* Republican win a risk to health care reform ?
* Democrats may still try to push through legislation
NEW YORK , Jan 15 ( Reuters ) - Healthcare stocks could rise next week if Republicans pull off a shock victory in Tuesday ’s Massachusetts Senate election that endangers U.S. healthcare reform , analysts and investors said on Friday .
A victory by State Senator Scott Brown may bode well for the shares of healthcare companies , including health insurers , which have been under siege by an overwhelmingly Democratic U.S. government .
But the market impact of such an outcome could be muted by expectations Democrats will attempt to push through the reform legislation quickly .
Some polls in heavily Democratic Massachusetts say the race between Democrat State Attorney General Martha Coakley and Brown , her Republican opponent , is too close to call .

A victory by Brown could leave the Democrats short of the margin needed to pass reform legislation .
“ If you even just put the concept of healthcare reform into question , everything we ’ve climbed the wall and worried about for this sector can get thrown out the window , ” said David Heupel , a portfolio manager with Thrivent Investment Management .
Heupel said medical technology companies , which face a tax under reform legislation , could receive the biggest boost .
Health insurer stocks , which have already had a strong run in recent weeks , could rise about 5 percent too , Heupel said .
Health insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc UNH.N and WellPoint Inc WLP.N face among the most substantial changes to their business if health reform passes .
Despite the recent rally in the stocks , Tim Nelson , a healthcare analyst with First American Funds , said health insurers stand to be the biggest gainers in a Republican victory .
If Brown wins , “ multiples could expand really across the board , ” Nelson said .
“ But that has be tempered by the magnitude of his victory and a lot of logistical issues that will then move to the forefront .
“ They ’ll all go up in anticipation this will mean the death of healthcare reform , but that ’s not guaranteed . ”
The healthcare overhaul that would extend insurance coverage to more than 30 million Americans is President Obama ’s top domestic priority .
It also will impose new regulations and taxes for many health industries .
Negotiators in the Senate and House of Representatives are working to reconcile their respective bills and closed in on a final deal on Friday .

Tuesday ’s special election in Massachusetts will fill the seat of the late Edward Kennedy , a political giant and staunch proponent of health reform , who died of brain cancer in August after holding the seat for 46 years .
Kim Monk , a healthcare analyst with Capital Alpha Partners in Washington , said that , while the election “ could have huge implications for health reform , ” Democrats are likely to try passing a bill before Brown could take office , stalling if necessary .
“ Timing is critical , ” Monk said in a research note , adding that the results could be a “ major game changer for health reform . ”
Ira Loss , an analyst with Washington Analysis , said the biggest challenge for Democrats if Brown wins will be getting the bill through Congress before he takes his seat .
“ People expect the stock market to move higher ( on a Republican victory ) , but I ’m not sure that ’s true , ” Loss said .
“ I do n’t think Brown ’s win would change the outcome of reform .
It ’s one person arriving late . ”

This amazing modern bar design in Lima , Peru features a number of unique and totally unconventional elements that really make it stand out .
El Tubo Bar created by Felipe Assadi and Franciesca Pulido and is located in Lima , Peru .
The bar is sited in the old and semi abandoned Puericultorio Perez aranibar building , which was dated 1820 , built to house an orphanage .
The space which had to be used for the construction of the bar was two rooms of the second level of one of the pavilions of the palace .
Rest of the building is part of the city of Lima cultural heritage .
These two programs live together within an independent and self - referring element .
A tube .
The tube was drilled on the middle part of one of its walls and the middle of its ceilling generating from these holes the single blue - violet light entrance to the space .
This highlights the idea that this elements floats inside the building .
Inside this tube , a long funky bar arranged the space making the concept looking like a single element .
The space near by the bar was arranged with five sculptures and huge frame pictures .
The furniture which is located in the ‘ hot tube ’ were created under the concept of a membrance that runs along its backing structure , consistent with the lightness idea .
All the furniture , dishes , everything in this bar was designed following a very abstract and neutral aesthetic .
The materials which have been used were steel , plaster board , lacquered mof and shining white epoxy paint .

Earlier : AOL 's long - promised Q1 layoffs began in small numbers today , and will pick - up steam throughout the week , we 've heard from the company , current and former employees .
We expect about 1,400 employees to lose their jobs .
The majority of notifications will go out Wednesday .
Employees in Europe and some in the US will find out today .
AOL says the layoff this " will not trigger the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ( WARN ) in any of our locations . "
But a spokesperson says the company will be " offering packages to impacted employees in the U.S. that will include severance , benefits and outplacement assistance , among other things . "
We 're just hoping AOL ( AOL ) cuts deep enough now so it wo n't have do this again .
Here 's a statement from AOL :
In November , we announced that the company would take a $ 200 million charge and that we planned to decrease the size of our global workforce by one - third .
Late last year , we offered Voluntary Separation Program to enable employees to decide what was in their best personal and professional interest .
We had approximately 1,100 employees opt to join the Voluntary program .
At that time we announced the Voluntary program we noted that if we did n’t reach our target reduction of a third we would need to follow the voluntary program with an involuntary action .
We did not reach that target .
The next phase of our restructuring plan will include an involuntary layoff .
Our process internationally varies by country and is subject to local laws .
We began meeting with employees throughout Europe today .
For example meetings have already taken place in the UK , Germany and France , and we announced plans to shut down many of our offices in Europe , beginning with those in Spain and Sweden .
In addition , we will be beginning the consultative process with the Workers ’ Councils in relevant countries this week .
In the United States , we will begin notifying a limited number of individuals impacted by the involuntary layoff today , with the majority of notifications taking place in the U.S. on Wednesday , January 13 .
As of this point , this layoff will not trigger the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ( WARN ) in any of our locations .
For many of the employees impacted in the U.S. , Wednesday will be their last day in the office .
Since April , we have been moving through a process that started with strategy , then focused on structure , and has most recently been centered on aligning our costs with the company ’s strategy and structure .
As a part of this process , we ’ve looked at every aspect of this business .
We evaluated our competitive position and product portfolio in every market – and we asked the hard questions about areas that were no longer core to the strategy and our profit profiles in the businesses and countries where we operate .
We will be offering packages to impacted employees in the U.S. that will include severance , benefits and outplacement assistance , among other things .
All of our cost alignment work is about ensuring AOL ’s sustainability and future success .
Project Everest is the completion of phase one of AOL ’s turnaround .
Geithner and Co. have taken a lot of heat for withholding information regarding AIG , its derivatives counterparties and how much the associated payouts were in regard to collateral calls .
No more .
Below is the infamous " Schedule A " document in all its un-redacted glory .
Needless to say , the numbers will blow your mind .

A Toronto woman in her late 30s is the most recent pedestrian victim in a string of deadly collisions that have killed 14 people this month in the GTA .
The accident occurred around 6:30 p.m. at the intersection of Davenport Rd. and Symington Ave. when a Dodge Durango hit the woman .
A police investigation concluded that the SUV was travelling north on Symington Ave. when it made a left turn onto Davenport , striking the woman .
Sgt. Tim Burrows said the victim was crossing slightly west of the crosswalk at the intersection .
" It 's difficult to determine who is at fault , " he said .
But he added the pedestrian was crossing in a way that was " not predictable and not the safest place to be " but was walking on a green light .
" I 'd rather just say that road safety is a shared responsibility and everyone has to do their part and abide by the laws and common sense . "
Burrows said the woman was carried on the hood of the vehicle before being vaulted off and run over .
He added that she was stuck under the SUV for some time .
" Despite the best efforts of emergency crews , she was pronounced dead on the scene , " Burrows said .
Her death marks the 14th pedestrian fatality in the GTA this month .
Maria Carvalho , 47 , who was walking nearby , heard the accident .
She heard a scream and looked back to see a woman lying on the ground .
The victim 's purse was tossed some distance away .
" I saw a lady lying on the ground and went back to see if I knew her , but I did n't , " she said .
Carvalho said she was very shaken by the accident and that her daughter learned on the Internet that the victim had died .
Young Kuk Kim , the owner of a convenience store at the corner , said that someone came into his store and told him to call police .
A customer made the call on a cellphone .
Police at the scene were interviewing a number of people including the female driver of the Durango .
The driver 's father rushed to the intersection as soon as he learned she had been in an accident .
He told the Star that his son called him to say that his daughter was involved .
As he spoke , his daughter , who was in a police cruiser , rolled down the window and asked him not to speak to reporters .
The intersection remained closed for several hours as investigators looked for clues to understand why another pedestrian was killed on city streets .
The 13th pedestrian fatality occurred earlier Monday when a 35 - year - old Woodbridge man who walked into the path of a streetcar on Queen St. E. died in hospital from his injuries .

Police suspect the man may have been distracted on his cellphone when the accident happened early Sunday .
" We do n't want people to be paranoid ( about being hit by a car ) , but we want them to be aware , " Burrows said .
" If this series of accidents does n't make people aware of their vulnerability and how dangerous it can be if they are not paying attention , I do n't know what else will . "
Last year , there were 31 pedestrian fatalities in the city of Toronto .
With the two deaths on Monday , the 2010 Toronto count rises to eight , which represents 25 per cent of last year 's total .
There have been no charges laid in either collision .

Opposition to smoking has been around almost as long as smoking itself , and some of the historical measures to curb lighting up might surprise you .
1. The Pope Cracks Down on Smoke
Getty Images
Pope Urban VII 's papacy began on September 15 , 1590 .
It ended with his death from malaria less than two weeks later .
Although he did n't spend much time as the head of the Catholic Church , Urban VII was around long enough to make his feelings on tobacco known .
He banned all tobacco " in the porchway of or inside a church , whether it be by chewing it , smoking it with a pipe or sniffing it in powdered form through the nose . " 
The penalty for breaking his edict ?
Excommunication .
Urban VII 's crackdown is considered to be history 's first public smoking ban .
Various papal bans on smoking stuck around until 1724 , when tobacco - loving Pope Benedict XIII gave Catholics the thumbs - up to light up again .
2. King James ' Ideal Version of England is Smoke - Free
Getty Images
King James
I of England was no fan of tobacco , but instead of whining about it , he picked up his pen .
In 1604 , James wrote the treatise A Counterblaste to Tobacco , and he did n't pull any punches , writing , " What honour or policie can move us to imitate the barbarous and beastly maners of the wilde , godlesse , and slavish Indians , especially in so vile and stinking a custom ? " 
Ouch .
Racism aside , James also warned of potential dangers from second - hand smoke and lung damage in addition to making a much simpler argument against tobacco smoke :
It stinks .
Later , he refers to smoking as " a custome lothsome to the eye , hatefull to the Nose , harmefull to the braine , dangerous to the Lungs , and in the black and stinking fume thereof , neerest resembling the horrible Stigian smoke of the pit that is bottomlesse . " 
For someone with such strong feelings about smoke , James I amazingly did n't ban tobacco altogether , though .
He did , however , jack up excise taxes and tariffs on the weed by upwards of 4,000 % .
Interestingly , early 20th century tobacconist and writer Alfred Dunhill speculated in The Pipe Book that James ' hatred of tobacco may have stemmed from how much the monarch loathed Sir Walter Raleigh , who was often seen smoking a pipe and actually turned Queen Elizabeth I on to smoking in 1600 .
3. The Sultan Puts Out Smokers

When Sultan Murad IV took over the Ottoman Empire in 1623 , he inherited a land filled with corruption and decadence .
He took care of it quickly , though , and by 1633 Murad had banned all tobacco , alcohol , and coffee from his empire .
Murad IV made Pope Urban VII look like a pushover -- his punishment for breaking the ban was death .
Murad IV did n't leave enforcement to his minions , either .
He supposedly walked the streets of Istanbul in plain clothes and used his mace to execute anyone he caught using tobacco .
As many as 18 people a day met their demise for smoking until Murad 's successor , Ibrahim the Mad , lifted the ban .
At around the same time , Russia instituted a similar ban .
First - time offenders would get a slit nose , take a beating , or be exiled in Siberia .
Repeat offenders earned themselves an execution .
These stiff penalties hung around until Peter the Great came to power in 1682 .
4. French Smokers Head to the Doctor for Their Smokes

French tobacco enthusiasts found themselves on the receiving end of a bit of a curveball in 1635 .
They could still smoke , but they would have to buy their tobacco from an apothecary .
They would also need a doctor 's prescription .
Luckily for smokers , this restriction did n't last too long .
In 1637 , King Louis XIII , a snuff fan , repealed all of the anti-tobacco laws .
5. Colonists Turn on Their Cash Crop

Early American colonists made some nice loot selling tobacco , but that does n't mean they were totally in favor of using it .
In 1632 , Massachusetts became wary of the fire danger from smoldering butts , so it banned outdoor smoking .
Connecticut followed suit in 1647 when it dictated that citizens could only smoke once a day .
Even then , one could n't be a social smoker , since the law dictated that smokers could only burn one when " not in company with any other . " 
In the 1680s , Philadelphia joined in with a ban on smoking in the city 's streets .
6. States Butt Out of the Tobacco Business
i Stock
Movies may depict the turn of the 20th century as a time of smoke - filled rooms , but in truth you could n't even pick up a pack of cigarettes in many states .
By 1900 , Washington , Iowa , Tennessee , and North Dakota had all banned the sale of cigarettes , and by 1920 11 other states had enacted similar bans .
Some states were quick to ban cigarettes over concerns that customers might be getting more than they bargained for when they bought a pack .
When a Tennessean challenged his state 's cigarette ban before the Supreme Court in 1900 , the justices upheld the prohibition partially due to concern over adulterated smokes , writing , " [ T ] here are many whose tobacco has been mixed with opium or some other drug , and whose wrapper has been saturated in a solution of arsenic . " 
Did these bans put an end to American smoking ?
Not quite .
Although buying cigarettes was n't legal in 15 states , the cigar business was booming .
In 1901 , four out of every five American men burned at least one stogie a day , and tobacconists sold 6 billion cigars a year .
Like the prohibition of alcohol , these cigarette bans gradually fell out of favor , and after Kansas repealed its restrictions in 1927 cigarettes were once again legal in all states .
7. Hitler Takes on Tobacconists
i Stock
One thing you might not know about Hitler :
He was a rabid opponent of smoking .
German scientists were among the first to study the links between tobacco use and lung disease , and the Nazis aggressively sought to suppress tobacco use .
In addition to implementing high tobacco taxes , Hitler banned smoking in German universities , government buildings , and Nazi party offices .
After 1942 , restaurants were n't allowed to sell smokes to female customers .
But when the Nazis fell , their bans fell with them .
After the party 's 1945 collapse , cigarettes actually became an unofficial currency in Germany 's war - ravaged economy .
This story originally ran in January 2010 .
After its initial purchase in 2006 , Irrational Games had its name changed to 2 K Boston to coincide with the launch of a little game called Bioshock .
A little over two years later , and the studio has returned to its roots , reverting back to its original moniker .
According to Gameinformer , the company shifted in order to better tie back into its catalog of great IP like System Shock 2 and Freedom Force .
Creative Director and President of the company , Ken Levine , spoke on the name re-change in his recent Joystiq interview .
“ I think the name change is about community .
I think the change in name , I think a lot of people here wanted to go back to the original name .
I think the press , I ’m not trying to be presumptuous here , but a lot of people would write about us as Irrational Games or ‘ formerly known as Irrational Games , ’ and we definitely got that from the fans as well .
So , we kinda looked at ourselves and said , ‘ Maybe we should go back to the old name ? ’
To Take - Two ’s credit , they said ‘ OK . ’
So we wanted to make sure we had a forum to connect with everybody and given this is the year we ’re going to start talking about our next product .
It ’s very important we have that connection . ”
Q : What was the impetus to make this film ?
A : I was frustrated with the childish , schoolyard mentality that permeates this world .
It really pushed me to look at what this entity that goes by the name of God means to people .
Here we are in the 21st century , in a technologically advanced time , and you have grown men flying airplanes into buildings , shouting “ God is Great . ”
You have a leader of the free world saying he invaded Iraq because God told him to .
You have young men and women blowing themselves up to buy themselves a place in heaven .
I decided to go around the world so that perhaps we might learn something from it .
Q : Why was your main question , “ What is God ? ”
A : I decided to ask “ What is God ? ” rather than “ Who is God ? ” so I could be a little more objective .
It takes out the idea of God being an image of man .
It 's like looking at it from the outside in , rather than the inside out .
When you ask the question “ Hello , what is God ? ” people kind of step back .
The result is something very spontaneous .
Q : What role did your own spirituality have in the making of the film ?
A : I am a spiritual person , and I do believe in the essence of power that binds everybody together .
I was a little bit wary of religion because of its politicized nature that sometimes causes conflict around the world , as well as very good things .
It was literally a searching thing for me .
Q : Why did n't you interview “ big ” religious leaders like the pope or Dalai Lama ?
A : Because they are professional God people .
They , of course , will tout their party line , and we 've heard that before .
I wanted to hear about what people felt about God on the streets , from all walks of life .
Celebrities are n't paid for and do n't live their life working day by day for a religion .
I wanted to see , in a natural sort of way , what people felt on a social basis , not a political basis .
Q : What do you hope viewers will take away from the film ?
A : To be more tolerant of other people who have different beliefs and to understand that we are much more united on this planet than we are divided .
We 're in this together :
Most of us have two eyes , two arms and two legs and we 're very similar .
Let 's celebrate the things that unite us and not be angry with those who do n't think the same way we do .

Political success , as reflected in the recent gubernatorial races appears ever - more staked on the state of the economy .
Official unemployment recently measured 10 percent , though the more - honest gauge ( U - 6 ) shows the nation running unemployment at a Depression - like 17.2 percent .
In response to high unemployment numbers , Barack Obama has said , " I will not rest until all Americans who want to work can . "
Yet Mr. Obama 's policies belie his words .
In fact , what his administration is doing will ensure massive unemployment and endless economic stagnation .
To understand why I make such a sweeping assertion , it is necessary to comprehend how our economy ended up in this predicament in the first place .
For this , I must give a cursory explanation of the Austrian theory of the business cycle .
The interest rate is a price signal , no different from the price tag on any good .
In a free market ( which the United States most certainly does not have ) , the interest rate is determined by the supply of and demand for capital .
Individuals choose to consume or invest , and this dictates the amount of loanable funds , which businesses will use to undertake projects to bring goods to market for future consumption .
However , when a central bank like the Federal Reserve prints money , artificially lowering the interest rate and expanding the loanable pool of funds , producers are left with a false price signal .
The interest rate will tell producers that consumers want them to undertake long - term projects to bring goods to market .
This artificially lowered rate will also induce consumers to save less and spend and borrow more .
The conflicting actions of consumers and producers in response to the government - distorted price signal of the interest rate cause the mass misallocation of resources .
This leads to the bust manifested , for example , in the empty houses and office buildings throughout the country .
Logically , one might think that the best way to fix this mess would be to liquidate the malinvestments of businesses , pay down our debts and start fresh ; in other words , allow for the market to correct the imbalances and distortions created during the artificial boom .
But the enlightened Barack Obama and his team of trusty economic advisers , along with the ever - compliant Messrs Bernanke and Geithner , have other ideas .
Practically every single policy they have enacted is intended to stop the market from clearing out the wastes and excesses of the boom .
The government has undertaken programs to keep people in homes and cars that they cannot afford , fictitiously propping up GDP numbers .
It has bailed out failing enterprises ; abrogated contractual obligations ; created make - work , politically oriented , and naturally often fraudulent and wasteful public - works projects ; and increased the money supply at an unprecedented rate , easing the Federal Reserve–controlled interest rate to a ridiculous 0 percent .
Our representatives have done all of this while vastly expanding a national debt that was already egregious .
" The interest rate is a price signal , no different from the price tag on any good . "
All of these policies prevent any sort of recovery .
They are designed to stop markets from reflecting reality , and to continue the distortions already created by government tinkering .
History seems to be repeating itself , with Obama following Hoover and FDR 's favorite anti-Depression prescriptions .
There are major costs to these programs .
Government has ( and continues to ) prolong the downturn by effectively jamming the gears of the markets .
It has also created a major moral hazard by bailing out failed companies , hurting those successful companies who have been forced to subsidize the failed ones , and preventing entrepreneurs from putting the assets ( now being tied up in unprofitable businesses ) to better use .
This forced subsidization of failed enterprises has been perhaps most notorious in the mortgage - lending market , where banks , not individuals in many cases , have had to take responsibility for underwater mortgages , absolving debtors from discipline , and discouraging banks from extending mortgages in the future .
The government has also completely misled businesses and their investors by running roughshod over contracts in the cases of the AIG bonuses and the GM - creditor boondoggle .
Government has extended largess to purportedly " save or create 600,000 jobs , " a figure that I say is purported because we know it is downright fallacious .
As Frederic Bastiat told us , the good economist examines not only what is seen , but also the unseen .
This arbitrary number of 600,000 hides the fact that government make - work projects and supports for unsound ventures stop new and more profitable industries from springing up , because of the diversion of land , labor , and capital into projects that would otherwise not exist .
This diversion prevents new job opportunities from being created , and also prevents workers from learning new skills to become viable employees in new and profitable businesses .
At best , if there was no politicization , corruption , or waste , and the government was able to build things both solid and aesthetically pleasing , the government could merely divert resources .
However , it would still not be meeting any consumer demand ( like a private enterprise would ) because government lacks the price mechanism of the market , which would show profits or losses .
Government responds to the demands of political interests .
Put more succinctly , we do n't know how many jobs have been lost because of the ones that have theoretically been saved or created .
The resources used to save or create these jobs ( and for all of the other bailouts and programs enacted by the government ) have to come from somewhere , and they do : from bilking the taxpayer and future generations of taxpayers .
In addition , low interest rates have not only kept alive banks that would have failed , but allowed them to generate profits on the taxpayers ' dime by borrowing money from the government at 0 percent and either lending it back to the Federal Reserve or pumping it into the financial markets , where we see the results of continued monetary inflation in the increase in stock , bond , and commodity prices .
" We do n't know how many jobs have been lost because of the ones that have theoretically been saved or created . "
The banks have no incentive whatsoever to gamble their free money by lending it to risky borrowers like the overleveraged American people .
What this represents is a massive wealth transfer from the public to the financiers , who prop up the government itself by underwriting and making markets in its debt .
Most important of all , in keeping interest rates artificially low , the government continues its distortion of the price - signaling mechanism , which caused the whole crisis in the first place .
There are also major costs due to the debt that the government issues to finance their intervention .
First , an increase in the national debt represents a levering up of the public balance sheet , counteracting the positive effects of the necessary delevering of the balance sheets of businesses and households .
Second , the massive increase in our debt undermines the creditworthiness of the country , which will ultimately lead to an increase in interest rates as people lose faith in our government and in the ability of our economy to pay down the debts .
The only way for the government to service these debts ( since they can not do it honestly by direct taxation ) is through the indirect tax of inflation .
And again , inflation will continue the price - signal distortion .
So , just to review , the government is creating wasteful public - works projects , preventing markets from adjusting , preventing businesses from going belly - up and their assets from being put to better uses by more competent businesspeople , and all the while debauching the dollar and ruining the nation 's creditworthiness .
There is a final point that must be made .
Just as during FDR 's presidency , market entrepreneurs ( as opposed to the political ones , who profit from government swindling ) are now genuinely afraid of this administration .
People in business do not know how arbitrary or onerous future government regulations will be .
As the government runs from one whimsical plan to another , all that market participants can be sure of is that there will be more regulation and intervention , and that the people will be soaked by taxes either direct or indirect .
Since businesses are unsure of the economic environment , but rightfully anticipating ( though , in my opinion , underestimating ) an increase in outright socialism , this uncertainty will surely quell economic growth .
Thus , we see that Obama 's policies are not only misguided but also incredibly destructive .
If instead of letting the economy liquidate , painful as it may be , we try to continue the illusory boom , we will be doomed to years of unemployment , stagnation , and ultimately the " crack - up boom " of the economy .
And this is n't even to mention the threats posed to our economy by national healthcare , cap - and - tax , and , even scarier , Mr. Obama 's foreign policy .
Each and every one of these policies retards the necessary adjustment , depriving businesses of valuable assets that can be put to more profitable lines of work and depriving consumers of the products they seek at true fair - market value .
The only way to create jobs and fix a broken economic model is to release the entrepreneurial forces of America .
Unfortunately , it appears that President Obama does not care for this solution , preferring to ensure a prolonged depression to serve his political ends .

Famed New Atheist Richard Dawkins has opened up a " religion - free " way of helping the victims of the deadly earthquake in Haiti .
Dawkins has joined 13 other groups to create the Non-Believers Giving Aid .
Donors are told that when they give they are " helping to counter the scandalous myth that only the religious care about their fellow - humans . "
" [ W ]e do not hide behind the notion that earthly suffering will be rewarded in a heavenly paradise , nor do we expect a heavenly reward for our generosity : the understanding that this is the only life any of us have makes the need to alleviate suffering even more urgent , " the atheist and freethought groups say .
The Non-Believers Giving
Aid was set up in response to the devastation from Tuesday 's 7.0 - magnitude quake that left more than three million people in need of aid .
Current estimates place the death toll between 50,000 to 100,000 people .
The atheists ' appeal comes amid an increasing number of ad campaigns , books and debates touting morality or goodness without God .
The New Atheists , who are more outspoken than previous humanists and non-theists and endeavor to make belief in God socially unacceptable , have widely put out writings and oral arguments making the case that one can live a good moral life and know right from wrong without God .
Creating a fund for Haiti victims is just one several ways they are demonstrating their point .
" Non-Believers Giving Aid is not a church ( that ’s putting it mildly ) but it does provide an easy conduit for the non-religious to help those in desperate need , whilst simultaneously giving the lie to the canard that you need God to be good , " the groups behind the fund maintain .
Though adamant in their argument , New Atheists have provided no objective foundation for their belief , says Chad Meister , director of philosophy at Bethel College and contributor to God is Great , God is Good : Why Believing in God is Reasonable and Responsible .
" No one is arguing that atheists cannot utter ethical statements or live good , moral lives .
Of course they can , " Meister writes in God is Great .
" Believing that something is right or wrong and justifying one 's belief that something is right or wrong are two very different matters . "
He argues that the New Atheists confuse an epistemic ( knowledge ) issue with an ontological ( foundational existence ) one , or in other words , they believe in morality without justifying morality .
Dawkins , author of The God Delusion , has argued that moral action is rooted in biological evolution .
" On Dawkins 's schema , one is kind to his neighbor because he 's been preprogrammed by his genes to do so ( at least some individuals have been so preprogrammed ; others perhaps not ) , and he 's been so programmed because acting this way confers evolutionary advantage , " Meister summarizes .
" It 's not that it is a universally binding moral value to be kind .
We simply call it ' morally good ' because our genes have , through eons of evolutionary struggle , gotten us to believe that it is so . "
Meister goes on to note that he has several friends who adopted children and he does n't suspect they would agree with Dawkins 's explanation for why they did so .
" In order to have a consistent and reasonable objective moral stand – a moral view in which you can substantiate a claim that this is right and that is wrong , this is good and that is evil – you need to have an objective moral basis , " Meister argues .
" I do n't see how one can have an objective lawgiver with anything other than a transcendent God .
Surely from the physical perturbations of the big bang , moral values did n't spew forth .
" And indeed nothing in biological evolution ... is capable of providing the foundation necessary to ground unconditionally binding moral values " such as compassion , dignity and respect .
The Non-Believers Giving Aid participants include Atheist Alliance International , Atheists Helping the Homeless , Atheists United , The British Humanist Association , and The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science , among others .
Dawkins has vowed to cover up to $ 10,000 in PayPal fees so that 100 percent of donations could reach Haitians in need .
The groups have chosen to direct donations to two aid organizations " that do not have religious affiliations " – Doctors Without Borders and International Red Cross .
awesome work , man ... i just saw the beginning of the RIDE QL , and i immediately started laughing at the way Brad walks out of the shot .. but there are truly some funny ass moments on this list ...

If you have photos from the ride you are encouraged to add them to the Facebook event page .
There 's already over 200 photos up .
An estimated 2500 cyclists along with friends and family of Le Canne attended the memorial ride this morning .
Never in my life have I seen so many people on bicycles , unfortunately it was under these circumstances .
Most attendees claim it was the largest turnout of cyclists at any S. Florida event thus far .
The ride was safe and went without incident .
Thanks to everyone who came out and showed support .

Ride in the news : CBS4 ( video )
In the last year and a half , a broad alliance of high - tech companies and Hollywood studios has been trying to address this problem through an organization called the Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem , or DECE .
Five of the six major Hollywood studios ( Warner Brothers , NBC Universal , Sony , Paramount and Fox , but not Walt Disney ) are involved , with Microsoft , Cisco Systems , Comcast , Intel and Best Buy .
The group is setting out to create a common digital standard that would let consumers buy or rent a digital video once and then play it on any device .
It might sound technical , but it could be crucial to persuading consumers to buy all the splashy new Internet - connected gear that tech companies will demonstrate at C.E.S. , like HDTVs and set - top boxes that can download TV shows and films .
Under the proposed system , proof of digital purchases would be stored online in a so - called rights locker , and consumers would be permitted to play the movies they bought or rented on any DECE - compatible device .
So , for example , business travelers might find that their hotel room television could tap into their personal movie collections .
Consumers could buy Blu-ray discs and have digital copies of those films accessible from all of their devices , even their mobile phones .
And a PC maker could customize a new laptop for buyers by loading it with all their movies and shows  and eventually even their video games and e-books .
These advances may not be all that far off .
On Monday , the digital content organization plans to announce several moves that signal it is ready for companies to start building devices and services with the technology this year .
Industry observers expected such an announcement last year .
A confession – it's been stalking me for years now , this crawling ­disdain for fashion ; the certainty that it is not an ally but an enemy .
The older I am , the more disenchanted I am with what is meant to make us beautiful .
Now , at 36 , I believe it is one of the ultimate evils in the universe , along with yoghurt .
It should have its own Death Star .
Put simply , I hate fashion .
I scowl at Harper's .
I snarl at W. I spit at Vogue .
Sometimes , I tear them up , these glossy pages full of anorexic ­children – part human , part makeup , part ­computer program – just because I 'm worth it .
Then I put a colander on my head .
You may say that I am bitter .
How is my sex life , you ask ?
Do men flee my fashion - free person ?
What is my weight ?
What has happened to make me reject the things we women are supposed to hug – wedges , fringes , shifts , tassels , linings , bows ?
And do n't forget shoes !
Surely I love shoes , the icons that Carrie Bradshaw worshipped instead of a god ?
No ?
I must be ill .
Weep for me in my giant knickers .
I am outcast .
Not at all .
I am a reasonable ­example of a normal woman .
I like food and men and comfort .
It is just that at some point , the unceasing prattle of fashion has become a scream in my head .
I ­cannot ignore its idiocies any more .
I walk past a shop that sells 6in heels and I am angry .
Banana ­Republic ?
­ Angry again .
Selfridges and its ­loathsome " I shop therefore I am " adverts , a manifesto for morons ?
Do n't even go there .
I have had it with this tyrant - fool throwing darts from every billboard and magazine and TV screen .
I want to hurl a spear back at it .
I decided to write this piece late last year , when I read that a 16 - year - old girl wearing high - heeled shoes had fallen between the carriages of a train in West Sussex .
She died , of course .
It was snowing that night , but still this young woman , with a lifetime of fashion choices before her , ran along that platform and is now dead .
And I could n't help suspecting that had she been wearing a shoe designed for movement , rather than to push her breasts out and her pelvis forward , she would be alive .
Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City ' worshipped shoes instead of a god ' .

This was different from the usual Fashion Death , where a model has a heart attack on the catwalk , because she lives on grapes .
This was an ­ordinary girl – a bystander .
And why was she wearing high - heeled shoes on an icy night ?
Because fashion , the whispering monster , told her to .
I thought about that young woman for days ; I could n't forget her .
Why ?
Because I realised that although I did not fall under a train , like Anna Karenina with a shoe instead of ­Vronsky , fashion has bullied me for ever .
It has followed me around like an eternal schoolyard taunt , throwing self - doubt and rubbish into my path .
If you are a young woman , it is the ordinary soundtrack to your life .
It is never enough to wear a clean dress and comfortable shoes and be done – fashion is a Jewish mother on crack .
This will make you beautiful !
This will make men want you !
Wear this !
Wear that !
Ca n't you ignore it , you may ask ?
Ca n't you squeeze yourself into a ­library and have an inner life instead ?
Ha !
Anyone who thinks that has never been a young woman staring into the window of Topshop .
Sophisticated weapons are employed to make us need the rubbish .
And so we do .
I discovered fashion when I was 13 .
Before that I dressed as Andy Pandy and was very happy .
No one sticks Andy Pandy in 6in heels to emphasise the sexual ­organs he does n't have .
I ­remember those Saturday ­morning shopping trips very well .
I can't ­remember ­exactly how I knew what I was ­supposed to be wearing .
You breathe it in , like air .
And so I dressed , like all schoolgirls in 1987 , in approximate homage to the cast of Neighbours .
How wonderful I looked , I imagined – jeans , black polo neck , boots and a pair of red Noddy braces that I wore inside my breasts .
( No one is infallible . )
How I enchanted .
How I belonged .
I thought I looked just like the effortlessly beautiful girls at school .
Except I did n't .
And , very soon , I realised that I did n't .
All that weekend job money and childish angst and still I looked like me .
That was the first seduction – and the first betrayal .
I did n't give in .
Who does ?
So I spent years buying junk – what else was money for ?
To make me secure ?
No .
How much more feminine to be ­insecure .
Run towards the ever - ­receding sense of self - acceptance and the promise of love ; perhaps this ­collection will fix you !
Or this one !
And if it does n't , there will be two more next year , like a bad clock .
And always , because designers produce just one tiny dress for all the ­advertising campaigns and magazine editorials , ­because improbable slimness is a ­mirage most women can only weep ( and shop ) for , came the continual , wicked message – too fat .
But the seduction continued .
I worked for a tabloid newspaper for a few years and I earned a lot of money .
I used to wander around Harvey ­Nichols , particularly on weekdays when I was at a loss for anything to do – up and down , up and down , an insect with broken antennae .
The first thing I noticed was how ­miserable all the shoppers looked , pale and shrivelled , as if they had been unplugged from something and were desperately trying to plug themselves back in – to a shoe perhaps , or a strange piece of jewellery .
I do n't think I ever saw anyone laugh in Harvey Nichols .
White and windowless , it smelled only of anxiety .
I also noticed how easy it was to buy a dress , and a bag and then perhaps some stupid , unnatural shoes and feel a kind of brief , bright burst of self - acceptance , which always evaporated as soon as I was home .
It withered like a smouldering feather in an ashtray .
The goods lay unwrapped on my ­ordinary bed .
They looked odd there .
They did n't fit .
The marketing does n't ­follow you home .
When the stiff bag with the ribbon is thrown away , you are left with just an ugly piece of leather – and yourself .
Fashion can't , I now know , make even itself happy .
I met a 16 - year - old model once , in the offices of her agency .
I was supposed to ­interview her , but my newspaper thought her comments were too depressing , so did n't publish them .
The dream did n't fit her either .
The doll was broken .
She was a sweet , utterly ­ordinary girl with an astonishing face .
She ­exuded gloom .
She showed me a ­photograph of herself .
It had ­appeared on the cover of Vogue .
" I do n't think it looks like me at all , " she said .
She was right .
It did n't .
It was a non-existent woman .
She described how they had ­attached long strands of hair to her eyelashes for the photograph .
" It was really painful , " she said .
" They said ' Do n't blink ' .
But I need to blink . "
In another photograph , she had to wear a sort of white harness on her head .
" I could n't hear , " she said .
­Because her minder had disappeared , I asked her – do you like any of these ­pictures ?
" No , " she said .
Do you think you are beautiful ?
( Just a hunch . )
Again – " no " .
And then I knew – it is worse for them than it is for us .
I only have to compare ­myself with the ­nearest angry writer .
­Models compete with Aphrodite .
The oddest thing rescued me from fashion .
It was that I got fat .
Never mind why ; that is a story for another page .
But I got so fat that even fashion would n't pretend it could fix me .
You can get so fat they do n't actually want you in their clothes .
It is bad marketing ; if very fat people wear their clothes , thinner ­people wo n't buy them .
There was no point rattling through the rails any more , seeking a satin redemption – nothing would fit my unfashionable bulk .
I was ­consigned to M&S smock - land , across the River Styx .
And it is lovely here ; no heels , no stupid dresses - of - the - moment , certainly no thongs .
Fashion has died for me , with an angry little hiss .
Ah , peace .
I can look at the clothes on the catwalk now and laugh at their imbecility .
They are not for me .
I still think about that young woman on the train tracks , though .
What did she pay for her shoes ?
• Do you think that fashion is oppressive to women – and men – or should we celebrate it as a source of fun and self - expression ?
Some consideration was given to having it declared invalid on the grounds that it was unconstitutional as well as a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights , but in the end the government agreed to allow the referendum to go forward , probably in the hope that it would be roundly defeated and thereby become a symbol of Swiss open - mindedness .
So certain were the politicians of prevailing that hardly any publicity was fielded against the initiative .
As a result , the streets were dominated by the proponents ’ posters , which showed a veiled woman in front of a forest of minarets that looked like missiles .
Minarets have never been a problem in Switzerland .
There are four in the entire country , some of which have been standing for decades .
( One of them is in my city but I ’ve never seen it . )
And only two other minarets were being planned .
Most mosques are in faceless industrial districts where no one notices them .
But perhaps that is exactly the problem .
Islamic immigrants do n’t live with us but beside us , just as French , German , Italian and Romansch - speaking Swiss live alongside each other without a great deal of animosity  or interaction .
The average Swiss citizen has no real contact with Islam .
Headscarves are seldom seen on the street , and chadors are practically nonexistent .
Moreover , when young proponents of the ban talk about problems with Muslims , they almost exclusively mean young men from the Balkans , who come across as male chauvinists but are almost never active members of Muslim communities .
Most people encounter Islam only through the news media , which do n’t report on the Muslims in our country but focus on terrorist attacks in Afghanistan , Iranian plans for an atomic bomb and Muammar el - Qaddafi ’s absurd proposal to abolish Switzerland .
It ’s hard to find one overarching explanation for why the Swiss voted as they did .
Similar referendums have brought surprises : 35 percent of voters wanting to do away with the army , for instance , or 58 percent approving of same - sex partnerships .
The prevailing Swiss attitude is both conservative and liberal : on the one hand everything should stay the way it is , on the other everyone should be able to do what he or she wants .
What ’s most conspicuous in these referendums is that we are a nation of pragmatists , inclined to our dour obstinacy , and we owe our success not to grand ideas but to problem - solving .
So focused are we on getting things done , it almost does n’t matter if the problem is n’t a problem , or if the solution risks sullying the country ’s reputation .
We Swiss sacrificed our good standing as a multicultural and open - minded society to ban the construction of minarets that no one intends to build in order to defend ourselves against an Islam that has never existed in Switzerland .
US consumers keeps on purchasing Kindles on credit cards which they apparently have no intention of every paying off .
The most recent Fitch report disclosed that October delinquencies have continued their steady climb , and together with charge - offs , are at near record highs : " Consumer credit quality remains under significant strain as a result of the persistent weakness in the labor markets , " noted managing director Michael Dean .
The Labor Department will report unemployment data Friday ; the jobless rate is expected to hold steady at 10.2 % , the highest level in decades , while the decline in payrolls is seen mitigating from the previous month .
Dow Jones reports :
All types of consumer lending have worsened the past several years , with borrowers falling increasingly behind and lenders writing off many billions of dollars of owed loans .
Fitch 's credit - card performance indexes show late payments rising to their highest levels in five months and indicate higher charge - offs in the months to come .
Fitch 's index on delinquencies of at least 60 days rose to 4.41 % from 4.22 % in September .
Late - stage delinquencies are now 31 % higher than year - earlier levels and just below the record high of 4.45 % in June .
Delinquencies of at least 30 days rose as well .
As Zero Hedge pointed out , and as Meredith Whitney has voiced her concernes about , the biggest threat to the economic going into 2010 may be that not only are banks dropping reducing overall credit availability , but that ongoing credit contraction to the tune of almost $ 2 trillion over the next several years will mean existing credit limits are tapped out as existing ones become increasingly maxed out .
This will likely further entrench the consumer into an accelerated deleveraging mindset , and no matter what the incremental liquidity from the Fed is , the deflationary pressures will likely continue .
Which means that markets will continue in full melt - up mode to compensate for real economic losses , which benefit exlusively the top percentile of the US population as the middle and lower classes continue experiencing the brunt of the credit contraction .
At some point the economic reality is sure to catch up with the market surreality .
That will be the point when all the flawed market policies by the Administration and Bernanke become exposed for the clothesless emperors they are .
Below the fold are a few questions that come to mind .
I am sure that if you are using solar PV , you may have answers to questions I have n't even thought of .
I am sure there are at least a few readers who have solar PV installed , and others who are considering installing solar PV .
Someone sent me an e-mail , asking if we could do a Campfire discussion of practical advice regarding solar PV , based on the experiences of readers who have tried it .
Posted by Gail the Actuary on January 13 , 2010 - 7:10 pm in The Oil Drum : Campfire
1 . Is it best to work with someone who both sells and installs solar PV panels ?
Or is this something that people end up doing themselves , using a variety of vendors ?
2 . What brands / types are best ?
3 . How much maintenance is required ?
4 . What experiences have people had who purchased solar PV , then moved to another home ?
Did the addition of solar PV help the resale value ?
5 . What have buyers experience with battery back - up been ?
Is a small amount worthwhile , even if a homeowner is on the grid ?
6 . Are there any particular issues with inverters that readers should be aware of ?
7 . If you have purchased solar PV , are you generally happy with it ?
8 . Where does one find good material to read regarding solar PV ?

Buoyed by the success of the Hubble Space Telescope , one of the key proposals on NASA ’s internal interpretation of the Augustine Commission ’s “ Flexible Path ” option includes a 45 day manned mission to construct a giant telescope in Geostationary orbit ( GEO ) .
A huge deep space telescope is also included in the roadmap , which would focus on a major advancement for the search of Earth - like planets .
Flexible Path / Massive Ambition :
The recently produced 64 page presentation – available on L2 – is being classed as heavily over ambitious by NASA sources , though it provides a fascinating insight into what NASA could do with a supporting budget .
Classed as an internal effort to “ peel the onion ” of the Augustine Commission option of the “ flexible path ” approach – several NASA centers and associated bodies were involved in providing insights to various options that could be open to the Agency , dependant on decisions that will be made by President Obama early this year .
Those centers , Ames Research Center ( ARC ) , Glenn Space Flight Center ( GSFC ) , Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) , Johnson Space Center ( JSC ) and the Hubble - related Space Telescope Science Institute ( STScI ) all contributed towards the findings .
“ Ultimately the goal of this brief study is to arm NASA leadership with some specific , evocative examples of the type of missions that could be done – and how they might be ‘ connected ’ into a meaningful , practical program sequence – should NASA choose to pursue the Flexible Path strategy introduced by the Review of U.S. Human Spaceflight Plans Committee ( Augustine Committee ) , ” noted the presentation .
“ When the inevitable question comes , ‘ What exactly does the Flexible Path mean ? ’ these ideas may be useful . ”
Creating an advanced path for huge space telescopes :
The presentation covers several areas , from the need for a heavy lift launcher , to manned missions to Mars and its moons – and also Near Earth Objects ( NEOs ) , as the main elements ( more articles will follow ) .
However , a large section is also dedicated to the construction of large telescopes , with examples citing locations in LEO , GEO and in deep space .
Such an effort would involve a roadmap , which begins with large Hubble - type telescope in Low Earth Orbit ( LEO ) .
“ Stepwise progression advances both human space flight and telescope science , ” opens the section .
“ Human / robotic assembly and servicing of large telescopes in space leads to breakthrough science and significant preparation for other deep - space human missions in stepwise fashion , beginning at ISS .
“ LEO telescope assembly demonstrations would validate approaches for Modular Design , Human / Robotic Interaction , On - board Metrology , Autonomous Alignment / Control , and Contamination Control on a ‘ small ’ in - space telescope where the development environment timeline is relatively unconstrained , multiple EVAs , and subsystem alternatives can be exchanged .
The end product would be an operational LEO telescope with larger aperture than HST . ”
The GEO based telescope would become part of an approach that would also serve as a testbed for human space flight outside of LEO , including the first expedition outside of the geomagnetosphere ’s radiation shielding .
“ Next could be a GEO Earth Looking Observatory for applications such as Greenhouse Gas Monitoring , Attribution and Compliance ; Persistent Intelligence , Surveillance and Reconnaissance ; and other Earth Science , ” the presentation continued .
“ Construction and servicing in the GEO environment constitutes a first step for human space flight outside the geomagnetosphere ’s radiation shielding . ”
The final example involved with the roadmap is based around two Deep Space Telescope options , which would still involve human space flight .
“ Deep Space Observatories are the goal for large - telescope science .
A very large observatory at the Sun-Earth L2 point could capture breakthrough science in multiple areas : Earthlike Exoplanet Spectra , First Black Holes , VIS / IR Astrophysics , Life in the Galaxy , and Event Horizon Physics , ” added the presentation .
“ Such deep space observatories might best be assembled in the benign , relatively close region of Earth - Moon L1 , and then carried to their operational location at SE L2 by a robotic low - thrust ( ion propulsion ) stage .
“ Two options then open for subsequent human servicing , including system replenishment and instrument upgrades : the ion stage could return the observatory to EM L1 , or a human mission could be mounted directly to SE L2 .
The latter case would demonstrate the expanding deep space capability of humans and their flight systems , and also avoid the long science down - time of relocating the observatory with a low - thrust system . ”
Although such a roadmap is highly ambitious , the combination of advancements in science , and their dual purpose of pushing human space flight out of LEO , is something the participating centers deem to be viable based on the Flexible Path recommendations of the Augustine Commission .
“ Having multiple steps on the path provides planning choices including schedule acceleration , combining of steps , or offramps to other types of human missions .
For these reasons , and because of the unique benefits to large - aperture observational science attainable only with human space flight , we recognize these mission classes as viable for a Flexible Path strategy . ”
While the presentation is deemed to be NASA internal , parts of the proposals are clearly aimed at both the general public and politicians – as the point is driven home about how “ breakthrough science is enabled by constructing extremely large telescopes in space , ” with the aim of finding the answer to the ultimate question – “ are we alone ? ”
“ Astrophysics is a photon - limited science .
Many exciting investigations cannot be done with today ’s space observatories simply because the targets are extremely faint , fainter by at least an order of magnitude than even the dimmest sources ever detected with HST or Chandra .
Two of the most exciting questions that future space - based telescopes will address are “ When did the first stars form ? ” and “ Are We Alone ? ”
“ The former question can be answered by searching for the black holes that the first stars leave behind when they die .
These black holes would have formed when the universe was a mere 100 to 200 million years old ( just about 1 percent of its current age ! ) .
“ To detect these black holes would require an x-ray telescope 1000 x more sensitive than current facilities .
But perhaps the most fundamental question of all is : Are We Alone ?
Are there planets around other stars where life as we know it has taken root ?
“ To answer this question requires a large Optical / IR ( Infra Red ) telescope for several reasons , but the two most significant ones are : ( 1 ) Earth - like planets even just 30 light years away will be extremely faint so we need a large telescope to obtain their spectra – which is where the signatures of life will be found ; ( 2 ) if such planets are not common , we may need to search 100 or more stars before we find even a handful .
“ The number of star systems where one can hope to obtain such spectra of Earth - sized planets in their stars ’
Habitable Zone increases dramatically with the size of the telescope – as the telescope aperture doubles , the star sample increases by almost 8 times !
Space telescopes with this much collecting area can only be assembled in space . ”
Finding Black Holes – or the detectable remnants of the first Stars – would be increased from the current ability of finding 17 sources in one area of the sky , to a massive 3,000 sources via a large 50m2 X - Ray telescope in the same area .
Such an increase would be achieved via a 20 - 30 m
Vis / IR telescope , which would be capable of searching for the signature of life is encoded in Earth ’s spectrum , as the “ number of stars searchable for habitable worlds increases as the cube of telescope diameter . ”
Constructing telescopes in GEO :
A combined human and robotic mission is outlined in detail , based around the construction of GEO observatory – four times the size of Hubble – with the focus on a 45 day mission for a crew using Orion .
In the scenario outlined , the “ highly modular ” telescope would be launched in two parts on two Ares V type heavy launchers .
The crew would launch in Orion – with the example shown of an Orion docked to a habitable module that includes an airlock , robotic arm and a payload box , riding on a stretched Centaur Upper Stage – though the graphic is possibly for “ illustrative purposes ” only .
“ Example 1 - 2 month human mission : constructing Earth - looking GEO observatory .
Astronauts assisted by robotic devices could construct a large observatory in geosynchronous orbit to enable persistent Earth Observation with unprecedented resolution , ” notes the presentation .
“ For example , this might be a 10 - m class wide field telescope with scanning visible and IR cameras / spectrometers ( for comparison , HST has a 2.4 - m primary ) .
The telescope design would be highly modular for ease of EVA ( Spacewalk ) assembly .
“ The construction operations design would incorporate structured robotics to assist astronauts on repetitive and highgeometric - tolerance tasks .
Example applications include : full Earth - disk scan imaging ; high resolution Earth atmosphere spectroscopy ; sourcelocalizing greenhouse gas monitoring , attribution & compliance ; in - field agricultural monitoring ; and Intelligence , Surveillance and Reconnaissance ( ISR ) .
“ Feed - forward technology opportunities include : modular observatory instrumentation / bus interfaces ; contamination control ; large lightweight mirror segments ; on - board metrology and autonomous control ; image based wavefront sensing ; expandable sunshades ; extended - use crew habitat , air locks , EVA suits , and robotic toolsets . ”
The 45 day mission timeline shows the crew spending several days to travel to the worksite and prepare to complete the tasks in the following order : “ Day 6 : Unpack modules .
Day 13 : Assemble primary mirror .
Day 17 : Attach Secondary Mirror Tower .
Day 19 : Attach Metrology and Control Module .
Day 23 : Attach Instrument Module and S/C Bus. Day 25 : Attach Sunshade and Baffles .
Day 29 : Autonomous Alignment .
Day 31 : Science Instrument Installation .
Day 32 : First Light .
Day 35 : Checkout , ” before packing up and re-entry on Day 45 .
Such a mission would “ provide actionable information to support societal and critical national needs , ” and would utilize a crew of four to six astronauts , carrying out around 20 EVAs .
“ Astronauts assisted by robotic devices could construct a large observatory in geosynchronous orbit to enable persistent Earth Observation with unprecedented resolution .
For example , this might be a 10 - m class wide field telescope with scanning visible and IR cameras / spectrometers ( for comparison , HST has a 2.4 - m primary ) .
The telescope design would be highly modular for ease of EVA assembly , ” added the presentation .
“ Feed - forward technology opportunities include : modular observatory instrumentation / bus interfaces ; contamination control ; large lightweight mirror segments ; on - board metrology and autonomous control ; image based wavefront sensing ; expandable sunshades ; extended - use crew habitat , air locks , EVA suits , and robotic toolsets . ”
Also noted is the gain in public interest , who would be “ engaged ” throughout the 45 day mission .
“ A strawman construction flow for the GEO Earth - looking observatory would use 4 - 6 astronauts , performing ~ 20 EVAs , over a 45 - day period .
Crew and cargo would be launched to a location on the geosynchronous arc , where assembly of pre-assembled modules proceeds as indicated in the arrowed flow .
“ The mission duration estimate includes ample schedule margin , and recognizes that the particular modularity scheme , tools and human / robotic interfaces would be defined and validated in the ISS environment .
Prior analyses leading to this notional mission description are based on HST servicing experience , JWST and AMD development , and conceptual designs of modular observatory systems .
Checkout sensors and algorithms are at high TRL .
“ Virtually every stage of the mission would yield public engagement milestones , and as HST has proven , the end result would be an unprecedented science system that ‘ keeps on giving ’ long after the crew has departed . ”
Once again , the search for life on other planets is a key selling point of building large telescopes in space is again emphasized in the presentation .
“ The path to constructing extremely large telescope in space moves humans progressively farther from the Earth , for longer durations in harsher environments .
It involves a spectrum of progressively more complex capabilities from human EVA to locally controlled robotics , remotely controlled robotics , and autonomous robotics .
“ Evolving capabilities are utilized to produce outcomes which feed forward to enable larger , more capable space observatories as well as expansion of humans into the solar system for other endeavors .
Finally , it produces breakthrough science to answer fundamental questions of where we come from and whether we are alone . ”
Interestingly , the telescope section of the presentation ends by claiming the construction of a deep space telescope can also be classed as the first step of a Flexible Path approach to NASA ’s future .
“ Constructing extremely large telescopes in space can be a first step on a Flexible Path , as it expands human space flight beyond LEO , develops progressive human / robotic capabilities , establishes needed technology and operations legacy , and enables breakthrough science . ”
The required elements for the deep space telescope mission include the need for a heavy lift launch vehicle – though it is not stated if the requirement is for the much - touted 200mt launcher mentioned in other parts of the presentation .
Other capabilities listed include the hardware , such as tools and telescope elements , plus the robotic assist requirements and low thrust propulsion vehicles .
The presentation claims such a path would lead to a legacy , which includes deep space human operations , human / robotic interactions , modular assembly ( outside of LEO ) , breakthrough science and national security .
How much each proposed mission would cost is not outlined in any part of the presentation .

L/ Cpl Katrina Hodge has served in Iraq
A soldier who has served in Iraq has been officially crowned Miss England after the original winner relinquished the title last year to clear her name .
L/ Cpl Katrina Hodge , 22 , from Tunbridge Wells , Kent , was drafted in when Rachel Christie stepped down following her arrest over an alleged nightclub brawl .
L/ Cpl Hodge said she wants to use her title to promote the British Army and military charities .
She was presented with her crown at the Manor House Hotel in Guildford , Surrey .
The soldier said she hoped to join the war effort in Afghanistan when she steps down as Miss England in July .
She was first runner - up in the 2009 national contest but was promoted after Ms Christie , athlete Linford Christie 's niece , gave up her crown to clear her name following her arrest in Manchester in November .
L/ Cpl Hodge was given leave from her duties as a soldier in the British Army to represent England in the Miss World final in Johannesburg , South Africa , on 12 December .
The international title was won by Kaiane Aldorino , Miss Gibraltar .
Senator Franken ( D - MN ) : " Senator Thune had a chart up , he had a chart up and he said , uh , when your taxes 'll kick in and when your benefits will kick in .
So , I did n't hear the whole speech and I feel bad about that , not having heard his whole speech , and I went up to him , and I said ' I did n't hear your whole speech . " and went ' Oh , man , that 's too bad . '
" And , uh , but I said " Did you actually happen to mention any of the benefits that DO kick in right away ? ' and he said " Uh , no . "
" Which I think is , you know , again , we are entitled to our own opinions , we are NOT entitled to our own facts .
Benefits kick in right away , and if your gonna hold up a chart that says when the , taxes kick in and when benefits kick in you say eighteen hundred days , you better include the benefits that do kick in right away ! "
Senator Thune ( Blue Cross / Blue Shield - R ) : " Ask the Senator from Minnesota a question ? "
Senator Franken ( D - MN ) : " Absolutely . "
Senator Thune ( Blue Cross / Blue Shield - R ) : " Did the Senator , would the Senator from Minnesota , when I was pointing out on the chart , understand the point that I was making ?
That the TAXES increase start , TAX INCREASES start eighteen days from now and that the benefits , the SPENDING benefits under the bill . . . "
Senator Franken ( D - MN ) : " No , there 's , okay . . . "
Senator Thune ( Blue Cross / Blue Shield - R ) : " Which are the premium tax credits and the exchanges that are designed to provide the benefit that ;s delivered under this bill do n't start until 2014 .
Did the . . . "
Senator Franken ( D - MN ) : " Does the Senator understand that the spending benefits start right away ? "
Senator Thune ( Blue Cross / Blue Shield - R ) : " If the Senator missed the point I can get the cart out again . "
Senator Franken ( D - MN ) : " No , I asked you a question , Senator .
I yielded to you for a question , I am asking you a question . "
Senator Thune ( Blue Cross / Blue Shield - R ) : " Will the Senator from Ohio yield for a question ?
Will the Senator from Ohio yield for a question ? "
Senator Brown ( D - OH ) : " This is , we gave the other side 30 minutes . "
Senator Franken ( D - MN ) : " We have our time . "
Senator Brown ( D - OH ) : " If Senator Thune wants to sort of monopolize our thirty minutes . "
Senator Franken ( D - MN ) : " We have our time , and the Senator from South Dakota JUST SAID that when he gave his presentation , he was saying that NOTHING that we 're paying for starts until eighteen hundred days from now .
I have a WHOLE LIST of things that start . . . "
Gavel bangs , anonymous woman : " The Senator from Minnesota has the floor , he may engage in a colloquy .
He does not have to yield to any further questions . "
Senator Franken ( D - MN ) : " The patient protection and affordable care act will prohibit insurance from imposing life time limits on benefits starting day one , starting day one , Senator .
He does n't want to hear it .
He does n't want to hear it .
We are entitled to our own opinions , we are NOT entitled to our own facts .
The fact is , benefits kick in on day one and the large majority of benefits kick in on day one and we should n't be standing up here with charts that say the exact opposite . "
" Senator McCain ( Maverick - AZ ) a week ago said ' facts are stubborn things . '
Uh , small business tax credits will kick in immediately .
The Senator from South Dakota just said that nothing , no payments , nothing that cots any money will kick in right away .
That 's not true !
We are NOT entitled to our own facts , and I stand here day after day after day and hear my colleagues , my good friends from the other side say things that are not based on facts . "
a few minutes later . . .
Senator Franken ( D - MN ) : " We 're actually addressing that donut hole that was in the medicare part d bill , we 're closing it by half .
You know when it starts ?
Next year . "
Anonymous voice : " I thought Senator Thune said . . . "
Senator Franken ( D - MN ) : " Senator Thune DID say that none of the benefits started next year , but , I , he just , I guess , has n't read the bill .
I have so many constituents come to me and say " Read the bill , read the bill , read the bill . . . "
Senator Brown ( D - OH ) : " Will the Gentleman yield .
Perhaps , if you 're going to vote against it , you do n't need to read it , is that , is that the way they think about it ? "
Senator Franken ( D - MN ) : " I do find that many of my colleagues who I , I am very friendly with have not read the bill .
And , and , and are not very familiar with it .
And I think that if you are gonna get on your feet and debate and make assertions , you should really be familiar with the content of the bill .
That 's what I thought .
I 've only been here for a while , so maybe I am naive , but I think when you say that none of the benefit are gonna start next year YOU SHOULD BE RIGHT ! "
IN APPRECIATION
Remembering those who died in 2009
Farrah Fawcett 's death in June was eclipsed by that of Michael Jackson , who died hours later .
She was the style icon for generations of women , says Sasha Wilkins , fashion journalist .
The Jennifer Aniston of her day , Farrah Fawcett became the female icon of a generation .
To appreciate her influence on 1970s style , pick up any family photo album from around that time .
At least half the women inside will be wearing high - waisted denim flares , with a tight bra-less T - shirt crowned by " the Farrah " - a confection of sun-kissed , flicked , feathered and layered bouffant hair that looked natural , but owed its volume to a strafing of industrial quantities of hairspray .
The key to the appeal of her wholesome good looks was its unthreatening obtainability .
To men she was the girl next door , the apogee of natural , unaffected beauty .
To women she represented an achievable , relaxed image .
In an age where the celebrity stylist was yet to make its mark , Farrah was just herself
It 's difficult for children that came of age in the 1990s to understand the appeal of unadorned , unmanipulated beauty .
To them Charlie 's Angels does n't automatically mean Farrah and her cast mates , Jacqueline and Kate , but instead Cameron , Lucy and Drew .
Where we had Farrah and her hair , they had Demi and her plastic surgery .
But the 1970s was a very different time .
Until Farrah and her fellow Charlie 's Angels blazed on to British television screens , female British TV icons were terribly posh : Dame Diana Rigg , Joanna Lumley , Honor Blackman .
Fantasy figures , sure , but no everyday bloke honestly thought he would have stood a chance .
The Angels became the popular antidote to the previously prevailing stylish but unapproachable female .
No gadgets , just babes Charlie 's Angels first appeared in 1976 as a TV movie .
Farrah , along with Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith , played sassy private investigators for a detective agency run by Charles Townsend , a reclusive multi-millionaire whom the women had never met .
Townsend referred to his employees as angels , a term that would never have got past the PC police in the 21st Century .
The movie was so successful that a series was promptly commissioned , and TV history was made .
The three ' angels ' carried the show Given the nature of our multi-media , multichannel viewing experience nowadays , it 's easy to forget the vast impact of television in the 1970s .
A show like Charlie 's Angels dominated the television landscape and became the cultural reference for an entire decade .
It 's no wonder Farrah and her cast mates became international superstars - they WERE the show .
The Charlie 's Angels of the 1970s is a reflection of a less sophisticated time .
No technology , no CGI , no go - go - gadgets to distract the viewer from the pulchritudinous babes who carried the story .
Farrah , who concealed a sharp brain and quick wit behind the pouffed - up hair , told TV Guide in a 1977 interview : " When the show was number three , I thought it was our acting .
When we got to be number one , I decided it could only be because none of us wears a bra . "
The real key to Farrah 's resonance with men and with women was her styling .
In an age where the celebrity stylist was yet to make its mark , Farrah was just herself .
With her wide , ultra - white toothy grin , fluffy hair , jeans and sneakers she was the epitome of Californian wholesomeness .
The open - necked , rolled sleeved gingham shirts , waisted jumpsuits and silky slip dresses looked simple and uncontrived .
Fawcett married actor Lee Majors
The hair was a different matter .
Men may have been taken in by its artless bounce , but women knew better : the Farrah took time to achieve : " I 'd curl , pin , curl , pin .
And when it was done , I took the pins out , turned the hair upside down and brushed it out so you would n't have a ' set ' look , " her hairdresser Allen Edwards told a journalist .
But it was the poster that made Farrah into a global sensation .
She was already well - known as a model before landing Charlie 's Angels , and the poster , a collaboration between Fawcett and the photographer , was shot at her home before she was cast on the show .
The success of Charlie 's Angels sent sales of the poster into the millions .
It 's been estimated that it sold as many as 12 million copies , and Farrah received a royalty on each one .
She was paid $ 5,000 ( £ 3,123 ) per episode for the one season she appeared on the show , but is believed to have racked up over $ 400,000 ( £ 249,801 ) in poster royalties .
Farrah did her own make - up , wore her own swimsuit , picked out six frames from the 40 rolls of film shot on the day , marking out as her favourite the image that finally became the poster .
She knew how to market herself .
" The reason that the all - American boy prefers beauty to brains is that he can see better than he can think . "
When Farah Fawcett died this year , the dreams of the 1970s died with her .

The good news : the New York State Senate had an actual up - and - down floor vote on a controversial and important issue .
Bad news : they voted down Gay Marriage .
Nice work , everyone .
The Democrats have a one - seat majority , so , of course , the bill went down 38 - 24 .
Not a single Republican supported it .
Meanwhile , Washington DC 's city council embarrassed all of us by overwhelmingly approving gay marriage .
Openly gay Sate Senator Tom Duane sponsored the bill .
The State Senate generally does n't vote on anything until passage is ensured , but , to his credit , Governor Paterson pushed the Senate to actually vote on the marriage bill instead of letting it wither and die in legislative gridlock , as Senate leaders preferred .
Debate quietly began this afternoon , with the bill 's supporters generally being more vocal ( this speech , from Staten Island Sen. Diane Savino , is particularly moving ) .
And then it went to an up - and - down vote with no one having any idea whether it would pass or not , and then it did n't , because some Democratic senators are cowards , some Democratic senators are bigots , and all the Albany Republicans are both .
Update : these are the Democrats , many of whom have received gay money , who voted Nay on equality : Carl Kruger , Bill Stachowski , Ruben Diaz Sr. , Joe Addabbo , Darrel Aubertine , Hiram Monserrate , Shirley Huntley and George Onorato .
AMMAN , Jordan -- Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said there wo n't be a new Palestinian uprising as long as he's in office , but warned the current calm might end once he steps down , as early as June .
In a 60 - minute interview , Mr. Abbas rebutted charges by Israel that he was responsible for holding up peace talks , saying he twice presented privately a compromise on settlements to Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak .
Mr. Abbas said Mr. Barak ignored the offer .
Mr. Barak 's office did n't respond to requests for comment .

Speeding may be dangerous for drivers , but it could soon be a boon for California ’s fiscal health .
Tucked deep into the budget that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger unveiled Friday is a plan to give cities and counties the green light to install speed sensors on red - light cameras to catch -- and ticket -- speeding cars .
Those whizzing by the radar - equipped detectors at up to 15 mph over the limit would have to pay $ 225 per violation .
Those going faster would be fined $ 325 .
Small - government advocates want to put the brakes on the plan .
“ This is a budget item for the state ? ” said Lew Uhler , president of the National Tax Limitation Committee .
“ This is totally reprehensible . ”
Red - light cameras are already in place in communities across the Southland .
The governor wants to install speed detectors in 500 of those cameras , which would nab an estimated 2.4 million speeding violators a year , according to the state Department of Finance .
In Beverly Hills , for instance , there are nine red - light cameras , which could catch 835 speeders a month , the Schwarzenegger administration estimated .
That would add up to big bucks for cash - strapped California -- about $ 337.9 million through June 2011 -- to pay for state courts .
Every year after that , the program would generate nearly half a billion dollars , the Finance Department says .
Local governments would get a share .
All of which annoyed Uhler .
“ I was nailed by one of these [ red - light ] turn cameras .
It ’s so irritating , ” he said .
As for the possibility of driving a smidgen over the speed limit and receiving an unwelcome ticket weeks later in the mail : “ Just obnoxious , ” he said .
The proposal also touted safety : “ There would be . . . fewer accidents and injuries to drivers , passengers and pedestrians . ”

Suppose someone were to tell you that he has a crush on a co-worker .
He knows that nothing is ever going to materialize but feels powerless to turn off the feelings .
The object of the crush has no idea he feels this way , and this is how it needs to stay .
Getting involved with someone at work would be a disaster on multiple levels .
While the two seem compatible in some areas ( at least in his imagination ) , there are many where they would clash .
And yet , the fantasy that something could happen someday seems so much more appealing than the reality .
I suspect most of us have found ourselves in situations like this at one time or another .
Maybe our experience with similar situations makes it easier for us to empathize with religious believers at least a little bit .
They have crafted what they consider to be a perfect god , and while what is left of the rational part of their minds may experience doubt at times , who would n't want such a god ?
Forget about all the reasons it can not be true .
Is n't it more exciting to ponder the possibility that it might be ?
Sometimes I wonder if the feelings of excitement religious believers report while considering their god are really that different from those we experience when fantasizing about what might ( but wo n't ) be a potential romantic situation .
Do they not sometimes worry about losing themselves in the face of their passion just as we sometimes have to exert self - control not to do or say something we 'd instantly regret ?
And what about other pleasant fantasies that do not involve the possibility of romance ?
Would n't it be great to be smarter , stronger , better looking , or more talented than we really were ?
Would n't you stand in line for superpowers if they were being handed out ?
There are many types of fantasies that should help us understand part of the pull of religion .
And by understanding the pull of religion , maybe we would have an easier time understanding religious believers .
I have encountered many religious people who respond to my objections with some variation of , " I do n't care whether it is true or not ; it makes me feel better to believe it . "
Fair enough .
If they would n't have to take the next step of meddling in everyone else 's lives , maybe we could all just allow each other our fantasies .
Then again , we might recognize that some fantasies can be harmful .
Maybe the difference between non-religious fantasies and religious fantasies is that those of us who have non-religious fantasies can recognize that they are not real .
We do n't really believe that the other person is in love with us or that we have superpowers .
We wish it was true while recognizing that it is not .
We want to believe that we 'll find ourselves in relationship bliss or be able to handle any villains that come our way .
Daydreaming about such possibilities may feel better than facing reality at times , but we still realize that the fantasies are not real .
If we were unable to do so , we 'd likely have problems living in the real world .
Shouting at your wife may get you a criminal record in France
Married couples in France could end up with criminal records for insulting each other during arguments .
Under a new law , France is to become the first country in the world to ban ' psychological violence ' within marriage .
The law would apply to cohabiting couples and to both men and women .
' Insidious ' : Couples who resort to ' psychological violence ' during arguments could get criminal records under a new French law ( file picture )
French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said electronic tagging would be used on repeat offenders
It would cover men who shout at their wives and women who hurl abuse at their husbands - although it was not clear last night if nagging would be viewed as breaking the law .
The law is expected to cover every kind of insult including repeated rude remarks about a partner 's appearance , false allegations of infidelity and threats of physical violence .
Police are being urged to issue a caution in the first instance , but repeat offenders could face a fine , a restraining order or even jail .
Critics said the measure was a gimmick produced in response to lobbying by feminists and would be impossible to implement .
But French premier Francois Fillon , who announced the law , said : ' The creation of this offence will allow us to deal with the most insidious situations - situations that leave no visible scars , but which leave victims torn up inside . '
Many believe the offence will be impossible to prove .
Psychologist Anne Giraud said : ' Squabbling couples will allege all kinds of things about each other , but often it will be a case of one person 's word against the other . '
Sociologist Pierre Bonnet said : ' The next step will be to make rudeness a criminal offence .
The police and courts will be over - stretched trying to deal with numerous cases . '
A spokesman for Mr Fillon said the law was supported by the government , and was likely to be implemented within six months .

To season a cast iron skillet that 's new , start by washing it with soap and water .
Dry it thoroughly then cover the skillet in a coat of vegetable or olive oil with a paper towel .
Next , place the skillet in the oven for 2 hours at 350 °F ( 175 °C ) .
Remove it from the oven and let it cool .
Then , repeat the process 2 more times .
Heating the skillet in the oven allows the oil to bake into it and create a strong , nonstick surface that wo n't strip off when you cook food .
To maintain your seasoned cast iron skillet , wash it immediately after using it .
Use your hand or a soft cloth and a mixture of salt and water to scrub off any food particles .
Never use soap or a tough sponge or brush on a seasoned cast iron skillet .
This can scrape off the seasoning , damage the nonstick surface , and allow moisture to react with the metal and create rust .
Next , dry the skillet completely .
Place it over a burner set to low heat for a few minutes .
When the water evaporates , finish by adding a thin layer of oil to the skillet with a paper towel .
Alternatively , if you want to clean and re-season a rusty cast iron skillet , soak it in a solution of 1 part white vinegar and 1 part water for 3 hours .
Rinse the solution off , then re-season the cast iron skillet as if you were seasoning a new skillet .
For more tips on how to re-season a seasoned skillet , read on !
By now , if you ’ve read any of my posts , you probably know that I ’m a little bit of a Russophile .
So when it was my turn to write this week ’s Adventures in Feministory , there was no doubt in my mind that I wanted to talk about the Soviet Union ’s 588th Night Bomber Regiment during World War Two .
This particular regiment ( along with 2 others ) was pioneered by pilot , Major Marina Mikhailovna
Raskova ( above , right ) , and was composed entirely of women — from the pilots to the mechanics and from the officers to the bomb loaders .
The women of the 588th were feared greatly enough on the western front that they were dubbed ‘ The Night Witches ’ ( Nachthexen ) by the Germans who suffered their attacks .
The 588th , was the most highly - decorated unit in the Soviet Air Force — each pilot flew over 1,000 missions , twenty - three were awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union title .
Thirty - one of its members died in combat .
As you can imagine , they did n’t have the greatest support from their male colleagues , one of whom was quoted as saying : ‘ Wow !
You even have political officers !
Just like in a real unit ?’.
Lovely — they put their lives on the line for their country just as their male counerparts , and that ’s the support they got .
But back to the missions !
The 588th flew obsolete Polikarpov ( Po - 2 ) planes ( that were wooden — hence the ‘ Night Witch ’ title ) that were generally used for training , and which only had the capacity to carry 2 bombs .
While their planes were slow , they were thankfully very maneuverable .
The pilots learned to drive their enemies crazy with their harassment bombing — hitting areas where soldiers are trying to rest after longs days of fighting — causing a general feeling of insecurity and restlessness with the enemy .
When they were involved in direct air combat , the maneuverability of their planes made them nearly impossible to hit and the German pilots usually gave up .
One former pilot , Dr. Galina Beltsova , ( below , right ) spoke recently about the name ‘ Night Witches ’ — and it ’s not all that different to a discussion about the reappropriation of the word ‘ bitch ’ , do n’t ya think ?
Have a look :
“ We slept in anything we could find — holes in the ground , tents , caves — but the Germans had to have their barracks , you know .
They are very precise .
So their barracks were built , all in a neat row , and we would come at night , after they were asleep , and bomb them .
Of course , they would have to run out into the night in their underwear , and they were probably saying , — Oh , those night witches ! ’
Or maybe they called us something worse .
We , of course , would have preferred to have been called ‘ night beauties , ’ but , whichever , we did our job . ”
So why is this so amazing ?
Well , if you consider that American women pilots , while they have a long history of involvement with military aviation , were n’t trained for combat missions until 1993 — you ca n’t help but see the significance of this .
Sure , it happened during a desperate time of war — it was a time when American women were experiencing the chance to go to work for the war effort ( no small feat ) , but Soviet women were given the chance to actually fight the war on the front !
And to that I say хорошo !

The golfer had to grit his teeth through a particularly humiliating few days in America as he was lampooned on the popular US television show Saturday Night Live and the tally of women with whom he has allegedly had affairs more than doubled .
It ’s not easy to bust poachers for hunting a protected species or out - of - season buck without letting them actually shoot a protected species or out - of - season buck .
Unless , of course , you happen to have a remote - controlled zombie decoy .
Taxidermist Brian Wolslegel of Custom Robotic Wildlife makes just such a trap .
He takes corpses , dries the pelts , and stitches the skins over polyurethane bodies .
The head , tail , and limbs of each animal are then wired to servomotors controlled by a remote joystick .
All that gear is concealed inside hidden compartments in the animal ’s neck and legs — places hunters do n’t usually aim .
( Next year Wolslegel will even roll out a deer with CO2 cartridges that make puffs of steamy breath . )
Vigilante conservationists use the bots in four - person sting operations .
One remotely controls the cyborg decoy , one videotapes infractions , and two tackle wrongdoers , who can expect stiff fines or even jail time .
Custom Robotic Wildlife ’s menagerie includes coyotes , deer , elk , antelope , and bears .
In addition to supplying conservationists , the company also sells bots to law - abiding hunters seeking decoys or targets , homeowners looking to scare off bothersome geese , and other people with a pressing need for an animal - skin- covered robot .
Ever since the pilots of NWA 188 overflew their Minneapolis destination , speculation has been rampant about what actually happened in the cockpit .
It was widely assumed that the pilots had fallen asleep .
Their subsequent explanation that they ’d been out of radio communication for 78 minutes because they became distracted while using their laptops seemed strange enough that it might indeed be true .
Still , most pilots wondered how both pilots could have totally lost situational awareness for so long .
as relayed to “ Mike , ” a friend of Captain Tim Cheney .
I ’m always skeptical of anonymous emails forwarded over the internet and a little sleuthing found that it appeared Friday afternoon on the Airline Biz blog of the Dallas Morning News .
Reporter Terry Maxon refers to it as a “ thrice forwarded email ” which I take to mean that was able to verify the email ’s authenticity by tracing it back three steps .
Even if this email is proven to be a hoax , it does a credible job of explaining how a series of events and distractions could have caused the incident .
While it explains what happened , it certainly cannot absolve the pilots of responsibility .
Even if ATC were complicit in the incident , it ’s up to pilots to recognize when a problem has occurred and to take action to resolve it .
That has n’t changed since the days of Wilbur and Orville Wright .
Hi All ,
I had a one hour conversation with Tim Cheney yesterday and would like to shed some light on what happened to cause the over flight of their destination , MSP .
Before I begin with details , I wanted to say right up front that although there are many events that helped to cause this , Tim takes full responsibility and places no blame on anyone but himself .
He is very humbled by what has happened and fully understands that as captain , he was responsible for the a / c , crew and passengers .
That said , he wanted me to know how it all happened .
Secondly , he has the full support of his neighbors in Gig Harbor , WA , as well has his church parishioners .
One of his neighbors wrote a letter to the Star & Tribune in Minneapolis saying how great a family the Cheney 's were , I agree .
On their flight from San Diego to Minneapolis , after passing Denver , the f / a called the cockpit to let them know Tim 's crew meal was ready .
Tim was the " flying pilot " on this leg , so he told his F/ O that when the f / a brings the meal up , he will step back to use the restroom .
When Tim returned , the F/ A left the cockpit and he began to eat his crew meal .
When a pilot leaves to use the restroom , it is customary for the other pilot to brief him on his return on " any changes " , such as altitude , heading , course changes or atc center frequency changes , etc .
In this instance , nothing was said .... even though the f/o had received a frequency change .
The problem that occurred was that the f/o never got a response on the new frequency .... it was not the correct frequency .... it was a Winnipeg Canada Center Freq .
Now , Denver Center is trying to get a hold of them because they never checked in , because the f/o had dialed in the wrong freq ...... that is who called them so many times .... but , then there was a shift change at Denver Center and no one briefed the new controller that there was a NORDO A/C ( non communications ) in their airspace .... so , in actuality , atc basically " lost " this a / c..... see Wall Street Journal article below .
Tim told me he heard atc chatter on the speaker and so never thought they were out of radio range ..... but , of course , they were hearing pilots talk on Winnipeg Center .
For non-pilots ..... when we do n't hear anything for a long while ... we ask atc if they are still there .... sometimes they are and sometimes you are out of their area and need to find a new frequency .
With this chatter going on , there was no concern that they were not being controlled .
Then Tim told the f/o that the new bidding system was horrible and that his November schedule was not what he hoped for .
He mentioned that his son was going into the Army in Dec. and he wanted certain days off so he could see him off ..... the f/o said he could help him , he knew more about the new bidding system .
Tim got his lap top out and put it on his left leg and showed the f/o how he bid .
He told me he had his lap top out for maybe 2 minutes .
Then the f/o said that he would show him how to do it on his laptop .
He had his laptop out maximum of 5 minutes .
Let 's also add the 100 kt tail wind that they had to the discussion , not helping matters .
The f/a 's called the cockpit on the interphone ( no they did not kick the door , no , no one was sleeping , no , no one was fighting ) and asked when they will get there .
They looked at their nav screens and were directly over MSP .
Because they had their screens set on the max , 320 kt setting , when the f/o called on the frequency , which of course was Winnipeg Center , he saw Eau Claire and Duluth on his screen .
They asked where they were and the f/o told them over Eau Claire , which was not even close , but MSP had disappeared from the screen even though they were right over the city .
They were , as you all know , vectored all over the sky to determine if they had control of the a /c and Tim kept telling the f/o to tell them they have control they want to land at MSP , etc .
They landed with 11,000 pounds of fuel ( no they did not come in on fumes , but had 2 hours in an A320 ) and not but 15 minutes past schedule , even though they left San Diego 35 minutes late due to an atc flow restriction .
In the jet - way awaiting them were FBI and every other authority you can imagine .
Aftermath and tidbits :
Although these pilots filed an NASAP Report , which was designed to have pilots tell the truth about events , so the FAA could learn from them , they had their licenses revoked by the ATL F.A.A. even before they came out of their meeting with NTSB and NASAP meetings .
ATL FAA is really big on this new regulation which will allow pilots to take a short nap in flight so they will be rested for the approach ... they were insistent that they were sleeping .
MSP FAA , Vance ( do not know last name ) was the person who handed Tim his revocation letter ( which was leaked to the entire world by the ATL FAA ) .
Tim said Vance had tears in his eyes and walked away , said nothing .
It was later learned that the entire MSP FAA office did not agree at all with revoking their pilot 's licenses , but had no jurisdiction over the matter , since ATL FAA had control because of Delta .
The pilots have been to Wash .
D.C. , ATL and MSP for several meetings .
In ATL , they met with the chief pilots and Tim said they could not have been nicer .
They are working to resolve this , not to try and fire them .
But of course , they will have to get their license back for Delta to consider allowing them to continue flying .
The appeal has been files for the FAA to reinstate their licenses or to settle on some form of punishment , etc .
When Tim and his wife were in MSP for a meeting with the NTSB , they happen to be staying at the same hotel as the NTSB was .
The next morning in the lobby , the NTSB official came over to Tim and said he did not know why they even called them in for this event .
There was no safety issue .
Also , MSP Center informed Delta that there never was a problem and no aircraft were near their plane .
Even though no radio communications , they had been followed and separated .
Yes , the company tried to contact them on ACARS , but the 320 does not have a chime ... it has a 30 second light which then extinguishes .
Tim always has 121.5 tuned , but as we all know as pilots , it can get very noisy at times and we turn it down and sometimes forget to turn it back on .
He told me this may have been the case .
So there were so many factors which helped to cause this episode .
Anyone would have likely prevented it ..... properly checking in on the new frequency would have been the first one .....
A note about laptops ..... in NWA's A.O.M
( I think it stands for airman 's operation manual ) , it does not say we can't use a laptop , however in Delta 's A.O.M. , it does , we are transitioning now and we actually have pages from both airlines .
When our union showed this to the attorney 's , they could not believe the confusion put on our pilot group .
But , D.C. F.A.A. put out a new possible ruling which will disallow all laptops ...... so stupid , do n't they know Jet Blue has laptops on every aircraft and soon all airliners will for the electronic Jepp charts .
These are the facts and again , Tim said he feels very bad for the company and the pilots and is hoping for a positive outcome on their appeal .
With 24 years at NWA , 21,000 blemish free hours , it would be a mistake to ruin his career over this in my opinion .
Thank you ,
Mike
F.A.A . Fails to brief new controller on duty ( WSJ Article )
The rich and famous people of ancient Egypt lived a decadent lifestyle with fine wine , sex , high fashion , and plenty of partying .
How do they compare with their equivalents today - the modern western celebrity set ?
The main differences might be regarding who were the richest people then , and who are the richest people now .
In ancient Egypt the pharaoh was at the top of the ‘ pyramid ’ and his family , noble people who owned land , and the priests came after .
Scribes , architects and doctors were well off , and skilled craftsmen also had many privileges .
Peasants and unskilled workers were low down the scale of Egyptian society , but it was the servants and slaves that skirted the bottom of the class pyramid .
Those working in mines and quarries were really asking for trouble , as diseases , physical strain and dangers lurked in every turned stone in the desert .
Slaves working in rich domestic environments were the lucky ones as they were assured security , housing and food .
Many of these endured hard physical work and usually died young as we can see from the osteological remains found at Amarna site analyzed by Dr. Jerome Rose which proved that people building those megalomaniac buildings for Akhenaton died young with severe bone lesions .
Jobs For the Boys
Men in the armed forces , army and navy were not afforded a high social status , and neither were entertainers .
Members of the armed forces are still not wealthy today , and face the same dangers .
Many still die in wars like the ones in Afghanistan and Iraq , or return with physical and mental injuries that haunt them for life .
However , it is somewhat different now regarding entertaining .
Although there are still many badly - paid wannabes , entertainers today are amongst the richest people on the planet .
Beyonce ( who Zahi Hawass called " a stupid woman " because of her lack of interest while touring ancient Egyptian monuments with him ) , Oprah Winfrey , Madonna , Angelina Jolie , Britney Spears and Simon Cowell are some of today 's high - earners .
Professions were usually hereditary , not chosen ; a man followed his father ’s trade and so on .
We also have that today as seen for example by the careers of actor Martin Sheen and his sons ( both actors ) Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez or Gwyneth Paltrow , famous actress and daughter of Bruce Paltrow and Blythe Danner ( both actors too ) .
And of course , there 's the Bush ' dynasty ' in US politics .
Scribes were the top dogs in the sphere of learning and teaching .
Not every child was able to learn how to read and write ; this was restricted to those following the scribe profession .
We can compare this to the present computer industry where people like Bill Gates and Larry Page rule the world of communications and fight for more people using their ‘ scripts ’ .
A paradox : we can have hieroglyphics in our cellphones now .
These days the situation is different , as the presidents and kings of nations might not be the richest people in their country .
The priests of any religion nowadays are not the richest people , that is for sure , as cults and religions are not considered as economically important in society as they were back then .
Gotta
Get to ... the Temple
Priests loved to eat and drink well .
They had all those succulent leftovers from the rituals at the temple to take home .
That is why arteriosclerosis ( high cholesterol ) was found in ancient Egyptian mummies .
Unlike today , when there 's a branch of Greggs ( British bakery chain , famous for its sausage rolls ) on every corner it seems , in ancient Egypt , only the elite could afford such a decadent disease !
Different kinds of meat were available for the elite : beef , veal , antelope and gazelle meat .
The poor ate mostly birds such as geese , ducks , quails , cranes , and from the New Kingdom onwards raised their domestic poultry animals .
Different fish from the Nile were consumed , though some were forbidden because of the myth of Osiris where he travelled along the Nile and the Mediterranean Sea while dismembered by his evil brother Seth .
The fish were most frequently dried in the sun .
Sweeteners were different too ; the rich used honey , while the poor used dates , left to ferment in the heat .
Booze Nation
Similarly to today perhaps , wine was the booze of choice for high society individuals .
Fine wines were labelled with the date , vineyard and variety as the tax assessors requested , such as the ones found in Tutankhamun ’s tomb .
Beer was the poison of the masses .
Rich people also drank beer though ... loads of it , in fact .
People loved to drink , as they do today , according to maximas written in the New Kingdom ’s The Maxims of Ptahhotep or Instruction of Ptahhotep , a vizier under King Isesi of the Egyptian Fifth Dynasty ( c. 2414-2375 BC ) .
These writings functioned as advice and were intended to be directed to his son .
There are several copies available today ; the Prisse Papyrus dating from the Middle Kingdom , at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris , and two slightly different versions at the British Museum .
Ptahotep explains why he wrote these ; he had reached old age and wanted to leave a legacy of ‘ good sense ’ instructions to his son .
These are rules on how to be kind , just , peaceful , and on how to behave in the correct manner in general .
Among those there were some pieces of advice on how bad your reputation gets ( it goes down the drain , really ) , if you drink too much .
Just like what happened to Charlie Sheen and his wife last Christmas ...
Grand Designs
As homes were built with adobe bricks , none of these buildings survived .
The most modest houses , for the poorest people , were built with straw , palm leaves and also some rudimentary bricks , and were incapable of resisting the winds and sands of centuries .
The houses built for the rich and powerful were obviously different from the ones built for labourers and farmers .
The two main differences were : materials and space .
Not that the rich all had golden taps , literally made of gold , like Saddam Hussein ’s , in their bathrooms , or Carrara marble like many rich people do today .
But , for example , wood was expensive in Egypt .
Egyptian trees did not provide the best wood for furniture - building , so the good stuff was imported from Byblos – present Lebanon .
Furniture made of ‘ good ’ wood was only found in the homes of the rich .
Wooden beds and wooden headrests featuring gods protecting the occupants from demons were not available for lower classes .
Rugs from Persia , ebony and ivory pieces from African kingdoms , golden vases , jewellery and sculptures from Nubia , various precious stones and gold ornaments were some of the treats rich people could afford in ancient Egypt .
As far as we know , they did n't have their own version of Hello magazine in which to show off their interior decor .
The equivalent to present day Beverley Hills or the Hamptons , the rich had their patch of land outside the city , where they had room for orchards and vineyards .
The poor were clustered together on the outskirts in small brick houses .
An example of housing ‘ for the poor ’ were the villages expressly built for workers like the one at Deir el - Medina - similar to the workers camps outside Dubai .
Dressed to Party
Another distinctive trait of rich people in ancient Egypt was the use of wigs , made with sheep or real human hair , and worn at parties and in domestic environments as well as at festival and important cults .
Fashion thrived , and found its victims amongst the wig wearers .
In an ancient Egyptian version of the Emmys or the Oscars , guests such as Victoria Beckam , Ivana Trump or Paris Hilton would all have wigs , and perhaps also burning perfume cones , on their heads .
But what about the gowns ?
It seems from archaeological findings that everyone wore tunics .
Men wore them down to their knees and women down to their ankles .
These tunics were made from linen , from the Flax plant very abundant across the Mediterranean .
Not the choice of Victoria Beckam for sure !
Like a school uniform , people found a way to customise the ubiquitous tunic .
Richer individuals wore their tunics folded , as depicted in art , with some with gold lines and designs .
Add on the jewellery and the headdresses , and there was no way could you mistake a celeb for her personal assistant .
Sandals ( ankh ) were worn by everyone ( without socks , you 'll be pleased to hear ) .
The difference was that poorer people could only afford papyrus or palm fibre sandals , while richer individuals had their sandals woven in leather .
There were no high heels like the ones models refused to put on at the latest Alexander McQueen fashion show !
Men and women wore makeup ( the rich ones ) .
Kohl for eyes was also used as a protective balm as many of the medical papyri prescriptions suggest , and henna was worn on the lips and nails .
Tattoos were common , applied to both the living and the deceased .
Today tattoos are becoming common amongst all types of people , and many male celebs slap on the face paint as well as the women .
Love , Sex and Adultery in Ancient Egypt
Women had more freedom than their counter parts in Mesopotamia , for instance , but never as much as Paris Hilton and pals .
Egyptians married young , very young indeed , and , in royal families , between themselves .
Childbirth was dangerous but encouraged in ancient Egypt - prosperity was a goal for everyone and that included having a big family .
The love and sex lives of the Egyptians were as complicated as they are today .
Turin 's famous Erotic Papyrus assures us that the Egyptians were sexually adventurous , with a penchant for naked belly - dancing , and collections of love poetry from the Amarna era reveal that they were also big romantics .
According to Angelina Jolie in recent news “ fidelity is not essential in her relationship with Brad Pitt ” , but adultery is one of the oldest reasons for divorce , death and depression - the 3 D’s - and in ancient Egypt as in most of the modern world , women often still file for divorce on the grounds of adultery .
Divorce was legal and the problems arising from it were usually when it involved property that had to be divided .
The bigger the stake - the bigger the battle , as the recent multi-million divorce case between ex-Beatle Paul McCartney and Heather Mills clearly illustrates .
The love and sex lives of the rich and famous captivated the less fortunate in ancient Egypt just as the romances of Jordan and Peter Andre or ' Bradjelina ' do today .
The alleged affair between Hatshepsut and Senenmut clearly occupied the minds of workers at Deir el - Medina - one of them drew a caricature of their love affair in an ostracon .
Then , as now , there would always be somebody who did n't approve !
Playboys of the Ancient World
There are many similarities between the leisure pursuits of the rich and famous now and in ancient Egypt .
The Egyptians practised many sports , including hunting and fishing ( still high on the country gent 's agenda ) , and wrestling , which has perhaps suffered some decline in status over the centuries .
Like now , the rich had a need for speed .
They loved racing horses and chariots ( after the horse was introduced in Egypt ) , just as the modern elite love their fast cars .
It was a dangerous passion that possibly caused Tutankhamun ’s death as well as James Dean ’s , but led rich playboy Lord Carnarvon to his career as an explorer .
Dinner parties , or banquets , were also frequent in rich houses with dancing , drinking and maybe sex included - just as today .
No scientific proof of the use of recreational drugs in ancient Egypt has been found yet , but jars from Cyprus found in Egyptian sites reveal that they used opium as medicine .
Now , there is a growing practice of the legitimate use of cannabis for medicinal purposes , to treat MS amongst other complaints .
No doubt Amy Winehouse and Pete Docherty have used ' medicinal purposes ' as an erroneous excuse at some point too .
Celebs Behind Bars ?
Not in Egypt
Scandals like the 1970 ’s allegation of a young girl ’s homicide by the hand of director Roman Polanski ( linked to sex offenses ) are not known to ancient Egypt .
However , the ancient world was n't without its bad boys .
High treason and attempts to the king ’s life were among the top crimes to be punished in ancient Egypt .
Robbery existed but there is no evidence of homicides or other death crimes .
Justice was Maat , the supreme balance against chaos , and everything in life had to be done accordingly .
Just as we respect our Constitutions and laws , ancient Egyptians had their laws and ordinances .
Viziers and judges were appointed by the pharaoh to decide upon requests for intercession .
Forget not to judge justice .
It is an abomination of the god to show partiality .
This is the teaching .
Therefore , do you accordingly .
Look upon him who is known to you like him who is unknown to you ; and him who is near the king like him who is far from his house .
Behold , a prince who does this , he shall endure here in this place .
- From The Instructions of Rekhmire , in The Wisdom of Ancient Egypt by Joseph Kaster .
Google sure does love shaking up the system .
Remember the original Google search page ?
It made news because your search results popped up fast and were n’t cluttered with ads .
Remember when Google went public ?
It made news because the founders auctioned off shares to the public .
Remember when Gmail came out ?
It made news because it offered 1,000 times the free storage space of competitors like Hotmail and Yahoo .
And now Google wants to shake up the way we buy cellphones  by letting you shop for the phone and the service independently , on a new Google Web site ( Google.com / phone ) .
To introduce this phone store , on Tuesday , Google took the wraps off what may be the worst - kept secret on the Internet : a brand - new cellphone , designed by Google and made by HTC , called the Nexus One .
It ’s pretty sweet , it advances the state of the art , and it ’s a welcome addition to the catalog of great app phones like the iPhone , Palm Pre and Motorola Droid .
You ’ll pay $ 529 without a two - year contract for service with T - Mobile , or $ 179 with one .
But the truth is , the Google news this week is n’t quite as earthshaking as Google seems to think it is .
Has Nicolas Sarkozy lost face in his battle against the burqa ?
One might think so considering his latest compromise on the issue .
While the French president firmly believes that these allegedly Islamic veils are " a sign of subservience , a sign of debasement " which are " not welcome " anywhere in the Fifth Republic , he now thinks the only workable ban would be on public transport or in civic buildings .
In a country which is meant to champion secularism and gender equality , it really is quite a climbdown .
The vast majority of French people , including most Muslims , believe that face coverings should be banned completely .
They 're not only intimidating and divisive , but actually have very little to do with Islam , and far more to do with central Asian and Middle Eastern traditions .
They certainly engender more than a sneaking suspicion that they 've been imposed by men intent on keeping their spouses or daughters away from the common gaze .
Sarkozy clearly laid out the popular view with the words : " The full veil is not welcome in France because it is contrary to our values and contrary to the ideals we have of a woman 's dignity . "
A ban would be an entirely democratic one which would not stigmatise anyone , least of all members of France 's six millon - strong Muslim community , Sarkozy argued .
Despite this , Sarkozy left us in little doubt that all those who wear face coverings – whether burqa or niqab – are Muslims living in a country which increasingly expects everyone to " adapt " to the Gallic way .
It was certainly no coincidence that the clampdown on religious symbols in state schools which began in 1994 centred on Muslim headscarves .
Sixteen years on , the only reason Sarkozy has stopped short of a full burqa ban is because he thinks it would be thrown out by appeal courts under European human rights legislation .
Such legal challenges would be a huge embarrassment to Sarkozy , especially during his rightwing government 's ill - conceived national identity debate which is allowing racist and Islamophobic views to masquerade as 21st - century patriotism .
Even anti-terrorism judges have captured the increasingly hostile nature of the arguments by saying that a full ban on the veil would lead to an increase in Islamic extremism .
Under such circumstances the real issue raised by Sarkozy 's burqa ban – and especially the watered down version – is not the freedom of the handful of few women who wear full veils ( less than 2000 and most of them confined to isolated housing estates , according to all reliable estimates ) , but the very place of Islam in modern France .
By targeting his tokenistic policies and soundbites at a harmless minority , Sarkozy and his cronies succeed in linking Islam with everything from sexism to national security threats .
If these associations are genuine , then they should be dealt with in a manner which is honest and unambiguous .
Anything less results in weak compromises engendering nothing but fear and suspicion , often without anybody really understanding why .
Cory Doctorow seems to have crafted the lexicon of the opposition to the Digital Economy Bill with his phrase ‘ Pirate Finder General ’ [ 1 ] .
In his follow up he claims that this bill will introduce three - strikes , ISP spying and powers for Peter Mandelson to rewrite copyright law at will .
I spent a fun-filled Sunday afternoon reading the bill to see how bad it really is so that you do n't have to ( although you still should ) .
You 're welcome .
Firstly , the changes to copyright law are only a small part of the bill .
Other parts of the bill cover : Channel 4 and Channel 3 licensing , removing the requirements for Teletext , digital switch over , radio licenses and classification of video games .
I wo n't be talking about those in this post .
The bill requires that ISPs pass on infringement notices to subscribers , either via email or via the postal system .
Copyright owners can also request infringement lists .
This allows them to see that their notices A , B , C all went to the same subscriber .
They can then take this information to court and proceed with the usual actions .
( 124A and 124B . )
The bill defers much of the policy in this area to a code that is to be written by OFCOM with the approval of the Secretary of State .
This code includes the number of infringement notices that a single subscriber needs in order to be included in a report , the size of fines to be imposed on ISPs for failing to follow the code and the appeals process .
The Secretary of State sets the compensation paid from copyright holders to ISPs and from everyone to OFCOM ( 124L ) .
What is n't in the bill is any talk of disconnection , ISP spying or three strikes .
However , 124H gives the Secretary of State the power to require any “ technical obligation ” .
(3) A " technical measure " is a measure that ( a ) limits the speed or other capacity of the service provided to a subscriber ; ( b ) prevents a subscriber from using the service to gain access to particular material , or limits such use ; ( c ) suspends the service provided to a subscriber ; or ( d ) limits the service provided to a subscriber in another way .
A brief interlude about statutory instruments is needed here .
SIs are published by the government and cannot be amended by Parliament .
There are two types .
The first takes effect automatically and Parliament has a short time ( usually 40 days depending on holidays etc ) to annul it .
The second requires positive action by both Houses before it takes effect .
According to Wikipedia , the last time that an SI was annulled was in 2000 , and 1979 before that .
The last time that an SI was n't approved was 40 years ago .
The powers to impose technical measures are of the annul variety : they take effect automatically after 40 days .
They do n't appear to include requiring ISPs to spy .
After that power , 302A gives the Secretary of State the power to change the Copyright Act via a positive action SI “ for the purpose of preventing or reducing the infringement of copyright by means of the internet ” .
Next up , 124N gives the Secretary of State the power to take over any domain name registrar .
By my reading , that is no exaggeration .
The Secretary can take action if they believe that the actions of a registrar affect “ ( a ) the reputation or availability of electronic communications networks or electronic communications services [...] ( b ) the interests of consumers or members of the public [... ]. ” .
The action can either be to appoint a “ manager ” , who has total power , or to ask a court to change the constitution of the body and enjoin them from changing it back .
There 's no requirement that this registrar be based in the UK , or even to allocate in the uk ccTLD .
Understandably , they are quite upset about this .
I 'd also like to quickly note that this bill contains provisions for the licensing of orphan works without the copyright holder being involved also for libraries to have the rights to lend out e-books .
( Although without giving any powers to do anything about technical limitations on e-books that might prevent it . )
Lastly , and I might be misunderstanding something here , on page 52 the Secretary of State seems to get powers to amend or annul anything relating to this act , in any bill in this session of Parliament , or before , by using a positive action SI .
Hopefully the above provides pointers for people who want to understand and read the bill .
Now , my ( informed ) opining :
This is an abomination .
It 's an attempt to subvert Parliament by giving the government the power to write copyright law at will .
The provisions are extraordinary .
The sanctions against domain name registrars are staggering .
I do n't know of any other case when the government can sequestrate a private entity at will .
Given the international nature of the domain name system , this should cause international concern .
I expect that this power is largely intended to be a very large stick with which to force the removal of xyzsucks.com style names that embarrass business or government .
No registrar will dare cross their interests if they have this power .
If you vote in the UK , goto TheyWorkForYou , lookup your MP , write a letter ( on paper ) .
Sign the petition .

As Senate Democrats try to settle the dispute over the proposed government - run insurance plan , or public option , in a way that can get at least 60 votes , some are looking again at a program that has long tantalized policy makers as a potential model : the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program .
That is the program that provides insurance coverage to more than eight million federal workers , including members of Congress and their dependents .
A team of 10 Democratic senators tapped by the majority leader , Harry Reid of Nevada , to fashion a last - ditch deal on the public option is now studying the federal employees ’ plan as a possible blueprint .
The goal would be to provide a menu of private , nationwide insurance plans .
The federal Office of Personnel Management would oversee them , conducting the same type of negotiation over benefits and premium prices that it does for federal workers .
The federal employees health plan offers workers an array of different private insurance plans , including preferred - provider networks and lower - cost HMOs .
Several of the plans are national in scope — the most popular is a national Blue Cross plan — and benefits are portable , from state to state , and usually can be carried into retirement .
An easy - to - use Web site allows federal employees to compare the plans available to them .
Although the insurance plans are all private , they have the aura of public insurance because the program is regulated by legislation , is overseen by a federal agency and serves federal workers .
Giving many Americans coverage similar to that of members of Congress is a politically potent — and potentially appealing — concept for both lawmakers and the people they serve .
McDonald 's restaurants may soon be the easiest spot to find free Wi-Fi and browse the Web as long as you like .
The restaurant chain is lifting a $ 2.95 fee for two hours of wireless Internet access starting in mid-January , according to the Wall Street Journal and other reports .
McDonald 's officials could not be reached immediately for comment .
The free Wi-Fi will reportedly be available at about 11,000 of 14,000 U.S. locations .
McDonald 's has used Wi -Fi provided by AT&T Inc. for several years , after first launching the service at 75 locations in San Francisco in 2003 .
The free Wi-Fi will come with no time limits , all the better to encourage visitors to stay longer and buy McDonald 's coffee drinks and hamburgers .

— The Cabarrus County Sheriff 's
Office says that a man charged with murder sought revenge on a man suspected of molesting a child .
WBTV , a CBS affiliate in Charlotte , reports that Christopher Michael Hartsell , 32 , shot and killed William Lee Ballance , 47 , in his residence in a small mobile home park early Friday .
Neighbors told WBTV that Hartsell had lived with Ballance , a convicted sex offender , until about a week ago .
Around the same time that Hartsell moved out , rumors started that Ballance had recently molested a child .
On Thursday , the Cabarrus County Sheriff 's Office issued warrants for Ballance 's arrest on sex- related charges , including first - degree rape of a child .
Ballance was slain before they could be served .
More details of the case are n't being reported to protect the victim 's identity .
Hartsell was being held in the Cabarrus County Jail Saturday without bond .
Ballance was sentenced to 20 months ' probation for a 1998 conviction for taking indecent liberties with a minor in Guilford County , according to state Department of Correction records .
DOC records show he also got probation in 2007 for possession of a firearm by a felon .
JUSTIN PRITCHARD , Associated Press Writer
LOS ANGELES -- Barred from using lead in children 's jewelry because of its toxicity , some Chinese manufacturers have been substituting the more dangerous heavy metal cadmium in sparkling charm bracelets and shiny pendants being sold throughout the United States , an Associated Press investigation shows .
The most contaminated piece analyzed in lab testing performed for the AP contained a startling 91 percent cadmium by weight .
The cadmium content of other contaminated trinkets , all purchased at national and regional chains or franchises , tested at 89 percent , 86 percent and 84 percent by weight .
The testing also showed that some items easily shed the heavy metal , raising additional concerns about the levels of exposure to children .
Cadmium is a known carcinogen .
Like lead , it can hinder brain development in the very young , according to recent research .
Children do n't have to swallow an item to be exposed — they can get persistent , low - level doses by regularly sucking or biting jewelry with a high cadmium content .
To gauge cadmium 's prevalence in children 's jewelry , the AP organized lab testing of 103 items bought in New York , Ohio , Texas and California .
All but one were purchased in November or December .
The results : 12 percent of the pieces of jewelry contained at least 10 percent cadmium .
Some of the most troubling test results were for bracelet charms sold at Walmart , at the jewelry chain Claire 's and at a dollar store .
High amounts of cadmium also were detected in " The Princess and The Frog " movie - themed pendants .
" There 's nothing positive that you can say about this metal .
It 's a poison , " said Bruce A. Fowler , a cadmium specialist and toxicologist with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
On the CDC 's priority list of 275 most hazardous substances in the environment , cadmium ranks No. 7 .

Jewelry industry veterans in China say cadmium has been used in domestic products there for years .
Zinc , the metal most cited as a replacement for lead in imported jewelry being sold in the United States , is a much safer and nontoxic alternative .
But the jewelry tests conducted for AP , along with test findings showing a growing presence of cadmium in other children 's products , demonstrate that the safety threat from cadmium is being exported .
A patchwork of federal consumer protection regulations does nothing to keep these nuggets of cadmium from U.S. store shelves .
If the products were painted toys , they would face a recall .
If they were industrial garbage , they could qualify as hazardous waste .
But since there are no cadmium restrictions on jewelry , such items are sold legally .
While the agency in charge of regulating children 's products , the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission , has cracked down on the dangers posed by lead and products known to have killed children , such as cribs , it has never recalled an item for cadmium — even though it has received scattered complaints based on private test results for at least the past two years .
There is no definitive explanation for why children 's jewelry manufacturers , virtually all from China in the items tested , are turning to cadmium .
But a reasonable double whammy looms : Cadmium prices have plummeted as factories grasp for substitutes now that lead is heavily regulated under the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 .
That law set a new , stringent standard for lead in children 's products :
Only the very smallest amount is permissible — no more than 0.03 percent of the total content .
The statute has led manufacturers to drastically reduce lead in toys and jewelry .
The law also contained the first explicit regulation of cadmium , though the standards are significantly less strict than lead and apply only to painted toys , not jewelry .
To determine how much cadmium a child could be exposed to , items are bathed in a solution that mimics stomach acid to see how much of the toxin would leach out after being swallowed .
The jewelry testing for AP was conducted by chemistry professor Jeff Weidenhamer of Ashland University in Ohio , who over the past few years has provided the CPSC with results showing high lead content in products that were later recalled .
His lab work for AP assessed how much cadmium was in each item .
Overall , 12 of the 103 items each contained at least 10 percent cadmium .
Two others contained lower amounts , while the other 89 were clean .
Ten of the items with the highest cadmium content were then run through the stomach acid test to see how much would escape .
Although that test is used only in regulation of toys , AP used it to see what hazard an item could pose because unlike the regulations , a child 's body does n't distinguish between cadmium leached from jewelry and cadmium leached from a toy .
" Clearly it seems like for a metal as toxic as cadmium , somebody ought to be watching out to make sure there are n't high levels in items that could end up in the hands of kids , " said Weidenhamer .
His test results include :
— Three flip flop bracelet charms sold at Walmart contained between 84 and 86 percent cadmium .
The charms fared the worst of any item on the stomach acid test ; one shed more cadmium in 24 hours than what World Health Organization guidelines deem a safe exposure over 60 weeks for a 33 - pound child .
The charms were purchased for testing in August 2008 .
The company that imported them , Florida - based Sulyn Industries , stopped selling the item to Wal - Mart Corp. in November 2008 , the firm 's president said .
Wal - Mart would not comment on whether the charms are still on store shelves , or how many have been sold .
Sulyn's president , Harry Dickens , said the charms were subjected to testing standards imposed by both Wal - Mart and federal regulation — but were not tested for cadmium .
In separate written statements , Dickens and Wal - Mart said they consider safety a very high priority .
" We consistently seek to sell only those products that meet safety and regulatory standards , " Wal - Mart said .
" Currently there is no required cadmium standard for children 's jewelry . "
As was the case with every importer or retailer that responded to AP 's request for comment on the tests , neither Sulyn nor Wal - Mart would address whether the results concerned them or if the products should be recalled .
— Four charms from two " Rudolph the Red- Nosed Reindeer " bracelets sold at a Dollar N More store in Rochester , N.Y. , were measured at between 82 and 91 percent cadmium .
The charms also fared poorly on the stomach acid test .
Two other charms from the same bracelets were subjected to a leaching test which recreates how much cadmium would be released in a landfill and ultimately contaminate groundwater .
Based on those results , if the charms were waste from manufacturing , they would have had to be specially handled and disposed of under U.S. environmental law .
The company that imported the Rudolph charms , Buy - Rite Designs , Inc. of Freehold , N.J. , has gone out of business .
— Two charms on a " Best Friends " bracelet bought at Claire 's , a jewelry chain with nearly 3,000 stores in North America and Europe , consisted of 89 and 91 percent cadmium .
The charms also leached alarming amounts in the simulated stomach test .
Informed of the results , Claire 's issued a statement pointing out that children 's jewelry is not required to pass a cadmium leaching test .
" Claire 's has its products tested by independent accredited third - party laboratories approved by the Consumer Product Safety Commission in compliance with the commission 's standards , and has passing test results for the bracelet using these standards , " the statement said .
Those standards scrutinize lead content , not cadmium .
— Pendants from four " The Princess and The Frog " necklaces bought at Walmart ranged between 25 and 35 percent cadmium , though none failed the stomach acid test nor the landfill leaching test .
The Walt Disney Co. , which produced the popular animated movie , said in a statement that test results provided by the manufacturer , Rhode Island - based FAF Inc. , showed the item complied with all applicable safety standards .
An official at FAF 's headquarters did not respond to multiple requests for comment when informed of Weidenhamer 's results ; a woman at the company 's office in southern China who would not give her name said FAF products " might naturally contain some very small amounts of cadmium .
We measure it in parts per million because the content is so small , for instance one part per million . "
However , the tests conducted for AP showed the pendants contained between 246,000 and 346,000 parts per million of cadmium .
" It comes down to the following : Cadmium causes cancer .
How much cadmium do you want your child eating ? " said Michael R. Harbut , a doctor who has treated adult victims of cadmium poisoning and is director of the environmental cancer program at the Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit .
" In my view , the answer should be none . "
Xu Hongli , a cadmium specialist with the Beijing office of Asian Metal Ltd. , a market research and consultancy firm , said test results showing high cadmium levels in some Chinese - made metal jewelry did not surprise her .
Using cadmium alloys has been " a relatively common practice " among manufacturers in the eastern cities of Yiwu and Qingdao and the southern province of Sichuan , Xu said .
" Some of their products contain 90 percent cadmium or higher , " she acknowledged .
" Usually , though , they are more careful with export products . "
She said she thought that manufacturers were becoming aware of cadmium 's dangers , and are using it less , " But it will still take a while for them to completely shift away from using it . "
The CPSC has received dozens of incident reports of cadmium in products over the past few years , said Gib Mullan , the agency 's director of compliance and field operations .
Though the CPSC has authority to go after a product deemed a public danger under the Federal Hazardous Substances
Act — the law used in lead - related recalls several years ago — there have been no enforcement actions .
" We are a small agency so we can't do everything we think would be a good idea .
We have to try to pick our spots , " Mullan said .
At most , the agency can investigate 10 percent of the tens of thousands of reports filed by the public each year , he said .
With the help of an outside firm , the CPSC has started a scientific literature review of cadmium and other heavy metals , including how the substances fare in leaching tests , according to spokesman Scott Wolfson .
" If there has a been a shift in manufacturing to the use of cadmium , CPSC will take appropriate action . "
" We are actively looking at cadmium right now , " Wolfson said , adding that the agency will " take the right actions to protect children from either toys or other children 's products " when an item violates the new stomach acid leaching standard or exhibits " a significant exposure problem . "
Meanwhile , the CPSC's Mullan cites " a trend upward " in cadmium reports the agency has received — and private - sector testing AP reviewed shows cadmium is showing up more frequently .
Two outfits that analyze more than a thousand children 's products each year checked their data at AP 's request .
Both said their findings of cadmium above 300 parts per million in an item — the current federal limit for lead — increased from about 0.5 percent of tests in 2007 to about 2.2 percent of tests in 2009 .
Those tests were conducted using a technology called XRF , a handheld gun that bounces X - rays off an item to estimate how much lead , cadmium or other elements it contains .
While the results are not as exact as lab testing , the CPSC regularly uses XRF in its product screening .
Much of the increase found by the Michigan - based Healthy Stuff.org came in toys with polyvinyl chloride plastic , according to Jeff Gearhart , the group 's research director .
Both lead and cadmium can be used to fortify PVC against the sun 's rays .
Data collected by a Washington - based company called Essco Safety Check led its president , Seth Goldberg , to suspect that substitution of cadmium for lead partly explains the increase he 's seen .
Lawyers representing the Toy Industry Association of America and the Fashion Jewelry Trade Association said their products are safe and insist cadmium is not widely used .
Sheila A. Millar , a lawyer representing the Fashion Jewelry Trade Association , said jewelry makers often opt for zinc these days .
" While FJTA can only speak to the experience of its members , " Millar wrote in an e-mail , " widespread substitution of cadmium is not something they see . "

Tampa , Florida ( CNN ) --
In addition to diplomacy and sanctions , the United States has developed contingency plans in dealing with Iran 's nuclear facilities , a top U.S. military commander told CNN's Christiane Amanpour .
Gen. David Petraeus , head of U.S. Central Command , did not elaborate on the plans in the interview , to be aired Sunday .
But he said the military has considered the impacts of any action taken there .
" It would be almost literally irresponsible if CENTCOM were not to have been thinking about the various ' what ifs ' and to make plans for a whole variety of different contingencies , " Petraeus told Amanpour at the command 's headquarters in Tampa .
Iran 's nuclear program has become a thorn for the United States and its allies , and Washington has sharpened its tone on dealings over Tehran 's program .
The Islamic republic maintains the program is for peaceful purposes , but the United States and other Western nations fear Iran wants to acquire nuclear weapons .
Israel has called Iran 's nuclear program the major threat facing its nation .
When asked about rumors that Israel could attack Iran 's facilities , Petraeus declined to comment about Israel 's military capabilities .
But when asked about the vulnerability of the facilities , Petraeus said Iran has strengthened the facilities and has enhanced underground tunnels .
Still , the facilities are not bomb - proof .
" Well , they certainly can be bombed , " he said .
" The level of effect would vary with who it is that carries it out , what ordnance they have , and what capability they can bring to bear . "
Iran is holding out on a United Nations - backed deal on its nuclear program that includes enriching uranium .
The country had until the end of 2009 to accept the deal offered by the " P5 plus one " -- permanent U.N. Security Council members Britain , China , France , Russia and the United States , plus Germany .
Instead , Iran countered , giving the West until the end of January to accept its own proposal .
The general said he thinks there is still time for the nations to engage Iran in diplomacy , noting there is no deadline on the enactment of any U.S. contingency plans .
He added , however , that " there 's a period of time , certainly , before all this might come to a head , if you will . "
Christiane Amanpour 's interview with Gen. David Petraeus airs Sunday at 2 p.m. ET on CNN .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - A U.S. peace envoy ’s suggestion that Washington could penalize Israel financially to force it to make concessions to the Palestinians drew Israeli ire on Sunday .
U.S. Middle East envoy George Mitchell reads a statement after his meeting Syria 's President Bashar al - Assad in Damascus July 26 , 2009 .

“ Under American law , the United States can withhold support on loan guarantees to Israel , ” George Mitchell said on U.S. television on Wednesday after being asked about the kind of pressure that could be brought to bear on Israel .
Over the past two decades , Israel has received U.S. guarantees covering billions of dollars in loans , underwriting that has enabled it to raise money overseas more cheaply .
Although such guarantees have slipped in importance and Mitchell made clear in the U.S. public television interview that no sanctions against Israel were being considered , his remarks added more discord to Israeli relations with President Barack Obama ’s White House .
In a statement late on Saturday “ in reaction to media inquiries after Mitchell ’s interview , ” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s office blamed the Palestinians for a peacemaking impasse which the envoy , due back in the region later this month , has been unable to break .
“ Everyone knows that the Palestinian Authority refuses to renew peace talks , while Israel took significant steps to restart the process , ” the statement said .
Speaking to reporters in Jerusalem , visiting U.S. Senators Joe Lieberman and John McCain rejected Mitchell ’s remarks .
“ Any attempt to pressure Israel , to force Israel , to the negotiating table by denying Israel support will not pass the Congress of the United States , ” said Lieberman , an independent .
Republican Senator McCain , who lost the 2008 presidential election to Obama , added : “ We disagree , obviously , with that comment and I am sure that you will see the administration in the future say that is certainly not the administration ’s policy . ”
‘ BOMBSHELL ’
Israeli media seized on Mitchell ’s remarks as reminders of a low point in U.S. - Israeli relations -- President George Bush ’s withholding of $ 10 billion in guarantees in 1991 after Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir refused to freeze settlement expansion .
“ Mitchell ’s threat , ” said the main headline of Israel ’s mass circulation Maariv newspaper , which described the envoy ’s comments as a “ bombshell . ”
Obama and Netanyahu have clashed over the president ’s demand -- since softened -- that Israel halt all settlement activity on land captured in the 1967 war , in line with a 2003 U.S. - backed peace ‘ road map ’ that also called on the Palestinians to rein in militants .
Nabil Abu Rdaineh , a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , rejected the accusation that the Palestinians were to blame for a lack of progress toward a statehood deal .
“ Israel continues settlement building in violation of the road map , ” Abu Rdaineh said .
Under pressure from Obama , Netanyahu imposed a limited , 10 - month moratorium on November 25 on housing starts in West Bank settlements , saying he hoped this would help restart negotiations suspended for the past year .
But he excluded East Jerusalem and nearby annexed areas of the West Bank , and Abbas has not budged from his demand for a complete settlement freeze before talks can resume .
Asked about Mitchell ’s remarks , Israeli Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz called U.S. loan guarantees a “ token of friendship ” but said Israel had no plans to use those available for 2010 and 2011 .
In 2002 , the United States provided a package of $ 9 billion in loan guarantees .
The package included a formula that deducts a dollar of guarantees for every dollar Israel spent on settlement building .
As of December 15 , Israel still had $ 3.148 billion of the guarantees available after issuing $ 4.1 billion in bonds backed by the United States and a $ 1.1 billion deduction for settlement building and concerns over the barrier Israel is building in the West Bank .
まるで季節行事のように、数カ月おきに有名人――たいていは政府や顧客情報を利用して利益を上げている企業の関係者――がプライバシー権を否定する発言をしている。
こうした発言にはいろいろなパターンがある。よくあるのは、「人々がオンラインでどんなふうに情報を共有しているかを見れば、今や彼らがテクノロジーを恐れていないのは明らかだ」というものだ。たいていはこんな言い方になる。「皆がFaceSpacingやTwitTubingでどんなことをしているか見てみるといい。誰もプライバシーに関心を持っていないことが分かる」
プライバシー権に反対するコメントで、もう1つよくあるパターンは、昔ながらの「隠すようなことが何もなければ、プライバシーを心配する必要はない」という言い方だ。これは最近、Googleのエリック・シュミットCEOがMSNBCのインタビューで使った戦術だ。同氏はその中で、オンラインで自分がやっていることを他人に知られたくないのなら、そんなことはするべきではないというようなことを言った（この件については、詳しくは同僚のクリント・ボールトンの記事を読んでほしい）。
要するにシュミット氏は、プライバシーを求めているのは悪いことをしている人だけで、そうでない人はプライバシーのことなんて心配しなくていいと言っているのだ。わたしのコラムを少しでも読んでいる人なら、わたしがこの手の発言にどれほど腹が立つか分かるだろう。
例えばわたしが今日何を食べたかをTwitterに投稿しているからといって、近所のスーパーに冷蔵庫の中を見られたいと思っているわけではない。Facebookのステータスに「具合が良くない」と書いたからといって、ボスに薬箱の中身を見られたいわけではない。日差しを入れるために窓の日よけを上げているからといって、近所の人や警察に家の中をのぞかれたいと思っているわけではない。たとえ何も悪いことをしておらず、ただ寝間着姿で「宇宙空母ギャラクティカ」を見ているだけだとしてもだ。
そして検索エンジンを使っているからといって、その情報を世界中と共有したいわけではない。シュミット氏はまるで、Google Appsなどのサービスに興味を持っている企業に対して、使わない方がいいと言っているようだ。わたしが企業ユーザーなら、他人に知られたくない機密情報をたくさん持っているからだ。
傷 口に塩を塗るかのように、Facebookは最近、プライバシー設定を「改善」した。多くの点でプライバシーを弱体化させるようなやり方で。個々の投稿を管理できるのは確かにいいが、その一方でFacebook APIとプロフィールを共有しない設定など、幾つかのセキュリティオプションがなくなっている。
わたしにとって一番いら立たしいのは、 「 フレンドリストを友人には見せるが、Google検索でわたしのプロフィールを見つけた人には見せない」オプションをFacebookがなくしたことだ。プライバシー反対派は、「大したことじゃないだろう。たかがフレンドリストじゃないか」と言うだろう。それにはこう答えたい。「誰がわたしの友だちなのか、友だちじゃない人には関係ないだろう」と（Facebookはその後この問題を「修正」したと発表したが、実際には直っていない。フレンドリストを全体に公開するか、誰にも見せないか選ばせるだけだ）。
ほかの記者も指摘している通り、Googleのシュミット氏の発言は、数年前の一件を考えるとちょっとした皮肉だ。CNETがGoogle検索で見つけたシュミット氏の個人情報を記事に載せ、同氏がGoogle社員にCNETの記者と1年間話をしないよう命じたという事件だ。
CNETがシュミット氏の給料や自宅の住所などの個人情報を掲載したとき、同氏はきっとこんなふうに反応したはずだ。「こんな情報を載せるなんて、何をやっているのか分かってるのか？
おまえたちには関係ないじゃないか！」
エリック、まさしくそれが、わたしの言いたいことなのだ。
このような有名人のプライバシー不要論で一番憂慮すべきなのは、おそらくは定期的にこういう話が出てくることだろう。「みんなが信じるようになるくらいに、何度も何度も主張する」というのが、特別な利害関係者や政党、扇動家のお気に入りの作戦だということは誰もが知っている。
プライバシーは死んだと何度も言えば、皆がプライバシーを気にしないようになる――そんなふうに期待している人がいるような気がしている。
There 's a new camera category in town .
It 's EVIL , and it 's going to kick your DSLR 's ass .
EVIL stands for Electronic Viewfinder Interchangeable Lens , and is our favorite acronym for cameras like the Olympus Pen , the Lumix GF1 and the Samsung NX10 .
These small , mirrorless , finderless cameras can fit in a pocket and outperform bulky DSLRs .
Here 's why your next camera will probably be EVIL .
They 're Small
DSLRs are bulky .
Their design comes from the film days when the only way to see the exact image that would hit the film was to divert the light coming through the lens with a mirror and send it to a viewfinder .
This mirror meant the body needed to be deep , and the lenses – further away from the film than those in a mirrorless rangefinder – were also bigger .
Now we can see what the sensor sees either on a screen , or through an electronic finder .
With the mirror gone , the body can be a lot smaller , just like a compact digicam .
This means you can carry it with you everywhere , fit it in a jacket pocket and be ready for * that * picture , wherever you are .
They Take Great Pictures
The trick with the new EVIL cams is that they have large sensors .
In the case of the Samsung NX10 , this sensor is the same size as you 'd find in a DSLR , and the others use the Micro Four Thirds format , a sensor which is half the size of a 35 mm frame , but a lot bigger than the pinkie - nail - sized sensor in a typical compact .
This gives the high image quality and low - light sensitivity of a DSLR .
And because they have large sensors , the depth of field is shallower , and you can throw a distracting background out of focus .
For most people , that is more than good enough .
You Can Change Lenses
Let 's be honest .
If you 're not a pro , you probably bought your fancy DSLR , fixed on the kit zoom lens , and that was it .
You probably spend 90 percent , if not all of your time , shooting with this on your camera .
With an EVIL camera , you can do this too .
It 's more likely though , given the tiny pocket - sized lenses for these cameras , that you will actually carry them with you .
Better still , with an adapter you can use all your current DSLR lenses on the newer , smaller body .
They 're Fast
Compacts have lost out to DSLRs by being slow .
Slow to power up , slow to zoom and slow to actually respond to your trigger finger .
EVIL cameras have fixed this , and are as responsive as any entry - level DSLR .
Watch out which model you go for , though .
The current generation still has some trouble focusing as fast as a bigger camera , although some models , like the Panasonic GF1 , have this nailed .
They Don't Scream " Look at Me "
With a smaller camera , you can blend in .
With an EVIL camera , you can blend in and still get great shots .
This combination of size and quality was the reason the Leica M series was the camera of choice for both street shooters and war reporters , from Henri Cartier Bresson to Sebastião Salgado .
And because there is no mirror to flip , they 're quiet , too .
The Con
As a new category , the EVIL is still relatively expensive , and you 'll pay as much for a body and lens as you would for a prosumer level DSLR .
For many , even pros , the size difference alone is enough to justify this .
For everyone else , you could wait until the likes of Canon and Nikon inevitably enter this sector .
Then prices will start to fall , and things will get really interesting .
Unless you have a specific use that these cameras can't meet , or you need the very highest level of performance only a Canon 1D or Nikon D3 can bring , you have no reason to buy a DSLR .
Instead , consider being EVIL .
You might like it .

Seedlings of a North American species of shade - loving Impatiens .
The plants reacted mildly with other offspring from the same mother plant , but when planted among non -kin shifted extra resources into growing leaves .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Plants do n't mind sharing space with their kin but when they 're potted with strangers of the same species they start invigorating their leaves , a study by McMaster University reveals .
The research , which appears in the current issue of the American Journal of Botany , suggests non -kin plants will not only compete underground for soil nutrients , but will attempt to muscle out the competition above ground in the ongoing struggle for light .
It follows previous research from McMaster University which found that plants can recognize their kin through root systems and will compete more strongly for soil nutrients and water with non-sibling plants .
" This is the first study that shows plants are responding to kin at the above ground level , " explains Guillermo Murphy , lead author of the study and a graduate student in the Department of Biology at McMaster University .
" When they recognize their kin , they grow differently in shape , taller , with more branches and fewer resources into leaves , therefore allowing their siblings to access precious sunlight . "
When researchers planted seedlings of a North American species of shade - loving Impatiens in the same pot , they reacted mildly with other offspring from the same mother plant .
But when planted among non-kin of the same species , the plants shift extra resources into growing leaves .
" This supports previous research that plants are capable of complex social behaviour and will exhibit altruistic behaviour , giving their siblings a competitive edge in the wild , " says Murphy .
In a previous study , led by Susan Dudley , associate professor of biology at McMaster , the Great Lakes sea rocket or Cakile edentula , which flourishes on beaches , showed altruistic behavior among its kin at the root level .
When nearby strangers were detected , the sea rocket shifted resources to roots , fighting for precious water and soil nutrients .
This all makes sense on an ecological level , says Murphy .
Sea rockets would have easy access to sunlight in its natural beach habitat and therefore , would struggle for nutrients underground .
Conversely , Impatiens thrive in the shady woodlands , where moisture is plentiful , but sunlight is scarce .
The roots seem to tell siblings from strangers , he says , whether the change in behaviour is above or below ground .
But simply placing them beside one another , in separate pots , did not produce the same results .
In the lab , researchers germinated the seeds from Impatiens collected in the field , to ensure they were properly grouped by sibling and non-siblings .

Scientists at the Stanford University School of Medicine have succeeded in transforming mouse skin cells in a laboratory dish directly into functional nerve cells with the application of just three genes .
The cells make the change without first becoming a pluripotent type of stem cell -- a step long thought to be required for cells to acquire new identities .
The finding could revolutionize the future of human stem cell therapy and recast our understanding of how cells choose and maintain their specialties in the body .
" We actively and directly induced one cell type to become a completely different cell type , " said Marius Wernig , MD , assistant professor of pathology and a member of Stanford 's Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine .
" These are fully functional neurons .
They can do all the principal things that neurons in the brain do . "
That includes making connections with and signaling to other nerve cells -- critical functions if the cells are eventually to be used as therapy for Parkinson 's disease or other disorders .
Wernig is the senior author of the research , which is published online in Nature .
Graduate student Thomas Vierbuchen is the lead author .
Although previous research has suggested that it 's possible to coax specialized cells to exhibit some properties of other cell types , this is the first time that skin cells have been converted into fully functional neurons in a laboratory dish .
The change happened within a week and with an efficiency of up to nearly 20 percent .
The researchers are now working to duplicate the feat with human cells .
" This study is a huge leap forward , " said Irving Weissman , MD , director of Stanford 's Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine .
" The direct reprogramming of these adult skin cells into brain cells that can show complex , appropriate behaviors like generating electrical currents and forming synapses establishes a new method to study normal and disordered brain cell function .
Finally we may be able to capture and study conditions like Parkinson's or Alzheimer 's or heritable mental diseases in the laboratory dish for the first time . "
Until recently , it 's been thought that cellular specialization , or differentiation , was a one - way path : pluripotent embryonic stem cells give rise to all the cell types in the body , but as the daughter cells become more specialized , they also become more biologically isolated .
Like a tree trunk splitting first into branches and then into individual leaves , the cells were believed to be consigned to one developmental fate by physical modifications -- called epigenetic changes -- added to their DNA along the way .
A skin cell could no more become a nerve cell than a single leaf could flit from branch to branch .
advertisement
That view began to change when Dolly the sheep was cloned from an adult cell in 1997 , showing that , under certain conditions , a specialized cell could shed these restrictions and act like an embryonic stem cell .
And in 2007 , researchers announced the creation of induced pluripotent stem cells , or iPS cells , from human skin cells by infecting them with four stem - cell - associated proteins called transcription factors .
Once the cells had achieved a pluripotent state , the researchers coaxed them to develop into a new cell type .
The process was often described in concept as moving the skin cells backward along the differentiation pathway ( in the leaves analogy , reversing down the branch to the tree 's trunk ) and then guiding them forward again along a different branch into a new lineage .
Finally , in 2008 , Doug Melton , PhD , a co-director of Harvard 's Stem Cell Institute , showed it was possible in adult mice to reprogram one type of cell in the pancreas to become another pancreatic cell type by infecting them with a pool of viruses expressing just three transcription factors .
As a result , Wernig , who as a postdoctoral fellow in Rudolf Jaenisch 's laboratory at the Whitehead Institute in Massachusetts participated in the initial development of iPS cells , began to wonder whether the pluripotent pit stop was truly necessary .
Thomas Südhof , the Avram Goldstein Professor in the Stanford School of Medicine , also collaborated on the research .
To test the theory , Wernig , Vierbuchen and graduate student Austin Ostermeier amassed a panel of 19 genes involved in either epigenetic reprogramming or neural development and function .
They used a virus called a lentivirus to infect skin cells from embryonic mice with the genes , and then monitored the cells ' response .
After 32 days they saw that some of the former skin cells now looked like neural cells and expressed neural proteins .
advertisement
The researchers , which included postdoctoral scholar Zhiping Pang , PhD , used a mix - and - match approach to winnow the original pool of 19 genes down to just three .
They also tested the procedure on skin cells from the tails of adult mice .
They found that about 20 percent of the former skin cells transformed into neural cells in less than a week .
That may not , at first , sound like a quick change , but it is vast improvement over iPS cells , which can take weeks .
What 's more , the iPS process is very inefficient : Usually only about 1 to 2 percent of the original cells become pluripotent .
In Wernig 's experiments , the cells not only looked like neurons , they also expressed neural proteins and even formed functional synapses with other neurons in laboratory dish .
" We were very surprised by both the timing and the efficiency , " said Wernig .
" This is much more straightforward than going through iPS cells , and it 's likely to be a very viable alternative . "
Quickly making neurons from a specific patient may allow researchers to study particular disease processes such as Parkinson 's in a laboratory dish , or one day to even manufacture cells for therapy .
The research suggests that the pluripotent stage , rather than being a required touchstone for identity - shifting cells , may simply be another possible cellular state .
Wernig speculates that finding the right combination of cell - fate - specific genes may trigger a domino effect in the recipient cell , wiping away restrictive DNA modifications and imprinting a new developmental fate on the genomic landscape .
" It may be hard to prove , " said Wernig , " but I no longer think that the induction of iPS cells is a reversal of development .
It 's probably more of a direct conversion like what we 're seeing here , from one cell type to another that just happens to be more embryonic - like .
This tips our ideas about epigenetic regulation upside down . "
Additional Stanford researchers involved in the study include research assistant Yuko Kokubu .
The research was supported by Stanford 's Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine , the Donald E. and Delia B. Baxter Foundation , the William Stinehart Jr. and the Reed Foundation , and the National Institutes of Health .
The researchers have recently applied for a patent on the technique .
Why do Santa ’s reindeer fly ?
The role of ancient mushroom - using shamans
by Mark Adams
These red and white mushrooms , Amanita muscaria , were found in an alpine forest around Creede , Colorado .
A. muscaria was the “ sacred mushroom ” used by the ancient tribal peoples of pre-Christian northern Europe .
Its bright coloring suggests the colors of Santa ’s garments and of holiday lights .
Although most people see Christmas as a Christian holiday , most of the symbols and icons we associate with Christmas celebrations are actually derived from the shamanistic traditions of the tribal peoples of pre-Christian northern Europe .
The sacred mushroom of these people was the red and white Amanita muscaria , also known as “ fly agaric . ”
This mushroom commonly is seen in books of fairy tales and usually is associated with magic and fairies .
It contains potent hallucinogenic compounds once used by ancient peoples for insight and transcendental experiences .
Most of the major elements of the modern Christmas celebration , such as Santa Claus , Christmas trees , magical reindeer and the giving of gifts , are originally based upon the traditions surrounding the harvest and consumption of this most sacred mushroom .
The World Tree
Ancient peoples , including the Lapps of modern - day Finland , and the Koyak tribes of the central Russian steppes , believed in the idea of a World Tree .
The World Tree was seen as a kind of cosmic axis onto which the planes of the universe are fixed .
The roots of the World Tree stretch down into the underworld , its trunk is the “ middle earth ” of everyday existence , and its branches reach upwards into the heavenly realm .
Amanita muscaria grows only under certain types of trees , mostly firs and evergreens .
The cap of the mushroom is the fruit of the larger mycelium beneath the soil which exists in a symbiotic relationship with the roots of the tree .
To ancient people , this mushroom was literally “ the fruit of the tree . ”
The North Star was also considered sacred , since all other stars in the sky revolved around its fixed point .
They associated this “ Pole Star ” with the World Tree and the central axis of the universe .
The top of the World Tree touched the North Star , and the spirit of the shaman would climb the metaphorical tree , thereby passing into the realm of the gods .
This is the true meaning of the star on top of the modern Christmas tree , and also the reason that the super - shaman Santa makes his home at the North Pole .
Ancient peoples were amazed at how this magical mushroom sprang from the earth without any visible seed .
They considered this “ virgin birth ” to have been the result of the morning dew , which was seen as the “ semen of the deity . ”
The silver tinsel we drape onto our modern Christmas tree represents this divine fluid .
Origin of phrase , “ to get pissed ”
The active ingredients of A. muscaria are not metabolized by the body , and so they remain active in the urine .
In fact , it is safer to drink the urine of one who has consumed the mushroom than to eat the mushroom directly , as many of the toxic compounds are processed and eliminated on the first pass through the body .
It was common practice among ancient people to recycle the potent effects of the mushroom by drinking each other ’s urine .
The mushroom ’s ingredients can remain potent even after six passes through the human body .
Some scholars argue that this is the origin of the phrase “ to get pissed , ” as this urine - drinking activity preceded alcohol by thousands of years .
Reindeer were the sacred animals of these semi-nomadic people , as the reindeer provided food , shelter , clothing and other necessities .
Reindeer are also fond of eating the mushroom ; they will seek it out , then prance about while under its influence .
Often the urine of tripped - out reindeer would be consumed for its psychedelic effects .
This effect goes the other way too , as reindeer also enjoy the urine of a human , especially one who has consumed the mushroom .
In fact , reindeer will seek out human urine to drink , and some tribesmen carry sealskin containers of their own collected piss , which they use to attract stray reindeer back into the herd .
Legend of the flying reindeer and modern image of Santa
The effects of the A. muscaria usually include sensations of size distortion and flying .
The feeling of flying could account for the legends of flying reindeer and legends of shamanic journeys included stories of winged reindeer , transporting their riders up to the highest branches of the World Tree .
Although the modern image of Santa Claus was created at least in part by the advertising department of Coca - Cola , in truth his appearance , clothing , mannerisms and companions all mark him as the reincarnation of these ancient mushroom - gathering shamans .
One of the side effects of eating A. muscaria is that one ’s skin and facial features take on a flushed , ruddy glow .
This is why Santa is always shown with glowing red cheeks and nose .
Even Santa ’s jolly “ Ho , ho , ho ! ” is the euphoric laugh of one who has indulged in the magic fungus .
Santa also dresses like a mushroom gatherer .
When it was time to go out and harvest the magical mushroom , the ancient shamans would dress much like Santa , wearing red and white fur - trimmed coats and long black boots .
These peoples lived in dwellings made of birch and reindeer hide , called “ yurts . ”
Somewhat similar to a tee - pee , the yurt ’s central smoke - hole is often also used as an entrance .
After gathering the mushroom from under the sacred trees where they appeared , the shamans would fill their sacks and return home .
Climbing down the chimney - entrances , they would share out the mushroom ’s gifts with those within .
The mushroom needs to be dried before being consumed ; the drying process reduces the mushroom ’s toxicity while increasing its potency .
The shaman would guide the group in stringing the mushrooms they gathered and hanging them around the hearth - fire to dry .
This tradition is echoed in the modern stringing of popcorn and other items .
The psychedelic journeys taken under the influence of the amanita were also symbolized by a stick reaching up through the smoke - hole in the top of the yurt .
The smoke - hole was the portal where the spirit of the shaman exited the physical plane .
Santa ’s famous magical journey , where his sleigh takes him around the whole planet in a single night , is developed from the “ heavenly chariot , ” used by the gods from whom Santa and other shamanic figures are descended .
The chariot of Odin , Thor and even the Egyptian god Osiris is now known as the Big Dipper , which circles around the North Star in a 24 - hour period .
In different versions of the ancient story , the chariot was pulled by reindeer or horses .
As the animals grew exhausted , their mingled spit and blood falls to the ground , forming the mushrooms .
St Nicholas and Old Nick
Saint Nicholas is a legendary figure who supposedly lived during the fourth century .
His cult spread quickly and Nicholas became the patron saint of many varied groups , including judges , pawnbrokers , criminals , merchants , sailors , bakers , travelers , the poor , and children .
Most religious historians agree that St Nicholas did not actually exist as a real person but was instead a Christianized version of earlier Pagan gods .
Nicholas ’ legends were mainly created out of stories about the Teutonic god called Hold Nickar , known as Poseidon to the Greeks .
This powerful sea god was known to gallop through the sky during the winter solstice , granting boons to his worshippers below .
When the Catholic Church created the character of St Nicholas , they took his name from “ Nickar ” and gave him Poseidon ’s title of “ the Sailor . ”
There are thousands of churches named in St Nicholas ’ honor , most of which were converted from temples to Poseidon and Hold Nickar .
( As the ancient pagan deities were demonized by the Christian church , Hold Nickar ’s name also became associated with Satan , known as “ Old Nick ! ” )
Local traditions were incorporated into the new Christian holidays to make them more acceptable to the new converts .
To these early Christians , Saint Nicholas became a sort of “ super - shaman ” who was overlaid upon their own shamanic cultural practices .
Many images of Saint Nicholas from these early times show him wearing red and white , or standing in front of a red background with white spots , the design of the mushroom .
St Nicholas also adopted some of the qualities of the legendary “ Grandmother Befana ” from Italy , who filled children ’s stockings with gifts .
Her shrine at Bari , Italy , became a shrine to St Nicholas .
True spirit of Christmas
By better understanding the truths within these popular celebrations , we can better understand the modern world , and our place in it .
Many people in the modern world have rejected Christmas as being too commercial , claiming that this ritual of giving is actually a celebration of materialism and greed .
Yet the true spirit of this winter festival lies not in the exchange of plastic toys , but in celebrating a gift from the earth : the fruiting top of a magical mushroom , and the revelatory experiences it can provide .
Instead of perpetuating outdated and confusing holiday myths , it might be more fulfilling to return to the original source of these seasonal celebrations .
How about getting back to basics and enjoying some magical mushrooms with your loved ones this holiday season ?
What better gift can a family share than a little piece of love and enlightenment ?
Below are references providing more in depth background on the role of mushrooms in the beginnings of some of our holiday traditions .

Another big defense contractor , Northrop Grumman , is moving its headquarters to the Washington , D.C. , area , where rivals Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics have shown the advantage of close proximity to the Pentagon , the White House and Capitol Hill .
Northrop Grumman HQ to D.C. area
Another big defense contractor , Northrop Grumman , is moving its headquarters to the Washington area , where rivals Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics have shown the advantage of close proximity to the Pentagon , the White House and Capitol Hill .
Northrop Grumman ’s announcement that it will relocate from Los Angeles by 2011 comes in the middle of a hard - fought competition with Boeing , another rival , over an Air Force contract for aerial refueling tankers worth $ 35 billion .
The Air Force is expected to issue final bid specifications for the planes sometime this month .

Positioning Northrop close to where decisions about defense are made is critical for the company ’s success , according to Loren Thompson , the chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute .
“ It ’s time for Northrop to put its culture of being an outsider behind it .
It still behaves like a company that is alien to Washington a lot of the time , ” Thompson said , noting that Lockheed and General Dynamics have both been more successful .
“ There ’s a lesson there . ”
As the defense industry has shrunk , all of the contractors began to look more and more alike , and it was only a matter of time , Thompson said , before management sought a geographical edge .
“ How well are you going to know the Obama team from several thousand miles away ? ” Thompson said .
Thompson noted that another big contractor , SAIC , recently moved its corporate offices from San Diego to Virginia — a change he said he recommended to Northrop executives years ago .
Northrop has exerted its influence by aggressive lobbying , outspending its larger rivals Lockheed Martin and Boeing by more than $ 25 million between 1998 and 2008 , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
The move involves only about 300 of the company ’s 120,000 employees , according to the company ’s statement but bolsters Northrop ’s already - large presence in the region .
It is one of the top employers in Virginia — putting to work more than 16,000 people , with massive operations in Newport News .
Northrop ’s Electronic Systems is based in Baltimore , and the company employs more than 10,000 in Maryland .
“ As a global security company with a large customer base in the Washington , D.C. , region , this move will enable us to better serve our nation and customers , ” said Wes Bush , the company ’s chief executive officer and president .
Correction :
An earlier version of this story used the wrong figures from the Center for Responsive Politics .

That is , the case for single payer that some libertarians could also support — and that 's because it's also the case for radical deregulation of the health care sector .
The trick , as Arnold Kling argues , is to do both :
I would like to see more experiments and more variety .
Instead of having a big national contest over what health care system , why not try single - payer in one part of the country and radical deregulation in another ?
Switzerland , which is about the size of Maryland , has different health care systems in each of its 20 - odd cantons , which are about the size of Maryland counties .
Surely it must be possible to try different health care approaches in Texas and Massachusetts .
I 'm obviously wary of socializing medical payment , even at the state or local level .
But given the opportunity to see single payer compete against a genuinely deregulated market , I 'm pretty sure I 'd bite .
And I suspect a lot of single payer supporters would too .
But that sort of political competition is n't in the cards .
Instead we 're stuck with a broken , compromised system in which neither side gets what they want :
On one hand , the government controls nearly half of all medical spending , but failures get blamed on the free market .
On the other hand , those who want to sweep away the current system and socialize medical insurance get stuck with messy legislative compromises larded with handouts for special interests .
You could make the Beltway centrist 's case that this is a good thing — that political systems should n't cater to extremes .
But in this instance , we 've got a system that 's catering to almost no one .
And in the meantime , we 're stifling innovation and experimentation on both ends of the political spectrum .
The President pledges to rein the deficit , citing three specific steps to this end .
He praises the Senate for restoring the pay - as - you - go law , discusses his proposal for a freeze in discretionary spending , and calls for a bipartisan Fiscal Commission to hammer out further concrete deficit reduction proposals .
An interesting recurring fact of human history is the endless supply of doomsayers .
One would think that this large supply would drive the price ( wages ) of these prophets of doom to zero .
But from Isaiah to Al Gore , we see that this is not so .
We are left to conclude one of two things : either economic theory is wrong ; or there exists a large persistent demand for doom and gloom .
Naturally , I prefer the latter interpretation .
But if so , then evidently , we like having the shit scared out of us .
I ’m not sure why this is the case , but if so , the phenomenon deserves study .
Most of you are likely too young to remember the hysteria created by the Club of Rome in their 1972 report The Limits to Growth .
Not sure what ever happened to these bozos .
I remember my grade 3 teacher announcing to my class that at current rates of air pollution , the world was destined to run out of oxygen in 10 years ( 1980 ) .
I spent the rest of that afternoon trying to design an oxygen tent that might save my family from this impending disaster .
Today , I ’m sure that students would be well - versed in the technique of sequestering government “ stimulus money ” to finance the endeavor .
But then my attention was turned to a more pressing issue : the coming ice age ; see Newsweek 1975 The Cooling World .
Back then , meterologists ( aka the experts ) were convinced that the globe was cooling ; and that disaster loomed on the short horizon .
While no one was sure of what was causing the cooling trend , there was a strong suspicion that industrialization ( aka capitalism run amok ) had something to do with it .
All that pollution blocking the sun ’s rays ; and so on .
Fortunately , we did n’t have to worry about global cooling for long ; it was soon supplanted by a much more pressing concern : Acid Rain .
The culprit ?
You guessed it : industrialization .
Never heard of acid rain ?
Do n’t worry about it .
The latest , of course , is global warming … oops , I mean “ Climate Change . ”
The climate changing …imagine that .
The culprit ?
Do I even have to ask ?
How are we to understand all of this ?
H.L. Menken had this to say : “ The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed ( and hence clamorous to be led to safety ) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins , all of them imaginary . ”
One of my colleagues ( Charles Crawford ) had this to say : “ Why is there such zeal for belief in global warming ?
I think that it taps into many different sources of the desire for power .
Some think it will allow regulation of the evil capitalist system .
Others see opportunities for new capitalist opportunities .
Some feel it will put a crimp in the style of rising economics , such as China .
Others with Puritan sentiments find it satisfying .
It would be interesting to explore the desires for power that encourage belief in global warming . ”
Another one of my colleagues ( John Heaney ) offers this : “ Guilt , as a feeling merited or unmerited , reduces a natural inclination to oppose bogus authority .
It is amazing that more or less random unwarranted associations suffices to produce this feeling with effect .
Climate justice , climate debt , climate reparations , climate colonialism .
Almost certainly , these slogans , will be the permanent legacy of Copenhagen .
So why worry about the science ? ”
I like this letter to the editor of the Economist Magazine , Dec 12 , 2009 by Paul Reiter : “ Sir– Passion is the root problem in what you term ‘ the modern argument over climate change ’ .
( ‘ A heated debate ’ , November 28th ) .
You state for instance , that the ‘ majority of the world ’s scientists have convinced themselves ’ that human activity is the cause of climate change .
I know of no poll that confirms this , but your choice of words is telling .
In science , our interpretations of nature are based on observation , experiment and evidence , not self - conviction .
Those of us who are dismissed , often derided , as sceptics have waited a long time for the chicanery behind the global - warming movement to come to light .
But we should not blame scientists –however unprincipled –nor UN organizations , nor national governments .
The true culprits are latter - day Nostradamuses , who , under their icons of cuddly pandas and polar bears , have misused science to stoke fear , guilt and a craving for atonement in the minds of the public .
Governments have been browbeaten to respond to these catastophists , and some scientists , dependent on public money , have fashioned their behaviour accordingly .
Nikolay Semyonov , a Soviet scientist and Nobel prize winner in chemistry , wrote that : ‘ There is nothing more dangerous than blind passion in science .
This is a direct path to unjustified self - confidence , to loss of self - cricalness , to scientific fanatacism , to false science .
Given support from someone in power , it can lead to suppression of true science , and since science is now a matter of state importance , to inflicting great injury on the country . ’
Semyonov was referring to the ruthless manipulation of Soviet science by Trofim Lysenko and other opportunists .
In a similar vein , it is time we recognize that we are becoming prey to a new fanaticism , a religious fervour that runs contrary to rational society . ”
Leigh Palmer notes that “ It should be noted that Paul Reiter ( of the Pasteur Institute in Paris ) is a respected scientist and a former lead author for the IPCC assessments .
He left the process and had his name removed as an author because the IPCC had published scientific misinformation regarding malaria in the second and third assessment reports .
He had quite a battle with the officials of the IPCC over this and his story bears listening to .
You can hear him tell this story in his own words here .
His story is not entirely unique , as other lead authors and lead reviewers * have resigned from the IPCC process for very similar reasons .
The IPCC has a mission .
It was formed by the UN pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to gather evidence linking anthropogenic atmospheric carbon dioxide to harmful effects on the world ’s human population .
In effect the IPCC is a prosecutor in a criminal proceeding with copious resources at its command to prove carbon dioxide guilty .
The prosecutorial metaphor fails , however , because there is no institutional defense .
Carbon dioxide is being tried by a modern Inquisition . ”
I am inclined to agree with these assessments .
Not that this makes me feel any better .
I think we can all agree that we would prefer to live in a cleaner world ; and that it is desirable that society takes steps toward meeting this worthy goal .
Why do many influential people feel the need to resort to scare tactics and bullying to achieve this goal ( assuming that this is their goal ) ?
And why do so many of us fall for it , time and time again ?

Cross -Domain AJAX for XMPP HTTP Binding Made Easy
January 19 , 2010
Fabio Forno recently asked me to help him debug a weird issue with browsers sending OPTIONS requests when using Strophe.js .
After digging in a little , I realized that this was the browser checking for authorization to do cross -domain AJAX requests according to the W3C ’s Cross - Origin Resource Sharing ( CORS ) recommendation .
If you ’ve never heard of CORS before ( I had n’t ) , it is how modern browsers request and receive authorization for doing cross -domain HTTP requests .
In other words , it makes modern browsers able to do cross - domain requests without Flash , without proxies , and without other crazy hacks .
: EXTENDED :
I went about testing this support in the browsers and found that Firefox 3.5 and up , Safari , and Chrome all support CORS .
IE , of course , does not support this , but it looks like IE8 has a secondary XMLHttpRequest object that does support CORS .
I ’ll have to investigate further .
Furthermore , since CORS is simply information communicated via HTTP headers , no changes are necessary to any code except to existing BOSH connection managers .
The implementation is so trivial , I was able to quickly develop patches for both ejabberd ( patch in bug EJAB - 1168 ) and Punjab ( patch in bug # 26 ) .
The BOSH connection manager I run as a testing service at http://bosh.metajack.im:5280/xmpp-httpbind is already running the new CORS - enabled code .
Using CORS from Strophe
Using CORS from Strophe is extremely simple .
Just set your BOSH service URL to the full domain , port , and path of the BOSH connection manager .
For example , http://bosh.metajack.im:5280/xmpp-httpbind .
Firefox , Safari , and Chrome will be able to do cross - domain requests without any issues since the connection manager will return the right CORS headers to allow the requests .
I still need to add some detection for this support and fallback to something else when it is not found , but I think it is already extremely useful .
For example , XMPP web application development for the iPhone is now extremely easy .
How CORS Works
CORS works very similarly to Flash ’s crossdomain.xml file .
Basically , the browser will send a cross -domain request to a service , setting the HTTP header Origin to the requesting server .
The service includes a few headers like Access - Control - Allow - Origin to indicate whether such a request is allowed .
For the BOSH connection managers , it is enough to specify that all origins are allowed , by setting the value of Access - Control - Allow - Origin to * .
The Content - Type header must also be white - listed in the Access - Control - Allow - Headers header .
Finally , for certain types of requests , including BOSH connection manager requests , the permissions check will be pre-flighted .
The browser will do an OPTIONS request and expect to get back some HTTP headers that indicate which origins are allowed , which methods are allowed , and how long this authorization will last .
For example , here is what the Punjab and ejabberd patches I did return for OPTIONS :
Access - Control - Allow - Origin : * Access - Control - Allow - Methods : GET , POST , OPTIONS Access - Control - Allow - Headers : Content - Type Access - Control - Max - Age : 86400
You can learn more about CORS either at the excellent HTTP Access Control article at developer .
mozilla.org or by reading the CORS recommendation .
I hope to convince all the major BOSH implementations to support this as well .
Hopefully within a short period , we can eliminate the need for annoying proxies , Flash , or browser hacks .
SINGAPORE , Dec 1 ( Reuters Life ! ) - Loneliness , like the flu , is contagious , U.S. research shows .
It can spread among groups of people and women are more likely than men to become " infected " , according to researchers at the University of Chicago , the University of California - San Diego and Harvard .
Using data from a large - scale study , they found lonely people tend to transmit their sad feelings to those around them , which eventually led to them being isolated from society .
" We detected an extraordinary pattern of contagion that leads people to be moved to the edge of the social network when they become lonely , " said University of Chicago psychologist John Cacioppo , a leading U.S. expert on loneliness .
The findings were published in the December issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .
Before losing their friends , lonely people transmit feelings of loneliness to their remaining friends , who also become lonely .
" On the periphery people have fewer friends , yet their loneliness leads them to losing the few ties they have left , " Cacioppo said .
" These reinforcing effects mean that our social fabric can fray at the edges , like a yarn that comes loose at the end of a crocheted sweater , " Cacioppo added .
Because loneliness is associated with mental and physical diseases that can shorten life , Cacioppo said it is important for people to recognize loneliness and help those affected before they move away to the edges .
For the study , the team examined records of the Framingham Heart Study , which originally studied the risks of cardiovascular disease for more than 5,000 people since 1948 .
The study has since been expanded , and its second generation , which includes another 5,124 people , was the focus of the loneliness research .
The study showed that as people become lonely , they become less trustful of others , and a cycle develops that makes it harder for them to form friendships .
Societies seem to develop a natural tendency to shed these lonely people , something that is mirrored in tests of monkeys , Cacioppo said , adding that this makes it all the more important to recognise loneliness and deal with it before it spreads .

The once secret life of a huge , recently discovered species of manta ray has been unveiled .
Biologist Dr Andrea Marshall has discovered that the giant fish , which she first described as new to science last year , undertakes huge journeys .
As well as making the longest migration known across the Indian Ocean , the fish gathers in large numbers to feed and survives attacks by sharks .
The behaviour is revealed in the BBC documentary series Natural World .
Growing up to 7 m wide , manta rays are the largest living ray in the ocean and one of the largest of all fish .
Previously , it was thought there was just one species of manta ray , known by the scientific name Manta birostris .
But the more Dr Marshall swam with them , the more she noticed how different manta rays that frequent reefs and the open ocean are , both in their behaviour and markings .
Mantas evolved from sting rays , and it was thought they had lost their sting .
Mysterious giants
But Dr Marshall has found that the larger ocean - going mantas have retained a vestigial sting on their tails , proving that the two are separate species .
In July last year , she announced the discovery that there are not one but two species of manta ray at the American Elasmobranch Society 's annual conference in Montreal , Canada .
The larger giant mantas retain the name Manta birostris , while the reef - going mantas have been newly named Manta alfredi , in tribute to Alfred Whitley who first scientifically described manta rays in the 1930s .
However , Dr Marshall 's studies have uniquely revealed a host of manta ray behaviours .
The rays sometimes swim across the ocean floor , skimming the reefs with their mouths , a behaviour filmed by the camera crew for the first time .
Usually the fish feed on plankton , but what they feed on when skimming is unclear .
Dr Marshall studies manta rays off the coast of Tofo in southern Mozambique .
It was always thought that manta rays stayed in shallow waters .

Advertisement But Dr Marshall has discovered that the larger giant species of manta ray dives deeply , and migrates 700 miles ( 1,100 km ) in just 60 days to the Maldives , the longest migration known for a fish living in the Indian Ocean .
In the Maldives , researchers have also uncovered a unique gathering place of reef mantas , where hundreds of the fish gather .
Around 80 % of the fish are female , with many pregnant , suggesting the area is a critical breeding site for the species .
Studies by Dr Marshall and colleague Dr Simon Pierce of the Manta Ray and Whale Shark Research Centre based at Tofo Beach in southern Mozambique have also revealed that manta rays living off
Tofo bear huge scars inflicted by large sharks .
Manta rays appear capable of surviving such attacks and will queue up to have their wounds tended by cleaner fish , which nibble at the wound to remove dead tissue and prevent infection .
Dr Marshall 's studies have also revealed new aspects to the fishes ' reproduction .
Many male mantas follow a single female , mirroring her behaviour in a bid to attract her as a mate .
Females , which give birth to a single pup after a 12 - month gestation , rarely give birth in consecutive years , Dr Marshall has found .
That extremely slow reproduction could place the fish in danger from overfishing , both for subsistence and for export to be used in traditional Chinese medicines .
" Andrea : Queen of the Mantas " will be broadcast on BBC Two at 2000GMT on Wednesday 11 November as part of the BBC Natural World documentary series .

A new hope ?
THE sign for the American Beauty Electric Iron building in Detroit has only five letters left , spaced far apart in a gap - toothed grin .
The building itself is empty except for a few trees .
Across the street , however , a building buzzes .
TechTown , a project of Detroit 's Wayne State University , offers classes , offices and other support for entrepreneurs of all kinds .
Jarrett Erwin wants to expand his painting business .
Robert Brooks , a former engineer at Ford , wants to start a consultancy for non-profits .
In a state whose economy has shattered , TechTown is one of many attempts to start anew .
It is a daunting task .
Michigan was once a Canaan , rich with jobs in the car industry .
“ Detroit is the largest city of opportunity in the world , ” declared a city directory in the mid-1920s .
In 2010 Michigan is America 's most vivid portrait of despair , with an unemployment rate of 14.7 % , almost five points above the national average .
The state is not short of ideas .
From Detroit 's grey streets to the lovely bays along the Great Lakes , it teems with plans for future prosperity .
However , recovery is only a distant goal .
The interim will be full of hope and disappointment .
The national recession began in December 2007 and has probably now ended .
Michigan , its fate yoked to that of carmakers , must observe its own dismal calendar .
The state has lost jobs in every year since the middle of 2000 ( see chart ) , the longest stretch since at least the 1930s according to economists at the University of Michigan .
Michigan 's loan delinquencies have outpaced America 's for more than eight years .
In 2001 Michigan ranked 20th for personal income per capita .
By 2008 it ranked 37th .
Even given this history , 2009 was particularly painful .
The bankruptcies of Chrysler and General Motors were devastating .
State economists reckon that car manufacturing shed 30 % of its jobs in 2009 .
The state 's total employment level is more than one - fifth smaller than it was in June 2000 .
There are some hopeful signs from the Big Three .
Ford posted profits of almost $ 1 billion in the third quarter , aided by the “ cash - for - clunkers ” programme .
Chrysler and GM emerged from bankruptcy freed of burdensome debt and cost structures .
But the old glory days will not return soon .
According to economists at the University of Michigan , the market share of the Big Three will continue to drop even as car sales recover .
By 2011 , the economists expect car manufacturing to employ about one - quarter of the workers it did in 2000 .
The loss is staggering .
Plans for the future
Faced with such a void , Michigan is searching for ways to fill it .
For years , the state has sought to attract new businesses and cling to existing ones .
More recently , a lovely tourism campaign has advertised Michigan 's beaches and forests , a bright antidote to relentless gloomy news stories .
But the loftiest ideas centre on transforming the rusty state into a “ new economy ” powerhouse .
Jennifer Granholm , Michigan 's governor , wants to use grants and tax incentives to make Michigan a hub for green jobs and advanced - battery technology in particular .
She has had some success .
When the Recovery Act awarded grants for advanced - battery development last summer , Michigan won $ 1.35 billion , more than any other state .
Such efforts , the state hopes , will build on existing engineering expertise and help Michigan 's manufacturing base begin a new era .
Universities , too , are preparing to play a bigger role in the state 's economy .
The top - notch University of Michigan , a mere 40 - minute drive from Detroit , is filled with cheerful cafés and big brains .
The three - year - old University Research Corridor is a collaboration between Michigan 's three main universities .
“ I describe it as the university becoming much more porous ” , explains Mary Sue Coleman , president of the University of Michigan .
She hopes to improve ties with businesses and ease the commercialisation of academic research .
Just as energetic is the attempt to nurture a new generation of entrepreneurs .
( For 100 years , Michigan coasted on the success of that hyperactive entrepreneur , Henry Ford . )
The University of Michigan has a two - year - old Centre for Entrepreneurship , providing classes and other support to students with business ideas .
In Detroit , Wayne State University 's TechTown is a research park as well as an incubator for new companies .
TechTown hopes to help create 1,200 start - ups by 2012 .
However it is impossible to guess whether such efforts will pull Michigan out of the mire .
Advanced - battery firms may move their headquarters to New York and their production to Asia .
A spin -off from a university may employ only a few , highly skilled workers .
Some entrepreneurs may succeed .
Many will fail .
Timothy Bartik of the Upjohn Institute , a regional think - tank , recommends more staid ways of improving Michigan 's labour market , such as investing in universal pre-kindergarten , or boosting business by cutting the marginal tax rate for firms that expand .
Regardless , the reinvented Michigan remains only an idea .
The University of Michigan expects employment to begin rising in the fourth quarter of 2011 .
But Michigan 's employment level is not predicted to return to its 2000 peak until 2025 at the earliest .
The painful present
In the meantime , the state must grapple with an uncomfortable reality : its government and workforce are framed around an economy that no longer exists .
Revenue for Michigan 's general fund has fallen by a devastating 43 % since 2000 , adjusted for inflation .
Prisons and Medicaid gobble almost half of the general fund , leaving little money to spend elsewhere .
Despite all the talk of universities ' importance , funding for higher education has dropped by 22 % since 2002 .
Michigan will be even more pinched next year , as money from the Recovery Act runs out .
Mitchell Bean , director of the non-partisan House Fiscal Agency , argues that Michigan 's revenue system is in desperate need of reform .
But even if the state extends its sales tax to services as well as goods , it will need to reconsider what it can afford to provide .
“ What should state government really do ? ” , Mr Bean asks .
As politicians mull such questions in the capital , workers across the state are confronting their own dilemmas .
Thousands are without jobs and many are tethered to Michigan , unable to sell their homes .
The worst affected are those who had high - wage , low - skill jobs .
“ The bottom has fallen out for the unskilled manufacturing worker , ” says Andy Levin , the state 's director of workforce development .
Mr Levin hopes that new skills will give workers a path forward .
Michigan 's retraining programme , No Worker Left Behind ( NWLB ) , is the country 's most ambitious , scraping together federal and state money to send workers to school for up to two years .
Between August 2007 , when NWLB began , and November 2009 the scheme enrolled 108,884 workers in training .
Even more are waiting to attend school .
Over 16,000 workers were on its waiting list at the end of November .
But better skills do not guarantee work .
According to the most recent data 48 % of those trained in NWLB had found a job ; 52 % had not .
There are over 50 résumés for each job listed in Michigan 's data base .
Given this climate many young educated workers are fleeing the state .
About 40 % of Michigan - born graduates leave each year , according to a two - year - old survey .
It is not through lack of local pride .
On any Saturday during football season , graduates from the University of Michigan cram into Duffy 's bar to cheer on their beloved Wolverines .
Duffy's , though , is in Chicago .

Data compression is one of the fundamental research areas in computer science , letting information systems do more with less .
It ’s the reason the iPod nano can hold thousands of songs instead of hundreds , and it ’s what keeps transmitted images from choking the Internet .
If every digital file is a string of bits — zeroes and ones — then compression is a way to represent the same information with fewer bits .
Most compression techniques trade space for time : while the compressed file takes up less memory , it has to be decoded before its contents are intelligible .
In applications where memory is in short supply but data needs constant updating , it can be prohibitively time consuming to keep decompressing a file , modifying it , and then recompressing it .
As a result , such applications — monitoring Internet traffic , for instance , or looking for patterns in huge collections of scientific data — often use a type of compression called linear compression .
With linear compression , a computer program can modify the data in a compressed file without first decoding it .
Last year , Associate Professor Piotr Indyk of MIT 's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and his graduate student Radu Berinde introduced two different versions of a new linear - compression algorithm that perform as well as any yet invented — and for some applications , better .
Both versions of the algorithm , however , had limitations : under certain extreme conditions , they ’d just stop working .
But this fall , at the Allerton Conference on Communication , Control , and Computing hosted by the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , Indyk and Berinde presented a new version of the algorithm that combined the advantages of its predecessors and overcame their drawbacks .
“ The two previous algorithms each had their own faults , ” says Deanna Needell , a postdoc at Stanford who helped develop one of the other leading linear - compression algorithms .
“ And this tends to be the case in many situations in this area , that if you have two algorithms , one is good at one thing and the other is good at another .
And [ the new algorithm ] sort of merged the two benefits .
It ’s like , here ’s this algorithm that does both of the good things . ”
Some compression techniques , like the zip algorithm commonly used for Internet downloads , are what ’s called “ lossless ” : when you unzip the zipped version of a file , you recover every bit of the original .
Other compression techniques are “ lossy ” : the MP3 version of a song , for example , takes up about a tenth as much space as the CD version , but it irreversibly discards a lot of subtle audio data .
Linear compression is lossy : expanding the compressed file does n’t give you all the data in the original .
But for many applications , that does n’t matter .
Take , for instance , Internet traffic monitoring .
Packets of data traveling over the Internet pass through a succession of special - purpose computers called routers ; each router examines the packet ’s ultimate destination and tells it where to go next .
There ’s no way a router could store information about all the packets that pass through it in the course of a day , but with linear compression , it can store an approximation .
Decoding the data can still disclose what Indyk calls the “ heavy hitters ” — the sites that are sending and receiving the most packets — which is what most researchers are interested .
In other applications , the heavy hitters might be the members of a large population whose blood tests positive for a disease , or the concentrations of particular molecules in a chemical sample .
Going the distance
According to Indyk , there are three principal criteria for evaluating the performance of a linear - compression algorithm .
One is the degree of compression : how much smaller the compressed file is than the uncompressed data .
The second is recovery time : how long it takes to decode the compressed data .
( Indyk says that some of the early linear - compression algorithms would take “ hours or even days ” to reconstruct an image captured by a one - megapixel camera . )
And since linear compression is lossy , the third is how accurately the algorithm can reconstruct the original file .
In the last seven years , Indyk says , the field has progressed to the point where linear - compression algorithms can perform well along any two of those three parameters at the expense of the third .
Indyk and Berinde chose to trade some fidelity in reconstruction for efficient extraction and good compression .
Indeed , Indyk and some of his other students have recently demonstrated that there ’s a mathematical limit to how much space savings linear compression can afford — and his and Berinde ’s algorithm reaches it .
The insight behind the MIT researchers ’ algorithm is fairly technical , but Indyk tried to explain it in layman ’s terms .
If you take two very different files — strings of ones and zeroes — of similar size , “ the difference between them has a geometric interpretation , ” Indyk explains .
That is , there ’s a way to mathematically describe the difference between the files in terms of distance : one file can be thought of as being close to or far away from the other .
With linear compression , there ’s generally a trade - off between how fast the compression algorithm is and how much of the original file can be recovered .
Slower but more accurate algorithms tend to preserve the geometric distance between files : if two uncompressed files are far apart , the compressed versions will be , too .
With faster algorithms , on the other hand , the compressed files tend to be much closer to each other than the source files were .
Indyk and Berinde found a way to analyze the difference between compressed files using a different mathematical notion of geometric distance ; under that analysis , some fast compression algorithms still preserve the distance between files .
By taking advantage of this new perspective , the researchers were able to devise a decompression algorithm that recovers much more information from the original file without sacrificing any speed .
Work like Indyk and Berinde ’s holds out the hope that soon , linear - compression algorithms will no longer need to sacrifice performance along one of the three parameters that Indyk mentioned — compression , time and accuracy .
“ I think we ’re actually pretty close to that , ” says Needell .
“ We ’re pretty much to the end : we ’re almost there . ”
She adds , however , that “ there ’s plenty of other directions that the field will go in . ”
For instance , she says , many of the mathematical techniques that linear - compression algorithms rely on could be adapted to improve the “ recommendation engines ” on web sites like Netflix or Amazon , which try to predict which books or movies a customer might like on the basis of prior history .
William Hsiao is a professor of economics at the Harvard School of Public Health and co-author of the 2004 book “ Getting Health Reform Right . ”
He served as a health care adviser to the Taiwan government in the 1990s , when officials decided to reform that country ’s health care system and to introduce universal coverage .
He spoke with Anne Underwood , a freelance writer .
Q .
Taiwan instituted universal insurance in 1995 .
What was the health care system like before ?
A .
Only a portion of the people were insured , including civil servants , employees of large firms and farmers .
The military had its own system of coverage .
But 45 percent of the population did not have insurance , and they faced financial barriers to access to health care .
President Lee Teng - hui felt strongly that he wanted to do something concrete and visible for all the citizens .
He thought of introducing national health insurance to touch the lives of all the people .
There was a sense in Taiwan that health care is needed by everyone and a country has to assure everyone equal access .
Q .
How did you become involved in the health care reform process ?
A .
The government initially appointed four Taiwanese professors to lead a task force of technical experts .
But the four professors all had different ideas .
It was like a wagon drawn by four horses , with each going in a different direction and nobody driving .
After a year of this , government officials realized there was a problem .
In addition , they wanted someone who understood health systems and health care abroad and what lessons other countries could offer to Taiwan .
The domestic experts did not have much international experience .
I was invited to a three - day workshop , where they tested me .
At the end , I was put in charge of the task force of four professors and 16 other technical experts .
It turned out to be a big advantage that I ’m not Taiwanese and had no aspirations of getting a job in Taiwan .
At the end of the day , our recommendations and findings were perceived as more objective and free of self - interest .
Q .
What was your assignment as head of this task force ?
A .
We had to design a national health insurance plan for Taiwan , based on international experience .
Government officials wanted to understand how other advanced countries fund and organize health care and learn from their successes and failures , so I made a study of the systems in six high - income countries — the United States , the U.K. , Germany , France , Canada and Japan .
Q .
And what was your conclusion at the end of this study ?
A .
We adopted a single - payer system along the Canadian lines .
I did not invent it .
I ’m just in the transfer - of - knowledge business .
Q .
Why did you choose the Canadian model ?
A .
Canada has a single - payer system with universal insurance coverage .
It offers people free choice of doctors and hospitals , and it has competition on the delivery side between public and private hospitals .
The quality of health services is very high , and people were very satisfied with the system from the 1980s through the mid-1990s .
Unfortunately , in the early - to - mid 1990s , Canada went through a severe recession for four or five years .
The budget became very tight .
The government underfunded national health insurance , which led to long waiting lines for elective surgery , MRIs and so forth .
But when Canada adequately financed its N.H.I. , it was a very good system .
Q .
In Taiwan , can people choose any doctor or hospital they want ?
A .
Yes , any provider .
Americans talk about choice .
But in fact , insurance plans in this country restrict what providers you can go to .
Canada gives its citizens more choice of providers .
So does Germany .
So does England .
So does Taiwan .
Q .
How comprehensive is the coverage ?
A .
It covers prevention , primary care and hospitalization , among other things .
Q .
I ’ve read that it also covers Chinese massage , acupuncture , traditional herbal medicine , mental health care , dental , vision and long - term care .
A .
Yes , these services are covered .
We tried to design a benefit package that would give people what they value .
For many Taiwanese , that includes traditional Chinese medicine .
Though Chinese medicine is not 100 percent proven to be medically effective , people believe in it .
And some therapies have been proven effective .
For example , when acupuncture is given in certain spots , it stimulates the brain to release opiates .
Q .
The Taiwanese system also covers home care .
A .
You need home care by visiting nurses for people who are chronically ill or bedridden .
It ’s not rocket science to recognize this .
Some people argue that the patients should pay for home care themselves .
But if people have to pay out of pocket , they might not ask for visiting nurse services and their illnesses may get much worse .
Then they will need to be hospitalized .
Q .
Is the system very expensive ?
A .
Expensive is a relative term .
Taiwan spends 6 percent of G.D.P. on health care , compared to 16 percent in the United States .
Q .
How much do people have to pay ?
A .
If you ’re employed , your employer pays 60 percent of your premium .
The employee pays 30 percent , and the government subsidizes 10 percent .
The government fully subsidizes the premiums for the poor and gives partial subsidies to veterans , the self - employed and farmers .
Q .
How much is the typical premium ?
A .
The total insurance premium for employed workers is 4.6 percent of wages .
That ’s much lower than in the United States , where the average is between 12 and 20 percent of wages for those who are covered by their employers .
Q .
Are there co-pays , too ?
A .
Yes .
The task force felt that service should not be totally free or else people might waste services .
For example , we studied what happened in Taiwan when some insurance policies gave prescription drugs free to everyone .
One - third of the drugs dispensed were never taken but thrown away .
You can imagine , if you have free office visits , some people will say , “ I have this little ache .
I ’ll go see the doctor because it ’s free . ”
We wanted to moderate this waste .
Q .
How high are co-pays ?
A .
The charge is $ 2 for a visit to a clinic and about $ 4 to a hospital outpatient department .
The co-pay for hospitalization is now 10 percent for the first 30 days and 20 percent for the days beyond 30 days .
For prescriptions , it ’s 20 percent of the cost of the drug , but capped at $ 6 for each prescription .
Taiwan also sets a ceiling on the total co-pays , so patients wo n’t face bankruptcy .
Q .
How long did it take to implement this program ?
A .
Less than a year .
Mr. Lee pushed through the legislation in four to five months , because an election was coming .
Then he asked for the new system to be implemented six months after that — and they did it .
Q .
What percent of the population is now insured ?
A .
Within the first year , Taiwan managed to insure 95 percent of the population .
That increased that by another percent or so each year , until they reached 98 percent .
They had trouble with that last 2 percent , because some were living overseas and others were homeless .
The government literally sent people to find the homeless under bridges and enroll them .
Now they have close to 99 percent enrollment .
Q .
Has this translated into better life expectancy or lower complication rates from major diseases ?
A .
There is evidence of positive health results for select diseases , like cardiovascular disease and kidney failure .
But overall , it ’s really difficult to say that national health insurance has improved the aggregate health status , because mortality and life expectancy are crude measurements , not precise enough to pick up the impact of more health care .
That said , life expectancy is improving , and mortality is dropping .
And everyone now has access to good health care .
Q .
What does the system do particularly well ?
A .
In addition to covering everyone , it has a uniform system of electronic health records .
Every patient has a Smart Card .
When you go in for services , the physician puts the card into his computer .
You give him the code to access your records , which are all stored on the card — what medications you ’ve taken , what tests , along with the results , the last time you saw another physician .
With a single , unified electronic system , it improves treatment and it also vastly reduces claims processing .
Hospitals and doctors get paid in a week or two .
It ’s a paperless system .
That ’s why it keeps administrative costs down to 2.3 percent of the total premium .
In the United States , it ’s more than 10 percent .
Taiwan was also able to control health - expenditure increases very well in the early years .
Unfortunately , now that the government budget is tight , it is overdoing it .
Q .
What are the system ’s weaknesses ?
A .
In the legislative process , compromises had to be made .
First , the president yielded on payment reform , so Taiwan kept its fee - for - service payment system .
Unfortunately , that encourages doctors and hospitals to give more treatment in order to boost their income .
Second , the Taiwanese system does n’t have a systematic way to monitor and improve quality of care .
Third , in the legislative process , they rejected a provision to adjust the premium automatically when the national health system depletes its reserves .
In every country , health care costs are increasing faster than wages .
When that happens , the premium has to go up .
But that provision was n’t incorporated into the law .
As a result , the system is running a deficit .
National health insurance tries to cut the fees for hospital and physician services .
But eventually these fee reductions will adversely affect the quality of health care .
Q .
What ’s the most important lesson that Americans can learn from the Taiwanese example ?
A .
You can have universal coverage and good quality health care while still managing to control costs .
But you have to have a single - payer system to do it .
Magic Happens
I ’ve always believed in the beauty of a great journey – discovering new places , seeking life experiences , fostering relationships and pursuing my dreams .
In fact , it ’s all I ’ve ever really wanted to do .
I just want to believe in something that ’s worth believing in and then pursue it with every facet of my being .
Such journeys , I ’ve found , are best when we share them with others who , like me , are ‘ crazy ’ enough to assume that our wildest dreams are just a brief distance away from reality .
These are the folks who realize that ‘ impossible ’ is simply a mindset – something we get when we have n’t trained our minds and our hearts to see past the systems that currently exist to ones that do n’t yet exist .
Because when our minds and our hearts and our hands work together , magic happens .
Fear
And only one thing has ever prevented me from making this magic happen more often .
Fear .
Being afraid of what others might think .
Afraid of the repercussions of putting my crazy ideas out there for the world to see and judge .
Afraid to let go of my comfort zone and just go for it .
Because …
What if I fail ?
What if …
What if …
Now , in most situations , fear no longer stands in my way .
But that does n’t mean it does n’t exist .
It most certainly does .
I ’ve just learned to curb my fears and adapt to change a bit more proficiently than I used to .
But I still feel the nerves of fear sneak up on me .
And the more important something or someone is to me , the more nervous I get , the more I stumble over my words , and the more I sound like an incoherent fool .
A few years ago when I began talking to my friends and family about my goal to write and start the blog that would eventually become Marc and Angel Hack Life , I mostly got half smiles , nods , and quizzical facial reactions .
And when I tried to say anything meaningful to Angel when we first met back in September of 2000 , she would often laugh at me because she literally found herself trying to decode my jumbled , shaky sentences .
Clarity
One of the most remarkable things about our lives is that clarity and progression occur with enduring love , passion , and patience .
This blog is now an easy topic for me to talk about … and now , it ’s even easy for others to talk about , including my friends and family .
And although it may take her a second or two , Angel now gets the gist of my jumbled , shaky sentences almost immediately .
And that makes me smile .
Because I want to continue to evolve and grow with the people and dreams that inspire me .
After all , I only have one shot – like we all do – to make this life meaningful .
And I know for sure , after coping with my fears on numerous journeys , that I would rather sound stupid …
Than be stupid and take no action at all .
Usain Bolt said he wanted to see the challenges facing Africa first - hand
The fastest man on Earth , Usain Bolt , has adopted the fastest animal on four legs , a cheetah , and has given it the only suitable name - Lightning Bolt .
The champion sprinter , on a four - day trip to Kenya , looked nervous as he was handed the three - month - old cub - which is about the size of a household cat .
But he soon recovered his composure to name the cub in his honour .
The Jamaican sprinter is helping to launch a conservation campaign run by German charity the Zeitz Foundation .
During his trip , he has already impressed local children with his football skills , and become an honorary Maasai warrior .
' Calm ' cheetah
Bolt , the world record holder at both 100 m and 200 m , told reporters at the weekend he was excited about his first meeting with a cheetah .
But the BBC's Caroline Karobia in Nairobi says he appeared to be knocked out of his stride as he toured the Nairobi animal sanctuary - coming face - to - face with fully grown creatures .
" I am glad it was n't a lion - the cheetah is much more calm , " he said earlier .
He is helping to launch a campaign called the Long Run , which aims to promote ecologically sound practices .
" I was attracted to the initiative because of its objectives on the conservation of the environment and co-existence of different cultures , " Bolt said .
" I do a lot of charity work in Jamaica .
But I would like to see first - hand the challenges facing Africa in environment . "
The Zeitz Foundation was set up by Jochen Zeitz , the boss of sportswear manufacturer Puma .
Our reporter says another small animal was also being adopted by a person of importance at Nairobi 's animal orphanage .
Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga adopted a lion cub and , not to be outdone , named it Agwambo - his own nickname , which means " king " in the Luo language .

Turn off MSNBC .
Tune out Howard Dean and Keith Olbermann .
The White House has its liberal wing in hand on health care , says White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel .
“ There are no liberals left to get ” in the Senate , Emanuel said in an interview , shrugging off some noise from the likes of Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I. , Vt. ) that a few liberals might bolt over the compromises made with conservative Democrats .
As the White House leans on conservative Democrat Sen .
Ben Nelson of Nebraska for the 60th health care vote , Emanuel has made the case that this generation of liberal political figures will not make the mistake of their predecessors .
The late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ’s greatest regret was not cutting a deal with Richard Nixon on universal health care .
Former President Bill Clinton has forever rued the day he did not take moderate Republican Sen .
John Chafee up on a compromise that could have secured a health care bill early in his presidency .
Liberal senators nearly scuttled the creation of the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program -– S- CHIP –- because Clinton compromised with Republicans and agreed to take the program out of Medicaid and involve private insurers .
“ Every time they ’ve gotten close to the deal , they ’ve passed up the opportunity and chosen to walk away from a particular where they ’ve lost the forest for the trees , ” Emanuel said .
The comments may not endear the powerful White House chief of staff to liberal activists , furious that Senate Democratic leaders , at Emanuel ’s urging , cut a deal with Sen .
Joe Lieberman to drop a federally run insurance policy option , then eliminate a Medicare buy - in proposal .
“ I do n’t think the White House recognizes how much trouble they ’re in , ” said one former Democratic official this morning .
“ I think they ’re miscalaculating what ’s happening with progressives and the left .
They feel like they ’re being taken for granted . ”
But Emanuel pointed to a New York Times column by economist Paul Krugman and another coming from National Journal writer Ronald Brownstein pressing for passage of the Senate health bill .
“ What you ’re seeing is the progressive backlash against the progressive backlash , ” he said .

Buried in the depths of page 26 of the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program 's ( SIGTARP's ) November 17 , 2009 report " Factors Affecting Efforts to Limit Payments to AIG Counterparties " hidden in footnotes 33 and 34 is something of a mystery .
It might be the beginning of an interconnected financial chain involving Dubai , the Federal Reserve , AIG , Basel I , Eastern Europe and even Switzerland and which , even if it does n't worry you , probably should .
Or it might be nothing at all .
Consider first " footnote 33 , " that reads as follows :
The first Basel Accord , known as Basel I , was issued in 1988 ; it focused on the capital adequacy of financial institutions .
The capital adequacy risk — the risk that a financial institution will be hurt by an unexpected loss — categorizes the assets of financial institution into five risk categories ( 0 percent , 10 percent , 20 percent , 50 percent , and 100 percent ) .
Banks that operate internationally are required to have a risk weight of 8 percent or less ....
The original paragraph that references the footnote reads thus :
As of September 30 , 2009 , AIG had $ 172 billion in exposure to swaps in its foreign regulatory capital portfolio .
The portfolio contains swaps purchased by financial institutions , principally in Europe , to provide regulatory capital relief under Basel I. [ note 33 ]
AIGFP ’s COO informed SIGTARP in July 2009 that they expect that most of these swaps will be terminated by the end of the first quarter 2010 as most financial institutions complete their transition to Basel II .
Currently , financial institutions are required to hold a certain level of capital against their assets , and one way for a financial institution to reduce the amount of capital is to purchase swap protection on its assets .
However , new requirements decrease the level of capital required for such assets and , in most cases , there will be limited capital benefit to holding on to the existing swaps .
Nonetheless , AIG warned in a June 29 , 2009 , SEC filing that if credit markets deteriorate , the company may recognize unrealized losses in AIGFP ’s regulatory capital credit default swap portfolio .
[ note 34 ]
AIG could continue to be at risk if the swaps in its regulatory capital portfolio are not terminated by the end of first quarter 2010 as expected .
( Emphasis added ) .
Taken together we read the thrust of this section to mean that a number of European banks , seeking to limit their regulatory capital requirements under Basel I ( read : seeking to increase their leverage ) bought swap protection on their assets from AIG .
These obligations still sit with AIG and , in the event credit markets sink materially , AIG is likely to take losses on these instruments .
Not just that but :
According to an AIG SEC filing , an ongoing concern for AIGFP is whether it will have to post more collateral if credit markets continue to deteriorate .
The amount of future collateral postings is partly a function of AIG ’s credit ratings , which may be affected by any further decline in AIG ’s financial condition .
( Emphasis added ) .
Simply put , AIG might also have to post more collateral .
Moreover , though AIG initially expected most of these swaps to " be terminated by the end of the first quarter 2010 as most financial institutions complete their transition to Basel II , " we see from footnote 34 that :
Subsequent to the June filing , European regulators adjusted the implementation timing of Basel II , potentially affecting the holders of AIGFP ’s regulatory capital swaps to hold beyond previously anticipated termination dates .
In other words , AIG is still on the hook - and had n't planned to be .
This raises a number of questions :
If the European banks that bought swap protection from AIG are still relying on this protection to meet their capital requirements , and AIG might be unable to make good on the agreements , are these banks actually out of Basel I compliance as we type this ?
Are the banks still able to use swap protection to reduce their collateral requirements because of the implicit or explicit backing of AIG by the Federal Reserve ?
If this situation existed in September - November 2008 , as it certainly appears to have , how exactly can the Federal Reserve claim in good faith that it lacked the leverage to negotiate with these banks from a position of strength ?
( One assumes that many of the same names collecting payment from AIG were also AIG swap protection buyers of the sort mentioned in the SIGTARP report ) .
Failure to back up an insolvent AIG would have resulted in near - immediate Basel I non-compliance as the protection offered by these swaps , and on which these banks depended for their reduced capital requirements , evaporated - a near death sentence .
Or had these banks somehow , and in the middle of the credit crisis , managed to boost their capital to levels that made the swaps unimportant ?
If so , why keep them on the books now , instead of unwinding them ?
Since it does n't seem likely that a teetering AIG could make good on these agreements without substantial assistance is the Fed is currently the ultimate backstop for AIG ?
Does this mean that the Fed is effectively underwriting these swap agreements ?
Will the Fed post collateral if deteriorating credit conditions at AIG ( today 's - $ 11 billion news suddenly seems especially daunting if the potential insurance shortfall has an effect on credit ratings ) or general credit market issues require it ?
Or are we missing something significant ?
By September 30 , 2008 AIG had already posted $ 974 million in collateral for its " Foreign Regulatory Capital " portfolio .
What if European banks are hit with more losses from , oh , we do n't know , say ...
Dubai ?
Deleveraging , risk reduction and credit tightening would have an effect on LIBOR , the Eurobond market and , of course , Eastern Europe .
Might not that sort of contagion easily spread to , say , Switzerland , which enjoyed the other side of the carry trade for years by lending Swiss Franc like mad to any Eastern European mortgage borrower who could sign documents ?
Could it be that the Fed , once again , might have to bail out the world ?
Or maybe we are just missing something obvious .
Members of Congress who may enjoy sharing music on the Internet without understanding the technology behind it all are learning the hard way about the potential dangers of peer - to - peer software .
A House ethics committee staffer using a “ P2P ” program  marketed to let users share music and other recreational data  did not know that the insecure software would allow the Web ’s world - at - large to share the committee ’s ( previously ) secret list of lawmakers facing ethics investigations .
The staffer , like countless others in government and the business world , ignored official policy and took sensitive data home to be compromised by the legion of electronic pickpockets out there .
In the brouhaha that followed , lawmakers demanded to know how this could have happened .
They should have listened to Representative Edolphus Towns , chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee , who has been warning for nine years about the insecurity of P2P software  for government computers and everyone else ’s .
As a result of P2P breaches , the location of the First Family ’s safe house was once disclosed , as were the schematics of the presidential helicopter ’s electronic system .
Scores of thousands of military members have had their personal records and home addresses disclosed , and the financial filings of myriad Americans , including the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer , have been “ shared . ”
The F.B.I. files on a Mafia hit man were disclosed while he was still on trial .

Copyright 2009 Walker & Company , Excerpt from Heart of Dryness
Circle of Blue ’s “ Water + Climate : Words ” highlights literary investigations of water and climate intersections .
As politicians debate the line - by - line contents of a global climate change treaty , the human and environmental drama is playing out around the world , from the deserts of Africa to the shores of Greenland .
In Heart of Dryness journalist and author James Workman shares the lives of Botswana ’s Bushmen , an indigenous hunter - gatherer population that has been forced to relocate by the national government since the 1990s .
As he follows this population ’s struggle for land , he comes face - first with the multi- layered reality of a world increasingly struggling for water while battling the effects of a warming planet .
“ The main thing was to have a story that would illustrate to the lay person so that they understand these water issues , ” Workman tells Circle of Blue .
“ If your bring these issues down to the people who laugh , dance and have babies like you , you care about them and see the parallels and connections between their life in the Kalahari and yours – you see their humanity .
“ When we hear the statistic that 2.2 billion people live without sanitation , it ’s shocking , but at the same time it ’s meaningless . ”
For two years Workman lived and traveled with the Bushmen as they battled the national government in court over access to the Central Kalahari Game Reserve ( CKGR ) .
At the end of 2006 , the Bushmen won the right to return to the CKGR while Workman was blacklisted from the country for his stories .
Now he shares these intimate stories with Circle of Blue , weaving each installment into the themes of our Water + Climate series .
The first excerpt examines their struggle for food in the face of political and environmental obstacles .
Chapter 8 . Forage or Farm ?
Since the dawn of Homo sapiens in arid Africa , nine tenths of our evolution has unfolded as foragers .
Only relatively recently did our species embark on agriculture , and recent events suggest certain limits to that extraordinary experiment .
Exponential population growth has combined with unprecedented climate change until half the planet ’s land surface can now be classified as drylands — arid landscapes inhabited by a third of humankind .
[ i ]
After decades of growth , nations as diverse as India , Mexico , China , Egypt , Yemen , Israel , Australia and Botswana lack sufficient water to grow enough food to feed themselves . [ ii ]
To make up the difference , hungry billions depend on foreign aid or trade , but now even that pressure valve has begun to close .
By the dawn of the increasingly warm 21st Century , subsistence and irrigation farmers , long dependent on reliable rains or cheap water supplies , began asking what to do with their desiccated lands , or where to turn for food . [ iii ]
Qoroxloo ’s tactics suggested one way of adapting to a fast - changing climate .
On mornings cool enough to walk yet warm enough so lions would rest in the shade , she strode out into the Kalahari armed only with her digging stick , her leather bag and her female friends .
Part of her goal was of course to gather nutritious wild groceries , yet each search involved a far more complex undertaking than that .[ iv ]
Qoroxloo observed emerging details for immediate use or to be filed for later .
She noted an item , discussed it with others as they walked , and mentioned it again after returning home at the end of the day : a ripening fruit here ; day old giraffe tracks there ; ostrich moving into the pans .
Pivoting her head while striding at a rapid yet graceful and unhurried pace , Qoroxloo scanned the horizon , the sky above , and back down again , forever seeking latent signs that suggested the presence of moisture .
ABOUT THE AUTHOR : James G. Workman is an award - winning journalist and has served as an environmental consultant to U.S. - cabinet members .
Carnivorous hunters had to think like the herbivores that drank the arteries of plants ; Qoroxloo had to think like the plants that sucked water from the moist capillaries in infinite sands .
In this all - consuming search for moisture even bugs took on significance .
Mopane worms , locusts and other slow - moving grubs offered succulent , juicy food , while lying insects served as beacons to damp places .
Water vapor sent a subtle signal into the air that insects sniffed out and hunted down : a congregation of gnats suggested local humidity ; butterflies alighted on damp earth ; bees flew in a direct line toward any source of standing water , and she followed their cue .
Yet Kalahari adaptation brought an inherent tension .
Drought - resistant plants sought to capture and retain water without avoiding advertising themselves as moist targets for consumption by more complex species .
By hiding and hoarding their wet bulk deep underground , plants revealed no more than a thin stalk and waited for just the right moment to convert energy and moisture .
Many animals overlooked that stalk , but not Qoroxloo .
She especially tried to detect , stop , and investigate closely with others the plants that Bushmen knew as rain - swelled “ storage organs , ” their substitute for water during the ten months when Kalahari pans were dry . [ v ]
As she educated the next generation about how and why “ some plants were for eating and other plants you can drink , ” her lessons boil down to seven habits of highly successful foragers .
Since the mid-1990s the Botswanan government tried relocating the Bushmen off the Central Kalahari Game Reserve .

First , harvest every raindrop embedded in the flesh of plants .
From this indifferent dry landscape Qoroxloo harvested as much as 90 percent of the band ’s moisture , contributing two thirds to three quarters of the band ’s food , the bulk of its caloric intake , and pound for pound more nutrients and oils than men could hunt .
[ vi ]
It was quite a crop for such few precious drops .
Next , devolve authority .
Knowledge of where , how , and when to harvest required democratic collaboration because , during the hottest months of the year Qoroxloo faced a precarious battle to gather more moisture and nutrients from what she dug than she burned off in the process of digging .
Timing was everything .
In this way Bushmen minimized waste , avoiding the harvest of too much , too soon or too late .
Qoroxloo did not plunder the Kalahari to depletion , but tactically cultivated a wild , permaculture garden to which she might return .
Third , diversify the diet .
By utilizing the widest spectrum of what was palatable — some 70 - 150 species of roots , rhizomes , tubers , melons , berries and fruit ; plus 40 animal species — Bushmen broadened the foundation of their vegetable food security .
True , some items on Qoroxloo ’s shopping list of were admittedly tasteless but still highly nutritious , or laden with moisture .
Fourth , eat locally and seasonally .
Distance opened more opportunities , but consumed precious energy burned up in transport .
Central stockpiling attracted pests and raised the odds of rotting food .
Throughout the dry months Qoroxloo and her band moved from one patch of water - embedded plants to another , ate eleven pounds a day to get the liquid they required .[ vii ]
Bushmen satisfied their daily minimum water requirement by seeking the shortest distance from the earth to the hand to the mouth .

Fifth , embrace the least disruptive technologies .
It ’s hard to imagine a more functional , timeless and durable tool than Qoroxloo ’s digging stick .
[ viii ]
Digging punished haste and sudden exertion but rewarded the pacing of energy in the blazing heat , tracing a vine down to the damper parts of the sand like an archaeologist gently brushing away sand in a search for answers .
The second Bushmen technology was fire .
Their small - scale burns created a rich mosaic that encouraged new growth , attracted prey , and reduced water lost through old dense vegetation .
Sixth , innovate as the habitat allows .
Bushmen were not locked in the past , wedded to tradition .
When they noticed how tsama melon seeds took root after sudden rains , some in Qoroxloo ’s band experimented with these and other emergency fallback sources of food .
Doing so further blurred the textbook line between farming and foraging , but anthropologists recently discovered that shifts from hunter - gatherer to pastoralist and farmer were never one - way , irreversible stages of teleological progress towards a more complex and perfect existence .
Rather , Homo sapiens had always shifted back and forth across a variety of survival strategies , mixing and matching techniques of food provision — foraging , farming , herding , hunting or all of the above — in flexible ways to suit the dictatorial conditions of the landscape . [ ix ]
Throughout our evolution , the determining forces of our human diet rested on rainfall and access to water . [ x ]
Finally , subordinate flavor to survival .
In the quest to gather moisture along with food , gemsbok cucumber held 70 percent water , on average more than a pint , and while bitter they could be chewed up , moisture extracted , and the fiber spat out .
Best of all the Tsama melons began to swell during the rainy season and reached their peak during the dry winter months .
Their round shape minimized exposure through efficient surface area , and the average one - pound melon consisted of 90 percent water ; 18 melons yielded 12 quarts .
Qoroxloo ’s band dutifully roasted and ‘ ate ’ the less tasty nutritious dry fare , but ‘ drank ’ juicier , more flavorful food with relish . [ xi ]

As I was an outsider to the heartless Kalahari , others had warned me to fill my canteens : “ You can endure weeks without food , but only days without water . ”
But that advice revealed a false dichotomy .
For Qoroxloo , food was water .
Water was food .
Food and water use diverged roughly 13,000 years earlier , with the onset of farming .
Some attribute the birth of agriculture to wetter times , others to the millennium - long dry , cold ‘ snap ’ known as the Younger Dryas . [ xii ]
Either way , the human approach to food as a prime source of water progressively split in two .
If foragers quickly ate local plants that stored water , agriculture stored water to slowly grow dry grains that could be eaten after months and bartered long distance .
As long as there was enough water , the latter approach offered considerable benefits .
Following this split , the world shifted from rain - fed subsistence crops to exploit arid lands extracting more and more high - value food reserves — especially monoculture or single - crop grains — for storage , processing , trade and shipment to cities .
Egyptian pharaohs instructed slaves and feudal lords ordered serfs to plant grain in advance of the rains ; industrial tools accelerated this trend ; fascist and socialist and capitalist leaders alike urged dryland farming , issuing propaganda about how to “ make the desert bloom ” since “ the rain follows the plough . ”
When such predictions proved false , engineers stepped in to correct them with dams , dikes , and irrigation diversions across every river until today more than 70 percent of all fresh water use on earth gets converted into food production .[ xiii ]
The mobilization of water transformed food and diets as well , often for the better .
Yet only a negligible fraction of our food retains its natural moisture .
And now we ’re not only expected to feed another 3 billion mouths in the next few decades , but twice that many mouths will hunger for the richer diets enabled by increasing affluence .[ xiv ]
Wealthier humans may require less than a quart of water to survive , but we routinely “ drink ” three to five thousand gallons embedded in the creation and processing of our meat , produce and grain – an amount analysts have christened virtual water . [ xv ]
The term is apt .
Thanks to evapotranspiration , all that water lost en route to the table is never again tasted or seen .
Economic affluence further distorts this water / food dichotomy :
The luxury of a soft drink containing sixteen ounces of water requires hundreds of gallons to grow the sugar , “ high fructose corn syrup , ” or “ evaporated cane juice ” contained within .
Consider how much virtual water it takes to grow just one healthy American breakfast .
A bowl of Rice Crispies with milk : 350 gallons .
Dry grounds for a cup of coffee ( sans real water ) : 37 gallons .
Eggs and toast and a side of bacon : 470 gallons .
Now multiply that by billions of people , 365 mornings a year , and you get an idea of the scale of the planet ’s growing stress from the water footprint of irrigated agriculture . [ xvi ]
Even chronically dry nation - states such as Botswana could not resist plunging into this arid land irrigation revolution .
In the name of “ nation - building , ” “ job - creation ” and “ food independence , ” Botswana ’s National Water Master Plan aimed to provide a fifth of the country ’s grain consumption within two decades .
That meant in addition to subsidized tractors , fuel , fertilizer , herbicides and pesticides , President Mogae ’s government handed out prodigious quantities of its fresh water .
It pumped some eighteen billion gallons from Kalahari aquifers or the anemic Limpopo River , and then sprinkled all this precious finite water out onto its increasingly hot sandscapes .
It planned to quintuple its irrigation area crops such as corn , alfalfa , vegetables on 4,000 acres.[xvii ]
Workman uses the Bushmen ’s story to reflect on the global water an climate crises .

In fairness , Botswana was not alone .
Saudi Arabia burned its oil to desalinate seas so that it could irrigate wheat , Egypt bled the Nile into the Sahara to grow grain pricier than it could import , and America poured out water on burning Western deserts to grow food as a weapon or a fuel substitute .
The irrigation addiction was easy to justify .
Given productivity gains from , say , India ’s Green Revolution , intensive dryland agriculture brought food security and warded off famine for billions .
No one could really complain , until everyone did , all at once , as water grew scarce around the world .[ xviii ]
In America , the Ogallala Aquifer began to bottom out across America ’s breadbasket Midwest even as Colorado River reservoirs stored half what they could a century ago .
Entire irrigated regions of China , India and Australia withered as the Yellow , Indus and Murray - Darling Rivers , respectively , stopped flowing to the sea .
Lake Chad and the Aral Sea dried up into shallow ponds and climate change altered the rainfall , runoff and evaporation patterns for a third of the world ’s population . [ xix ]
To make matters worse , in recent years up to a third of global water withdrawals are being converted to irrigate new sources of fuel . [ xx ]
Since it takes 9,000 gallons of water to produce a gallon of biodiesel , and 4,000 gallons to produce a gallon of corn ethanol , a “ clean fuel ” drive to the supermarket could burn up the water that would otherwise have grown a week ’s worth of calories .
“ There was a remarkable lack of careful planning in the drive to convert food into fuel , ” wrote Nestlé ’s Chairman .
“ Either it never occurred to biofuel advocates to ask about the amount of water needed for biofuel production , or they simply chose to ignore this particular inconvenient truth . ” [ xxi ]
The resulting food price inflation brought widespread misery on scales that defied statistics .
As a rule of thumb , middle classes cut back on meat , lower classes surrendered vegetables , and impoverished billions stopped feeding themselves and turned to food aid .
Some political leaders , knowing that in the decade ahead the world will grow hotter and add a billion more hungry inhabitants , have begun to question long - standing assumptions about dryland irrigation .
Meanwhile , agricultural experts trace the origins of the global food problem to its figurative and literal roots , weeding out extraneous factors to grasp one essential priority that even Thomas Malthus could n’t appreciate .
In order to feed itself at its current pace , even without a third of all irrigation diverted to biofuels , the world will deplete 2.9 billion cubic miles of fresh water by 2050 .[ xxii ]
Food production is n’t dramatically limited by land , innovation , price , know - how , support , fertilizer or technology .
It is cut by the loss of water .[ xxiii ]
Upon reaching this consensus , global experts offered advice that sounded rather familiar : squeeze more productivity from each raindrop ; devolve water authority to informed local decision makers ; diversify crops beyond risky monoculture ; reduce distances between production and consumption ; scale back water - intensive methods ; adapt crops to local rainfall ; and exploit ‘ green water ’ embedded in the ground .[ xxiv ]
This broad - consensus , multi-stage , seven - part prescription for the world looked solid on paper , but was proving hard to swallow outside the Kalahari .
Vital organs of the body politic felt threatened , and resisted or rejected it .
Even supporters conceded that this water - based or hydro- centric approach to food production in a changing climate required a daily discipline .
It demanded more intuitive art than technical skill .
It called for the experience and training of some so - called “ primitive ” or “ Stone Age creature , ” whose families had been quietly adhering to this new paradigm for millennia .
Someone like Qoroxloo .
( CNN ) --
On August 28 , the Saudi Arabian deputy minister of interior , Prince Mohammed bin Nayef , survived a bombing attack launched by an al Qaeda cell based in Yemen , Saudi Arabia 's southern neighbor .
Abdullah Hassan al Asiri , the would - be assassin , a Saudi who had fled to Yemen , posed as a militant willing to surrender personally to Prince Nayef .
Because he leads Saudi Arabia 's counterterrorism efforts against al Qaeda , the prince is a key target for the terrorist group .
Al Asiri concealed the bomb , made of PETN , in his underwear , according to the official Saudi investigation .
PETN is a plastic explosive that is not picked up by metal detectors -- through which the would - be assassin had to pass before he was allowed to meet with the prince .
Saudi officials believe that the prince 's assailant exploded the 100 - gram device using a detonator with a chemical fuse , which would also not be detected by a metal detector .
When the bomb went off in Prince Nayef 's Jeddah home it killed the assassin , but the prince survived the attack , sustaining only minor injuries .
Similarly , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab allegedly attempted to bring down Northwest Airlines flight 253 using a PETN bomb that was not discovered by metal detectors .
A federal security bulletin obtained by CNN said Abdulmutallab claimed to investigators that the explosive device used Friday " was acquired in Yemen along with instructions as to when it should be used . "
A senior U.S. counterterrorism official says it is " rare " for PETN to be used in a terrorist attack .
The method of concealment , the use of PETN and the origin of the bomb -- Yemen -- make the Prince Nayef assassination attempt and the Northwest plot an almost perfect match .
" I believe that , after the attack on the prince , the fear of using similar techniques against airplanes , which was discussed openly in the media , has encouraged al Qaeda cells to try it , " a Saudi counterterrorism official said ,
PETN was also used by Richard Reid , an al Qaeda recruit known as the shoe bomber .
He concealed a bomb made of PETN in his sneakers when he tried to bring down an American Airlines flight flying from Paris , France , to Miami , Florida , almost exactly eight years ago during the busy holiday travel season .
Feature article offers comment from Perle , Feith , spokesman for Grossman , as well as information and comment in support of the FBI translator / whistleblower 's charges of nuclear treason ...
Brad Friedman Byon
10/21/2009 , 12:58 pm PT
The military news outlet Military.com is covering the story of FBI linguist - turned - whistelblower Sibel Edmonds as their lead story today .
Reporter Bryant Jordan 's 1,500 word feature includes a background summary of Edmonds ' story , which The BRAD BLOG has been detailing for years , and a summary of the allegations she offered under oath last August in her sworn deposition following seven years of " forced silence " under a court - ordered gag due to the so - called " State Secrets Privilege " twice - invoked by George W. Bush 's Department of Justice .
A good round - up of the startling information Edmonds says she gleaned while listening to and translating wiretaps in the counterintelligence division at the FBI after 9/11 is offered throughout his coverage .
Jordan 's piece is well reported and includes , for the first time to our knowledge , several forms of denials of Edmonds allegations by some of Bush 's key State and Defense Department officials --- such as Richard Perle and Douglas Feith --- who , she says , were participants in espionage plots against the United States in order to share military and even nuclear secrets with Turkish and Israeli government operatives .
Edmonds also offers a very spirited and seemingly common - sense response to those denials ( one of which is rather ironic in retrospect ) and to critics who maintain she has been offering these allegations due to some form of vendetta .
If you 're not already familiar with Edmonds ' story , we 'll recommend Jordan 's full article at Military.com , just as we have previously recommended the excellent cover - story interview by CIA vet Philip Giraldi at American Conservative magazine also published following her 8/8/09 deposition in which she was finally able to tell her story publicly and on the record for the first time .
She did so as the Obama Dept. of Justice chose not to invoke the " State Secrets Privilege " when they had the opportunity this time .
If you are already familiar with her story , then read on , as we 'll try to highlight the new information in which Jordan advances the story a few beats --- as every other U.S. mainstream corporate media outlet has simply failed to since Edmonds ' remarkable allegations have finally become public ...
Jordan ledes with the background on the specific aspects of Edmonds ' far - reaching allegations which he will then expand on throughout much of his coverage :
After seven years of forced silence , a government whistleblower is opening up on what she learned while working as a Turkish translator for the FBI in the wake of 9/11 .
In sworn testimony to attorneys on Aug. 8 , Sibel Edmonds described a Pentagon where key personnel helped pass defense secrets to foreign agents or provided them names of knowledgeable officials who were vulnerable to blackmail or co-option .
And firmly rooted in this espionage program in the 1990s , according to Edmonds ' deposition , were two men who , with the election of George W. Bush as president in 2000 , found themselves in the Pentagon : Douglas Feith , who would head the Office of Special Plans , and Richard Perle , who would become chairman of the Defense Advisory Board .
" They were 100 percent directly involved , " Edmonds told Military.com .
" They were not in the Pentagon [ in the late 1990s ] but they had their people inside the Pentagon . "
One of those people , she said , was Larry Franklin , an Air Force officer assigned to the Office of Special Plans who , in 2003 , passed classified information to representatives of the American Israel Public Affairs Office , or AIPAC .
By then Feith was leading the OSP .
With that in place , Jordan offers various forms of " emphatic " denials from both Perle and Feith --- something which , apparently , other U.S. news organizations have been unable or unwilling to do at all up until now .
( Note : The BRAD BLOG has requested comment from a number of those accused by Edmonds , including former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Marc Grossman , former Ambassador to Turkey and Under Secretary of State in the Bush Administration who is said to have been the U.S. ring - leader in the operation .
Both have refused multiple requests for comment . ) :
Perle , today a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and board member for or adviser to other think tanks , including the National Institute for Neareast Affairs and the Center for Security Policy , emphatically denied Edmonds ' claims in an interview with Military.com .
" This woman is a nutcase .
Certifiable , " Perle said .
" She makes wild accusations .
She was fired from her job , and has been on a vendetta against … imagined demons ever since . "
Feith , in an email to Military.com , said : " What I 've read on the Internet about Ms. Edmonds 's claims about me is wildly false and bizarre . "
Defense Department spokesman Lt. Col. Eric Butterbaugh declined comment , saying any investigation into such allegations would be carried out by the FBI .
An FBI spokesman said the bureau 's policy is not to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation .
You 'll note that Perle engaged in a direct ad hominem attack on Edmonds ' character in his direct quote --- a non-denial denial , if you will - but he is not directly quoted as actually denying the charges , even as Jordan reports that Perle " emphatically denied Edmonds ' claims in an interview with Military.com . "
So if Perle actually did deny the charges directly , we 'll have to take Jordan 's word on that for the moment .
It should also be kept in mind that Perle was one of the key Bush Administration players at the State Department advocating war against Iraq both before and after 9/11 , claiming Saddam Hussein had WMD and " ties to Osama Bin Laden . "
He had also been highly critical of the CIA for not acting on information being supplied by Iraqi defectors , such as Aghmed Chalabi and others , whose information was regarded by the agency as dubious long before it was ultimately and fully discredited .
All of that is worth keeping in mind as Perle charges that Edmonds is " a nutcase " chasing " imagined demons . "
Military.com also received another general , blanket denial .
This one from The Cohen Group , the D.C. lobbying firm where Grossman now serves as Vice Chairman .
The Cohen Group has not answered several requests for comment from The BRAD BLOG in the recent past .
As we 've previously reported , the firm , which has represented both Turkey and Israel , sells itself with this pitch : " Mastering the complex and often veiled dynamic where government , politics , media , and business intersect requires a rare combination of knowledge , skills and experience .
Our Principals bring centuries of experience at the White House , the State Department , the Defense Department , and Congress . "
Founded in 2001 by President Clinton 's former Republican Secretary of Defense , William Cohen , the company 's website goes on to note : " The Cohen Group 's reach extends internationally where our Principals have developed great expertise and relationships with key political , economic and business leaders and acquired valuable experience with the individuals and institutions that affect our clients ' success abroad . "
Instead of receiving a direct denial from Grossman --- who , we presume , declined to respond directly to Military.com for some reason --- the article offers a denial from Robert S. Tyrer , co-president of Grossman 's lobbying firm :
Edmonds claims that much of the Pentagon information found its way into the hands of both Israeli and Turkish operatives through the State Department , courtesy of Marc Grossman , then assistant secretary of state for political affairs , the third - highest ranking member at State .
As she described in her Aug. 8 testimony , " certain people from Pentagon would send a list of individuals with access to sensitive data , whether weapons technology or nuclear technology , and this information would include all their sexual preference , how much they owed on their homes , if they have gambling issues , and [ Grossman ] would provide it to these foreign operatives , and those foreign operatives would go and hook those Pentagon people . "
Robert S. Tyrer , co-president of The Cohen Group , a Washington lobbying firm where Grossman is now a vice chairman , told Military.com in an email that Edmonds ' allegations against the former ambassador " are completely untrue and ludicrous . "
Jordan goes on to offer a direct response from Edmonds to the notion that she has been disclosing all of her information as form of bizarre vendetta , as charged by Perle in his non-denial denial quoted above :
After seven years of silence , Edmonds said she was glad to be able to finally divulge some of what she had been forced to keep in , but she doubted any government agency would seriously pursue her claims .
There is no indication the current Justice Department is reopening an investigation , she said , and neither politicians nor mainstream media have shown an interest .
" I did it [ testified ] under oath , " she said .
" I have a very successful financial life , I 've been married 18 years .
I have a family , I have a daughter , I have a lot to lose .
I 'd have to be either mentally insane or someone who does n't have anything to lose , [ who ] just makes allegations and lies under oath , " to claim these things if they were not true .
The article also offers information and statements in support of Edmonds from others , such as from 18 - year FBI executive John M. Cole .
Cole , who , as The BRAD BLOG covered in detail two weeks ago , had corroborated several key elements of Edmonds ' allegations , including confirmation that Grossman had been targeted by a " decade - long investigation " by the FBI " which ultimately was buried and covered up . "
Cole has also called for a " Special Counsel " to be named to " investigate [ the ] allegations and have people 's feet held to the fire .
Have them be held accountable for their actions " in this matter .
He also added a chilling note to his comments , which we reported at the time [ emphasis taken from his original , recorded statement ] : " You know , it really irritates me that people are getting away with murder , in some cases .
They should not be allowed to get away with that .
There needs to be accountability . "
In Jordan 's article , Cole comments on an aspect of Edmonds ' allegations which have a fresh resonance this week , following the arrest of a top U.S. Dept. of Defense scientist busted by the FBI in a sting operation after he was allegedly attempting to sell nuclear secrets to an undercover agent he had thought was representing Israel :
One of Edmonds ' believers is John M. Cole , a former FBI counterintelligence analyst and author of " While America Sleeps : An FBI Whistleblower 's Story . "
Cole , who worked for the bureau 18 years and now works for the Defense Intelligence Agency at Offutt Air Force Base , Neb. , said the pattern of espionage described by Edmonds is familiar to him .
" In the 1990s I was responsible for Western Europe and Israel [ counterintelligence cases ] , " Cole told Military.com .
" We did have ongoing investigations of officials in the State Department and also the Department of Defense . "
And he said cases did extend outside the Pentagon , to various Air Force Bases and the RAND Corp . - something Edmonds also stated in her testimony .
As she has previously , Edmonds echoed Cole 's statements about " ongoing investigations " of various State and Defense Department officials as well as various contractors .
Apparently scientist Stewart David Nozette , who was arrested this week for attempting to sell nuclear secrets to Israel precisely as Edmonds has long charged in her allegations , had been both an official at the Defense Department and a private contractor sharing information he had collected while working at nuclear facilities and the Pentagon .
According to Edmonds , those sought out by Turkish and Israeli agents might actually be working outside the Pentagon .
As a result , she testified , the foreign operatives managed to put on their payroll individuals " on almost every major nuclear facility in the United States , RAND Corporation and ... various Air Force labs that develop certain weapons technology . "
...
“ There is a black market for everything , including for nuclear - related information , weapons technology , ” she told Military.com .
Finally , in a related note here , we 'd like to flag your attention to blogger " Connecticut Man1 " who , at ePluribus Media , has been digging and connecting a few interesting dots in the arrest of Nozette , reported by the DoJ to have travelled to an unspecified " Foreign Country A " as part of his alleged Israeli espionage bid .
The blogger has collected some information which suggests that " Foreign Country A " could , perhaps , be Turkey , said to have been working very closely with Israel in all of the matters discussed in Edmonds ' charges .
" It is starting to look like a conspiracy theorist 's dream , " Connecticut Man1 concludes , " Or just what Sibel Edmonds was talking about all along . "
Uh , yeah .
Or , we could just take the discredited Richard Perle 's word for it --- as so many in the indispensable U.S. corporate media seem to have done --- that " this woman is a nutcase . "
We report , you decide .

Court last week , a hearing date has been set for next month and a summons was due to be served on Friday .
The case stems from a criminal trial during which Bill spent two years fighting charges based on his wife 's allegations .
He was eventually acquitted , but the ordeal cost him his job , his home and about $ 450,000 in lost income and legal costs .
The case is also based on similar accusations of sexual abuse of their children made by the ex-wife during a bitter Family Court battle .
The Family Court judge found Bill 's ex-wife to be violent , untruthful , lacking moral values and responsible for the psychological and emotional abuse of her children - but still gave her custody of the two girls , now aged 9 and 11 , because they had become estranged from their father .
By contrast , Bill was found to have shown " laudable forbearance in the face of the most challenging circumstances " .
Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show about 2.5 million Australians are denied access to family because of family law proceedings , and about 680,000 fathers see their children as little as once a year .
ABS figures also show 700,000 children have no meaningful contact with one of their non-custodial parents - mostly fathers .
Bill said yesterday he was bringing the case because he felt betrayed by the justice system .
" The Family Court have cut me off from my children effectively because of false evidence brought by my wife , " Bill said .
" In 2005 , she went to the police and made the allegations and then prepared the children on what they should say .
The result was my kids were taken away from me .
" I proved my own innocence and that she had lied on both occasions - in the criminal trial and in the Family Court matter .
" My life with my kids was destroyed .
If people can lie in court and hurt others by their utterances and statements , what is the point of the law ? "
The case will intensify the current national debate over the operation of the Family Court and the principle of shared parenting , which is under attack by women 's groups and is being reviewed by the Rudd Government .
Bill 's ex-wife is facing charges of perjury , assault and making a threat to kill .
The charges allege that she knowingly and wilfully made 10 pages of false statements to police in September 2005 and perjured herself by repeating the allegations in a sworn affidavit during a Family Court hearing in 2008 .
She is also accused of threatening to kill Bill in 2004 and of assaulting him with chopsticks and fingernails in 2000 .
Law Institute of Victoria chief executive Michael Brett Young said private criminal prosecutions were rare , but not unheard of .
" This man will have to prove his case , like anyone else , in the criminal courts , " Mr Young said .
The former keyboard player died on Tuesday in the Isle of Man
A former keyboard player with Echo and the Bunnymen has been killed in a motorbike crash on the Isle of Man .
Jake Brockman , who was 53 and married , lived in Bristol .
He died when his bike was in collision with a converted ambulance near Kirk Michael on Tuesday .
Known to fans as the " Fifth Bunnyman " , he had been associated with the Liverpool band since its 80s heyday and became a full - time member in 1989 .
In 1989 the band 's first drummer Pete De Freitas died in a similar crash .
' Invariably seasick '
A spokesman for the Isle of Man Police confirmed Mr Brockman 's death .
In a statement , his family and wife Sally Mundy said : " Jake was always a classic bike enthusiast , he loved sailing though he was invariably seasick .
" Music was central to Jake 's life . "
Mr Brockman formed the dance band BOM with Bristol - based musician Damon Reece .
He also worked as a sound recordist for the BBC 's natural history unit on several projects .
Mr Brockman , who was born in Borneo , studied at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School .
The band has paid tribute to Mr Brockman on its official website .
He was was riding along the Kirk Michael to Ballaugh Road on Tuesday evening when the accident happened .
Mr Brockman was taken to Noble 's Hospital but died from his injuries a few hours later .
Investigations into the crash are continuing .
Feminist and out “ radical lesbian ” Mary Daly died Sunday at the age of 81 .
A philosopher and known mostly for of her controversial work in theology , she shaped many of the arguments held today about women and their relation to religion .
Daly jumped on the feminist scene as a major voice with her first book , The Church and the Second Sex , published in 1968 , which is considered on par with The Feminine Mystique as far as influence on the women ’s movement .
Daly followed up with Beyond God the Father : Toward a Philosophy of Women ’s Liberation in 1973 .
Daly was on the theology faculty at Boston College for more than 30 years , though the university tried to fire her after her first book .
Student outrage helped her keep her job .
Her practices were certainly not without critics , though .
She ruffled a few feathers when she protested Condoleezza Rice ’s commencement speech at Boston College .
And her refusal to allow men to attend her classes outraged many for sexism .
That policy eventually led to her retirement as part of a legal settlement .
Daly once wrote in The New Yorker : “ Ever since childhood , I have been honing my skills for living the life of a Radical Feminist Pirate and cultivating the Courage to Sin , ” she wrote in the opening of “ Sin Big . ”
… The word ‘ sin ’ is derived from the Indo - European root ‘ es - , ’ meaning ‘ to be . ’
When I discovered this etymology , I intuitively understood that for a woman trapped in patriarchy , which is the religion of the entire planet , ‘ to be ’ in the fullest sense is ‘ to sin . ’ “
She was known to have a wry , wicked sense of humor and a way with words , which means she left behind many “ colorful ” quotes :
The fact is that we live in a profoundly anti-female society , a misogynistic “ civilization ” in which men collectively victimize women , attacking us as personifications of their own paranoid fears , as The Enemy .
Within this society it is men who rape , who sap women ’s energy , who deny women economic and political power .
The Boston Globe ‘s tribute to Daly quotes Sister Joan Chittister , a feminist author and a member of the Benedictine Sisters of Erie , Pa. , as saying : “ Her legacy is a cloud of women witnesses and male theologians , too , who have now been released into whole new understandings of what the tradition really holds and really means for all of us , male and female .
She was a great thinker , she was a great icon .
She will be maligned by some , but history will see her very differently . ”
The National Catholic Reporter goes into more detail about her specific theological theories .
NPR has an audio story on her life .
We do n’t agree with all or most of her philosophies ; her ideas about transgender identity were particularly regressive .
But by pushing the envelope in so many areas , Daly broke important ground for the women ’s movement .
Her concentration on theology helped attack one of the greatest bastions of patriarchy : religion .
As she once said : “ There are and will be those who think I have gone overboard .
Let them rest assured that this assessment is correct , probably beyond their wildest imagination , and that I will continue to do so . ”
We hope her work — and discourse around the weaknesses of her work — inspires many to “ continue to do so . ”
Finished .
I ’m finally finished .
It took a total of 243 hours of downloading ( 42 hours ) and uploading ( 201 hours ) to complete the entire process .
Insanity .
I honestly hope no one has to ever do this ( or at least to this scale ) .
But , if you happen to find yourself in a place where you ’re going to do the switch , here ’s one way of doing it that ’s been 100 % successful .
Of course , results ( and time required ) will vary since much of this is based on your availability , your uptime with your internet provider , and your speed ( up / down ) .
And , if they do n’t shut you down or throttle your bandwidth …
For a sake of comparison and full disclosure , here ’s what SpeedTest . net rated my ISP and connection speed .
I will also add that I was not directly connected to the internet ever ( ethernet ) and went wireless the whole time .
Although these numbers may seem impressive it hardly sustained this throughout the week and some change .
Finally , after the walk through you ’ll find my justification of abandoning Flickr and moving to Picasa , despite having a good deal left on the paid Pro account .
I ’d imagine that this will interest a number of my readers , so it ’s at the end folks .
Ready ?
Set ? Go .
1. Make Flickr Sets
The first thing you ’ll need to know is that software that I used requires that your pictures be in sets in Flickr .
This is n’t a hard thing to do and luckily I had ordered about 99 % of my pictures in sets already .
For the images that were “ floating ” I just created a random set called “ Z ” and threw them all in there .
Do this first before you do anything else !
2. Privacy and Permissions
You ’re going to want to make sure that the application that I used ( PhotoGrabbr – See below ) has access to your images .
Make sure your Privacy and Permissions Settings are the following in your Flickr Account :
3. Download PhotoGrabbr
There have been a number of applications that are out there including one that apparently could help migrate directly from Flickr to Picasa ( Migratr ) but that application required that you give it your username and password ( I was n’t comfortable with that ) and it broke on install ( made me feel even more anxious about it ) .
Instead , I found and used PhotoGrabbr , which is a miracle app .
I downloaded it and it worked like a charm :
A few things to remember when you use this , the first being that your “ username ” is not the same thing as your web address name .
This was somewhat confusing at first :
The second being that downloading files sometimes “ time outs ” due to overuse of the API ( according to them ) .
I found that the “ Download All Photos ” broke a lot .
What I did , especially since I had 21,000 + images and media was to check off 3 - 5 sets at a time and just hit “ Download ” .
You ’ll want to make a note of each set , how many images are in each , and then confirm after completion that you did , in fact , download every image .
If the download does “ break ” on you you ’ll have to delete the folder ( Set ) and re-attempt the download or you ’ll get duplicate files ( it ’ll add a “ - 1 ” to the copy ) .
I had to do this a number of times .
Finally , PhotoGrabbr downloads ONLY IMAGES and NOT VIDEO .
What it ’ll do is download a “ screencap ” of the video and not the video itself .
This is probably the only drawback and if you ’ve got a lot of videos this can be significant .
4. Begin Downloading !
This is the fun ( or exceptionally boring ) part .
Begin downloading .
Make sure to confirm downloads and make note of all videos in your sets that will not be downloaded fully .
Have fun .
5. Download Missing Videos
To download your videos you ’re going to have to do this manually .
Unfortunately I had exactly 666 videos ( I ca n’t believe that , what a stinky number to have ) and this took a lot of manual labor and a strained wrist .
There are two ways in which you could do this , the first being going through each of your sets and visually identifying the “ videos ” ( small play arrow ) in your set , opening each up , clicking the embed button and then scrolling to the bottom and hitting download :
Clicking the “ Embed ” button :
Scrolling down and then finally downloading the darn file :
That ’s the first way ( or at least what you ’d have to do in the second too ) .
The other way is to sort through the online file manager by
First you ’ll have to sort through videos by going in to the online file manager , clicking “ More Options , ” then “ Videos ” and then editing them , opening each photo page individually so that you can proceed with the downloading :
This , of course , can help if you have no idea where all your videos are and if they span tons of different sets ( like my situation ) :
Regardless of your situation it ’ll be a tedious and time - killing process .
Prepare for the suck .
Thankfully I was able to download up to 30 at a time and it only took a “ few ” hours .
Not .
6. Download Picasa , Upload Like a Mofo , Pay For More Space
Now , the rest of the process is pretty easy .
Download Picasa from Google , make sure you ’ve got enough space ( I had to upgrade to 80 GB plan ) and then wait for the sync :
As you can see , I ’ve already used about 77 % of my space .
I ’ll be upgrading to the next plan of 200 GB pretty soon .
Make sure you Upload the “ Original Size ” to get a full version onto your site :
Fun times .
7. Wait and Make Sure It Syncs 100 % !
And , of course , for me , this was just a long waiting process ( 201 hours ) .
The problem with uploading so much media is that the synchronization process was n’t perfect .
I had to confirm upload for a few folders and double check the media count .
( Time seemed to slow down here and drag on forever .
Image from FJTU . )
No software is perfect , so it ’s your job to confirm the uploads !
And that ’s that .
Why I Moved From Flickr to Picasa
The simple answer to this question is this :
My mother .
Fact is that my mom is n’t on Flickr .
But , she ’s on Picasa .
And it ’s all about showing my mother pictures and videos of my daughter .
Picasa makes this transfer and sharing easy as pie .
She can even download the images into her system and computer and then print it out .
Win .
Oh , and Google apparently owns the world .
I ’ve got so much invested in their products that I might as well have put my stuff there anyway .
I needed some more space on my GMAIL account too .
Google Apps for Small Business is the shiznittle , BTW .
But , for those interested , here are some additional reasons why Flickr is the bomb ( and not in a good way ) :
Flickr has no significant desktop application .
What a loss .
And no , I do n’t consider their “ Uploader ” a serious desktop application .
In fact , it ’s nothing compared to Picasa .
I mean , Picasa has an amazing desktop application that is dead - simple to use and “ mom - proof ” as they say .
Win .
Flickr ’s online experience is slow .
When you get over about 10,000 images it starts taking more than a few seconds to actually get into the editor and to even view the sets !
In fact , on average , it took about 10 seconds to load my junk .
I could go to the fridge , crack open a diet - coke and be back before it finishes loading .
Sad forever .
The layouts and user experience has n’t really changed .
Like , in years .
I want more viewing options for goodness sake .
The online editor is slow , clunky , and broken .
Sad .
In fact , I hate it .
It ’s terrible .
The slideshow technology Flickr has sucks .
Slow .
Ca n’t freaking download your pictures in batches .
This is a serious issue .
Why should I have to “ hack ” or use alternative programs to get my silly pictures down ?
Quality of HD videos just is n’t cutting it .
This might be me , but my Vimeo Pro account kicks the living snot out of Flickr .
This is n’t even mentioning the level of customization that Vimeo has and that Flickr does n’t .
Vimeo is worth every penny .
The 90 - second rule in Flickr is lame .
Enough said .
( Ca n’t believe I bought into that crap … )
Flickr has n’t improved their product in years .
It ’s obvious to anyone with half - a- brain that Yahoo !
is going down the drain and they are n’t willing to invest in one of their marquee online products .
Picasa , on the other hand , continues to innovate and pump out new features .
But , to be fair , Picasa is n’t perfect either .
One of the most serious grievances I have is the fact that you ca n’t download the movies at all .
And , the video quality is the same if not worse .
Oh well , that ’s why I have Vimeo ( and backups ) .
But , at least my mom can watch the videos .
Love your thoughts , comments , flames , whatever .
In the end , the move was a personal one and it should be the same for you .
No pressure or dogmatism from this side of the fence ; do what you gotta do .
Now , if I just had the time to finish all this facial recognition stuff …
* sigh *
It never ends .

The cows will still give their milk and their owners will still savour frothy mouthfuls straight from the farm .
But now , the infamous cow - share program of Durham , ON , is legal in the eyes of the law .
In a surprise move , a Newmarket court ruled Thursday that dairy farmer Michael Schmidt is allowed to continue his raw milk co-operative and that his venture does not break laws against selling unpasteurized milk .
Government officials had little to say about the decision Thursday afternoon .
But dairy experts say the ruling will spur more cow - share programs to form and encourage the underground co-ops already operating in Ontario to surface .
And , they say , it will likely force the government to change its laws to allow the sale and distribution of raw milk in the province .
Food activists , chefs , proponents of the local and slow food movements and those who scorn excessive government regulations see the ruling as a victory for their causes .
But few were more thrilled than Schmidt ’s dedicated contingent of some 200 cow - share members .
“ This is beyond our wildest hopes , ” said Judith McGill , who has been a cow - share member at Schmidt ’s Glencolton Farms for four years .
“ We are now out and we will build . ”
Toronto chef and restaurateur Jamie Kennedy was one of the more than 100 people waiting outside the courthouse who greeted news of the ruling with cheers , hugs and happy hand shakes .
“ This is a wonderful first step because it recognizes that raw milk is in our society , that there are people who freely choose to engage and feed their families this product , ” Kennedy told the Star Thursday evening from his Gilead Café and Bistro .
The next step , he said , is to fight to make raw milk available to anyone who wants it in Ontario .
He hopes one day to be able to serve foods made from raw milk in his restaurants .
“ It would contribute to the experience of my patrons who have come to my place to eat , ” he said .
“ And that ’s where we are going in our sophistication in food culture . ”
Art Hill , professor and chair of the University of Guelph ’s Department of Food Science , said the ruling , which provides a legal way for Ontarians to consume raw milk and for farmers to sell their farm - fresh product , will likely prompt changes in the dairy industry .
“ This ruling signals that it is time to create a system where the sale of raw milk is legalized , but controlled , ” said Hill .
“ We have to work now at finding ways to make raw milk available as safely as we can . ”
Hill noted the sale of raw milk is not uncommon in other jurisdictions , including the United Kingdom .
About half of U.S. states have legislation that allows consumers access to raw milk , either directly from farms or at grocery stores .
Justice of the Peace Paul Kowarsky ruled Schmidt ’s cow - share program is exempt from legislation set out in Ontario ’s Health Protection and Promotion Act and the Milk Act .
He found Schmidt not guilty on 19 charges under the two acts .
The verdict came one year after Schmidt ’s trial began in January 2009 .
The 55 - year - old farmer defended himself against the charges .
In his 40 - page ruling , which took almost three hours for him to read to the court , Kowarsky said it was beyond his jurisdictional authority to abolish or amend the legislation that requires all milk sold or distributed in Ontario to be pasteurized .
Kowarsky said he focused his decision on whether or not Schmidt ’s cow - share program circumvented the law .
Schmidt has long maintained he does not break the law by providing milk to the cow ’s owners , all of whom purchase a portion of the cow and pay to board the animal at Glencolton Farms .
The prohibition on raw milk in Ontario does not apply to farmers drinking raw milk from their own cows .
Kowarsky ruled Schmidt ’s cow - share program did not break the law because the farmer only provided milk and raw milk products to his members , did not advertise or market his operation , and that cow - share members were aware they consumed milk at their own risk .
He said it was also essential to note “ There is no evidence that anyone ever became ill as a result of the consumption of the defendant ’s milk products ... ”
Hill said consumers need to be aware the purported benefits of raw milk do not outweigh its well - established and substantial risks .
Milk that has not been pasteurized can contain potentially deadly pathogens , including Salmonella , Listeria and E. coli 0157 :H7 , the same strain that killed seven people in Walkerton in 2000 .

Warnings against drinking raw milk are regularly issued by Health Canada , medical associations and local health units .
Officials maintain the laws are in place to protect public health .
According to the Ontario ’s ministry of health , there were 145 cases of reportable enteric illness associated with unpasteurized milk in Ontario between 2005 and 2009 .
Spokespersons for two local health units , the health ministry and Ontario ’s ministry of agriculture , food and rural affairs said each is carefully reviewing the court ’s decision .
“ There is an appeal period and we are considering our next steps , which may include an appeal , ” said health ministry spokesperson Andrew Morrison .
The Dairy Farmers of Ontario has its legal counsel reviewing the decision and has already expressed its support and concern directly with the Ministry of the Attorney General , said spokesperson Bill Mitchell .
“ At this point , my expectation would be that the Ontario government would appeal the decision and defend the legislation and take all steps necessary to protect public health , ” Mitchell said .
Kathryn Boor , professor and chair of Cornell University ’s Food Science Department , said the ruling is “ absolutely being watched outside of Ontario . ”
Earlier this month , health officials warned B.C. residents against drinking unpasteurized milk distributed from raw milk producers in that province .
Ontario raw milk advocates say a similar trial over the constitutionality of raw milk laws is expected in British Columbia .
“ The entire population of people who drink raw milk , and which seems to be growing , is certainly mindful this case was underway , ” said Boor .
“ The expectation is that a ruling of this nature would have an impact on some arguments made in the U.S. as well . ”
As he left court Thursday , Schmidt drank deeply from a glass of raw milk , thanked his supporters and said he was glad to help in their fight for food rights .
“ We want to be responsible for our food , ” said Schmidt , who mentioned his intent to run for provincial government .
“ Standing up for basic rights is a moral obligation and that 's what we did .
I could not have done this alone . ”
The above quote comes from Anne Sweeney , president of the Disney - ABC Television Group , whose daughter insisted her dorm room did not need a TV thanks to Hulu and other streaming sites .
It 's the sound of panic setting in .

And she has good reason to be scared that an entire generation does n't find a television to be an essential household item .
People are flocking to the web to watch streaming shows , but the networks still are n't making any money off these views .
Hulu , the largest streaming site , is getting over 40 million visitors a month who are viewing 5 billion minutes of shows and clips .
And that number is only going up , while TV viewership is going down .
These content creators need to figure out a way to monetize this phenomenon , and fast .
Because the genie is out of the bottle , and there 's no putting him back in .

Deposed Honduran President Manuel Zelaya will be allowed to leave the Brazilian embassy in the capital , Tegucigalpa and go into exile on January 27 , maybe .
Zelaya was overthrown by a military coup on April 28 of last year , and sent into exile in Costa Rica .
He returned later by a secret route and has been ensconced in the Brazilian embassy since then .
A massive resistance movement led by unions , peasants ’ organizations and other sectors has been demanding his return and the removal the coup installed president , Roberto Micheletti .
However , an election on November 29 , carried out by the coup government and denounced as illegitimate by much of the world chose the National Party ’s Porfirio “ Pepe ” Lobo as president , and the handover of power is scheduled for January 27 .
Lobo has announced an arrangement whereby his government will give Zelaya a safe conduct to leave the embassy and go to the Dominican Republic , by prior agreement with its president Leonel Fernandez .
Various scenarios have been suggested for the next steps , including that Zelaya will go and live in Mexico .
Previously , the Micheletti government said it would agree to allow Zelaya to go into political asylum in Brazil , but that this must include an agreement that Zelaya not be allowed to participate in Honduran political affairs .
Otherwise , Zelaya would have to face criminal charges in Honduras , including treason and abuse of power .
The Honduran constitution , which Costa Rican President Oscar Arias has described as “ the worst on the face of the earth ” , defines even broaching the subject of constitutional change by anybody in office as being treason .
The pretext for the overthrow , arrest and exile of Zelaya was that he had lent his support to a campaign for a non-binding referendum in which the people of Honduras were to be asked if they wanted to vote on November 29 about a later constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution .
This poll was to take place on the day the coup was carried out .
In fact , Zelaya had annoyed the landholding and business oligarchy by raising the minimum wage , increasing workers rights , beginning a land reform plan , promising justice for victims of right - wing death squads , and refusing to let his country continue to be a base for U.S. subversion against left - wing governments such as those of Cuba and Venezuela .
He had also annoyed the United States by joining his country to ALBA , the Bolivarian Alliance for the People of our America , a left - wing economic , trade and political bloc involving Cuba , Venezuela , Ecuador , Bolivia , Nicaragua , Dominica , Antigua and Barbuda and St. Vincent and the Grenadines .
During the Contra Wars of the 1980s , Honduras was the main launching pad for death squads who penetrated Nicaragua and El Salvador to carry out massacres of teachers , health workers and others .
Many of the Honduran participants or enablers of those activities are still involved in Honduran military and political institutions .
On the U.S. side , many of the people who supported the Contra War from Honduras are still very active .
The overthrow of Zelaya was strongly supported and abetted by right - wing circles in the United States , including major figures in the Republican Party and some Democrats .
At the outset , the Obama administration denounced the coup and reasserted its position that Zelaya was the legitimate president .
However , later on it greatly disappointed the Honduran resistance and the Latin American left by breaking ranks with most countries in the area and announcing that no matter what happened , it would recognize the results of the November 29 elections .
Since that time , killings of Zelaya supporters ( and a few on the other side ) have continued on the streets of Honduras .
The Congress voted to withdraw Honduras from ALBA .
The Micheletti regime announced that six army officers involved in removing Zelaya from the country would be put on trial , including General Romeo Vasquez Velasquez , the army head .
However , as Zelaya immediately pointed out , there is less to this than meets the eye , because it is certain that if these officers are found guilty they will immediately be pardoned .
A pardon is in the offing for all persons involved in the coup , but not for Zelaya or his supporters .
Pepe Lobos has a difficult situation to face .
Very few heads of state are going to show up for his inauguration on January 27 , and many sanctions remain on his government .
Therefore he has an interest in “ resolving ” the situation for the sake of the perceived legitimacy of his government .
This is the motive behind his efforts to find away to get Zelaya out of the embassy .
The U.S. State Department has been pressuring Micheletti to step down before the inauguration , to give the handover more of an appearance of legitimacy .
Micheletti has not done so but has agreed to become invisible in the interim .
At this writing , according to the pro-Zelaya newspaper El Libertador ( http://ellibertador.hn/Nacional/3708.html), the public prosecutor of Honduras , Alberto Rubi , who is not an appointed member of the president ’s cabinet , has thrown a monkey wrench into the arrangement for the departure of Zelaya by suggesting that the Lobo - Fernandez - Zelaya deal may be illegal because Zelaya still faces the “ treason ” charge , and that Lobo may be prosecuted if it is carried out .
The Honduran resistance is now focusing on the fight for a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution .
On Squawk Box this morning , Jim Chanos reiterated his call for a major Chinese real estate bust on the horizon .
One eye - opening stat :
There 's currently 30 billion square feet of Chinese real estate in the works , which would work out to a 5x5x5 cubicle for every man , woman , and Child in the country .
Yeah , that does n't sound good .

CAPE TOWN , South Africa 
Host nation South Africa will face Mexico in the opening game of the 2010 World Cup , and then play two former world champions -- France and Uruguay .
Still , South Africa coach Carlos Alberto Parreira , was confident the hosts would advance out of the tough group .
" We will make it , " he said , adding that the key will be the June 11 opener against the 15th - ranked Mexico .
" We need to have a win to have that confidence . "
South Africa is ranked 86th in the world compared by will be able to count on strong support in the 87,000 - capacity Soccer City stadium .
" I do n't envy the Mexicans who are going to be subject to 90,000 vuvuzelas , " said South Africa defender Matthew Booth , referring to the loud horns that Bafana Bafana fans love to use .
A huge gasp went up from the 3,000 - strong crowd when Oscar - winning actress Charlize Theron announced that Mexico would play the opener .
Worse was to come for South Africa when France , ranked seventh in the world , was also put in group A . The French will play the often decisive last group game against the hosts .
" Sometimes no comments speak louder than words , " said Theron , the presenter .
South Africa coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said inevitably was going to be difficult .
" All the groups are tough , " he said .
" We have two world champions in our group , and that will give us even more motivation to prepare .
Home field advantage only helps if you are well prepared . "
South Africa has only won one game in its history against the three opponents combined , a 2 - 1 victory over Mexico four years ago .
France has never lost against South Africa and beat it in the opening game of the 1998 World Cup , which it hosted and won .
" We will be proud to face the host nation , " France coach Raymond Domenech said .
" We wanted this to fully appreciate the atmosphere of African football . "
Some 30,000 at the Fan Fest in central Cape Town were hoping the country could rise above the mediocre play of the last few years .
" Anything can happen .
That is why it is the World Cup , " said 42 - year - old Ranks Lehloenya .
Yoliswa Sotsopo , 34 , was even more positive .
" It is not a tough one , we are comfortable , " Sotsopo said .
Some of the opening matches have set World Cups off on the right track .
Four years ago , Germany was considered dour and short on attacking flair .
After its 4 - 2 win over Costa Rica , the host rode its momentum into the semifinals and finally finished third .
In 2002 , the opener was one of the biggest shockers when outgoing world champion France was supposed to have an easy ride against Senegal .
Bouba Diop decided otherwise , leading the Africans to a perfect start with a 1 - 0 win .
France never recovered and was eliminated in the group stage .
It was not the only time Africa made such a splash in the first game .
In Milan in 1990 , African football truly came onto the international scene when Francois Omam - Biyik scored for Cameroon to beat defending champion Argentina .
Diego Maradona and Argentina did recover from the shock and lost the cup only in the last minutes of the final against Germany .
Argentina had a similar start in 1982 in Spain , when it also was the defending champion .
That time , Erwin Vandenbergh scored the only goal for an upset Belgian win .
There have also been some awful duds to kick off the World Cup , as three scoreless openers from 1966 to 1974 illustrate .
As host , South Africa was already sure to play the opener at Soccer City .

A decade ago the great worry about nanotechnology was that it could quite literally destroy the planet .
As Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy warned in his essay “ Why the Future Does n’t Need Us , ” self - assembling nanobots could potentially spread out of our control ( Mis - ) programmed to replicate ad infinitum , these subsentient bots would spread across the landscape as a gray goo of devastation , consuming the earth and every unlucky creature who called it home .
Nowadays we can only wish that our planet - dooming scenarios were so far - fetched .
Our existential worries revolve around the all too immediate problems of global warming and disease , and nanotechnology — incorporated into improved solar panels , wind turbines or drug delivery mechanisms — could , if anything , emerge as an important tool to fight these threats .
Yet like any new technology , nanomaterials carry with them potential both for good and for harm .
The most salient worries concern not a gray goo apocalypse but rather the more prosaic and likely possibility that some of these novel materials may turn out to be hazardous to our health or the environment .
Because ordinary materials display unique properties at the nanoscale , the nanometer - size bits of a seemingly benign material might turn out to be noxious .
As John D. Young and Jan Martel report in “ The Rise and Fall of Nanobacteria , ” even naturally occurring nanoparticulates can have an deleterious effect on the human body .
If natural nanoparticulates can harm us , we would be wise to carefully consider the possible actions of engineered nanomaterials .
The size of nanoparticles also means that they can more readily escape into the environment and infiltrate deep into internal organs such as the lungs and liver .
Adding to the concern , each nanomaterial is unique .
Although researchers have conducted a number of studies on the health risks of individual materials , this scattershot approach cannot provide a comprehensive picture of the hazards — quantitative data on what materials , in what concentrations , affect the body over what timescales .
In response to this uncertainty , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently announced a grand research strategy to study the health and environmental effects of nanomaterials , a welcome step that many have been advocating for years .
We hope that the program will help build a robust database that will give policy makers and the public the facts needed to understand the possible health risks that specific nanomaterials might create .
And although it would be unwise to rush careful research efforts , speed is paramount .
According to the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies , more than 1,000 consumer products containing nanomaterials are available in the U.S. , a number that is quickly growing .
We also emphasize speed because of the EPA ’s alarming recent history with a similar research program .
In 1996 Congress directed the EPA to conduct a comprehensive screening program for endocrine disruptors in the environment .
These chemicals interfere with the body ’s hormonal system and can lead to abnormal development of the sex organs , infertility and cancer .
Although the U.S. has banned the production of known endocrine disruptors such as PCBs and DDT , other common chemicals — most notably bisphenol A ( BPA ) and some pesticides — may also affect the body ’s endocrine system .
Even for a government agency , the EPA ’s response to the congressional directive was woefully indolent .
Instead of quickly beginning to study the thousands of suspected endocrine disruptors that may exist in the nation ’s drinking water , the EPA spent the next decade building a labyrinth of committees and subcommittees to evaluate what materials might be worthy of study and the methodologies that should be used to study them .
By 2002 — six years after the program began — the EPA got so far as to devise the selection process it planned to use to choose the first 50 to 100 chemicals that would eventually be subject to analysis .
In 2007 the agency published a draft list of those chemicals .
In April 2009 it finalized the list .
And triumphantly , in late October , 13 years after the program began , the EPA announced that it would begin research .
The country cannot afford a repeat of this farce — and not just because of the public health concerns .
With so many nanomaterials already on the market and such little public awareness of nanotechnology , one safety scare might convince consumers that all nanotechnology is dangerous .
( Witness Europe ’s attitude toward genetic modification for an example of how a culture can turn against an entire class of innovation . )
In addition , without clear scientific and regulatory guidance , many companies are hesitant to invest in nanotechnology R&D , fearing the exposure to legal action that could result if one day a technology is deemed dangerous .
Procter & Gamble , for example , is not pursuing na­notechnology because of the long - term risk of litigation .
This uncertainty is putting people ’s health at risk and choking innovation .
And with all the threats the planet faces , we need all the little bits of innovation we can get .
' Coming out as a gay actor ruined my career in Hollywood , ' says actor Rupert Everett
Rupert Everett has said coming out as a gay man has harmed his career in the film business
Actor Rupert Everett is urging gay stars not to ' come out ' and to keep their sexuality a secret as it could end their film career .
The 50 - year - old My Best Friend 's Wedding star came out as gay 20 years ago and admitted that since then , he has been given supporting roles and not lead parts .
Everett is now suggesting that aspiring actors stay in the closet as it could harm their career .
He said : ' It 's not that advisable to be honest .
It 's not very easy .
And , honestly , I would not advise any actor necessarily , if he was really thinking of his career , to come out ...
' The fact is that you could not be , and still cannot be , a 25 - year - old homosexual trying to make it in the British film business or the American film business or even the Italian film business .
' It just does n't work and you 're going to hit a brick wall at some point .
You 're going to manage to make it roll for a certain amount of time , but at the first sign of failure , they 'll cut you right off .
' And I 'm sick of saying : " Yes , it 's probably my own fault . "
Because I 've always tried to make it work and when it stops working somewhere , I try to make it work somewhere else .
' But the fact of the matter is , and I do n't care who disagrees , it does n't work if you 're gay . '
However , Everett added that he does believe he is happier than those other major stars who are keeping their sexuality a secret .
He said : ' I think , all in all , I 'm probably much happier than they are .
I may not be as rich or successful , but at least I 'm vaguely free to be myself . '
Supporting roles only : Rupert starred alongside Julia Roberts in the 1997 hit My Best Friend 's wedding
But despite Everett 's insistence that he is being overlooked for lead parts , his supporting roles have been quite prominent ones .
In 2007 , he landed a cross- dressing role in the first St Trinian 's movie as the school 's headmistress Miss Camilla Fritton , and a second starring part as Miss Fritton 's dodgy art dealer brother Carnaby , both main characters in the film .
He was then cast to play Miss Fritton in the sequel , St Trinian 's 2 : The Legend Of Fritton 's Gold , due for release on December 18 .
He also had the lead male role in The Next Best Thing , which starred Madonna as a yoga teacher who has a baby with her gay best friend , played by Everett , who was praised for the part , despite the film being a total flop .
And he lent his voice to the part of Prince Charming in the second and third Shrek films , which have become international box - office hits .
Obama set to bypass Congress and approve massive transfer of wealth to world government
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Friday , December 18 , 2009
The final Copenhagen draft agreement which was hammered out in the early hours of Friday morning includes provisions for a global tax on financial transactions that will be paid directly to the World Bank , as President Obama prepares to bypass Congress by approving a massive transfer of wealth from America into globalist hands .
As Lord Monckton , Alex Jones and others warned , the notion that the globalists would achieve nothing at Copenhagen has likely been a ruse all along .
The elite look set to ram through the lion ’s share of their agenda , which would include a massive global government tax at a cost of at least $ 3,000 a year for American families already laboring under a devastating recession , double digit unemployment and a reduction in living standards .
Hillary Clinton arrived yesterday to rally global leaders around a resolution and Barack Obama is set to be portrayed as the savior of the world by rescuing what was pitched all along as a conference doomed to fail .
“ The summit “ hangs in the balance , ” said Obama this morning .
“ We are running out of time .
The time for talk is over .
It is better for us to act than to talk .
The question is whether we move forward together or split apart . ”
The final agreement may not force countries to meet CO2 emission targets , but it will grease the skids for the biggest tax hike in human history , a fact that establishment media outlets have completely failed to emphasize .
Monckton told the Alex Jones
Show last week that the initial secretive draft version of the Copenhagen agreement represented a global government power grab on an “ unimaginable scale , ” and mandated the creation of 700 new bureaucracies as well as a colossal raft of new taxes including 2 percent levies on both GDP and every international financial transaction .
Monckton said that the new world government outlined in the treaty would be handed powers to , “ Tax the American economy to the extent of 2 percent GDP , to impose a further tax of 2 percent on every financial transaction …. and to close down effectively the economies of the west , transfer your jobs to third world countries . ”

As the leak of the Danish text outlined , such taxes , earmarked as “ climate financing , ” will go straight into the coffers of the IMF and the World Bank .
These funds will be used to bankroll the imposition of global governance that UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon promised would be achieved at Copenhagen .
According to the latest news out of Copenhagen , the taxes that were included in the initial text are still in the final agreement which is set to be passed later today or in the early hours of Saturday morning .
The Sydney Morning Herald reports that the final text , “ Proposes a range of innovative mechanisms for raising the money , ranging from a tax on air and sea transports fuels to a tax on financial transfers . ”
This would form part of an initial commitment of $ US10 billion a year from 2010 to 2012 , climbing to $ US50 billion annually by 2015 and $ US100 billion by 2020 , although these figures will inevitably increase if the UN ramps up its climate fearmongering as it has done at each successive climate conference since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 .
The treaty outlines , “ Penalties or fines for non-compliance , ” in developed countries and the creation of an international police force to “ enforce its will by imposing unlimited financial penalties on any countries whose performance under this treaty they do n’t like , ” Monckton told the Alex Jones Show , saying that it amounted to a total global government takeover on an “ unimaginable scale ” .
“ We ’re looking at a grab for absolute power and absolute financial control worldwide by the UN and its associated bureaucracies and 700 new bureaucratic bodies , ” said Monckton , adding that if the agreement was signed by Obama , the U.S. would be losing its freedom to a “ sinister dictatorship ” being formed under the contrived pretext of global warming .

I am super excited and a little sad to say that I wo n't be posting on this blog anymore .
I have been wanting to create a new blog that is just dairy / glut ...
4 years ago
' I received a text message saying , " I 'm really sorry , Mum , I do love you , but we do n't want to be father and daughter any more .
We 're having a relationship " '
When I met Mike , my second ­husband , my youngest ­daughter from my previous marriage was 12 years old .
Mike raised Lisa as if she were his ; she called him Dad and even changed her surname by deed poll to match ours .
He and I went on to have three children of our own .
In the eight years Mike and I were ­together , he always treated Lisa like a daughter .
Or so I thought .
Four and a half years ago , Lisa ­decided to work abroad .
My ­husband reacted badly , which I could n't ­understand .
She was 20 and , with three younger children , the house often seemed cramped .
I 'd been e­ncouraging Lisa to find a place of her own , which Mike always ­resisted .
He 'd say , " She 's our daughter , she can stay as long as she wants . "
Once she 'd gone , Mike became withdrawn and moody .
He said he needed a break and went to visit Lisa .
A week later he returned , bringing her with him .
That was my first inkling some­thing was n't right .
Then I thought , " No , this is your husband , your daughter , you 're losing the plot . "
But the uncertainty kept ­niggling at me .
Eventually I confronted Lisa , who stormed out of the house .
Four hours later , I received a text message saying , " I 'm really sorry , Mum , I do love you , but we do n't want to be father and daughter any more .
We 're having a relationship . "
In shock , I phoned my husband .
He said he loved me , he loved the children , but he loved her , too .
He said he could n't be with either of us , because he did n't know which way to turn .
But he did n't come home that day .
He never came back again .
The news tore through our family , provoking very different reactions .
People did n't know what to say .
Some turned away .
Others became angry .
My older children went through hell .
I virtually had a nervous breakdown – I 'd lost my husband and daughter , two people I 'd also classed as very good friends .
How long had it been going on ?
Friends have since told me Mike and Lisa always seemed ­unusually close ; some suggested he had been " grooming " her ; others said she'd had a crush on him even as a 12 - year - old and set out to get him .
I do n't believe Mike abused my daughter – I think their sexual relationship began when he started seeing her as a woman rather than a child .
Nevertheless , he was someone she 'd called Dad , and he was old enough to have been her father .
Three days after they left , I took everything from Lisa 's room and up to the top of the garden – clothes , personal things , even bedding – and burned it .
For six months , I ­really blamed only her .
Mike and I had a horrendous court battle over the house , which I won – he wanted a share of the money to set up a home with Lisa .
He stopped seeing the children after I insisted he could visit them only on his own .
It seemed he was trying to recast Lisa as a stepmum to her own half - siblings , which was upsetting and confusing .
Over time , I 've put my life ­together .
I went back to university and started training to become a social worker .
I felt as if I 'd been to hell , and was just about free .
Then , three weeks ago , Emma , one of my older daughters , gave birth to my first grandchild .
I was sitting on the ward , cradling the newborn , when I glanced up and saw Lisa and Mike at the ­reception desk .
They had n't come to visit Emma – it 's unlikely they even knew she was in the hospital .
Lisa was heavily pregnant .
No one spoke .
The ward sister , who I know well , ran over and said , " I 'm so sorry .
I thought you knew . "
She pulled a curtain across and took me into a private room , where I broke down .
Afterwards , I sent Lisa a note .
It just said , " I hope you 're OK and everything goes well with the baby .
Mum . "
I did n't expect a reply , and I did n't get one , but regardless of what 's happened , she 's still my daughter .
If she knocked on the door tomorrow , I would n't turn my back on her .
I will never have contact with my second grandchild .
I would n't be welcome , I know that .
It would mean Mike and Lisa having to ­confront what they 've done , and what this child means .
I feel sorry for the child , too , because at some point , years down the line , he or she will need to know the truth , and how will that feel ?

The economics of open - air markets
John List
Little is known about the basic economic principles of open - air markets and bazaars , which have existed for centuries .
This column explores the fundamental underpinnings of such markets .
While exchange prices approach the prediction of competitive market equilibrium theory , such markets are ripe for price manipulation .
Bilateral bargaining has constituted the foundation of markets for centuries , from peasant economies – such as Athen ’s Agora , Rome ’s Forum , the medieval fairs and markets in England , and the 1,000 year old market in Morocco – to the substantial bazaars and “ flea ” markets that litter the landscape of developed and developing countries today .
Geertz ( 1978 ) , for example , found that up to two - thirds of the population of the Moroccan town he studied was employed at the local bazaar .
Despite the importance of such markets in shaping economies of yesteryear and allocating goods and services today , little is known about the basic economic principles of such markets .
For example , whether the bread and butter of economics – supply and demand curve shape and location – provide accurate predictions of price and quantity realisations in such domains is relatively unknown .
In recent research , I use open - air markets as my experimental laboratory to explore the fundamental underpinnings of such markets ( List 2009 ) .
My general line of attack is to undertake controlled experiments in these markets where factors at the heart of my conjecture are identifiable and arise endogenously .
I then impose the remaining experimental controls to learn something about underlying market behaviour and equilibrating tendencies .
A key result from the field experiments is the strong tendency for exchange prices to approach the prediction of competitive market equilibrium theory .
Even under the most severe tests of neoclassical theory ( treatments that predict highly asymmetric rents ) the expected price and quantity levels are approximated in many market periods .
These results suggest that in mature markets very few of the “ typical ” assumptions , such as Walrasian tâtonnement or centrally occurring open outcry of bids and offers , are necessary to approximate the predicted equilibrium in the field ( see also List , 2004 ) .
Yet , such markets are ripe for price manipulation .
For instance , in certain cases small numbers of sellers provide homogeneous goods that are jointly purchased from middlemen , barriers to entry exist , and seller communication is continual .
Indeed , via interaction with an individual seller in this marketplace , I learned interesting details of just such conspiracies in these markets .
Armed with knowledge from my “ mole ” and using insights gained from months of interaction in the market , I am able to build a bridge between the lab and the field , effectively exploring the behaviour of experimental subjects across sterile and rich settings .
This approach has a dual benefit in that it affords an opportunity to marry the vast experimental literature on collusion in laboratory experiments with parallel behaviour in the field .
How effective is collusion ?
For more than 100 years , economists and historians serving as expert witnesses , commissioners , and jurists have laboured to assess the “ effectiveness ” of cartels ( Conner , 2005 ) .
Throughout the years , those critical of aggressive antitrust policy have embraced the Stiglerian notion that cartels are fragile coalitions , fraught with cheating that will eventually produce outcomes that more closely mirror competitive expectations .
For example , when the OPEC cartel began to influence world petroleum prices in the early 1970s , several leading economists predicted its imminent demise .
Adelman ( 1972 , p. 71 ) wrote that “ Every cartel has in time been destroyed by one and then some members chiselling and cheating … ”
An excellent recent overview of cartel activities is provided by Levenstein and Suslow ( 2006 ) .
They conclude that even though many cartels collapse within a year , the average cartel in their sample lasted between 3.7 and 10 years ( see p. 51 , Table 1 ) .1
The effect that cartels have on prices is less well understood .
Conner 's ( 2005 ) survey identified hundreds of published social - science studies of private , hard - core cartels that contained 674 observations of long - run overcharges .
The primary finding is that the median cartel overcharge for all types of cartels over all time periods is 25 % ; 18 % for domestic cartels , 32 % for international cartels , and 28 % for all successful cartels ( the overcharge rate is calculated by comparing cartel prices to a competitive benchmark ) .
In these regards the experimental data presented in my study provide some interesting parallels .
First , consistent with Stigler ( 1964 ) , the natural field experimental data suggest that maintaining strict compliance to the collusive agreement is difficult to sustain in a repeated game with secret price cuts and demand uncertainty .
In this manner , the data are consonant with the notion that inherent problems associated with maintaining collusive agreements might preclude conspiracies from having considerable influence on prices in similar market structures .
Second , however , in those cases where collusion was stable ( the lab and framed field treatments ) , much surplus was lost .
Sellers were able to exact large price increases through explicit collusive arrangements and such conspiracies frustrated market efficiency considerably .
These contrasting insights from nearly identical experimental situations highlight a general lesson for policymakers ; transference of results across situations ( or time , or different industries ) is dangerous .
Theory teaches us that the determinants of cartel success are rich , and the empirical data herein highlight that sellers are quite sensitive to these factors , even ones that many might consider ancillary .
In this spirit , one prominent aspect of the data is that one should take great care when generalising results .
Theory and comparative static empirical insights can inform us of general principles , such as when and where to expect collusion , and when to suspect that collusion is having an important influence on pricing and allocation decisions .
But , statements on the actual existence , or efficacy , of collusive arrangements are quite difficult to make without actually investigating the industry itself .
I conclude in noting that empirical work measuring comparative statics , such as those in this study , can provide a hint about where to look for fire but cannot determine by themselves whether there is an actual fire worth extinguishing .
Footnotes
1 This bimodality of cartel survivorship has been the subject of intense research and our understanding of its causes is just beginning to crystallize .
While cheating is certainly an important factor , Levenstein and Suslow ( 2006 , p. 45 ) argue that “ the most frequent causes of cartel failure are entry and bargaining problems . ”

STOCKHOLM ( Reuters ) - Arsonists set fire early on Wednesday to a giant straw statue of the Swedish Yule goat , a forerunner to Santa Claus in Sweden , defying security measures for a third year in a row .
Police in Gavle , north of Stockholm , said an unknown number of attackers had torched the goat in the early morning hours , leaving a blackened skeleton standing in the town square .
“ It ’s a tradition to burn it down , ” Lofberg said .
“ It ’s happened an untold number of times since the 1960s ... it ’s been burned down more years than it ’s survived . ”
Burning the goat has been a popular , and illegal , tradition in Gavle since the 1960s when an advertising executive first came up with the idea to endow the city with a giant replica of the goat , a Christmas decoration common in many Swedish homes .
There were no witnesses , but a bottle of lighter fluid was found near the goat ’s frame , which stood about 12 meters tall at the apex of its horns , police told Reuters .
“ We have some leads , ” said Stefan Lofberg , who is leading the investigation for the Gavle police .
Police have tried a range of tactics to stop would - be arsonists , including posting guards near the straw goat , coating it with flame retardant and training security cameras on it .
But vandals have usually found a way around the foils and their assaults have become more elaborate : in recent years the goat has been run over , dragged into a river and attacked by arsonists dressed as Santa Claus and the Ginger Bread Man .
Flame retardant coating thwarted attempts to burn the goat in 2006 , but the group sponsoring it then stopped flame - proofing it because of the ugly , brownish tinge its straw took on .
Goats have special meaning in Swedish Christmas tradition .
Before Santa
Claus became ubiquitous at the turn of the 20th century , men would dress up as goats and hand out presents to well - behaved children .
Bad children received lumps of coal .
TANA , West Bank–Israeli forces knocked down shelters that were home to about 150 Palestinians in the Israeli - occupied West Bank on Sunday , Palestinian officials said .
A spokesman for the Israeli authorities in the West Bank , occupied by Israel since a 1967 war , said 14 " illegally constructed structures were removed . "
They had been built on a military training ground , " endangering the lives of those present " , Lee Hiromoto , the spokesman , said .
Atef Hanini , a local Palestinian official , disputed the Israeli justification and said the Palestinian farming community had lived in the area of Tana , east of Nablus , for decades .
A mechanical digger ploughed through what remained of one of the shelters and a Palestinian woman remonstrated with Israeli soldiers at the scene .
The structures included homes , stables and a school .
Hanini said the residents had defied Israeli instructions to demolish the structures themselves .
Hiromoto said numerous warnings and evacuation orders had been issued .
Under interim peace agreements with the Palestinians , Israel exercises full military and civil control over some 60 percent of the West Bank , a zone known as " Area C " .
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a December report that Israel 's restrictive planning regime in Area C meant tens of thousands of Palestinians were left with no choice other than to build without authorisation , risking the demolition of their homes .
The U.N. body said it recorded the demolition of 180 Palestinian - owned Area C structures in 2009 .
The demolitions displaced 319 Palestinians , including 167 children .

One in four drivers has been targeted by yobs throwing objects at their vehicle
The growing problem is now so bad that 70 per cent of drivers say they fear for their safety whenever they pass under a bridge .
Eighty per cent of motorists have seen vandals throwing objects such as stones or rocks into the road , while 94 per cent want preventative measures on bridges , such as higher fences or CCTV cameras .
Autoglass , which commissioned the survey , cited cases where motorists have been killed after objects were thrown at them .
Delivery driver John Wells , 28 , was killed last year in a pile - up when three young children threw stones at traffic near Merthyr Tydfil in south Wales .
A girl of 12 and two boys aged 15 and 14 were later convicted after admitting they did it “ for a laugh ” .
Even yesterday police were hunting yobs seen throwing stones at cars travelling on the M25 .
Autoglass managing director Nigel Doggett said : “ We fix thousands of windscreens every day and so we see first - hand the consequences of the actions of these mindless yobs .
San Francisco ’s equal marriage trial , now in its third week , has been marked by moving testimony about the pain denial of marriage has inflicted on same - sex couples and their families and the discrimination and abuse gays and lesbians continue to experience in their everyday lives .
In the first - ever trial in federal court on marriage equality , plaintiffs Kristin Perry and Sandy Stier of Berkeley and Paul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo of Burbank seek to overturn California ’s Prop. 8 on grounds it violates the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution .
The constitutional amendment passed by voters in 2008 defines marriage as between a man and a woman .
The plaintiffs rested their case Monday after introducing videos produced by Prop. 8 backers , claiming equal marriage would lead to pedophilia , polygamy , incest and bestiality .
Attorneys for the two couples had earlier called as a hostile witness William Tam , director of the Traditional Family Coalition and one of five official proponents of the constitutional amendment .
During the campaign , Tam wrote to supporters that “ other states would fall into Satan ’s hands ” if equal marriage prevailed in California .
Defense attorneys opened their testimony by calling Claremont McKenna College political science professor Kenneth Miller , who sought to counter earlier testimony by Stanford University academic Gary Segura that gays and lesbians lack “ meaningful ” political power despite some backing in high places .
Miller claimed anti-gay discrimination is declining , and said gays and lesbians have powerful political , corporate , union and media allies .
Under cross-examination , however , Miller acknowledged the military ’s “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy , the federal law defining marriage as between a man and a woman , and the absence of openly gay elected officials in any California statewide office .
He also acknowledged his testimony was partly based on information supplied by the defense attorneys .
A highlight of the trial ’s second week was the account by San Diego ’s Republican mayor , Jerry Sanders , of how his attitude toward equal marriage was transformed .
As his daughter , a lesbian , and her wife watched from the gallery , Sanders said that though he and his wife wholeheartedly accepted their daughter ’s relationship , he had remained an opponent of same - sex marriage .
Sanders said he initially planned to veto a City Council resolution supporting a court challenge to the state same - sex marriage ban , and his daughter said she would support his decision .
But after a discussion with gay and lesbian friends , he reached a different conclusion .
“ About 15 people spoke that night , ” Sanders said .
“ But before the first one was finished , I shared their disappointment .
It was then that I realized that all opposition to same - sex marriage , including my own opposition , was grounded in prejudice . ”
Sanders signed the resolution , and despite predictions his political career would be ruined , he was re-elected mayor the next year .
Among other highlights of the trial ’s first two weeks :
• Gregory Herek , a psychology professor at the University of California - Davis , said the vast majority of self - identified gay men and lesbians believe they have little or no choice about their sexual identity , and that therapy to change sexual orientation has no scientific basis .
He said “ change therapies are especially harmful because they present the view that homosexuality is an illness or disorder , ” leading people to think they are personally and morally at fault when the therapy fails .
His testimony was supported by that of a gay man who described his pain at being subjected to the therapy by his family .
Witnesses have also testified that gay and lesbian parents are just as qualified as “ straight ” parents to raise children , and that procreation is not central to marriage .
• San Francisco ’s chief economist , Edward Egan , told the court that legalizing same sex marriage would lower the city ’s health and welfare costs .
“ Married individuals are healthier , on average , and behave in healthier ways than single individuals , ” resulting in less absenteeism , more productivity , higher wages and payroll taxes , Egan told the court .
He added that married people are more likely to have health insurance than are singles or domestic partners .
• Plaintiffs Perry , Stier , Katami and Zarrillo described in detail their feelings of discrimination over not being allowed to wed , and their outrage at the anti-gay slurs put forth by Prop.
8 ’s supporters .
Defense attorneys dropped four witnesses they originally planned to call , after the witnesses made statements during deposition harming the case for Prop .
8 . The defense claimed the witnesses feared harassment if their testimony was broadcast during the trial , but initial plans to stream video of the proceedings were nixed by the U.S. Supreme Court before the trial began .
Chief U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn
Walker ’s decision in the non-jury trial is widely expected to be appealed , and ultimately to reach the U.S. Supreme Court .
Introduction
The earliest evidence for notions of hell related to Hinduism are found in the Vedic texts , which date from c. 1500 1000 BCE .
In the long tradition of Hindu literature there was a significant development in the concept of hell from the period of the Vedas through the period of the Puranas ( c. 300 1500 CE ) .
The earliest descriptions are vague , particularly in terms of topography , alluding only to an underground , dark , putrid place for punishing sinners .
Later descriptions calculate the huge dimensions and designate almost innumerable subdivisions of hell .
Segmented Hell
Infernal otherworlds are either integrated , where all sinners and punishments are amalgamated in one space , or segmented into different spaces , each one a place for a particular punishment usually associated with a particular sin .
Hindu hell , originally one space in Vedic literature , became segmented in the epic literature and Puranas , until approximately 80 names for different hells could be identified .
The few names found in the earlier literature were later reused , often as the names for major divisions .
For instance , “ Raurava , ” mentioned in the Ramayana ( c. 200 BCE ) , became a major division of hell later when the names and numbers of major hells and their subdivisions proliferated .
The Vamana Purana ( c. 3001000 CE ) mentions 21 hells , while the Padma Purana ( c. 1000  1400 CE ) delimits seven , each with six divisions , or 42 , each divided into two sections  for deliberate and non-deliberate sins  bringing the total to 84 hells .
Roughly contemporaneous with the Padma Purana , the Agni Purana ( c. 1200 1500 CE ) mentions 5 major divisions of hell , 28 subdivisions , and 140 other hells .
Rivers are generally prominent features of hell , and one usually forms the infernal border .
Hindu hell descriptions enumerate six , seven or as many as 99 rivers .
Most often these are unnamed , but the Vaitarani , mentioned first in the Mahabharata ( c. 600 BCE ) , forms a border around hell and is sometimes considered a hell itself , while the Agni Purana mentions specifically the Salmali as one of the major rivers .
Deeds  or Karma  and Punishment
Although early texts discuss hell as a place of punishment for gods defeated in cosmic battles , from the Vedic period , in the second and first centuries BCE , there also was a clear relationship between earthly conduct or karma and afterlife destinies .
It would be difficult to call many of these deeds sins in a Western sense , since they often include actions that would simply be considered impolite , rude or unhygienic .
For urinating in front of a cow , a brahman , the sun or fire , for example , crows would rip the intestines out through the anus of the offender .
Here there is some anatomical relationship between the deed and the punishment , but often there is no clear analogy , and although souls would find their punishments specifically assigned for their deeds , there would be no clear symmetry between the two .
Punishments can be graphically described , but often the Sanskrit names for different hells substitute for descriptions , ranging from Ambarisa : a hell associated by its name with a frying pan ; to Lohapinda , a hell associated with red - hot iron balls ; and Vinmutra : feces and urine hell .
Each hell is simply one of many places where a soul might find itself , with or without connection to a particular deed .
Agency of Punishment
Yama has many soldiers , servants and attendants who carry our his work ; and hell is full of animal - like creatures , like the ever - present sharp - beaked birds , who act as guards there .
But one of the unusual features of Hindu hell is that as often as not there are no punishing agents specifically mentioned .
Those who suffer often act out their own punishments , forced to endure a destiny or undertake some course of action , rather than being the object of torture .
As the Ramayana explains , they eat the fruit of their own acts .
The various names of the hells indicate circumstances and conditions : for instance , Ghatiyantra is a hell associated by its name with a water wheel and also with an intestinal disease , characterized by diarrhea and ulceration of the mucous membrane of the digestive tract .
Gudapaka is a hell associated by its name with infections of the anal passage .
Other hell names indicate what souls will find .
In Kutasalmali , they find the kutasalmali tree  with its thick conical spines  which the denizens climb up and down , ripping their bodies apart , as if driven by some cosmic obligation .
Harrowing of Hell
The harrowing of hell is a motif that is found in Christian literature of the otherworld , most notably Christ ’s harrowing of hell from the New Testament , particularly 1 Peter , and Mary ’s harrowing of hell from the Apocalypse of Mary .
Three of the major Hindu Hell texts narrate a similar story : the descent into hell of a king , who has either been sent there mistakenly or to quickly purge a minor offense .
His very presence ameliorates the torture suffered by the inhabitants .
When he is encouraged to leave and assume his place with Indra or Vishnu , he refuses , insisting that he would rather dedicate himself to the relief of these souls than escape to his own reward , and claiming that the opportunity to offer relief is , in fact , a far greater reward .
Eventually his commitment to these souls effects their release .
This motif predates the Christian tradition and occurs first in the Mahabharata of 600 BCE , with King Yudhishthira ; then in Markandaya Purana of 300 CE , with King Vipashchit ; and finally in the Padma Purana of 1000  1400 CE , with King Mahiratha .
Hell and Reincarnation  or Samsara
None of the hell texts from the Vedic , epic or Puranic periods specifically discusses hell in the context of the doctrine of samsara , or transmigration of the soul .
However , it is a significant feature of Hindu hell that , unlike Christian hell for instance , the sentence is not eternal or infinite .
The time may add up to hundreds of thousands or millions of years , and for all practical purposes may approximate eternity , but in the end the soul will be released from hell and re-enter the world , assigned to a position based on the deeds or karma of the previous life , but also without memory of that life .
This is the result of a discussion between myself and Simon PJ a few weeks ago , inspired by recent discoveries of poor performance with mutable arrays ( eg. see Data .
Hash discussion on glasgow - haskell - users around October 2005 ) .
Note that all this applies to mutable arrays of pointers , i.e. IOArray and STArray , not to unboxed arrays , i.e. IOUArray and STUArray .
Current implementation
There are two primitive types : MutArray # and Array# .
We convert between them with :
unsafeFreezeArray# :: MutArr# s a -> State# s -> (# State# s , Array # a # ) unsafeThawArray# :: Array # a -> State# s -> (# State# s , MutArr# s a #)
An Arr# is not normally on the old - gen mutable list , unless ( a ) it has pointers to young gen objects , or ( b ) it has been recently frozen .
The implementation of unsafeFreezeArray # is a single write to the header word of the array .
The implementation of unsafeThawArray # is slightly more complex : if the array was not already on the mutable list ( indicated by the value of the header ) , then we add it .
Also , we change the header word to indicate that the array is now mutable .
A MutArr# is always on the mutable list .
Objects pointed to by Array # are eagerly promoted to the generation in which the Array # resides , with the aim that the Array # can then be removed from the mutable list .
It is only safe to write to a MutArr# , so if multiple threads are accessing an array , they should not be doing thaw / freeze tricks without extra locking around the array ( such behaviour can cause the GC to crash ) .
The Problem
The problem is that mutable arrays are always completely traversed on every GC .
To get around this , we can keep an array in a frozen state and thaw it just before writing , then freeze it again afterward .
This is a bit inconvenient , not to mention unsafe with multiple threads unless extra locking is used .
Furthermore , a modified array is completely scanned , whereas for larger arrays it would be much better to just scan the part of the array that had been modified ( known in the GC literature as " card- marking " ) .
The benefit of the current approach is that writing to a mutable array is a single write instruction , whereas to do card - marking or something else requires a write - barrier .
The unsafeThaw / write / unsafeFreeze sequence amounts to a write barrier , so if this is a common technique we should provide an easy way to do it , possibly making it the default .
Solutions
Leaving aside card - marking for now , let 's think about incorporating the write barrier in the write operation .
Suppose that mutable arrays are always kept on the mutable list , but the header word indicates whether the array needs to be scanned or not ( eg. we have MUT_ARR_DIRTY , MUT_ARR_CLEAN ) .
The array write op should ( a ) set the header to MUT_ARR_DIRTY , and ( b ) do the write .
The GC turns MUT_ARR_DIRTY into MUT_ARR_CLEAN when everything the array points to is in the same generation ( or older ) .
Downsides to this :
intitialising a mutable array , or doing block writes , will be more painful , because each write will have the write barrier ( perhaps not too painful )
How does freezing / thawing interact with this ?
We currently create immutable arrays by starting with a MutArr# , intitialising it , and then freezing it to make an Arr# .
We can still do this , exactly as now ( and with the same thread - unsafety ) , but initialization will be a bit slower due to the write barrier .
Block writes
We could try to provide for " block writes " , by allowing a thread to " open " the array for modification , and then " close " it again after it had finished writing , with all writes in between being done without a write barrier .
This would replace unsafeThaw / unsafeFreeze .
To do this safely , we would have to use some kind of synchronisation on the open / close ; techniques that we came up with were to increment ( atomically ) a counter in the array header , or to allocate a new heap object pointing to the array in the current thread 's allocation area .
Card marking
We could refine the write barrier so that it marks just part of the array as dirty , instead of the whole array .
The natural choice is to put the mark bit in the block descriptor for the current block , giving us a granularity of 4/8 k , which is possibly a bit large but other solutions are much more expensive .
Even this would significantly increase the cost of the write barrier , so it may be that we want a different kind of array type for this ( LargeMutArr# ? ) .
Furthermore , currently not all arrays have their own block descriptors ( " large objects " in GHC 's storage manager ) , the small ones are allocated in movable memory .
To do this , we would have to ensure that every array had its own block ( or check in the write barrier , which adds even more expense ) .
IORefs
This also affects IORefs , which are essentially single - element IOArrays .
I just noticed that GHC often has a large number of IORefs hanging around in the heap from the typechecker , and the cost of traversing the mutable list can dominate minor GCs .
Washington ( CNN ) --
The U.S. military 's Missile Defense Agency will practice protecting the United States from a simulated Iranian missile attack next month in an exercise using the agency 's newest missile - killing technology , Pentagon officials said Friday .
Previous tests have been focused on a missile trajectory that mimics an attack from North Korea , but the January test will have a trajectory and distance resembling an intercontinental ballistic missile launch from Iran .
At the same time , the agency will be testing its new " Capability - 2 " technology , with upgraded software and sensors loaded inside an interceptor missile that will be fired at the fake Iranian missile .
The Capability - 2 technology is designed to eventually replace the existing hardware the United States has in its two missile defense bases in California and Alaska , according to Rick Lehner , a spokesman for the Missile Defense Agency .
While intelligence assessments of that country 's capabilities now suggest an Iranian ICBM threat is as far away as 2020 , this test was planned more than three years ago , when the threat seemed much closer , Lehner said .
In the January test , the fake ICBM is slated to originate from the Missile Defense Agency 's launch facility in the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific while the interceptor missile will be launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California , according to Lehner .
Missile defense tests have been likened to hitting a bullet with a bullet .
This test will be even more difficult :
It will be like hitting a bullet head - on with another bullet , because any launch from Iran would have a trajectory that would require a U.S. interceptor missile hitting the target directly , Lehner said .
The missiles will be flying at speeds of between 17,000 and 18,000 miles per hour , according to Lehner , about 3,000 mph faster than tests involving mock North Korean missiles .
The speed will reduce the strike window , meaning the interceptor , also known as the " kill vehicle , " will have to work even faster at identifying and striking the target missile .
The United States has only two missile defense bases , one at Vandenberg , with three missiles , and the other at Fort Greely , Alaska , with 20 interceptor missiles at the ready .
Lehner said that if Iran were to launch an ICBM attack against the United States , the most likely defense option would be firing a missile from Alaska , because of the shorter distance around the globe .
The United States was prepared to put a third missile defense site in eastern Europe , but the Obama administration scrapped that option because of the reduced ICBM threat from Iran .
In its place , the administration said it will move ships with the capability of shooting down short - and medium - range missile from Iran which , they say , pose a greater threat to Iran 's neighbors and U.S. bases in the Middle East .
Author and journalist Webster G. Tarpley tells Russia Today that the case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab is not a matter of unconnected dots , but rather that of a protected patsy or puppet deliberately used by the US intelligence community for a Christmas Day provocation designed to facilitate US meddling in the civil war in Yemen , which is where Umar Farouk allegedly trained and was given his PETN device .
Banker ’s son Umar Farouk had been denied an entrance visa to Great Britain , and had been denounced to the US Embassy in Lagos , Nigeria as a possible terrorist by his own father in mid-November .
His one - way ticket to Detroit was bought in Ghana for cash , and he reportedly entered Nigeria illegally .
In Amsterdam , he was assisted at the Northwest Airlines gate by a “ well - dressed Indian ” who explained that Umar Farouk had no passport .
He did have PETN , the same substance supposedly used by the mentally impaired shoe bomber Richard Reid in his abortive attack of eight years ago .
In spite of all this , Umar Farouk ’s US entry visa was never revoked , he never made it onto the no-fly list , and he was never thoroughly searched .
These egregious lapses in normal procedure show that Umar Farouk was part of an orchestration sponsored by the CIA , which has now yielded 4 solid days of media hysteria .
Obama has formulated his new version of the Axis of Evil , composed of Afghanistan - Pakistan , Somalia , and Yemen .
In Yemen , a civil war pits the Saudi - backed central government against the Iranian - backed Shiite Houthi rebels , whom the US has bombed at least twice this month .
The goal here is to play Iran against Saudi Arabia so as to weaken both the pro-Moscow Ahmadinejad government in Iran , and also those Saudi forces that are fed up with their status as a US protectorate .
The US is openly now sponsoring a regroupment of “ al Qaeda ” ( the CIA Moslem legion ) in Yemen , including by sending fighters direct from Guantanamo .
The new CIA - promoted entity synthetic entity is “ Al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula or AQAP , a gaggle of US patsies , dupes , and fanatics which is claiming credit for the Umar Farouk incident .
The US hopes to further dominate the exit from the Red Sea and the Suez Canal , while also easing pressure on the battered US dollar by jacking up the price of oil in an atmosphere of tension on the Arabian peninsula .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is now Totalitariano to the left , and Incompetano to the right .
Rather than harassing travelers , she should resign or be fired along with the other corrupt , bungling , or complicit officials of the Obama administration involved in this false flag provocation .

Anjem Choudary is the group 's spokesman A radical Islamist group has cancelled plans to hold an anti-war march through a town famous for honouring the UK 's servicemen and women killed abroad .
Members of Islam4UK had planned to march through Wootton Bassett , Wiltshire , to honour Muslims killed in the Afghanistan conflict .
The government had been considering outlawing the group , which is said to have extremist links .
Earlier this week , Gordon Brown said plans for the march were " disgusting " .
Families of soldiers who died in Afghanistan had condemned the planned march , and MPs signed a motion calling on the home secretary and local authorities to prevent the protest .
Wootton Bassett has become the focus of public mourning , with hundreds lining the streets every time hearses carrying the repatriated bodies of killed UK service personnel are driven through the town from nearby RAF Lyneham .
' Maximum publicity '
On Sunday , a statement from Islam4UK 's leader , Anjem Choudary , said it had " successfully highlighted the plight of Muslims in Afghanistan " .
People in the town have lined the streets for the repatriation processions " We at Islam4UK have decided , after consultation with others including our Sheikh Omar Bakri Muhammad , that no more could be achieved even if a procession were to take place in Wootton Bassett , " he said .
The group denied members had planned to carry 500 empty coffins through the town .
Islam4UK had previously said it had chosen Wootton Bassett to create maximum publicity .
The News of the World reported on Sunday that Home Secretary Alan Johnson would outlaw the group on Monday .
The newspaper said comments made by senior members of Islam4UK and on websites breached the Terrorism Act .
A Home Office spokesman said the final decision on whether to ban the group rested with Mr Johnson but he would not confirm the plan .
The whole announcement was to get media coverage
James Gray MP
" Proscription is a tough but necessary power to tackle terrorism , " he said .
" Decisions on proscription must be proportionate and based on evidence that a group is concerned in terrorism as defined in the Terrorism Act 2000 . "
North Wiltshire MP James Gray said he was " extremely glad " Islam4UK had abandoned its plans , and he also condemned Mr Choudary 's actions as a " media stunt " .
" He was trying to make a political statement , the whole announcement was to get media coverage - he admitted that himself - and he achieved it .
He received lots of coverage , " he said .
Mohammed Shafiq , from the Ramadhan Foundation , said Mr Choudary had been deliberately provocative .
" His attempt to demonstrate at Wootton Bassett was set out to provoke hatred between communities and is not welcomed in the Muslim communities , " he said .
" He and his cronies have no support in the British Muslim communities . "

Dems Voting No on Prescription Drug Imports Receive More Pharma Money
Emily Calhoun | December 16 , 2009
December 16 , 2009 - Yesterday , the Senate voted against the importation of prescription drugs , 51 - 48 .
Offered by Sen Byron Dorgan ( D - ND ) as an amendment to the health care reform bill , the provision would pave the way for market access to cheaper prescription drugs , by relaxing restrictions on imports from Canada and other highly - developed countries .
In a bipartisan effort rarely seen in recent votes on health care reform , 30 Democrats sided with 17 Republicans and one Independent to kill the bill .
MAPLight.org found that Senate Democrats who voted to block imports , siding with drug companies , received an average of $ 73,678 each from drug companies over the past six years — 76 % more than Democrats who voted in favor of imports .
Among all Senators , those voting to block imports received an average of $ 85,779 each from drug companies , 69 % more than those who voted in favor of imports .
All Democrats ( and Independents )
Average to Yes votes ( allow imports ) : $ 41,894
Average to No votes ( block imports ) : $ 73,678
All Senators
Average to Yes votes ( allow imports ) : $ 50,767
Average to No votes ( block imports ) : $ 85,779
The pharmaceutical manufacturing industry is opposed to drug importation , claiming the risks of counterfeit medicines and sub - standard regulations could cause undue harm to consumers .
Senator Dorgan and 12 co-sponsors argue in the text of this bill that " a prescription drug is neither safe nor effective to an individual who cannot afford it . "
Dorgan estimates that the bill would save American consumers $ 100 billion over ten years .
Previous MAPLight.org research has also shown alignment of pharma campaign money and votes in Congress .
On a Medicare - related vote in September , Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee who voted in favor of pharma interests received 4.2 times more campaign money from pharma interests than Dems who voted against pharma interests .
And in May 2007 , the Senate voted to kill a similar effort to allow prescription drug imports .
Senators who voted in favor of pharma interests received three times more campaign money from pharma interests — $ 100,000 each over six years — than Senators who voted against them .
Note : Averages for yesterday 's vote exclude Senator Byrd , who did not vote , and recently elected or appointed Senators Roland Burris , Paul Kirk , and George LeMieux
Correction : Earlier post excluded Herbert Kohl from averages .

Imagine that your nation is entirely dependent on a belligerent and economically unstable foreign country for a precious commodity .
Imagine that without that commodity , your entire society would grind to a halt .
Got it ?
OK , now imagine that your nation is China , the belligerent nation is the US , and the commodity is CPUs .
For China to maintain its blistering pace of growth — about 8 percent over the course of the global financial meltdown — the nation 's leaders know they must transition to a postindustrial economy as rapidly as they transitioned to a free - market economy 30 years ago .
Computers are key to doing that .
The country 's demand for PCs is enormous .
The Chinese purchased 39.6 million of them in 2008 .
And that number is only going to climb — 75 percent of the population still does n't have access to the Internet .
But the vast majority of PCs sold in China are running central processing units created by the US companies Intel and AMD .
This poses a range of problems ; perhaps the biggest is that it locks China into paying first - world prices for CPUs .
China is also deeply reluctant to build military hardware on top of Western processors .
( And if that sounds paranoid , keep in mind that there 's concern in Washington over whether the US military should use American - designed chips that have merely been manufactured overseas . )
Given those issues , it 's not hard to understand why the Chinese government sponsored an ambitious initiative to create a sort of national processor .
Work on the Loongson , or Dragon Chip , began in 2001 at the Institute of Computing Technology in Beijing .
The goal was to create a chip that would be versatile enough to drive anything from an industrial robot to a supercomputer .
One of the first Loongson - powered computers appeared in 2006 , an ultracompact desktop PC known as the Fuloong ( Lucky Dragon ) .
It was built by the Chinese company Lemote , which soon followed that up with a cheap netbook .
And China is now boasting that a third - generation multicore Loongson chip , currently in the prototype stage , will be used to power a petaflop supercomputer .
China 's decision to roll its own processors has gone largely unnoticed in the West .
It should n't .
The country is incredibly motivated for the project to succeed — it has become a cornerstone of the National High - Tech R&D Program embarked upon in 1986 .
And we know that the Chinese are very good at leveraging economies of scale .
The Loongson chip is going to change more than just computer - ownership rates in the most populous nation on the planet .
It 's going to have a profound impact on computers everywhere .
For starters , it could help usher in an era of true post - Windows PCs .
Because the Loongson eschews the standard x86 chip architecture , it can't run the full version of Microsoft Windows without software emulation .
To encourage adoption of the processor , the Institute of Computing Technology is adapting everything from Java to OpenOffice for the Loongson chip and releasing it all under a free software license .
Lemote positions its netbook as the only computer in the world with nothing but free software , right down to the BIOS burned into the motherboard chip that tells it how to boot up .
It 's for this last reason that Richard " GNU / Linux " Stallman , granddaddy of the free software movement , uses a laptop with a Loongson chip .
Loongson could also reshape the global PC business .
" Compared to Intel and IBM , we are still in the cradle , " concedes Weiwu Hu , chief architect of the Loongson .
But he also notes that China 's enormous domestic demand is n't the only potential market for his CPU .
" I think many other poor countries , such as those in Africa , need low - cost solutions , " he says .
Cheap Chinese processors could corner emerging markets in the developing world ( and be a perk for the nation 's allies and trade partners ) .
And that 's just the beginning .
" These chips have implications for space exploration , intelligence gathering , industrialization , encryption , and international commerce , " says Tom Halfhill , a senior analyst for Microprocessor Report .
Will Loongson - based PCs make inroads with average consumers in the West ?
You can already order a Lemote netbook online .
It is n't any cheaper or better than other entry - level netbooks , and reviews from geeky hardware enthusiast sites are less than enthusiastic .
But these crude first - generation products hark back to another wave of boxy , underpowered consumer goods that were initially regarded as mere curiosities in the West .
They were called Toyotas .

The supposed usefulness of UK ID cards has been called into question by news that major travel companies are telling would - be passengers that ID cards are NOT valid travel credentials for travel in Europe .
Around 1,736 people in Greater Manchester have voluntarily paid £ 30 for biometric - based ID cards since a pilot programme was launched at the end of last month .
The Home Office said these ID cards could be used for travel in Europe , as well as being a means of identity in opening up bank accounts and the like .
However one ID card pioneer , Norman Eastwood from Salford , was denied passage on a P&O ferry from Hull to Rotterdam on Saturday after he was told he was n't going anywhere without his passport .
Dutch passengers with national ID cards issued in The Netherlands , by contrast , were allowed passage on the same journey .
The Home Office told El Reg on Tuesday that it informed P&O and other international carriers twice about the “ UK National Identity Card ’s design and security features ” in the the run-up to the issue of cards .
It said Eastwood ’s unfortunate experience was an isolated incident caused by P&O ’s local staff not being aware of the National Identity Card , a gap in knowledge the ferry firm has promised to plug .
However a timely investigation by the Manchester Evening News revealed that P&O were far from alone in not understanding how UK - issued ID cards can be used as an alternative to passports for travel in Europe .
Front - line customer service workers at nine major travel firms — including British Airways , Eurostar and BMI baby — told MEN reporters posing as would - be customers that ID cards are no good for travel .
Eight of the nine firms subsequently issued statements saying that their staff had given the wrong advice but Eurostar remained uncertain .
“ We are unable to confirm whether the ID cards are valid on Eurostar at this time , ” a Eurostar spokesman told the MEN .
Two German airlines , German Wings and Air Berlin ( both of which run flights from Manchester Airport ) , said that UK ID cards would not be accepted until they are officially recognised by the German government .
Only four travel firms quizzed by the MEN — Easyjet , Ryanair , Brittany Ferries , and KLM — said ID cards were sufficient for travel to Europe .
In a statement , the Identity and Passport Service ( IPS ) said it remained confident that the majority of travellers will have no problems using ID cards as an alternative to passports .
The National Identity Card is a valid document for travel and is as good as a passport in Europe .
We expect all carriers in the UK to accept National Identity Cards for travel as a legal duty and we are confident that the vast majority of travellers will have no problems using their Identity Card as a travel document .
Customers who are concerned or experience problems using their National Identity Card should call the Identity and Passport Service helpline on 0300 330 0000 .
The ID card scheme pilot programme that started in Manchester on 30 November has been expanded into Liverpool .
Ministers most recently signed off plans to expand the scheme , a watered - down version of an earlier , compulsory roll - out , to the north - west of England and Scotland and Wales starting 4 January .
A nationwide roll - out later next year is expected .
The opposition Conservatives have pledged to scrap the ID card programme if they are elected into government by a general election that must happen before the end of June 2010 . ®
HONG KONG  Somali pirates carried out a record number of attacks and hijackings in 2009 , despite the deployment of international warships to thwart them and a United Nations Security Council resolution to bring the fight against them to shore .
The Piracy Reporting Center of the International Maritime Bureau said Tuesday that pirates operating across the Gulf of Aden and along the coast of Somalia had attacked 214 vessels so far this year , resulting in 47 hijackings .
Twelve of those ships , with a total of 263 crew members , are currently being held for ransom by the pirates .
In 2008 , according to the maritime bureau , 111 ships were attacked in the region , a figure that itself represented a 200 percent increase from 2007 .
The hijackings continued this week with the seizure of a Greek - owned cargo ship and a British - flagged chemical tanker , both of which were taken on Monday .

Chronic Depression
This week , the Australian central bank became the first to declare victory .
It raised its key lending rate 0.25 % and gave a whoop … signaling an end to the slump .
The European Central Bank fidgeted and vaguely threatened to raise rates too .
But the Americans stayed in their trenches .
New York Fed governor Bill Dudley said that even though the economy is recovering , any rate hikes in the United States would be over his dead body .
Then , word came that even Alan Greenspan thinks a recovery is underway .
“ This is what a recovery looks like , ” said the maestro .
That settled the matter as far as we are concerned .
Alan Greenspan did n’t see history ’s biggest financial bubble until it exploded in his face .
In the following few words we undertake to show that Greenspan is as blind as ever .
“ Great time for US consumers , America is on sale , ” says an item at YahooFinance .
The “ discounts are unbelievable , ” adds a blogger known as Frugal Rhode Island Momma .
All across the nation , merchants are no longer selling the merits of their products ; they ’re selling price .
McDonald ’s advertises its “ dollar meals . ”
Hotels have cut room prices by 20 % in the last year .
House prices are down about 30 % since 2006 .
Sellers are offering bargains and they want buyers to know it .
“ Sold for $ 365,000 in 2006 .
Now $ 195,000 , ” says a typical house ad .
Foreigners have noticed too .
Colleagues in London say they are thinking of moving to Florida where they will get far more for their money .
The dollar falls ; foreign purchases go up .
Stocks , for example .
In the first quarter , foreigners were unloading US shares .
Now they ’re buying more than $ 100 billion worth per month .
It is a deflationary world , at least that part of the world between the Rio Grande and the 49th parallel .
The CPI in the United States is negative and falling faster than at any time in 59 years .
Households can only be induced to spend money by cutting prices .
“ Cash for Clunkers ” cut prices on new cars by about 20 % .
As soon as it ended , so did auto sales .
Most new house sales could be traced to a tax credit – which reduced the down payment by at least 20 % .
That program is scheduled to end in November .
And now , the White House frets about jobs .
Unemployment is supposed to be a lagging indicator , but this time it seems to have dropped out of the race all together .
Still , Congressional elections are coming up .
Unemployed voters are surly and unreliable .
So , the Obama administration is considering a $ 3,000 tax credit to bribe businesses to hire them .
If the typical employee costs his firm about $ 40,000 , this effectively reduces the cost of labor by 7.5 % .
It ’s beginning to look more and more like the Roosevelt years .
By the end of this year , all the jobs created during the bubble era – 2002 - 2007 – will have been eliminated , making it the first decade with no job growth since the ’30s .
We ’re expecting a fireside chat any day .
Typically big businesses cut workers in a recession .
Then , when the economy recovers , small businesses are quick to take them back .
But this is unlike the typical post - war recession .
This time , deprived of capital as well as customers , small businesses do n’t have a chance .
Neither does a genuine recovery .
The authorities still do not understand what is going on .
They are used to fooling most of the people most of the time .
They think they can dupe them again – with bailouts and boondoggles .
But real demand has vanished as households try to pay down their debt .
That is not going to change anytime soon .
Not while the federal government is sabotaging a genuine recovery .
It ’s savings – capital – the US economy needs .
A capitalist economy in which the capitalist have no capital wo n’t work .
Why is there no capital ?
Because the feds take it .
Supplying cash - for - this and cash - for - that is an expensive proposition , especially when tax receipts are falling .
The money has to come from somewhere .
As it turns out , the feds borrow it from the very people who are trying to rebuild their personal balance sheets .
Of the $ 1.6 trillion the US government will borrow this year , the biggest single lender is the private sector , chipping in $ 700 billion .
But instead of being put to use in a way that might stimulate a real recovery – providing credit for small business and consumers – it is taken up by the US government and then frittered away .
The banks are happy to play the government ’s game too .
They can borrow overnight money from the Fed at only one quarter of 1 % , annualized .
But lending to small business is hard work .
And it is risky .
Why bother ?
The US Treasury will pay them 4 % for lending back to the government , long term .
This is practically free money to the banks .
Both the bankers and politicians end up ahead – with a bigger piece of the economy under their control .
Meanwhile , the real economy staggers .
“ Drought of credit hampers recovery , ” summarizes The Wall Street Journal .
The United States needs to create a million and a half new jobs each year just to keep up with population growth .
Currently there are 15 million people without jobs already … and a couple hundred thousand more unemployed every month .
And if this recovery continues long enough there wo n’t be a single person left in America who still has a job .
Even if the economy could be stabilized , it will leave millions without jobs – more or less permanently .
Add the people working reduced hours , and those who have been looking for work so long they are no longer counted , and their families , and you have a quarter of the population without money to spend .
That ’s why this slump is not going away any time soon .
As in Japan in the ’90s , we may have to live with this depression for the rest of our lives .
Enjoy your weekend ,
Bill Bonner
The Daily Reckoning
Call Jack Thompson , Jesse Jackson , and the Pope , this is n’t just an assault on morals , it is an assault on the Church .
Be rewarded for killing Christian leaders .
" Our story follows a disgraced master Assassin ( ALTAIR ) who embarks on an epic quest to restore his status within the Assassin Order .
After failing to assassinate the Templar Leader ( ROBERT DE SABLE ) and recover the legendary Templar Treasure , Altair is demoted to Uninitiated ( the lowest rank in the Assassin order ) .
SINAN , Leader of the Assassins , offers our hero an opportunity to redeem himself .
Altair must venture out into the Holy Land and assassinate men said to be exacerbating and exploiting the hostilities created by the Third Crusade .
In doing so , he will stabilize the region , allowing Sinan to usher in an age of peace . "
If your history is n’t so good this is the war that Kevin Kostner was returning form in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves .
The premise at first seems well intentioned enough , kill a few key leaders and bring peace to the world .
Seemingly not that violent , part of your " Creed " is to not kill anyone you do n’t have to .
But it would seem those you must kill are all Christian Leaders , and if you kill all of them you get the " Personal Vendetta Achievement " and 40 Gamer Points .
This is far from the first game to reward you for killing Christians , but it is certainly one of the most mainstream ones to hit the market .
Games like Man Hunt which recently made the news because a patch allowed uncensored violence are mostly played by those who know they are playing a very violent game .
No parent who spends 5 minutes watching Man Hunt is in the dark about the premise of the game .
But Assassin ’s Creed ( AC ) keeps the dark undertone quiet enough that when you are eaves dropping on a park bench or learning how to hide on a roof top that you might miss the parts where you kill the Men of the Cloth in their White robes .
At one point you kill a Bishop while he is shopping in the market with a knife to his back , then flea as everyone in the city comes to his aid .
It is not possible to finish the game with out killing the majority of the Templars in the game .
And the Templars are not explained to be evil , they may be encouraging men to join the crusades to retake Jerusalem , but they are not " bad " men being cleansed for a higher purpose .
Jade Raymond the games producer says " there ’s plenty of freedom to tweak people ’s personalities and motivations " which he obviously does .
Many games you can look at the violence and give it a reason , or purpose .
Doom , Halo , you were defending Earth .
Man
Hunt has only the excuse that you are playing the bad guys .
Assassin ’s Creed you are playing the Hero Role doing the " right " thing killing these men of God .
The Game has two modes as Raymond puts it " a socially acceptable " low profile " mode , where all his actions are modified to help him blend in socially .
In the second " high profile " mode , Altair goes into all - out hero mode , but simultaneously becomes more conspicuous , possibly putting his mission at risk . "
High profile / Hero
Mode is the mode you have to be in when you Kill one of your Christian Targets .
The Game is nearly Photo - realistic .
The scenery is beautiful , the people are fantastically realistic , and each of your targets has a distinct look , making it extremely personal when you kill them .
In most cases you do so at very close range , unlike First person shooters where you are farther away and do n’t " know " your kill .
Would I let my kids ( I do n’t have any ) play this game ?
Probably not .
The Game Features no multiplayer modes so you wo n’t stunt his / her social skills because they are the only kid not playing the game .
I personally think that Halo CTF is a great game to point kids at because it teaches Team work , same with Rainbow 6 .
I ’m certainly not opposed to violence in video games , I find it can be a useful outlet .
But I do n’t take it to the extreme of Man Hunt , and I do n’t feel that your House Hold can show good Christian Values if you condone a game like Assassin ’s Creed .
LONDON : The Arab states of the Persian Gulf have agreed to launch a single currency modelled on the euro , hoping to blaze a trail towards a pan -Arab monetary union .
'' The Gulf monetary union pact has come into effect , '' said the Kuwaiti Finance Minister , Mustafa al - Shamali , speaking at a Gulf Co-operation Council summit meeting in Kuwait City .
The move will give the hyper - rich club of oil exporters a petro-currency of its own , greatly increasing its influence in the global exchange and capital markets and potentially displacing the US dollar as the pricing currency for oil contracts .
Between them the Gulf countries amount to a regional superpower with a gross domestic product of $ US1.2 trillion ( $ 1.3 trillion ) , some 40 per cent of the world 's proven oil reserves , and financial clout equal to that of China .
Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Bahrain , and Qatar are to launch the first phase of the single currency next year , creating a Gulf Monetary Council that will evolve quickly into a full - fledged central bank .
The United Arab Emirates is staying out for now - irked that the bank will be located in Riyadh , at the insistence of Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah , rather than in Abu Dhabi .
The UAE is expected join later , along with Oman .
The Gulf states remain divided over the wisdom of anchoring their economies to the US dollar .
The Gulf currency - dubbed the ' ' gulfo ' ' - is likely to track a global exchange basket and may ultimately float as a regional reserve currency in its own right .
Winter Wondercar : Modified Subaru Shreds the Snow
Snow chains will only get you so far in some parts of the world .
When you want to really rip up the backcountry , what you need is a crazily modified Subaru with cat tracks , a supercharged engine and heavy - duty suspension .
Then you ’ll be ready to drive right up to the pristine , snowy peaks and snowboard your way down .
The modified car started life as a Subaru Impreza WRX STI .
Then American rally car driver Ken Block got his hands on it , and it soon became the Trax STI , which is probably the only vehicle of its kind .
The cat tracks and beefed - up suspension allow it to glide along effortlessly on the snow and ice – much to the surprise of some unsuspecting snowboarders in the above video .
The car ’s modifications were prepared by Vermont SportsCar ; they included the cat tracks in place of wheels , rally dampers , a hydraulic handbrake and a turbo - charged STI engine .
Although it ’s not shown in the video , a tow - behind sleigh was also made for the project and designed to haul snowboarders and their gear up the mountain .
Rye , N.Y .
SIXTY - EIGHT years ago tomorrow , Japan attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor .
In the brutal Pacific war that would follow , millions of soldiers and civilians were killed .
My father  one of the famous flag raisers on Iwo Jima  was among the young men who went off to the Pacific to fight for his country .
So the war naturally fascinated me .
But I always wondered , why did we fight in the Pacific ?
Yes , there was Pearl Harbor , but why did the Japanese attack us in the first place ?
In search of an answer , I read deeply into the diplomatic history of the 1930s , about President Franklin D. Roosevelt ’s policy on Asia , and his preparation  or lack thereof  for a major conflict there .
But I discovered that I was studying the wrong President Roosevelt .
The one who had the greater effect on Japan ’s behavior was Theodore Roosevelt  whose efforts to end the war between Japan and Russia earned him the Nobel Peace Prize .
When Theodore Roosevelt was president , three decades before World War II , the world was focused on the bloody Russo - Japanese War , a contest for control of North Asia .
President Roosevelt was no fan of the Russians : “ No human beings , black , yellow or white , could be quite as untruthful , as insincere , as arrogant  in short , as untrustworthy in every way  as the Russians , ” he wrote in August 1905 , near the end of the Russo - Japanese War .
The Japanese , on the other hand , were “ a wonderful and civilized people , ” Roosevelt wrote , “ entitled to stand on an absolute equality with all the other peoples of the civilized world . ”
Roosevelt knew that Japan coveted the Korean Peninsula as a springboard to its Asian expansion .
Back in 1900 , Roosevelt had written , “ I should like to see Japan have Korea . ”
When , in February 1904 , Japan broke off relations with Russia , President Roosevelt said publicly that he would “ maintain the strictest neutrality , ” but privately he wrote , “ The sympathies of the United States are entirely on Japan ’s side . ”
“ With affairs , you get sex .
With polyamory , you get breakfast , ” says Cambridge sex therapist Gina Ogden , citing a well - known poly saying .
Ogden is the author of The Return of Desire , in which she dedicates a chapter to affairs and polyamory .
“ Polyamory is n’t a lifestyle for everybody , any more than monogamy is for everybody , ” she says .
“ Keeping one relationship vital is a lot of work , and if you start adding more relationships , it becomes more work . ”
Though common descriptors used for monogamy do n’t easily apply to polyamory , there is a recognizable spectrum of how open these partnerships may be .
On the closed end , you might have a couple in a primary relationship who will then have one or more secondary relationships that are structured to accommodate the primary one .
There ’s also polyfidelity , in which three or more people are exclusive with one another .
On the open end , there might be chains of people where , for example , Sue is dating Bill and Bill is dating Karen and Karen is dating Jack , who is also dating Sue .
Everything else with guidelines , that is , although those vary according to the agreed - upon needs and desires of the people in the relationships .
After all , this is n’t swinging , in which a couple seeks out recreational sex .
This is n’t even the free love of the ’60s and ’ 70s , characterized by psychedelic love -ins .
And despite the shared “ poly ” prefix , this certainly is n’t the patriarchal , man - with - many - wives polygamy that has earned increased public attention with the HBO show Big Love .
Polyamory has a decidedly feminist , free - spirited flavor , and these are real relationships with the full array of benefits and complexities -- plus a few more -- as the members of Poly Boston ’s hypercommunicative , often erudite , and well - entwined community will explain .
Through the lens of monogamy , this love connection may appear distorted , but that ’s not how Sekora and Mare , who is 45 , describe their lifestyle .
Adherents call it responsible non-monogamy or polyamory , and the nontraditional practice is creeping out of the closet , making gay marriage feel somewhat last decade here in Massachusetts .
What literally translates to “ loving many , ” polyamory ( or poly , for short ) , a term coined around 1990 , refers to consensual , romantic love with more than one person .
Framing it in broad terms , Sekora , one of the three founders and acting administrator of the 500 - person - strong group Poly Boston , says : “ There ’s monogamy where two people are exclusive .
There ’s cheating in which people are lying about being exclusive .
And poly is everything else . ”
Jay Sekora is n’t actively looking for an additional relationship , but he admits to occasionally checking a dating site to see who ’s out there .
Sekora ’s girlfriend , Mare , who does not want her last name used here for professional reasons , said she is not pursuing anyone , either , but is “ open and welcoming to what might come along . ”
In the three - plus years they have been together , a few other people have come along , like the woman whom Sekora , a 43 - year - old systems administrator from Quincy , met online and dated briefly until she moved away .
There was also a male - male couple that Mare and Sekora , who identifies as bisexual , dated for several months as a couple .
Other than that , it has been the two of them .
Well , sort of .
Women may face more criticism for living a polyamorous lifestyle , according to Valerie Sperling , professor of women ’s and gender studies at Clark University in Worcester .
“ This is a hot - button issue for women , ” Sperling says , “ and if a woman is out as having two or more boyfriends , people might label her oversexed , versus the ‘ boys will be boys ’ idea that kicks in when men have sex with lots of women .
What a stud .
What a slut . ”
She points to this double standard as a possible reason so few poly women would speak on the record for this story .
“ The gay struggle is a larger struggle , and as poly people we do n’t have to be political , ” says Amoroso , who , like many poly people , does see the need for a clearer legal recognition of relationships that are n’t marriages .
( If one of his partners were to fall ill , for example , he would want legal visitation rights . )
But he also thinks the lifestyle can gain acceptance .
“ Most poly relationships that I ’m familiar with are heterosexual , and that ’s a lot more understandable to people , even if they would n’t do it this way , ” he says .
“ The fantasy of more than one boyfriend or girlfriend is fairly widespread , ” he adds .
It ’s complicated , as the poly catch phrase goes .
It ’s also still surprisingly closeted .
Nonetheless , Valerie White , executive director of Sexual Freedom Legal Defense and Education Fund in Sharon , says we are ahead of the curve in Massachusetts , particularly compared with the South , where teachers have lost their jobs and parents have lost their children for being poly .
But she notes there is no push in the poly movement to legalize these relationships , largely because there ’s no infrastructure for it .
“ It was easy to legalize gay marriage .
All you had to do was change bride and groom to person A and person B .
But we do n’t know what multi- partnered marriage looks like , ” White says .
“ I ’m not sure there are as many ways to be poly as there are people who are poly , but it ’s close , ” says Thomas Amoroso , an emergency room doctor from Somerville and member of Poly Boston .
Amoroso , 48 , who identifies as straight , has been in a committed relationship for five years with a woman and man who live together within walking distance of his Somerville apartment .
Amoroso is only sexual with the woman , who is sexual with each of the men separately , but they all consider the others life partners .
“ No one has said the words ‘ Till death do us part , ’ but I think that ’s the intent , ” Amoroso says .
Divorced in 1999 after 15 years of marriage , Amoroso felt unable to express his affectionate nature in the confines of a monogamous relationship .
When a woman he had just begun seeing revealed she was polyamorous , the concept , new to Amoroso , resonated .
Amoroso and the woman stayed together for five years , while each sustained additional relationships , including -- for her -- one with Sekora that drew Sekora and Amoroso together in a close friendship that they still maintain .
For Amoroso , being poly is less about sex than the authentic expression of caring for more than one person .
“ People tend to harp on the sexual component , ” he says , “ but the relationship component is just as important . ”
“ A lot of poly people who feel jealous say it ’s a warning sign that your needs are n’t getting met , ” says Sekora .
He says he ’s felt insecure about relationships but not necessarily jealous of his partner ’s partners .
He recalls a time early in his relationship with Mare , however , when she felt threatened by a woman he had started dating .
When the three sat down and talked , the women got along well and Mare ’s worries dissipated .
“ Sensible , mature , self - reliant , and stable partners would be a welcome asset ” to their relationship , says Mare , who began to identify as poly five years ago when she tapped into the Poly Boston community .
Even though she grew up in a more sexually permissive era than her mother did , Mare remembers being in high school and college in the 1980s and envying her mother ’s 1950s young adulthood when people dated around .
For Mare , who likes the thought of having deep , enduring love with Sekora -- and the possibility of more first kisses with other people -- a polyamorous lifestyle is the answer .
“ The conventional paradigm of monogamy is very much entrenched in our culture , ” says Randi Kaufman , a clinical psychologist who has counseled nearly 40 poly people in her Cambridge office .
“ Practicing polyamory means setting aside the basic principle of monogamy that one person will meet all of another ’s needs in an intimate relationship . ”
Though Kaufman has seen polyamory work well , she also has counseled clients on some poly - specific challenges , such as “ new relationship energy , ” referring to an intensified focus on a new person that can cause someone to neglect his or her other partners while in the throes of new love .
Just as in monogamous relationships , sex can drop off in poly relationships , too , says Kaufman , but poly people can still get their sexual needs met by others without damaging their primary relationships .
Then there ’s the issue of jealousy .
For even more serious reasons , Opeyemi Parham kept her poly lifestyle closeted for the 20 years she worked as a physician in Boston .
A divorced woman who for several of those years was in an open relationship with a male partner , Parham feared both the professional consequences and the possibility that she could lose custody of her two children , who are now in their 20s .
Since leaving conventional medicine to work as a health educator , Parham says she is now beyond those consequences and wants to show people that her lifestyle is not threatening in any way .
“ Boston , in my experience , has a uniquely cerebral approach to life and is somewhat disconnected from the body .
Therefore , issues of sexuality can be a little more volatile and open to misinterpretation , ” says Parham , who moved to Greenfield in 2003 .
“ My agenda is a society where people can choose how they relate with other humans sexually without legal penalties , professional penalties , and the emotional penalty of shame and blame , ” says Parham .
It was Biversity Boston , a thriving , well - organized bi community , that helped draw Sekora to Boston in 1992 .
After a few years , he and two other non-monogamous bisexual friends envisioned a similar organization and separate social space for poly people .
Their research revealed that a small , albeit active , polyamorous group called Family Tree had already been in existence locally since 1980 .
( Valerie White says Family Tree was one of the first established poly groups in the country , perhaps pointing to a progressive social attitude in the Boston area . )
But the Family Tree meetings usually took place , and still do , in the suburbs , and its members were generally older .
Sekora imagined Boston - centered , T - accessible events that could also draw an urban crowd .
In December 1994 , Sekora and the two others who are no longer active in the community launched Poly Boston as a mailing list of five people .
Six months later , it started taking root with new members .
Sekora took over the list in 1998 , steadily helping it grow to its current 500 members , with an almost equal number of men and women .
He says bumps in new subscription requests usually come in the wake of Poly Boston ’s appearance at the Boston Pride Parade or its booth at the associated festival .
Many people find the journey from a closed to a sexually open lifestyle scary , according to Dossie Easton , coauthor with Janet Hardy of 2009 ’s The Ethical Slut : A Practical Guide to Polyamory , Open Relationships and Other Adventures , a book many consider the poly bible ( the first edition came out in 1997 ) .
“ Most of us will have to deal with challenging emotional responses to new experiences as we move into more openness in our relationships , and work to find ease and security beyond guarantees of love based on sexual exclusivity , ” says Easton , a licensed marriage and family therapist in San Francisco who made a conscious decision 40 years ago never to be monogamous again .
The benefits , she says , include the freedom to engage in relationships that are not about life partnerships but may provide different perspectives , adventures in sexuality , and new connections with many people .
Easton also cites the value of a poly community as a place to exchange information and support with people who understand your lifestyle .
Growing up in Macomb , Illinois , Sekora never felt any inclination toward monogamy .
He gave it a try with his first girlfriend at 16 and quickly knew it was n’t for him .
Through reading about other times and cultures , the intellectually curious teen realized he might not be the only person on the planet who felt hard - wired for open relationships the way some people are meant for monogamy .
As an undergraduate at Yale in the 1980s , Sekora never met anyone else who identified as non-monogamous , but when he moved to Princeton , New Jersey , in 1989 for his first post - college job in technical support , he got plugged into a bisexual community that helped him claim that identity .
Through that community , which Sekora and others say has a large overlap with the poly community , he met a significant number of non-monogamous people and had his first relationship with someone who already identified as poly and was looking for open relationships .
Sekora remembers it as a learning experience .
“ I think you can play the part of a monogamous person without necessarily having to think what it means for you , ” he says .
“ There ’s a cultural script that we learn from movies , sitcoms , songs on the radio , and watching our parents .
Because there is n’t a similar script for poly relationships , you have to think about what you ’re doing and decide what you want . ”
Poly Boston members Alan and Michelle Wexelblat of Burlington take turns attending the cafe gatherings .
As the parents of two boys , 6 and 9 , the poly couple find that the get - togethers -- though child - friendly -- conflict with homework and dinnertime .
“ There ’s nothing that having kids did n’t affect in our lives , including how we date , ” says Alan .
That would be dating each other as well as other people outside of their stable 10 - year marriage .
Both Alan and Michelle identified as non-monogamous when they met and hit it off 15 years ago at a science - fiction convention in Philadelphia .
Authors such as Robert Heinlein , whose stories often feature nontraditional marriages , are frequently credited with the striking overlap of poly people and science - fiction fans .
But there seems to be no causal relationship between discovering these ideas in books and putting them into practice .
More likely the Internet , a longtime hangout for sci- fi fans and poly people , is the common denominator .
As the website administrator and first point of contact for new members , Sekora maintains his original goal of fostering a healthy , welcoming poly community here .
The flavor of the group reflects the city in general , with a fair amount of students as well as people who came here to study and then stayed on .
But , demographically , it is more bisexual than the city at large because of the identities of the three founding members .
Information technology , academia , and biotech are well represented among the professions , but , though the group is somewhat skewed toward the sciences , plenty of Poly Boston people work in the humanities or the service industry , according to Sekora .
The most obvious common feature beyond their lifestyle may be a love of intellectual ferment .
“ It certainly seems to be a group of people who are , by and large , interested in the discussion of ideas , ” Sekora says .
When it comes to dating within the group , Sekora observes that , unlike with monogamous breakups where there ’s a tendency to divvy up friends and social events , this is n’t the norm in Poly Boston .
“ I think the line between lovers and friends is less impermeable in the poly community , and that can help avoid drama , ” says Sekora .
“ But that is n’t the way for everyone , ” he adds .
“ I certainly know people who ca n’t show up for an event because their exes might be there . ”
While primarily still a mailing list and website with no formal organizational structure , Poly Boston hosts weekly gatherings at a cafe in Somerville ’s Davis Square and monthly dinners at a restaurant on the Red Line .
Occasionally , the members meet for ad hoc discussion evenings or day trips .
The events , which typically attract a few dozen people , are not meant to be places to shop for partners , but some of that becomes inevitable , according to Amoroso , who attends a gathering every other month .
He admits that if you ’ve been in the community any length of time , you ’ve probably dated a significant fraction of the people in it .
“ People have been practicing polyamory for eons , ” says Michelle , a social worker at a community mental health center in Lawrence .
“ It ’s not necessarily polyamory , but there is this concept of relationships with multiple people in them . ”
She cites biblical writings that refer to multiple wives and hunter - gatherer communities where men and women stayed together for a few years before moving on to new partners .
“ This is common if you look at anthropology , ” she adds .
Alan and Michelle kept in touch after the convention and eventually dated their way -- although not exclusively -- into their open marriage .
Prior to becoming parents , they would each typically have at least one or two relationships beyond their own .
Currently Alan , a user interaction designer for a local software company , has one -- a steady girlfriend of four years -- and Michelle has none .
How long has it been since Michelle has dated anyone ?
“ Long enough to be annoying , ” says Alan , who would like to see his wife find a boyfriend .
Michelle , who calls herself a romantic , says she gets wistful rather than jealous when her husband goes out on dates , and while she would welcome having someone new in her life , it also has to be the right person .
There ’s compatibility to consider but also schedules , goals , and , of course , the feelings of other partners .
Alan likens the experience of introducing new people into the relationship to the awkwardness of bringing a boyfriend or girlfriend home to meet the parents .
They both note that dating outside the poly “ tribe ” is difficult .
“ It ’s easier to date people who already share a certain set of beliefs about relationships , ” says Alan , who , like Michelle , wears a wedding band and asserts that they are both upfront about their lifestyle when meeting a non-poly person they would like to date .
“ Why wait until you ’ve got the other person interested and it could be complicated to tell them ? ” says Michelle .
Then there are the kids , who in this case , according to Alan , understand as much about their parents ’ lifestyle as they want to .
The two boys have attended several Boston Pride Parades , and they know and interact with their parents ’ partners as they would with any other close adult friends .
But the Wexelblats have not yet explained the specifics of their lifestyle to their sons .
“ Kids deal well with things they think are normal , ” says Alan .
“ To the degree that we can help them be comfortable with this , then they will treat it as normal .
That ’s the theory , anyway . ”
That theory is starting to get support from research .
In 2006 , Elisabeth Sheff , an assistant professor of sociology at Georgia State University who had been collecting data on poly families since 1996 , launched the first long - term study of children raised in such families .
While her findings are not yet conclusive , Sheff says her initial generalization is that kids raised in poly families have access to many resources , such as help with homework , rides when needed , and the additional emotional support and attention that comes from having other , nonparental adults in their lives .
Sheff adds , however , that “ kids in poly families also sometimes feel extremely upset when their parents ’ partners leave , if it means the end of the relationship between the kid and the ex-partner . ”
She says that poly families often pass as mundane , blended families from divorce and remarriage and therefore easily fly below the radar .
Many poly people do n’t necessarily want to stand out , but quietly seek acceptance for a lifestyle that they say is challenging , often time - consuming , and yet rewarding .
“ For some people , being poly is a lot of constant work , ” says Sekora .
“ It is probably intrinsically harder balancing three people ’s wants and needs than two people ’s .
But if I had to choose between monogamy and celibacy , I would choose celibacy . ”
For Alan Wexelblat , being poly is important to his identity , but hardly the whole of his and Michelle ’s life .
“ Ninety nine point nine percent of our lives is ordinary stuff , ” he says .
“ We have jobs .
We have kids .
We worry about school .
We check homework .
For us , living as a poly couple is just living as people in modern society . ”

I was recently reminded of an experience that I had gone through during the “ wild west ” days of the Internet – when this domain was held hostage by an unscrupulous company – before I had found GoDaddy .
When I first got the bright idea of registering Jonamerica.com , I did a quick search of domain registration pricing and found several companies offering domains for less than $ 30 .
The Network Solutions ’ monopoly on domain names had been broken up , and the cost of registering a domain had recently dropped from $ 100 .
I found a company that was offering a “ total ” registrar solution , and for only $ 9.99 / year , per domain .
Well , they neglected to mention that the price was only good for the first year .
The second year it would cost $ 39.99 to renew the domain .
If you let a registration lapse , your domain name become available for purchase by others .
There are whole business models based on purchasing lapsed domain names in the hopes of capturing the established traffic for ad revenue – or in the hopes that the owner will want it back and be willing to pay a hefty price .
Not wanting to lose my domain , I quickly looked into what it would take to transfer the domain to another registrar .
This should be easily done – you simply make a transfer request and the domain is moved .
However , my registrar had locked my domain , and it could n’t be moved .
Before I go any further , I want to be clear that it is recommended that everyone lock their domains .
It is good practice .
During the “ wild west ” days of the Internet , domain “ slamming ” – where a registrar would submit a false transfer request to gain control of a domain – happened more regularly that it should , largely because the organization that oversees domain rules , ICANN , had rules that required all registrars to comply with a transfer request , unless the domain was locked .
Unfortunately for me my registrar automatically locked all domains and did n’t make it possible to unlock them .
According to the company , the unlock procedure had to be initiated 60 days before renewal , and could n’t be initiated until 60 days after renewal .
They required that you fill out a form and mail it to their company in Australia .
There were countless online reports of people sending in forms , but being told by the registrar that they never arrived .
Forms sent by registered mail returned unopened because the registrar did n’t accept any registered or certified mail .
The mailing address was a PO Box – the company ’s address turned out to be an alleyway in Sydney .
I sent countless e-mails to the registrar and ICANN , posted angry messages on forums , but nothing could be done .
I had to pay $ 39.99 each year or lose the domain .
Eventually there was a class - action lawsuit .
Shortly thereafter ICANN made a change to the rules , requiring that all registrars to provide an easy way to lock and unlock a domain online .
The company was forced to comply with the new rule and I was able to unlock my domain and start a transfer .
If the company did n’t transfer my domain they would be in violation of the rules and could lose their ICANN accreditation .
My transfer went through – I had found a new registrar home with GoDaddy and was pleased to be freed from a company who would rely on such practices for earnings .
That experience taught me two thing :
1 . If not thought out , rules can be misused and abused .
ICANN should have thought more carefully about the system they had created - and when that system failed , they should have moved more quickly to correct it .
2 . The value of an established brand should not be discarded in favor of a scheme .
The company I was registered with would have had better results if they had acted reasonably .
Offering a low introductory cost is a common business practice , and most would n’t have minded if the registration cost went up by a few dollars the next year .
The registrar , which was a fairly big player at the time , lost almost all of their customers and had to change the name of their business because it had become synonymous with the scam .
This change meant a loss of all of the money and time invested on marketing , branding , and trafficking efforts that went into building up the company .
Cantor : No Tax Increases Until Unemployment Falls Below 5 Percent
Created : December 02 , 2009 13:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Rep. Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) is rolling out his economic speech at the Heritage Foundation today with a lot of fanfare .
Earlier this morning , he held a conference call that was fairly vague on details and heavy on explanations of how Democrats were blundering the economic recovery ; that got some friendly coverage .
Two hours before the speech , he has released excerpts of what he ’ll say .
Possibly the least surprising element : “ Agreeing ” not to consider tax increases until unemployment falls below 5 percent .
In other words , if unemployment plunged 50 percent below today ’s rate of 10.2 percent — something that would clearly mark the end of the recession and an economic revival — it would not be enough to justify any tax increase of any kind .
The basic points after the jump .
1. ) “ We must tear down self - imposed obstacles to economic growth and wealth creation .
Therefore Congress and the Administration should stop the deluge of detrimental rules and regulations . ”
2. ) “ We should agree to block any federal tax increases until unemployment drops below 5 percent .
Americans of all political stripes can agree that the government should never raise taxes during periods of high unemployment . ”
3. ) “ We need to restore confidence in America ’s economic future .
Record deficits and debts – coupled with runaway spending – have shaken confidence in our economic future .
Many believe that the only solutions will be higher taxes or inflating the dollar , which promise lasting pain for small businesses and working families . ”
4. ) “ We should reform the unemployment system to help people out of work find jobs . ”
5. ) “ We need to approve three promising free trade agreements with Colombia , South Korea and Panama that have stalled under the new administration .
Recently the President stated that increasing U.S. exports by just 1 % would create over 250,000 jobs . ”
“ We must take action to reduce regulatory and tax barriers that inhibit domestic job creation . ”
7. ) “ We must deal swiftly and honestly with the looming commercial real estate collapse .
Congress should move to give bank regulators incentives to deal responsibly with banks and their borrowers . ”
Autism Diets : No Evidence They Work or Not , Say Experts
Report on treating stomach issues finds no proof that special diets help autism .
Jan. 4 , 2010  --
For years parent support networks and celebrity activists have endorsed restrictive diets to combat the so - called " leaky gut " symptoms and behavior problems of children with autism .
But an expert panel published a report today saying there is currently no evidence proving whether children with autism have more gastrointestinal problems than other children , or any evidence that the common casein - free , gluten - free diets work .
The statement on so - called autism diets was one part of a larger report on how doctors should approach gastrointestinal issues in children with autism .
The report , published today in the journal Pediatrics , echoed some parents ' claims that gastrointestinal issues are linked to autism - like behaviors .
The panel of 27 experts agreed that " problem behavior in patients with ASDs ( Autism Spectrum Disorders ) may be the primary or sole symptom of the underlying medical condition , including some gastrointestinal disorders . "
But until studies prove or disprove the merits of casein - free and gluten - free diets , the experts recommended adapting traditional treatments for gastrointestinal problems in children with autism .
Parents Turn to Restrictive Diets for Autism Without Scientific Evidence
" Probably 90 percent of parents of children with autism try dietary intervention , " said Dr. Fred Volkmar , Director of the Child Study Center at Yale University .
" The sad reality of it is that with any complementary alternative treatment -- there is no evidence .
It 's what makes it complimentary alternative treatment , " said Volkmar .
Volkmar said his patients try the restrictive diets after hearing anecdotes from other parents , which is not proof enough for scientists and doctors .
He also thinks parents are keen to pick up on diets as a form of treatment because a common characteristic in children with autism is finicky eating .
Rebecca Estepp , a mother of a boy with autism and national policy manager for Talk About Curing Autism , said she first started wondering about her son 's diet for those very reasons .
" I put my son on this diet nine years ago , and there was no evidence but the evidence of my son's constant diarrhea , constant indigestion , " said Estepp .
" He also avoided milk .
I kept thinking , what two- year - old pushes away the milk cup ? "
Estepp said her son's health improved after she put him on a restrictive diet .
It did n't cure his autism , but his better health led to better behavior .
" I think a lot of the time these kids are misbehaving because they do n't feel well , " said Estepp , who said her son and others may be acting out and unable to communicate their pain .
Although studies on the diets are lacking , Estepp said she was " ecstatic " that doctors are making recommendations on how to approach treating stomach problems in children with autism .
" That makes all the difference in the world to someone who cannot speak , " said Estepp .
" I wished this had happened 10 years ago when my child was diagnosed . "
But Are the Diets Safe ?
If done well , Volkmar said children can live on the diets and stay relatively healthy .
The only problem Volkmar sees with the diets is that " occasionally parents get so crazy with the diet that they lose perspective . "
He has seen parents so focused on diets that they miss other medical problems or neglect behavioral therapies that have been proven effective in rigorous studies .
Focus On Autism Diets Can Sometimes
Be Unhealthy
" Sometimes you have parents who pursue a treatment that has not been shown to work , to the detriment of treatments that have been shown to work , " he said .
But parents who want hard scientific evidence before trying the casein - free , gluten - free diets may have to wait a while .
" For many researchers this would be a lower priority .
The problem is there 's limited federal dollars , it 's an amazing amount of work to get these [ treatment ] studies done , " said Volkmar .
Complicating the problem is the vast spectrum of behaviors and medical issues within autism .
Gastrointestinal issues may be more common in some parts of the spectrum but not in others .
Doctors say lumping children with autism into one diet study may confuse the results .
" Studying them [ patients ] in large groups of people who are heterogeneous -- very different from one another -- is not the best way to learn what is going on with these diets , " said Dr. Martha Herbert of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston .
" You will wash out any effect in a subgroup by blurring them in with others who have different problems . "
Dr. Arthur Beaudet , who contributed to the published statements , said he believes genetic studies may one day lead to better research of gastrointestinal problems in children with autism .
For instance , children with autism symptoms caused by one genetic mutation may be more likely to develop gastrointestinal issues than children who have a different genetic mutation -- or none at all .
Beaudet said current research has already pinpointed subgroups of people with autism who have a specific mutation and distinct behavior , such as the estimated 1 percent of people with autism who have the mutation known as " 16p11.2 "
" There 's a very broad spectrum of autism from very severe handicaps to very mild handicaps … we have to break these down to the smallest extent possible , " said Beaudet .
About
Emacs ’s undo system allows you to recover any past state of a buffer .
To do this , Emacs treats “ undo ” itself as just another editing action that can be undone .
This can be confusing and difficult to use .
If you make an edit while undoing multiple changes , you “ break the undo chain ” .
To get back to where you were , you have to undo all the undos you just did , then undo all the changes you ’d already undone before .
Only then can you continue undoing from where you left off .
If this sounds confusing , it ’s because it is !
Hence , a number of packages exist that replace it with the undo / redo system ( see CategoryUndo ) .
Instead of treating undo / redo as a linear sequence of changes , undo - tree - mode treats undo history as a branching tree of changes , similar to the way Vim handles it .
This makes it substantially easier to undo and redo any change , while preserving the entire history of past states .
The undo - tree visualizer is particularly helpful in complex cases .
An added side bonus is that undo history can in some cases be stored more efficiently , allowing more changes to accumulate before Emacs starts discarding history .
Undo history can be saved persistently across sessions with Emacs 24.3 and later .
It also sports various other nifty features : storing and restoring past buffer states in registers , a diff view of the changes that will be made by undoing , and probably more besides .
For more information , see the Commentary at the top of the undo - tree.el file .
( http://www.dr-qubit.org/undo-tree/undo-tree.txt)
Downloading
The undo - tree package is available from GNU ELPA in recent Emacsen , and in el- get .
You can install it with ‘ M - x install - package undo - tree ’ .
The latest “ stable ” version ( version 0.6.4 , released August 2013 ) can also be downloaded from :
If you want to live on the bleeding edge , the latest “ development ” version can be found in a git repository located at :
This is a git repository , not a web page .
You can not view it in a web browser .
To grab the latest development version , clone the repository using :
git clone http://www.dr-qubit.org/git/undo-tree.git
To enable it , add it to your LoadPath ( if necessary ) , then add the following to your InitFile :

Customizing undo-tree
Here are a few options you may want to investigate :
undo - tree - visualizer - diff - Show diffs when browsing through the undo tree
- Show diffs when browsing through the undo tree undo- tree - visualizer - timestamps - Show relative times in the undo tree visualizer

Playing nicely with linum
I use linum and I was experiencing glitches with line numbers when I tried to jump from one buffer state to another with undo tree .
The line numbers may had become scrambled , missing or incorrect .

Would n’t it be nice to have something like “ after buffer state changed ” hook here ?
Dear author , if you ’re reading this , please consider making use of hooks in the future release .
Thanks .
What ’s wrong with the standard `after - change - functions` hook ?
Does n’t it work ?
( BTW , if you want a timely response from the package author , I strongly recommend emailing him rather than writing something on EmacsWiki .
I hear he does n’t spend his time polling EmacsWiki just in case someone writes something about one of his packages .
Or stackexchange .
Or comments on github clones of his repos he does n’t even know about .
Or reddit .
Or any other random web sites .

Labeling deception
Dean Foods facts
( Natural News ) Until early 2009 , brand soy milk was made using organic soybeans .
But earlier this year , Dean Foods ( owner of the Silk brand ) quietly switched to conventional soybeans , which are often grown with pesticides .
But they kept the same UPC barcodes on their products , and they kept the product label virtually the same , only replacing the word " organic " with " natural " in a way that was barely noticeable .
They also kept the price the same , charging consumers " organic " prices for a product that was now suddenly made with conventionally - grown soybeans .
Many retailers and consumers never noticed the bait - and - switch tactic , so they kept buying , thinking it was still organic .
The shift on the product label from " organic " to " natural " was n't well understood by consumers , either .
Many consumers continue to think that the term " natural " is basically the same as " organic , " when in fact they are almost opposites .
The term " natural " is entirely unregulated , and almost anything can be claimed to be " natural " even when it 's sprayed with pesticides or treated with other chemicals .
This bait - and - switch ploy continued throughout 2009 until a few watchdog organizations started to catch on to the covert switch .
In late October , the www.Cornucopia.org ) accused Target stores of misleading consumers by advertisingproducts using the old " organic " labeling even though the product being sold in stores was not organic .
Cornucopia 's Mark Kastel accused Target and Dean Foods for " blurring the line between organic and natural , " thereby confusing consumers while boosting profits from the more lucrative sales of non-organic products sold at organic prices .
( http://www.cornucopia.org/2009/10/off-target...
Meanwhile , a Sunflower health food store in Texas also found itself caught up in the bait - and - switch tactic .
It had been reorderingfor months , thinking the product was still organic .
But now , after discovering the scam , the store posts a hand - written sign in front of the Silk products , warning consumers with this message : " Silk is no longer organic . " " We do n't want to be part of customer deception , " said the store owner in a Star - Telegram interview .
According to that same story , food retailers in California , Delaware and Texas were also duped by Silk 's bait - and - switch scheme , only discovering the switch to conventional soybeans months after the switch was covertly made .
Dean Foods , you see , never bothered to tell retailers they had switched from organic to conventionally - grown soybeans .
They just quietly made the switch but kept the same box design and UPC codes , perhaps hoping no one would notice .
And the ploy worked !
" Dean has only added to the marketplace confusion between ' natural ' and ' organic , ' as they definitely do not mean the same thing , and ' natural ' requires no verification whatsoever , " said Consumer Reports senior scientist Urvashi Rangan ( see Star - Telegram article link below ) .
Dean Foods is one of the big food giants that serves processed , factory - made foods and beverages to the American people .
It 's the parent company of , the so - called " organic " milk maker that 's been caught up in a web of deception exposed by the Organic Consumers Association ( https://www.naturalnews.com/021763_organic_st... ) .
The company has pushed hard to lower organic standards so that it could market products as " organic " even though they might contain questionable ingredients .
When Dean Foods bought out WhiteWave , the creator of Silk soy milk , WhiteWave founder Steve Demos soon left the company in disgust , saying that " green " values had been abandoned for the sake of profit .
Dean Foods even refused to participate on a " soy scorecard " investigation undertaken by the Cornucopia Institute ( https://www.naturalnews.com/026294_soy_food_f... ) .
The last thing this company wants is scrutiny of its business practices , it seems .
For example , in 2002 , Dean Foods cut off U.S. soybean farmers and switched to soybeans grown in China ( http://www.cornucopia.org/silk-whitewavedean... ) .
And for years , the company has waged attacks on the Cornucopia Institute itself .
In my opinion , .
It has no ethics , no moral code and no hesitation about deceiving consumers or hurting American farmers in order to maximize profits .
In America today , the big food companies are all about .
Rather than telling the truth on product labeling , they seek to .
That 's why they want to weaken the definition of " organic " -- so that they can essentially grow conventional foods with pesticides , then misleadingly position them as " near - organic " products that are sold at organic prices .
Consumers end up buying products they think are organic but really are n't .
And because the products are misleadingly positioned as " organic " products , they command a higher price .
This , in turn , generates more profits for the food companies .
in the food industry today .
Perhaps that 's why so many companies continue to do it .
From : http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=D... • Dean Foods investors include Pfizer , ExxonMobil , Coca - Cola and Wal - Mart . • Dean Foods controls 70 % of all " organic " milk products sold in the U.S. •
Dean Foods brands include Hershey's , Folgers , Borden , Horizon milk , Stroh 's ice cream and Silk soy milk . •
Dean Foods spent over $ 1 million on lobbyists in 2006 . •
The CEO of Dean Foods , Gregg Engles , was paid $ 3.4 million in salary and nearly $ 58 million in exercised stock options in 2006 alone .
Cornucopia Target complaint ( PDF ) Star - Telegram
— at least so says Robert Gallo , co-non - discoverer of the non-AIDS - causing “ HIV ” .
In “ HAART , heart disease , & lying with statistics ” ( 2010/01/19 ) I pointed out that Lo et al. ( 2010 ) claim statistical significance for an association between coronary disease and “ HIV ” without benefit of the proper control group , “ HIV - positive ” people who had never been fed antiretroviral drugs .
One of the earliest instances of the “ bait and switch ” tactic of ascribing to “ HIV ” what is actually caused by “ treatment ” against “ HIV ” was with lipodystrophy , which became prominent only upon introduction of protease inhibitors ( PIs ) , a fact that does n’t prevent mainstreamers from talking about “ HIV - associated ” lipodystrophy instead of PI - associated lipodystrophy .
This attempted legerdemain of ascribing to “ HIV ” what is caused by antiretroviral drugs is widespread and will continue to be so , since an increasing proportion of “ HIV - positive ” people will suffer “ treatment ” as it is being extended to people with higher and higher CD4 counts , and is even proposed as prophylaxis in healthy , “ HIV ” - negative people whose only “ risk factor ” is being an African woman .
By the time every “ HIV - positive ” person is on antiretroviral drugs , every “ side ” effect of the drugs can be asserted to be “ HIV - associated ” .
Robert Gallo is engaged in an analogous attempted legerdemain by ascribing to viruses , without benefit of evidence , certain human cancers .
According to Gallo , history teaches that the importance of infectious agents has been discounted for a century or so , despite periodic reminders : Spanish flu , polio , HIV : “ ‘ I arrived in the National Cancer Institute in 1965 and there was a serious search for viruses involved in human cancer and a serious respect for infectious disease as potentially new epidemic disorders . . . .
By 1975 the virus cancer programme had been killed and people had come to the conclusion that no virus was involved in human cancer and almost certainly would never be . ’”
Yet a few years later , those biases had been smashed .
“ Viruses are now known to be involved in about 20 per cent of all human cancers , maybe more , and we now have one of the great epidemics of all time in our face : HIV ” ( emphases added ; “ Keeping focused on eradicating a life - long and killer disease ” ) .
Actually the virus - cancer program was not killed , it self - destructed because no human - cancer - causing viruses had been discovered , despite a mistaken claim by Gallo followed by his continuing insistence that HTLV is a retrovirus that causes leukemia — even as he writes that HTLV “ tended to be transmitted within families and to stay within families for generations ” ( p. 114 , Gallo 1991 ) .
To most people , even medical scientists and perhaps even virologists , something that stays within families for generations is a heritable genetic factor and not an infectious disease .
But Gallo is quite ready to re-write medicine and science just as he feels entitled to re-write history : he ascribes medical advances from the beginning of the 20th century to “ an increased understanding of and reliance upon the scientific method ” ( p. 2 ) ; and “ over the last fifty years , I see few examples in which the scientific - medical establishment arrived at an important conclusion about a disease and was later shown to be wrong ” ( p. 297 ; maybe only “ few ” , but they ’ve been fairly significant , like prions mistakenly thought to be lentiviruses , or bacterially caused ulcers ascribed to psychological stress , or shock treatments and lobotomies ) ; and he describes interferon and cytokines as “ non-chemical ” ( p. 301 ) , as though Wöhler had not destroyed the basis for such distinctions in 1828 .
Just a few weeks ago , before I had seen this latest Gallo emission , I ’d commented that “ ‘ HIV ’ has infected virology with cancer - causing viruses ” ( 2010/01/08 ) in connection with XMRV , the allegedly “ xenotropic ” ( species - jumping ) mouse virus allegedly involved in prostate cancer because SOME prostate cancers can yield bits of “ non-chemical ” substances that might be interpretable as originating in a virus related to XMRV : HIV / AIDS has provided the precedent for regarding something as a cause just because bits of what might be from it can be found in some proportion of cases .
Of course , if there ’s a “ statistically significant ” correlation at the p<0.05 level , calculated by use of a ready - made statistics software package , that proves it scientifically , because in HIV - virology correlation proves causation .
After all , the fact that a couple of strains of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) are correlated with genital warts is clear proof that HPV cause the cancers that are sometimes correlated with such warts .
Gallo is anything but shy , though his memory may be conveniently short .
Twenty - five years ago he assured the Secretary for Health and Human Services that an anti-“ HIV ” vaccine would likely to be ready in a couple of years .
Now , more than two decades of nothing but failed vaccine trials later , he interprets the latest failure of such a vaccine quite positively : “ ‘ It worked , but all the positive data are in the first six months and after that there ’s no protection .
So whatever worked stopped working , and we have a good idea of what that might be . . . .
I think it ’s down to a special category of antibodies that were induced , and it fits with some ideas that we are working on . ’
Gallo is understandably reserved about predicting the outcome of research in train , but he believes it could produce interesting results . ”
He would obviously make a champion seller of Brooklyn Bridges , not to speak of snake oil ; perhaps I should say , he has already shown himself to be such a champion .
The State of California has just added AZT to its list of recognized carcinogens .
AZT was administered for more than two decades to “ HIV - positive ” individuals , and during this time an association was noticed between certain cancers — for example , cervical cancer — and “ HIV - positive ” .
Should not Gallo point out to Governor Schwarzenegger that it is n’t the AZT that causes cancer , it ’s the HIV against which the AZT is administered ?
But Gallo’s ( unsupported and unsupportable ) claim that ≥ 20 % of human cancers are virus - caused is far too modest .
He unaccountably failed to realize that “ HIV ” can be indicted for an even more widespread condition that negatively affects human beings , namely , aging .
The logic is simply the increasingly common syllogism by which HAART - associated equals “ HIV ” - associated :
Aging is caused in some part , perhaps very large part , by accumulation of mitochondrial mutations and increasingly poor mitochondrial function ( Linnane et al. 1989 ) .
Antiretroviral drugs cause mitochondrial damage .
“ HIV - positive ” people consume antiretroviral drugs .
QED : “ HIV - positive ” is associated with mitochondrial damage which leads to aging .
This is not a purely theoretical deduction , moreover : it has been noticed that “ HIV - positive ” individuals often seem to age very prematurely : “ A striking number of HIV patients are living longer but getting older faster — showing early signs of dementia and bone weakness usually seen in the elderly ” ( David France , “ Another kind of AIDS crisis ” , New York Magazine , 1 November 2009 ) :
“ patients who contracted the virus just a few years back are showing signs of what ’s being called premature or accelerated aging .
Early senility turns out to be an increasingly common problem . . . .
One large - scale multi-city study released its latest findings this summer that over half of the HIV - positive population is suffering some form of cognitive impairment .
Doctors are also reporting a constellation of ailments in middle - aged patients that are more typically seen at geriatric practices , in patients 80 and older .
They range from bone loss to organ failure to arthritis .
Making matters worse , HIV patients are registering higher rates of insulin resistance and cholesterol imbalances , and they suffer elevated rates of melanoma and kidney cancers and seven times the rate of other non-HIV - related cancers .
Whether this is a result of the drugs or the disease itself , or some combination , is still an open question . . . . ”
It ’s an open question only for people who do n’t remember the past .
Whether “ non-HIV - related cancers ” are a result of “ HIV ” is not an open question , it ’s an attempt to obfuscate .
Under HIV / AIDS theory , the average time from “ HIV - positive ” to any symptoms of illness is 10 years .
Now , “ patients who contracted the virus just a few years back are showing signs of what ’s being called premature or accelerated aging ” [ emphasis added ] .
The determined defenders of the orthodox faith speak in hand - waving fashion which ignores that chronology ( among other things ) .
The official line is that the life - saving drugs are enabling HIV / AIDS patients to live longer than ever before , and so to become prone to ailments of old age .
What that attempted explaining - away does not explain is that the ailments “ of old age ” are affecting people in middle age ; HAART - treated individuals are not living into old age and getting those ailments .
Moreover , in the past , in the early days of actual AIDS , people died from opportunistic infections , not from cancers or other typically old - age conditions .

Hi Cygwin friends and users , after an exceptionally long time of development and testing we 're proud to release Cygwin 's next major version 1.7.1 .
This release is a big leap from the former Cygwin releases in a couple of ways .
For the full list we urge you to read the new User 's Guide , which you can now find in the usual place : http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/
There 's a " What 's new " section at http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/ov-new1.7.html
The most important changes are : - The mount table is no longer stored in the registry .
Rather , it 's stored in /etc / fstab and / etc / fstab / $USER .
See http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using.html#mount-table
-
Support for pathnames beyond the former 260 chars border .
PATH_MAX is now set to 4096 , but Cygwin will try to support even longer paths up to the Windows maxium of 32767 Unicode chars , - Multiple Cygwin installations can co-exist on a machine , as long as you keep them separate .
- Support for IPv6 . - Default character set is now UTF - 8 , but other character sets are supported via an improved internationalization support .
See http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-locale.html
- Support for new authentication methods which are supposed to improve changing the user context without password .
-
No more support for Windows 95 , Windows 98 and Windows Me. ======================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES for those who upgrade from an existing Cygwin 1.5.25 installation :
You * must * upgrade to the latest setup.exe from our main web page at http://cygwin.com/
Moving the mount table from the registry to /etc / fstab works only automatically for system mount points .
User mount points have to be taken care of manually , using the /usr / bin / copy - user - registry - fstab script .
See http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using.html#mount-table

On a Wednesday morning in July , a group of armed men came to the door of a house in Santa Maria Ostuma , a hilly and remote town east of El Salvador ’s capital .
The men , wearing black outfits that resembled police uniforms , knocked on the door .
When the occupants — four alleged gang members — answered it , the black - clad killers opened fire .
All four occupants died in the attack .
The state investigators believed the killings and others like it in recent months were the work of right - wing death squads .
It also set off worries the country is returning to the brutal years of the civil war , when death squads roamed with impunity .
It ’s also notable the killers targeted gang members — possibly in retaliation for rising violence after a much - publicized truce between the government and the gangs collapsed last year .
El Salvador is n’t at war — in the sense of a traditional military conflict .
But the country ’s streets are more dangerous than many war zones .
El Salvador ’s gangs are so powerful they have press conferences .
Tens of thousands of members owe their loyalties to the gangs , and they ’re armed with everything from hand grenades to assault rifles .
“ Scratch beneath the surface of apparent peace in El Salvador and you will find a hidden war being waged , ” Salil Shetty , the head of Amnesty International , wrote in Huffington Post this month .
But El Salvador took a somewhat different approach than its neighbors in dealing with gang violence and cartel - linked drugs .
Instead of fighting a losing war , the government made a truce with the gangs in 2012 .
The state never made the terms of the truce very clear , but in practice it meant the security forces would lay off the gangs in exchange for peace between the country ’s two largest and most powerful criminal organizations — Mara Salvatrucha and Barrio 18 .
This deal also brought the gangs into secret negotiations with the government , which resulted in the state moving some of the gangs ’ imprisoned leaders into laxer prisons .

It worked … for awhile .
El Salvador saw its homicide rate drop .
Three years ago , the country ’s homicide rate was the second - highest in the world , at 77 homicides per 100,000 people .
The only country worse was neighboring Honduras .
A year later , the rate dropped to more than half that number — to 32 homicides per 100,000 .
That was still extremely high , and roughly equivalent to South Africa and Colombia .
The progress did n’t last .
During a three - day period in May , a wave of gang violence targeting rival gang members , cops and non-combatants resulted in 83 deaths .
Gang members have also assassinated nearly three dozen members of the police and military this year .
The gangs ’ leaders declared another truce in August , but the violence does n’t appear to be slowing down .
“ The victims range from low - to high - ranking members of the security forces and are spread across a wide geographic area , ” wrote Steven Dudley at the Latin American crime monitor InSight .
“ This gives the impression that they were not pre-selected or targeted , but rather were killed when the opportunity presented itself , or following security force disputes with local gang factions . ”
The roots of El Salvador ’s gang violence are complex , originating in a 12 - year civil war between a American - backed military junta — supported by powerful landowners — and a leftist uprising backed by Cuba and the Soviet Union .
It was one of the Cold War ’s bloodiest conflicts .
Thousands died , and a quarter of the country ’s population fled .
Migrant children who settled in Los Angeles in the 1980s and 1990s joined street gangs .
The U.S. swept the gang members by the thousands and deported them back to El Salvador .
Many of the deported gang members did n’t know Spanish , or spoke a hybrid Spanglish .
Suddenly , they had to survive on the streets of a country they barely knew .
The United States effectively deported its street violence to a country where most crimes also go unprosecuted .
Now introduce cocaine trafficking coming from Colombia on its way to Mexico and the U.S. — and the result is dead bodies .
For its part , the U.S. declared El Salvador a “ major drug - transit country ” in 2011 as the nation continued to deteriorate .
No one even knows how much cocaine is moving through El Salvador — except those moving it .
Salvadoran troops seize tons of the white powder every year , but this is widely believed to be marginal compared to the true amount transiting the country .
According to InSight , the country ’s homicide rate will likely return to its pre-truce high this year — as the country ’s hidden war goes on .
New parts for the damaged Seiko clock had to be brought in from Japan
A town clock in Manningtree High Street has caused a stir after the numbers were put in the wrong order .
The clock , on the wall of the NatWest bank at the junction of Brook Street , was donated to the town by the local Rotary Club in 1990 .
However , recent repairs necessitated by vandalism led to the mix -up .
" Everything was put back as we thought , only for a day after we noticed two numbers in the wrong position , " said the Rotary Club 's David Moss .
" At this moment it is our intention to leave it .
The main reason being [ is that ] it is 20 foot up on a wall , which means we have to put scaffold poles up , " he added .
" We have to get up to it in the spring , so I think then we will probably deal with it . "
David said he hoped the unusual clock would attract extra visitors to the north - Essex town .
After being pulled from the shelves for what some saw as racy content , Merriam Webster ’s Collegiate Dictionary may have the last word in Menifee .
A committee of parents , teachers and administrators decided Tuesday to return the dictionaries to the fourth - and fifth - grade classrooms at Oak Meadows Elementary School just days after they were removed over complaints about entries detailing references to various types of oral sex .
“ The dictionary will go back to the classroom but the parents will be given the option to determine if they want their kids to have access to that dictionary , ” said Betti Cadmus , a spokeswoman for the Menifee Union School District in southwest Riverside County .
Students will take permission slips home and parents who do n’t want them to use Webster ’s 10th Collegiate Edition can opt for alternative dictionaries .
The controversy began last week when a parent complained to the school principal about what she believed was explicit sexual content in the dictionary .
The books were ordered off the shelves until a committee could determine if they were “ age appropriate ” for fourth - and fifth - graders .

The move immediately set off cries of censorship among many , including the president of the local school board , who warned that banning one book would inevitably lead to the banning of more and more .
Cadmus said that despite complaints about the dictionary , no parents showed up at Tuesday ’s meeting to express any concerns .
“ The bottom line is the district followed the road map laid out for it in board policy , ” she said .

Facebook claimed it was doing the world a favor when it updated how the site handles privacy settings earlier this month , but the change has done nothing but get the company in even more hot water .
Amid heavy criticism from rights and privacy groups , the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( EPIC ) has called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the changes that it says mislead users and " contradict Facebook ’s own representations . "
Facebook has always had pretty detailed ( if not overly complex ) privacy settings .
As we detailed in our own guide to Facebook 's privacy controls from earlier this year , these settings allow people to granularly control how each type of information is shared with others and who sees what at any given time .
However , many users were painfully unaware that these settings existed , resulting in numerous embarrassments , job losses , and more — all because of misplaced Facebook postings .
In an attempt to draw more user attention to the fact that there are , in fact , privacy settings , Facebook made sweeping changes across its site at the beginning of December .
The problem ?
Some of the changes urged users to share everything with everyone — pretty much the polar opposite of what most people would want to do .
The privacy screen that every user had to click through ( called the " transition tool " ) was unclear and asked users to choose between sharing wall posts , pictures , and more with everyone or ... whatever you had set before .
What did you previously set for , say , photos of you tagged by other people ?
Do you know off the top of your head without checking ?
Most people do n't , and Facebook did n't outright tell you .
Not only were they vague , but the default settings were set to the widest level of sharing possible .
It 's this detail that has privacy advocates — and many Facebook users — up in arms .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation was among the first to criticize Facebook for its choice of wording and default options , and now EPIC and nine other privacy organizations are asking for further investigation from the FTC .
In its 29 - page complaint , EPIC says far more user information became publicly available after the rollout of the transition tool .
The organization also says that third - party developers have access to more user info than ever before , and criticizes the elimination of a setting that universally disallowed the sharing of information with third parties .
The basic premise of the complaint is that most users either do n't understand the changes they are being prompted to make , or that the changes are so complex that even experienced users are confused by them .
( These arguments are supported by numerous quotes from tech gurus around the Web discussing their frustration and confusion with the new settings . )
As a result , EPIC believes users are being misled by Facebook into exposing more than they had ever intended .
" Absent injunctive relief by the Commission , Facebook is likely to continue its unfair and deceptive business practices and harm the public interest , " wrote EPIC .
Despite this onslaught of criticism , Facebook has largely held steady in its decision to enact these changes — for now .
If we have learned anything from Facebook in the past , however , it 's that the company usually stands behind its initial decision for a while , only to acknowledge user complaints some time later and eventually cave into demands to make default settings more geared towards user privacy .
After all , that 's what happened with the now - defunct Facebook Beacon .
Update : " We ’ve had productive discussions with dozens of organizations around the world about the recent changes and we ’re disappointed that EPIC has chosen to share their concerns with the FTC while refusing to talk to us about them , " a Facebook spokesperson told Ars on Monday morning .
The company noted that it was pleased that many users have already updated their privacy settings , demonstrating the effectiveness of the transition tool .
" We discussed the privacy program with many regulators , including the FTC , prior to launch and expect to continue to work with them in the future . "

Haha !
I love it all !
Thanks so much !

As relevant today as it was almost 19 years ago , " The Drumhead " focuses on an act of sabotage aboard the Enterprise and the witch hunt that slowly envelopes the crew .
The episode also features one of the best moments of dialog , in The Next Generation , between Admiral Satie and Captain Picard .
Check out the amazing exchange in the video below .
Simmons was also a well acomplished actress outside of her brief encounter with Trek .
According to the LA
Times , her career spanned more than 60 years , she appeared in about 55 feature films and nearly as many television productions .
In the 1950s and 1960s , she made more than 30 movies and displayed her versatility by appearing in costume epics , romances , musicals and dramas .
Simmons also starred opposite a virtual who's who in hollywood , including : Marlon Brando , Gregory Peck , Cary Grant , and Kirk Douglas , to name a few .
" My career has had a lot of ups and downs , " Simmons said , " but basically it has been wonderful . "
She is survived by her two daughters , Tracy Granger and Kate Brooks .

California is back in the hole and digging deeper .
It is now $ 21 billion in the hole again and digging deeper every day .
In response to the growing problem , Schwarzenegger Seeks Obama ’s Help for Deficit Relief
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , anticipating a $ 21 billion state budget deficit , plans to ask President Barack Obama to ease mandates and minimums on social programs to save as much as $ 8 billion .
The Republican governor plans to seek the relief , according to a California official who asked not to be identified because details have n’t been resolved .
Instead of seeking one - time stimulus money or a bailout , the most - populous U.S. state wants the federal government to reduce mandates and waive rules stipulating expenditures on programs such as indigent health care , the official said .
“ The problem is that there are no easy solutions left , ” said Jean Ross , executive director of the California Budget Project , a Sacramento - based research group concentrating on issues facing the poor .
“ Where do you go to cut that does n’t permanently compromise the level of public services that this state needs to remain economically competitive and to have some semblances of a safety net left for vulnerable populations . ”
“ We ’ve already gone after the low - hanging fruit and the medium - hanging fruit and the higher - hanging fruit , so it ’s going to get tougher and tougher now to balance the budget , ” Schwarzenegger told reporters in November .
The governor has said he wo n’t increase taxes again to close the gap .
That means more cuts , complicated by mandated expenditures for programs such as Medicaid health - care for low - income residents .
With reductions already made to programs for the poor , additional trims jeopardize those federal funds .
Biggest Issuer
“ In terms of programmatic reductions , we have to keep an eye on the fact that in some areas -- be it education or health and human services -- if you run afoul of federal maintenance of efforts requirements , you risk the loss of federal dollars , ” said Schwarzenegger ’s budget spokesman , H.D. Palmer .
“ As tough as 2009 , these factors are going to make 2010 even more challenging . ”
Moody ’s Rating
California ’s general - obligation debt rating from Moody ’s Investors Service is Baa1 , the company ’s eighth - highest investment grade , and A from Standard & Poor ’s , the sixth - highest .
By comparison , Greece , the poorest member of the 16 - nation euro region , is rated two steps higher at A2 by Moody ’s and two lower at BBB + by S&P .
“ California , which is more than three times bigger than Greece , is running out of money , ” T.J. Marta , chief market strategist at Marta On The Markets LLC , a financial - research firm in Scotch Plains , New Jersey , told Bloomberg Radio today .
A Standard & Poor ’s / Investortools index of California state and local debt has returned 13.1 percent this year through Dec. 23 , about 1.5 percentage points less than the national average .
Investors have demanded higher interest rates from California , compared with other borrowers .
The state ’s 10 - year bonds yielded 4.6 percent by the end of last week , 1.51 percentage points more than top-rated municipal borrowers , according to Bloomberg indexes .
Three months ago , that difference was as little as 1.06 percentage points .
Greek 10 - year bonds yield 5.72 percent , Ireland ’s 4.78 percent and Spain ’s 3.93 percent .
“ When you are looking at a deficit in the size we have , everything needs to be on the table , ” Assembly Speaker - Elect John Perez , a Democrat from Los Angeles , told reporters on Dec. 11 .
After the West won the Cold War , democracy flourished in the world as never before .
No more .
The tide of political and human freedom has n't merely slowed but in recent years has turned in the other direction .
Seeing that the U.S. midwifed the post -1989 world , these trends are of more than passing interest .
Democracy 's troubles are summed up in " Freedom in the World 2010 , " the yearly report card published today by Freedom House .
We 're in a " freedom recession , " the advocacy group says .
For the fourth consecutive year , more countries saw declines in political and civic rights than advances , the longest such period of deterioration in the 40 year history of this widely cited report .
Start with the " axis of engagement " states that President Obama sought to butter up diplomatically in his first year in office .
The authoritarian regimes in Russia , Venezuela , Iran and China all became more repressive in 2009 , according to Freedom House measures .
America 's attempts to play nice did n't make the other side any nicer .
Military coups rocked four African states .
Central Asia 's one democratic hope , Kyrgyzstan , was demoted this year from the " partly free " to " not free " category .
The Mideast remains the world 's least fertile soil for democracy .
Only one nation — Israel — qualifies as " free . "
Most of its Arab neighbors went further down the path of repression .
There were declines even in Jordan and Morocco , whose moderate kings moved in the past year to concentrate political power .

A federal judge has rejected claims that the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota defamed a charter school that the ACLU has accused of promoting Islam .
As a public school , Tarek ibn Ziyad Academy ( TiZA ) is a governmental body and can't sue for libel , U.S. District Judge Donovan Frank said in an order dated Wednesday .
The ACLU filed a lawsuit against TiZA in January , claiming the charter school promotes religion in violation of the Constitution 's First Amendment .
The school , which has campuses in Inver Grove Heights and Blaine , has denied the claims .
In July , TiZA countersued , saying the ACLU had defamed the school and hurt its ability to hire qualified teachers .
Among other comments , the school complained after Minnesota ACLU executive director Chuck Samuelson said publicly that TiZA is " a theocratic school . "

And still do .
A recording documents the presence of musicians who are no longer there , but the thing itself can stand in for them , can mediate our relationship to the music we are hearing .
We like to turn it over , gaze at the cover art , devour its liner notes , and arrange it on a shelf in a way that gives it meaning in the context of the other albums we own .
To begin with , there is nothing left to hold in our hands .
Recordings have of course always been physical objects , ever since the first known recording device , a phonautograph , was created in France in the mid-1800s .
Its inventor did not design it to play back a song - he could not conceive of such a thing - but merely to visualize the music as lines on paper .
Before we could dream of reproducing sound , we simply wanted to hold it .
But as I haul boxes of discs down to a basement room - at a time when CD stores have all but vanished from the local landscape and musical downloading has reached a tipping point in our society at large - I ’ve been thinking not only about the virtues of high - tech listening but also about what ’s been lost in our headlong sprint into the digital future .
This is not a Luddite ’s lament , or a cri de coeur about the significantly reduced audio quality of those compressed MP3 files .
I love having more music at arm ’s reach than ever before , I love taking it with me wherever I go .
But I do find myself wondering why , exactly , collecting music now means so much less .
Of course , the conveniences of this approach are vast and , several years into the digital music revolution , still astonishing to me .
A few keystrokes pull up exactly what I ’m looking for .
A couple clicks and 10 majestic symphonies of Gustav Mahler pour onto my cellphone , ready to be summoned while I ’m stopped at a red light or sitting on the train .
The novelty has not worn off .
But this has been an exercise both exciting and melancholy .
My own CD collection once commanded a proud stretch of home - office wall space , but it has become a casualty of urban living with a growing family and I have been slowly transferring it into an iTunes library on my hard drive .
My Mac does not discriminate .
Dufay or du Pré , Eno or Ellington , the computer digests them each with the same chipper whir , and check marks appear on my screen next to each MP3 file I have just created .
I think I am supposed to feel accomplished .
Piles of CDs surround me .
I have been feeding them into my computer to suck the music out of them .
And then I pack them away .
The personal aspects loom large for many collectors , and a home library becomes a kind of autobiography , an index of one ’s quirks , passions , and adventures .
I love for instance my recording of the Tokyo Quartet ( with violinist Peter Oundjian ) playing Schubert ’s “ Death and the Maiden . ’’
The performance is great , but if I ’m honest , I ’d say I love it even more because of the sticker from “ Uncle Bud ’s Deli ’ ’ truck stop that was whimsically slapped onto the CD while on an epic road trip in my early 20s with my string quartet .
That sticker is still there , brittle and crinkled , and the entire album has become a kind of jewel - cased madeleine .
No wonder I ca n’t quite bring myself to pack that one away .
In other words , they can still serve one of the unique functions of many collections , be they music , books , or photographs :
They help us hold together the fugitive pieces of both a historical and a personal past .
It is , by contrast , extremely hard to fetishize an MP3 .
A digital file that lives on our computer is immaterial and deracinated , shorn of context , not to mention liner notes .
Even with CDs , whose charisma is much attenuated , you can still marvel at their silvery iridescence , display them on your shelves , and squint at their spines .
I once knew a passionate collector of 78s , the short - playing shellac records that were manufactured through the end of World War II .
The sound he produced from these records was astounding , and I realized while standing in his living room and listening to Arthur Rubinstein and members of the Pro Arte Quartet sail through Brahms ’s G - Minor Piano Quartet , that I had never truly heard any of the older historic performances that I owned only as CD reissues .
But what made an equally lasting impression was also the sheer size , weight , and physical charisma of these albums , with each side containing only about four minutes of music .
“ Don Giovanni ’’ contained a massive , shelf - warping 46 sides .
It was n’t long before records became mass - produced ; acoustic recordings yielded to electrical , and the technology marched onward .
Different collectors today will tell you with great conviction the point at which everything went to pot .
They seldom agree on the actual date , but you can be sure it was a long time ago .
The history of recordings is , among many other things , the history of the object itself shrinking , and its distinctive aura along with it .
The very first cylinder recordings could not be copied , so an artist had to perform the same piece again and again for each recording .
But what you possessed on the other end was , in some sense , a direct proxy .
It had attended this live performance for you .
Even our collective buying habits hint at a deeper ambivalence about losing music ’s corporeality , its thing - ness .
It ’s somehow no surprise that even as MP3 players get ever - sleeker and more capacious , people are also once again buying turntables and vinyl records in numbers not seen in years .
And within the CD market itself , there is a surprising robustness in the area of box sets .
What are these sets if not quintessential “ collector ’s items , ’’ complete with single - disc slip covers made to look like LP jackets .
They are also big physical hunks of music that can anchor all those vacant shelves after the rest of their contents have disappeared .
The ease of the click
Yet it is not only the object itself , but also the process of bringing it into our lives that has changed .
For a real collector , the hunt to find an object can at once take on the dimensions of sport , art , and life ’s quest .
Even a casual music lover can appreciate the feeling of working hard to track down a particular recording , thumbing through the bins , or scouring the holdings of used - music stores .

Even a casual music lover can appreciate the feeling of working hard to track down a particular recording , thumbing through the bins , or scouring the holdings of used - music stores .
Today ’s increasingly preferred mode of acquiring music - downloading - is a surreally effortless activity .
A few clicks of the mouse , and , as if some cosmic spigot has been opened , the music pours onto your hard drive .
If you are converting a large CD collection , there are services that will do the entire thing for you .
It has become , in some senses , too easy .
If Locke ’s theory of property is true - that we accrue authentic ownership of land through our labor on it - then in this Lockean sense , we no longer own our music to the same extent anymore .
Music can also be copied with disconcerting ease .
Another collector I knew who had gone digital once offered to clone his entire meticulously assembled virtual holdings for me , a sprawling library no doubt assembled over decades .
Drop off a 500 gigabyte hard drive , he said , and his music would be mine .
It was an extremely generous invitation , but it felt like cheating .
Or more eerily , like receiving a transfusion of someone else ’s past .
There is an individualized aspect to collecting , a sense that we are each in it alone .
Concerts bring people together , but assembling a collection is typically a private endeavor .
For the true collector , the critic Walter Benjamin once wrote , “ ownership is the most intimate relationship that one can have to objects .
Not that they come alive in him ; it is he who lives in them . ’’
Saving time Collecting has been around for centuries , but collecting recorded music was , by definition , an invention of the 20th century .
They were mutually reinforcing endeavors - collecting recordings and listening to them .
Both are retrospective activities .
And unlike , say , collecting stamps , records actually capture not just the look or feel of a past event , but something still more ephemeral : its sound .

And unlike , say , collecting stamps , records actually capture not just the look or feel of a past event , but something still more ephemeral : its sound .
Certain recordings can summon the broad pathos of a collective historical moment , or they can trigger the upwelling of memory in an individual mind .
Sometimes both .
Bruno Walter ’s performance of Mahler ’s Ninth Symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic , recorded on the eve of the Anschluss , seems to speak for an entire continent on the edge of the abyss .
The music critic Hans Fantel was at that same concert , and came across the recording five decades later .
It moved him most deeply , he wrote , because it was “ 71 minutes of the 16 years ’’ he had spent with his father , who would subsequently perish in the war .
On the deepest level , a recording - at least a live one - is an invitation to time travel , a chance to resurrect the voices of the dead , a way to indulge a deep instinctual yearning to slow the passage of time .
With a recording , we can preserve that fleeting moment , and play it again and again , according to our will .
In his penetrating book “ The Recording Angel , ’’ Evan Eisenberg calls record listening “ a séance where we get to choose our ghosts . ’’
To collect on a hard drive is to collect without amassing anything , and that is perhaps why , for some , it may ultimately feel less meaningful .
We fasten time a bit less firmly .
The price for all that convenience and instant gratification is that music - not as sound , but as thing - has vanished into the ether .
Yet for any digital collector , the choice of course is not either / or .
You can rip or burn , save or pack away .
And every once in a while , as I plan to do , you can visit it all in the basement , a life in boxes .

High Frequency Trading : The Best Of Technological And Financial Innovation ...

Over the last couple years there 's been growing chatter about the rise of " high frequency trading , " which is the increasingly sophisticated algorithmically - driven way of financial trading , where it has little to do with how smart your investment philosophy is , but how fast your hardware and algorithms run .
As a principle , there 's nothing wrong with the concept of high frequency trading .
And , as many defenders of the concept point out , such systems , in theory , provide more liquidity to many markets , and basically skim pennies off the top in return for that liquidity .
The potential , however comes in when such operations take over the market .
The latest estimates put high frequency trading at 61 % of the market -- up from 30 % just five years ago .
That should be a warning sign .
It 's typical , but you can see it in plenty of previous Wall Street meltdowns as well .
After someone figures out a " system " for making lots of money ( say , mortgage - backed securities a few years back ) , everyone starts piling in .
Then , the " innovation " occurs .
Now , much of it is well - meaning , and even useful .
With mortgage - backed securities , things like credit default swaps actually were a very useful insurance tool originally .
But at some point , they basically flipped from insurance to gambling .
People were n't using them to back up an investment , but as the investment itself -- so you 'd actually have what was , in effect , thousands of people all buying an insurance policy that one house would n't burn down .
If that house burned down ... the insurance company ( hi , AIG ) defaulted , and everything comes crashing down .
The problem is that these systems become so complicated that it 's actually pretty difficult to figure out what the " trigger " is and how the disaster will spread .
No one accurately predicted how the last Wall Street meltdown would occur ( though some certainly predicted a meltdown ) , and the fear with the rise of high frequency trading is that the situation is even more opaque .
What 's happening is built into the algorithms , and with more and more companies piling in , it 's inevitable that some of those algorithms are going to have a bug ( or , not even a bug , but basically programming to do something that has serious unintended consequences ) .
Again , I doubt there 's anything nefarious in most of this ( unless you consider making money nefarious -- which I do n't ) .
But , at some point things get overwhelming , and many are beginning to wonder when we reach that point .
I 'm all for financial innovation and technology innovation -- but I have to admit to a bit of worry when the tech innovation seems to be taking over to such a level that there 's little rationale for the financial side .
It 's about who has the better techies and hardware , rather than who has the better financial thesis , and that leads to dangerous results , because the purpose of the market is separated from the mechanisms that make the market run .
When you get that kind of separation between form and purpose , bad things happen .

In response to what some opponents see as a Congress that does n’t represent their interests , State Legislators are looking to the nearly forgotten American political tradition of nullification as a way to reject any potential national health care program that may be coming from Washington .
In 2010 , residents of Arizona will be voting on a State Constitutional Amendment that would let them effectively opt out of any proposed national health care plan .
Legislatures in Florida , Michigan , Ohio , and Pennsylvania are also considering similar State Constitutional Amendments .
And now , Missouri is joining them .
According to a report in The Missourian , " Rep. Cynthia Davis , R - O’Fallon , pre-filed a bill Dec. 1 that , if approved by voters , would effectively put a halt on any national health care legislation .
Davis said her intent was to give voters a way to protect themselves . "

" To preserve the freedom of citizens of this state to provide for their health care , no law or rule shall compel , directly or indirectly or through penalties or fines , any person , employer , or health care provider to participate in any health care system .
A person or employer may pay directly for lawful health care services and shall not be required to pay penalties or fines for paying directly for lawful health care services .
A health care provider may accept direct payment for lawful health care services and shall not be required to pay penalties or fines for accepting direct payment from a person or employer for lawful health care services .
Subject to reasonable and necessary rules that do not substantially limit a person ’s options , the purchase or sale of health insurance in private health care systems shall not be prohibited by law or rule . "
NULLIFICATION : A HISTORY LESSON
The principle behind such legislation is nullification , which has a long history in the American tradition .
When a state ‘ nullifies ’ a federal law , it is proclaiming that the law in question is void and inoperative , or ‘ non-effective , ’ within the boundaries of that state ; or , in other words , not a law as far as the state is concerned .
Early nullification movements began with the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 .
These resolutions , secretly authored by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison , asserted that the people of the states , as sovereign entities , could judge for themselves whether the federal government had overstepped its constitutional bounds  to the point of ignoring federal laws .

Seventeen people were arrested at an English Defence League ( EDL ) rally in Stoke - on - Trent after trouble broke out .
Four officers were injured and vehicles were damaged when EDL supporters broke through police cordons .
Two of the officers needed hospital treatment .
About 1,500 EDL supporters were at the rally in Hanley on Saturday to protest about Islamic extremism , police said .
Up to 300 members from the group Unite Against Fascism gathered on the other side of Hanley centre .
Multi - faith pledge
Supt Dave Mellor of Staffordshire Police said more than 600 officers had been deployed to the rally and disorder had been " sporadic " .
One officer needed hospital treatment for an arm injury , another needed a facial injury examining by doctors .
Neither of them were required to stay in hospital overnight .
The two other injured officers returned to duty immediately .
During the protest outside The Reginald Mitchell pub in Stoke city centre , the EDL group was surrounded by about 100 officers .
Its members waved placards proclaiming " Patriotism is not racism " and " Terrorists off our streets " .
After gathering outside the pub , the protesters walked 200 yards round the corner to Stoke Town Hall .
BBC Midlands Today reporter Matt Cooke said there had been few problems with the Unite Against Fascism demonstration .
He said there was trouble as the EDL crowd dispersed .
Christian , Muslim , Jewish and Sikh faith leaders signed a pledge against all forms of racism , ahead of the event .
The Right Rev Gordon Mursell , the Church of England Bishop of Stafford , said after signing the pledge on Thursday : " We believe that real diversity actually helps create a vibrant and attractive city .
" The EDL and BNP think the opposite .
That is why we oppose them . "
Staffordshire Police said it had sufficient officers in place to deal with the demonstration and had learnt " valuable lessons " from other police forces around the country , who had dealt with similar protests .
It said the people arrested were aged between 17 and 49 and all " linked " to the EDL demonstration .
They were held on suspicion of committing a series of public order offences , violent disorder as well as assaulting a police officer .
Ninety people were arrested following clashes between EDL campaigners and anti-fascist supporters in Birmingham in September .
KIDNEY BEAN BURGERS
Okay …some of us may toot … but they ’re still super healthy !
I like to use them in lots of ways – although simply in a bowl with a little butter and spices is fantastic – and these burgers were really good .
With added ground nuts to up the protein , the carbs are complex and fiber - filled .
On a toasted whole grain bun or plain with all the fixings , these make a very filling meal .
( They are even better as leftovers . )

1/4 cup pecans , coarsely ground
1/4 cup onion , finely diced
1 clove garlic , minced

When I opened the package from my Secret Santa , the first thing I saw was a note :
" It 's a photo I took in Spain with a giant camera I built out of a delivery truck "
My jaw hit the floor because I knew exactly what was in store .
I saw an article a few months back about a crazy guy who builds what are , in essence , giant pinhole cameras in box trucks .
Check out the story here :

Lo and behold , this guy sent me a print of some windmills in Spain .
I wish it was one of the crazy 3.5 ' x6 ' prints , but I 'm more than happy with the gorgeous framed by 4 " x6 " print I 've got in front of me .
Shaun , I can't thank you enough .
I love it .
It 's going on my wall as soon as I find the perfect spot for it .
To top this all off , Shaun was my second Santa .
I got rematched a few days ago and the package showed up today , Christmas Eve .
Made my day .
I 'm giddy .

“ Few would deny any longer that Communism - Marxism - Leninism and its variants — meant in practice , bloody terrorism , deadly purges , lethal gulags and forced labor , fatal deportations , man -made famines , extrajudicial executions and show trials , and genocide .
It is also widely known that as a result millions of innocent people have been murdered in cold blood . ” — R.J. Rummel
“ Anthropogenic global warming ” has been proven to be a scam , so we can all stop hunching our shoulders for fear of polar bears falling from the sky .
Instead you should arm yourself and your family against marauding bears driven south by the extreme cold .
You might want to keep any pets inside too .
But wait — it appears that the “ global warming ” cabal is not about to go without a fight .
They are now claiming — get this — that “ global warming ” is the cause of “ global cooling ! ”
That ’s right — it is now colder because it ’s warmer .
Far be it for me to ever accuse the Far Left of pristine logic , but this latest ploy is incredible even by their moronic standards .
Recently a senior engineer from China ’s National Climate Center , Ren Fumin , told the “ Beijing Times , ” that “ The severe coldness this winter can be called an extreme weather event . ”
Do n’t expect a Nobel Prize for that observation , Einstein — then again , given the record of the Norwegian idiots passing out those prizes …
Fumin continues , “ The main reason is the emergence of new EI Nino phenomenon caused by global warming . ”
There you go — “ global cooling ” is caused by “ global warming ! ”
These people never stop .
Mere facts and the truth will not deter them .
The key point to the “ global warming ” scam , of course , is that the Far Left claims that “ global warming ” is caused by humanity — specifically that evil greenhouse gas CO2 , carbon dioxide .
The fact that the earth has experienced periods where the CO2 level was much higher than today — totally independent of humanity ’s influence — does n’t register with the Far Left world - view , and therefore is ignored .
The Far Left eco-nutz also blithely ignore the fact that CO2 is a precious life - giving gas , and that almost ALL plant life would quickly die if deprived of its life - giving benefits .
To hear them tell it , CO2 is some toxic killer , akin to Zyklon B .
Perhaps the most disturbing element of the “ global warming ” lie , is that is was fueled by such a relatively small number of “ scientists . ”
The Climategate documents make it abundantly clear that a couple of dozen “ scientists , ” in collusion with the UN ’s IPCC , the liberal press , and academics , were the driving force behind the Big Lie .
These Far Left agenda - driven “ scientists , ” have combined their ideology and professions , into a new fusion of Marxism and science , that could be called “ Marxience ” — being nothing more than the same ol ’
Marxist wolf , in new sheep ’s clothing .
Actually this attack by atheistic ideologues against the truth , is nothing new at all , and its roots can be traced as far back as the ancient Greek , Epicurus ( as Benjamin Wiker brilliantly describes in his book “ Moral Darwinism ” ) .
What ’s new about this current Marxience , is its blasé willingness to use lies , manipulation , and subterfuge , to advance its agenda — the truth is merely a useful tool , to be discarded whenever convenient .
Of great concern is the fact that Marxience — Marxist - driven science — is hardly limited to climate scientists .
When the Council of Europe elected to look into the world - wide “ pandemic ” scam , they took special care to mention the collusion of “ scientists , ” ( Marxientists , and greedy scientists just in it for the money ) .
It has become increasingly obvious that there are a number of Marxientists working in various professional fields , and pushing Far Left agendas , as opposed to searching for the truth .
They make a mockery of science as a whole , and their specific field in particular .
They are most commonly found in the environmental sciences , helping to move along the Far Left ’s cause célèbre , Agenda 21 , in whatever way they can .
( Source )
Their Marxist game plan is to take the wealth from the richer nations , and redistribute it to the poorer ones .
Equal misery for all .
That ’s the main reason behind the “ global warming ” scam .
The fact that the global elitists are also making money hand over fist , via various eco-scams , is just icing on the cake .
( Source )
I should point out that when I use the word “ Marxism ” here , I ’m using it in a broad sense , meant to include all of the “ isms ” that stem from it : Communism , Fascism , Communitarianism , Socialism , Statism , Fabianism , and all the rest .
They are , each and every one of them , mental , emotional , cultural , political , and spiritual pathologies — pathology meaning an illness , a sickness , a disease .
But that ’s the subject for another article .
In the meantime , enjoy the “ global warming , ” and do what you can to help get Scott Brown elected to the Senate .
And keep an eye out for polar bears .
Laus Deo .
Original Post
This post is n’t a newbie asking why lycra and chamois pads are important .
This is more along the lines of the social / cultural aspects of cycling clothes .
I am not a disbeliever in cycling kits .
Not including my two sets of shoes , I have about $ 500 + in clothes .
The garments are typically expensive , and sadly they do get exponentially better when you reach that $ 50 for a pair of shorts level .
I also do not ride exclusively in cycling clothes .
I am not afraid of pedaling along in jeans and t- shirt around town or to go to the store .
After maybe three or four months of trying to use some of my already owned performance clothing used for running or other sports , I found out some of these pieces just did n’t cut it .
Gym shorts will not suit you for a thirty mile ride or more if you do n’t want saddle sores or crotch rub .
With that said , you can clearly take me out of Grant Peterson ’s side of the Venn diagram .
I have many issues with the clothing in this statement for cycling use .
I would n’t have a problem with wearing such clothing ( if it did n’t look like it was two or three sizes too large on the person ) as long as we are n’t talking more than ten miles .
Call it a luxury , call it habit , or even call it weakness , but I see no sense in wearing clothes that will get and stay dirty or eventually be uncomfortable on a ride .
Here is my point and fact on the whole cycling clothing thing :
Road riding demands high effort when climbing , and sprinting , let alone the aerodynamics of it all .
Khakis and a baggy dress shirt just would n’t be the proper accommodations .
Imagine all the sweat , grease on the leg of the pants , and the shirt bunching up on you in the drops .
Just like in mountain biking , cross-country riders have in the last decade switched over to full race kits too .
These outfits keep sweat evaporated , hold your gear while being a weight weenie , do not catch on brush or branches and the clothing goes on even after a crash .
I ’m sure a button or zipper missing would nearly incapacitate a pair of jeans out on the trails .
These types of clothes just make sense for performance driven fun to be even more about the ride .
The one part about Grant Peterson ’s spiel that I agree to is :
Also , when you ’re riding as a group , dressing like other riders , in tight & stretchy clothes , can encourage camaraderie and make you feel part of a group .
On the other hand , no group worth feeling a part of will ostracize you for looking a little different .
There is a lot of social stigma attached to cycling clothing .
We do look like spacemen or superheroes or whatever else you want to associate to the kits that we wear .
At least when I wear lycra , I am planning on riding either a longer distance than normal clothes would allow , or I am focused on speed and efficiency … and I ’m focused on those things a lot .
But not all of us who wear lycra are Cat1 racers setting the pace with their Dura - Ace .
Wearing cycling clothes does typecast us as cyclists that are entrenched into the sport , and it does stereotype us as people you would ask if they are going to ride in the Tour de France if you did n’t know them .
it does look silly .
I love the feel of it though .
I really do .
All in all , it is ingrained into the culture , if you disregard the excuse of comfort .
it is just the thing to wear .
You do n’t play basketball in a three - piece suit , do you ?
I hope you do n’t .
There are also tons of unofficial do ’s and don’ts of the cycling culture around you about your kits .
I mean … who wears rock racing clothing ?
Wearing your favorite team ’s kit can be considered being a poser .
How did all of these double - edged rules and exceptionalities come to be ?
I get flack from friends , family , and coworkers about my bike garb .
This does n’t stop me from wearing it , nor does it really make them want to ride bikes .
I really think that if there was an entry - level , very passive way to introduce cycling clothing to people who do n’t make a six figure budget , it would sell .
Outlier and many other companies are coming out with street wear that is moderately appropriate for long distance , but starts out at like $ 120 for a pair of shorts .
A lot of their clothing is what I wear off of the bike .
Dockers - type shorts and dress shirts .
Sperry topsiders Shoes .
Other well established and comfortable clothes will be sufficient go to the farmer ’s market to buy some veggies or whatnot , but like I stated ; it ’s a joke to go on a half century with this kind of stuff .
I do n’t even want to imagine how much more energy is lost here and there .
If you ’re a non cyclist , and really wonder what all the garb is about – try it .
Do n’t be afraid .
It ’s very useful .
Do n’t worry about random people ’s approval , and get out there .
The prices are a bit prohibitive at first , but the weight lost from riding may help you fit into all of your old clothes in turn saving you money !

The prices are a bit prohibitive at first , but the weight lost from riding may help you fit into all of your old clothes in turn saving you money !
I accidentally deleted my post somehow , this is the 2nd version .
This post is n’t a newbie asking why lycra and chamois pads are important .
This is more along the lines of the social / cultural aspects of cycling clothes .
I am not a disbeliever in cycling kits .
Not including my two sets of shoes , I have about $ 500 + in clothes .
The garments are typically expensive , and sadly they do get exponentially better when you reach that $ 50 for a pair of shorts level .
I also do not ride exclusively in cycling clothes .
I am not afraid of pedaling along in jeans and t- shirt around town or to go to the store .
After maybe three or four months of trying to use some of my already owned performance clothing used for running or other sports , I found out some of these pieces just did n’t cut it .
Gym shorts will not suit you for a thirty mile ride or more if you do n’t want saddle sores or crotch rub .
With that said , you can clearly take me out of Grant Peterson ’s side of the Venn diagram .
I have many issues with the clothing in this statement for cycling use .
I would n’t have a problem with wearing such clothing ( if it didnâ€t look like it was two or three sizes too large on the person ) as long as we arenâ€t talking more than ten miles .
Call it a luxury , call it habit , or even call it weakness , but I see no sense in wearing clothes that will get and stay dirty or eventually be uncomfortable on a ride
Grant Peterson did get one thing right :
Tight and stretchy * is* the way to go if you want to set a personal record on a certain loop you ride , and there ’s a lot of flat and downhill riding in it .
Also , when you ’re riding as a group , dressing like other riders , in tight & stretchy clothes , can encourage camaraderie and make you feel part of a group .
On the other hand , no group worth feeling a part of will ostracize you for looking a little different .
This is right .
Cycling clothes have a stigma to them .
Oh , you ’re a bike racer .
You gonna ride the Tour de France ?
You look like a racer .
But wait , has the rider typecast the clothing into the stereotype or was it the clothing that has put the stigma on the riders ?
Chicken or the Egg , no ?
Personally , I see that there is a threshold that needs to be crossed to have the need to wear cycling clothes .
This threshold includes : Distance – 20 + Miles Performance or Speed Requirements / desires
Road riding twenty miles for several days in a row is just not worth doing in normal clothes for me .
I would end up with bike grease on my clothes , sweat dripping from me the entire time ( think spin bikes at the gym. ) , and the likely chance of chafing .
Cycling clothes make even more sense for cross-country mountain biking since there are so many things to snag shirts and shorts on .
I totally understand the trend of having XC riders wear cycling kits .
Wearing clothing like outlier and other posh crafters is nice for less than twenty miles .
Heck , I wear tons of above the knee shorts without a million cargo pockets , dress shirts / polos /etc , and sperry topsiders on my bike all of the time .
I ’m not trying to be a velofashionista , or ride cycling chic .
This is just an evolved taste of mine .
but I ’ll be damned if I will pay $ 120 for a pair of shorts from these fine companies like Outlier or Rapha .
The most important thing is enduring comfort .
Spend your money on your contact points :
Feet
Rear End
Hands
Everything else is important too , but not as substantial .
Remember these items if you are just starting out or are interested in getting your first bits of cycling gear .
This sounds elitist , but spend some money .
These clothes will last , and you may even lose money with the new enthusiasm for cycling that comes along with them .
The money you save on not having to buy new jeans and shirts can go to bike gear , loans , or even more bike clothes 😀

John Tomlinson , the Michigan Mauler , has now written a column with a cracking 38 howlers in his denial of global warming
I 'm really annoyed with Michigan columnist John Tomlinson .
First , the Michigan Mauler has walked all over the competition for the prestigious Christopher Booker Prize , just a couple of months into the contest to find the world 's most misguided comments on climate change .
He set a high bar with his first article about global warming , which contained 18 magnificent errors .
I feared that this would be impossible to beat .
How wrong I was !
He has now seen off all possible contenders ( except perhaps a repeat performance by his good self ) , with a cracking 38 howlers in one short column for the Flint Journal .
Ironically he made these errors in response to my exposure of his previous claims .
Amazingly , this even beats his own provisional world record for density : the ratio of falsehoods to words .
His first column averaged one misleading statement for every 26 words .
This one delivers one per 21 words .
I intend to submit his second column to the Guinness Book of Records as the most inaccurate article ever published in a newspaper .
Secondly , this astonishing wealth of disinformation means it has probably taken me 100 times longer to respond to his article than he took to write it .
This is why there 's been such a long delay in my response , and a general hold - up in all further entries for the Christopher Booker Prize .
The amount of time I 've wasted on his nonsense means I 'm beginning to regret launching this prize .
And beginning to lose the will to live .
I warn you now : this is a very long blog post .
Like most climate change deniers , the Michigan Mauler makes no attempt to answer his critics .
He does not seek to defend his previous claims ; he simply abandons them and switches to another set of falsehoods .
For example , in the first column he maintains that " The Earth 's temperature peaked in 1998 .
It 's been falling ever since " .
In the second column he claims that " Temperatures plunged until 1850 , then rose , peaking in 1934 . "
He makes no attempt to justify this switch .
He really does n't care , does he ?
There is no attempt to argue here , just to machine - gun his readers with so much nonsense that only people daft enough to devote several days to investigating his claims - as I have just done - can answer them all .
I was not entirely surprised to discover that the Mauler makes his living by practising hypnosis .
Something of the hypnotic method appears to be at work in his articles : if you say it loudly and confidently enough , people will fall under your spell .
As Tomlinson says in promoting his practice , " Hypnosis is easy … intelligence and will , aspects of the conscious mind , are irrelevant .
Only imagination matters .
Almost everyone can be hypnotized , if they so choose . "
I have decided to accept no further entries from the Michigan Mauler .
He 's just too good at this stuff .
He 's almost certain to win the prize , though I 'll be looking high and low for another contender .
The problem is that in order to win they 'll have to produce at least 39 howlers , and the thought of documenting them all is just too much to bear .
Is it worth it , or should I just give up and award this prize to Tomlinson now ?
Anyway , here , in all their glory , are his falsehoods :
Claim 1 .
For most of the last 10,000 years , Earth was much warmer than today .
Fact :
This is bunkum .
Tomlinson , as usual , gives no source for this claim , but it 's probably a new variant on the mid-Holocene canard , which he has somehow extrapolated to the entire period .
NOAA has this to say about it :
In summary , the mid-Holocene , roughly 6,000 years ago , was generally warmer than today , but only in summer and only in the northern hemisphere .
More over , we clearly know the cause of this natural warming , and know without doubt that this proven " astronomical " climate forcing mechanism cannot be responsible for the warming over the last 100 years
Claim 2 .
Even 1,000 years ago it was much warmer .
Fact : Rubbish again .
As you can see from the graphs of past temperature reconstructions ( page 467 in this chapter by the IPCC ) , none of the curves suggest that temperatures 1,000 years ago matched those of today , let alone were much warmer .
Claim 3 . Temperatures plunged until 1850 , then rose , peaking in 1934 .
Fact :
No - only in 48 states of the US , comprising 2 % of the world 's surface .
Claim 4 . According to Nasa , the 1930s was our warmest decade in the 20th century .
Fact :
This appears to be a double extrapolation .
First Tomlinson extends the US 1934 data to the whole planet .
Then he extends it to the whole decade .
The 1930s were n't the warmest decade by any stretch of the imagination , even in the US .
Claim 5 .
We 're still below that temperature .
Fact : Nonsense again , as you can see from the Met Office series .
Claim 6 . Next , a sharp cooling trend began , bottoming in 1979 .
This produced the now infamous " ice age " scare .
GW alarmists always start their numbers from this bottom because temperatures rose until 1998 , before dropping once again .
Fact : Given that Tomlinson , in the same article , cites the recorded temperature series , beginning in 1850 , and the palaeoclimate reconstructions of the past 2,000 years , he evidently knows that this too is bunkum .
I have never seen any scientist or environmentalist use 1979 as the starting point for temperature records .
Claim 7 .
Because temperatures rose until 1998 , before dropping once again .
Now , 11 years later , that bounce is almost gone .
Fact :
For the umpteenth time , 1998 was the warmest year ever recorded , but the trend shows a steady rise across the decades , with the result that eight of the 10 warmest years since 1850 have occurred since 2001 .
In other words , Tomlinson is doing exactly what he wrongly accuses his critics of doing ( see 6 ) : starting his temperature series at a point convenient to his argument .
Claim 8 .
The whole GW argument hinges on which temperature source you quote .
Fact :
No it does n't .
It hinges on the entire range of data , observations , reconstructions and models , spanning many thousands of scientific papers .
Claim 9 .
Many climatologists believe the University of Alabama - Huntsville is the world 's foremost temperature monitoring source because it uses satellite scanning , as opposed to ground stations .
Fact :
No , they see it as one among many useful sources , all of which contribute to the scientific understanding of climate trends and causes .
Claim 10 .
Its data absolutely do not support GW theory .
Fact :
Oh yes they do .
Claims 11 and 12 .
It 's the other global temperature monitoring source , the Goddard Institute of Space Studies ( GISS ) that started the scare .
Facts : " The other " suggests that Tomlinson believes this is the only alternative data source .
Attention was first drawn to the prospect of man-made global warming in 1896 , by Svante Arrhenius .
Claim 13 .
In 1988 , testifying before Congress , Dr James Hansen , head of GISS and an expert in computer modelling , said CO2 production was destroying Earth .
Fact :
He said no such thing .
Claim 14 .
Enlisting Al Gore and his Hollywood minions , they brought fear to the hearts and minds of women and children everywhere .
Fact : Al Gore began raising concerns about climate change soon after becoming a congressman in 1977 .
Claim 15 .
As head of GISS , Hansen personally determines the temperature numbers they publish .
Incredibly , he refuses to say how he got them .
Fact :
Yes , it is incredible , and plain wrong .
Here are some of the places in which Hansen and Nasa explain their methodology :
Hansen , JE , R Ruedy , Mki Sato , M Imhoff , W Lawrence , D
Easterling , T Peterson and T Karl , 2001 : A closer look at United States and global surface temperature change .
J Geophys Res , 106 ,
23947-23963 , doi:10.1029/2001JD000354 .
Hansen , J , R Ruedy , J Glascoe , and Mki Sato , 1999 : GISS analysis of surface temperature change .
J Geophys Res , 104 , 30997-31022 ,
doi:10.1029/1999JD900835 .
GISS Surface Temperature Analysis : Sources
Claim 16 .
Nevertheless , two Canadians , Stephen McIntyre , a mathematician , and environmental economist Ross McKitrick , decided to check .
Fact : Stephen McIntyre has written on this issue .
Ross McKitrick has not .
Claim 17 .
They first achieved fame in 2004 by completely discrediting Michael E Mann , famous for creating the " hockey stick " - shaped temperature graph Gore used to scare the bejesus out of people .
Fact : Yaaawn .
I suppose I 'll have to say it again .
The first hockey - stick paper , produced by Michael Mann et al has been vindicated by subsequent studies ( see the IPCC ) .
As a result of the controversy whipped up by climate change deniers , the hockey - stick paper was investigated by the National Academies of Science in the US .
Its Committee on Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years found the following :
The basic conclusion of Mann et al. ( 1998 , 1999 ) was that the late 20th century warmth in the Northern Hemisphere was unprecedented during at least the last 1,000 years .
This conclusion has subsequently been supported by an array of evidence that includes both additional large - scale surface temperature reconstructions and pronounced changes in a variety of local proxy indicators , such as melting on icecaps and the retreat of glaciers around the world , which in many cases appear to be unprecedented during at least the last 2,000 years .
Claim 18 .
Mann also refused to reveal his methodology .
Fact : Blimey , this ancient meme again .
Mann et al 's methods and data have been picked over more comprehensively than those of just about any other scientific paper over the past 20 years , as Tomlinson must surely know .
They are available for anyone to see .
Claim 19 .
Did you know Gore 's key global warming " fact " was completely destroyed five years ago ?
Fact : Er , no .
It has been repeatedly upheld during that period .
Claim 20 .
The mainstream media wo n't mention it .
Fact : Apart from the hundreds of articles on this topic published in newspapers including the Sunday Telegraph , Daily Express , Australian , Wall Street Journal , Washington Times etc .
Claim 21 .
Fortunately , Canadians know their hockey sticks !
Riding that success , McIntyre and McKitrick took on Hansen 's data to see if maybe he made any mistakes .
Sure enough , he did .
On August 8 , 2007 , Nasa announced these guys had found a gaping flaw in Hansen 's numbers .
The error was huge : .8 degrees Celsius annually .
Fact : No , not 0.8 degrees , 0.001 degrees .
How 's that for a " gaping flaw " ?
Claim 22 .
To put this error into context , the entire GW scare is over a net rise of .6 degrees Celsius in the 20th century .
Fact :
No it 's not .
The concern about global warming arises from the knowledge that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations will continue to raise global temperatures ( the rise is already 0.8 degrees since the beginning of the 20th century ) .
Claim 23 .
Once Nasa re-did Hansen 's numbers , 1934 became our hottest year and 1998 only a secondary peak .
Fact : As Nasa points out :
Contrary to some statements flying around the internet , there is no effect on the rankings of global temperature .
Also our prior analysis had 1934 as the warmest year in the US ( see the 2001 paper above ) , and it continues to be the warmest year , both before and after the correction to post -2000 temperatures .
However , as we note in that paper , the 1934 and 1998 temperature are practically the same , the difference being much smaller than the uncertainty .
The effect on global temperature ( the left side of the figure ; see larger GIF ) was of order one - thousandth of a degree , so the corrected and uncorrected curves are indistinguishable .
Claim 24 .
McKitrick , assistant professor at Guelph University , published a study on GISS data collection in the Journal of Geophysical Research - Atmospheres in 2007 .
Fact :
He did not use GISS data .
Claim 25 .
He found GISS , which relies on surface measures , overstated warming by " about half " due to a laundry list of collection errors .
Fact : Bunkum , yet again .
As Gavin Schmidt has shown , McKitrick 's results emerge only if you do n't take proper account of the fact that nearby locations have correlations in both temperature and economic activity .
Claims 26 and 27 .
Interestingly , GISS lost about 50 % of its stations after the USSR fell in the early 1990s .
As those stations were replaced with computer simulations , Hansen 's " new " numbers began to show a huge acceleration in global warming .
Facts : Gavin Schmidt of Nasa comments :
" Wow .
This one is really out to lunch .
Spatial coverage is pretty much
the same as it was in the early 1990s , and no computer modelling is involved in the GISTEMP analysis . "
Claim 28 .
Today , the vast majority of GISS sites are in the US .
Computer guestimates cover outlying areas , particularly across continents such as Africa and South America , where data collection is almost nonexistent .
Fact : Gavin Schmidt tells me :
" Again simply not true .
While there are areas that are less well covered by stations , the area covered remains at about 80 % of the land area . "
Claim 29 .
Because GISS relies on surface stations , its ocean coverage is abysmal .
Fact :
Oh no it does n't .
Its land - ocean index uses satellite data over the oceans .
Claims 30 and 31 .
Nasa oceanographer John Willis found that ocean temperatures have been falling since at least 2003 .
Facts :
It 's JOSH Willis .
And , as he has shown , his findings were the result of calibration mistakes .
They have since been corrected .
Claim 32 . GISS had no idea .
Fact :
Of course it did n't , because it was a data - gathering error .
Claim 33 .
Now , it turns out , even GISS can't find any global warming whatsoever in the southern hemisphere .
Fact : Nonsense again , as the GISS figures show .
Claim 34 .
Imagine , 70 % of Earth 's surface temperature dropping sharply , and the global warming geniuses did n't have a clue .
Fact :
Yes , you 'll just have to imagine it .
Claim 35 .
Global warming is all about confiscating wealth and power .
Fact :
No , it 's about scientific observation and prediction .
Claim 36 .
Congress passed a law making it illegal ( in five years ) to use incandescent lightbulbs because they cause global warming .
Fact :
No , the act merely ensures that they will no longer be sold by 2014 .
It does not ban their continued use .
Claim 37 .
That 's how we 're slowly losing our freedom : chancing prison for using politically incorrect light bulbs .
Fact :
And he accuses other people of scaremongering !
Claim 38 .
Truly , the world is n't getting warmer
Fact :
Yes , it is getting warmer .
For how much longer will the Flint Journal employ John Tomlinson to produce this rubbish ?

The People Making “ The Rules ” are Dumber Than You
Recently the administration at the hospital where I work announced their intention to become a cardiac “ Center of Excellence . ”
Certification requires a considerable amount of employee education on 12 - lead telemetry and the like .
If you ’ve ever worked in a hospital , you know that “ employee education ” equates to a bunch of photocopied “ inservice ” handouts , mostly on stuff that ’s completely unrelated to your job and with post - tests you can pass without remembering any of it five minutes later .
That got me thinking about a number of things :
About how irrelevant most of the material is to the jobs of most of the people studying it .
About how irrelevant the metrics of the people in charge are to what they are supposedly trying to measure .
About how opaque genuine standards of excellence , and the work being judged , are to the people making policies .
About how such “ certification , ” like ISO - 9000 and JCAHO , is a gimmick designed mainly to impress yokels on the outside who do n’t know any better .
The people who regulate what you do , in most cases , know less about what you ’re doing than you do .
It does n’t matter whether it ’s nominally a “ public ” or “ private ” organization , or how smart the people running it are as individuals .
No matter how smart the people in charge are , they are systematically stupid in their organizational roles , because of the dynamics of information flow in hierarchies ( as described by Robert Anton Wilson , for example ) .
Organizations are pyramids , and the people at the tops of the pyramids tend to communicate much more effectively with each other than they do with those at the bottoms of their own respective pyramids .
That means that most organizations are riddled with “ best practices ” based almost entirely on feedback about how well they worked from people at the tops of the other pyramids .
And those latter people have almost no valid knowledge of how the policies actually worked in their own organizations .
Remember the story of the Emperor ’s new clothes ?
Large organizations are designed to insulate naked emperors from unpleasant feedback .
That set of clothes must look good , because the emperors at the other organizations all have a set just like it , and they ca n’t stop talking about how great they look !
The state , by promoting centralization and hierarchy and insulating bureaucratic organizations from the competitive consequences of their inefficiency , causes such irrationality to predominate in our society .
We ’re living in the world of Terry Gilliam ’s “ Brazil . ”
Once you view the people making the rules as people like you , just using their own judgment based on their subjective assessment of events , it ’s pretty hard to respect “ the rules ” as something handed down from Mount Sinai .
You view the rule makers as your equals , and their rules as suggestions to be judged based on your own assessment of the reasoning behind them .
And more often than not , you find the judgment of the people making the rules is inferior to that of the people in direct contact with the situation .
Once you take this view , you ’re likely to resist attempts to force you to substitute someone else ’s authority - based rules for your own judgment , or to promise not to do anything before you ’ve had a chance to assess the situation for yourself .
You ’re likely to treat rules imposed by people not directly involved in the situation as a form of irrationality , and to treat bureaucratic irrationality as an obstacle to be routed around by the people actually doing the work .
For example , every time I drive over the Boston Mountains in western Arkansas , I see endless “ suggested speed limits ” signs .
But I can tell by the feel of the truck under me , as it handles a curve , whether the suggested speed limit is a reasonable one .
And I would guess that I ’ve driven that route a lot more times than the person who set the limit .
Another good example is Robert Pirsig ’s account , in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance , of how a technical writer composes the assembly instructions or manual for something like a bicycle .
Generally the foreman takes the most dispensable worker off the assembly line to “ advise ” the writer based on his personal judgment , from just looking at the parts , of the best way to fit them together .
Despite the common view of “ The Dictionary ” as some sort of superhuman authority , dictionary definitions , standard pronunciations , etc. , are determined by lexicographers based on field observations of how a majority of educated people actually use the words .
All these “ rules ” and “ instructions ” are based on the subjective judgment of people just like you .
So when it ’s a choice between authority - based rules and your own lying eyes , go with your lying eyes .
robots .
txt is a useful file which sits in your web site ’s root and controls how search engines index your pages .
One of the most useful declarations is “ Disallow ” — it stops search engines accessing private or irrelevant sections of your website , e.g .
Disallow : / junk / Disallow : /temp / Disallow : /section1/mysecretpage.html
You can even block search engines indexing every page on your domain :
User-agent : * Disallow : /
I ’m not sure why anyone would do this , but someone , somewhere will not want their site to appear in search engine results .
However , blocked pages can still appear in Google .
Before you step on your soapbox to rant about Google ’s violation of robots .
txt and the company ’s abusive control of the web , take a little while to understand how and why it happens .
Assume you have a page at http://www.mysite.com/secretpage.html containing confidential information about your company ’s new Foozle project .
You may want to share that page with partners , but do n’t want the information to be public knowledge just yet .
Therefore , you block the page using a declaration in http://www.mysite.com/robots.txt:
User-agent : * Disallow : /secretpage.html
A few weeks later , you ’re searching for “ Foozle ” in Google and the following entry appears :
mysite.com/secretpage.html
How could this happen ?
The first thing to note is that Google abides with your robots .
txt instructions — it does not index the secret page ’s text .
However , the URL is still displayed because Google found a link elsewhere , e.g .
< a href = " http://mysite.com/secretpage.html "
>
Read about the new Foozle project …</a>
Google therefore associates the word “ Foozle ” with your secret page .
Your URL might appear at a high position in the search results because Foozle is a rarely - used term and your page is the sole source of information .
In addition , Google can show a page description below the URL .
Again , this is not a violation of robots .
txt rules — it appears because Google found an entry for your secret page in a recognized resource such as the Open Directory Project .
The description comes from that site rather than your page content .
Can Pages Be Blocked ?
There are several solutions that will stop your secret pages appearing in Google search results .
1 . Set a “ no index ” meta tag
Google will never show your secret page or follow its links if you add the following code to your HTML < head > :
< meta name = " robots " content = " no index , no follow " />
2 . Use the URL removal tool
Google offer a URL removal tool within their Webmaster Tools .
3 . Add authentication
Apache , IIS , and most other web servers offer basic authentication facilities .
The visitor must enter a user ID and password before the page can be viewed .
This may not stop
Google showing the page URL in results , but it will stop unauthorized visitors reading the content .
4. Review your publishing policies
If you have top - secret content , perhaps you should n’t publish those documents on a publicly accessible network !
Some dressed in sackcloth , a few crawling on their hands and knees , thousands of Cubans paid homage to a Catholic saint who doubles as a powerful deity in the Afro - Cuban Santeria faith .
The Saint Lazarus pilgrimage on Thursday is one of the most important religious events on the communist - run island , melding Afro-Cuban faiths with Roman Catholic beliefs that were marginalized for decades after the 1959 revolution .
Devotees of Saint Lazarus , who traditionally wear sackcloth and purple clothing as symbols of repentance , flock to the shrine at a church near the village of El Rincon in the countryside just outside Havana .
Saint Lazarus is associated with helping the sick , and many of the pilgrims go to ask the saint to cure relatives ’ ailments .
Others make long , hard journeys barefoot or haul themselves along the ground on their hands and knees .
Experts explain this fusion of Santeria and Christian figures by saying that African slaves in Cuba originally pretended to worship the Catholic saints of their Spanish masters while secretly paying homage to their own deities .

Tinnitus causes ringing , buzzing , roaring , hissing or whistling Individually designed music therapy may help reduce the noise levels experienced by people who suffer from tinnitus , say German researchers .
They altered participants ' favourite music to remove notes which matched the frequency of the ringing in their ears .
After a year of listening to the modified music , individuals reported a drop in the loudness of their tinnitus .
The researchers said the " inexpensive " treatment could be used alongside other techniques to relieve the condition .
It could significantly complement widely - used and rather indirect psychological treatment strategies
Dr Christo Pantev
Westphalian Wilhelms University
It is thought that around 1 - 3 % of the population have chronic ringing in their ears which is significant enough to reduce their overall quality of life .
Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the researchers said although the cause of tinnitus remains unknown , it has been shown that the part of the brain that processes sounds is frequently disrupted in people with the condition .
The theory behind the new technique is that removing the spectrum of noise associated with tinnitus from the music reduces activity in the brain relating to that frequency , alleviating the condition .
Therapy
The 39 patients who took part in the study all had chronic tinnitus for an average of five years but had no other hearing problems .
They were split into three groups and were offered either the modified music therapy , a dummy version of music therapy or usual treatment .
Participants listened to the music for an average of 12 hours a week and by the end of the study , those who had been given the tailored music reported a significant drop in the level of the ringing they heard compared with those listening to the dummy version .
Study leader Dr Christo Pantev , from Westphalian Wilhelms University in Munster , said the approach specifically targeted the part of the brain responsible for tinnitus .
" The notched music approach can be considered as enjoyable , low cost , and presumably causal treatment that is capable of specifically reducing tinnitus loudness .
" It could significantly complement widely - used and rather indirect psychological treatment strategies . "
Dr Ralph Holmes , director of biomedical research at deaf and hard of hearing charity , RNID , said he would look in detail at the findings .
" While we find it encouraging there is new investment in treatment for tinnitus , we know there is no proven ' cure ' .
" This seems to be similar to tinnitus retraining therapy which is one of the most common ways of managing the condition . "

the singapore based horizon fuel cell technologies is showing off the hydrofill , a fuel cell system designed for charging electronic gadgets at CES 2010 .
the product will be released later this year and allows users to charge up their favourite mobile or small electronics with a hydrogen fuel cell .
the device extracts the hydrogen from water and stores it in special cartridges , which fit into the pocket size minipak .
the minipak uses a USB port to charge everything from ipods and cameras to rechargeable batteries and GPS devices .
the process of turning water into hydrogen is very clean too , since its only produces water vapour as a result .

The Advanced Research Projects
Agency for energy put out its second call for new ideas , and this time , the agency has narrowed its focused to three research fields .
The new arm of the Department of Energy , which is dedicated to high - risk , high - reward innovations , is betting $ 100 million on batteries for cars , new materials for capturing carbon , and microorganisms that can convert sunlight and carbon dioxide directly into fuels .
" This solicitation focuses on three cutting - edge technology areas which could have a transformational impact , " said Energy Secretary Steven Chu , in a release .
Energy gets used in a lot of different ways , so no single technology can make all the difference .
That said , a few key pieces of technology would provide the political world with better clean - energy options .
We use coal to make half the nation 's electricity .
Fossil fuels , mostly oil , burned for transportation account for roughly one - third of American emissions .
Finding cheaper , cleaner solutions to the key problems of baseload generation and fuel for cars would be major steps toward reducing carbon emission and dependence on foreign oil .
This is the second call for proposals the DOE outfit has issued .
ARPA is modeled after the military 's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency .
This new request is as narrow as the last was wide .
In the first grants announced in October , ARPA - E spread the first $ 150 million from its coffers broadly on 37 different technologies across the energy landscape from building efficiency to biomass conversion to waste heat capture .
Each endeavor received between $ 500,000 and $ 9 million .
Energy - dense , low - cost , long - lived batteries have been a dream of inventors since Thomas Edison claimed to have solved the problem in 1901 .
His battery was described by The New York Times as " combining all of the long - sought advantages of lightness , durability , and effectiveness . "
It was so good , in fact , that " it was predicted that a new art of electrical propulsion and navigation would result . "
Though that has yet to happen , scientific knowledge of materials at the nanoscale has grown by leaps and bounds .
ARPA -E is looking for battery makers who can meet the ambitious goals ( .pdf ) laid out by the United States Advanced Battery Consortium , a group of car makers working with the government .
Another area where scientific knowledge has been growing at an astounding pace is microbiological genomics .
Scientists have gone beyond understanding individual gene functions to tweaking them for specialized functions .
Synthetic biologists are working to develop microorganisms that are , in essence , programmable .
One company , LS9 , calls them " DesignerMicrobes . "
The equation that the DOE would like these biological machines to solve is simple : CO2 and sunlight in , a substitute for oil out .
Already , a flock of synthetic biology companies like Amyris , Solazyme and Synthetic Genomics are trying to create alternatives to oil using microorganismal genomics , and the DOE would like to see more .
Carbon dioxide capture is considered a mainline strategy for reducing carbon dioxide emissions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , but it requires a substantial percentage of the energy that the plant produces to do it .
It 's thought that new materials could , as the DOE puts it , " dramatically reduce the parasitic energy penalties and corresponding increase in the cost of electricity required for carbon capture . "
Some labs , like Omar Yaghi's at UCLA and Gerbrand Ceder 's at MIT , have developed new methods for finding large amounts of new materials and determining their properties .
Their work is a promising start , but more carbon capture is n't the only step needed to keep smokestack emissions from warming the earth .
They also have to be permanently buried .
Last year , energy researcher Vaclav Smil at the University of Manitoba estimated that to bury just 25 percent of CO2 produced by power plants would required moving twice the material the world 's crude - oil industry ( . pdf ) does now .
That 's a tall order and would require a heck of a lot of pipes and caverns .

Roman pottery was found next to the skeleton
A skeleton has been uncovered by builders carrying out refurbishment work at Yorkshire Museum .
The skeleton was found in a shallow grave as work was carried out on the museum 's drains .
The remains have been removed by archaeologists .
They will be examined by experts to try to work out how long the skeleton had been there for .
The museum was built on the site of the medieval St Mary 's Abbey .
A 4 m ( 13ft ) deep well was also discovered .
Its curator of archaeology , Andrew Morrison , said : " At this stage it is very hard to work out much about him or her , but they were buried east to west which suggests a Christian burial .
" Roman pottery was also found , but whether the skeleton is of the same age is not known at this stage . "

A model of the history of human misery A model of the history of human misery
In the comments below I was outlining a simple model which really is easiest to communicate with a chart .
I removed the labels on the Y and X axes because the details do n't matter , the X axis is simply " time , " and the Y axis simply reflects the magnitudes of the three trendlines .
The key is to focus on the relationship between the three .
I 've labeled for clarity , but more verbal exposition below ....
For most of the human history we 've been hunter - gatherers .
But over the past 10,000 years there was a switch in lifestyle , farming has emerged
I am willing to grant that the median hunter - gatherer exhibits somewhat less
There 's plenty of evidence that farming supports many more people per unit of land , so in pure demographic terms hunter - gathering was bound to be doomed .
They did n't have the weight of numbers .
But why did the initial farmers transition from being hunter - gatherers to farmers in the first place ?
Because I think that farming was initially the rational individual choice , and led to more potential wealth and reproductive fitness .
Remember , there 's a big difference between existing in a state of
I suspect that new farming populations which slam up against the Malthusian limit suffered even more misery than their descendants .
This is because I believe that their demographic explosion had outrun their biological and cultural capacity to respond to the consequences of the changes wrought upon their environment .
First and foremost , disease .
During the expansionary phase densities would have risen , and infectious diseases would have begun to take hold .
But only during the stationary state would they become truly endemic as populations become less physiologically fit due to nutritional deficiencies .
The initial generations of farmers who reached the stationary state would have been ravaged by epidemics , to which they 'd only slowly develop immunological responses ( slowly on a human historical scale , though fast on a evolutionary one ) .
This is even evident in relatively recent historical period ; Italians developed biological and cultural adaptations to the emergence of malaria after the fall of Rome ( in terms of culture , there was a shift toward settlement in higher locations ) .
But there would be more to adapt to than disease .
Diet would be a major issue .
During the expansionary phase it seems plausible that farmers could supplement their cereal based diet with wild game .
But once they hit the stationary phase they would face the trade - off between quantity and quality in terms of their foodstuffs .
Hunter - gathering is relatively inefficient , and can't extract as many calories per unit out of an acre ( at least an order of magnitude less ) , but the diet tends to be relatively balanced , rich in micronutrients , and often fats and protein as well .
The initial shock to the physiology would be great , but over time adaptations would emerge to buffer farmers somewhat from the ill effects of their deficiencies .
This is one hypothesis for the emergence of light skin , as a way to synthesize vitamin D endogenously , as well as greater production of enzymes such as amylase and persistence of lactase , which break down nutrients which dominate the diet of agriculturalists .
Once societies reached a stationary state it would take great shocks to push them to a position where becoming hunter - gatherers again might be an option .
A population drop of 50 % , not uncommon due to plague or political collapse , would still not be low enough so that the remaining individuals would be able to subsist upon game and non-cultivated plant material .
Additionally the ecology would surely have been radically altered so that many of the large game animals which might have been the ideal sources of sustenance in the past would be locally extinct .
The collapse of the Western Roman Empire and the highland Maya city - states seems to have resulted in lower population densities and reduced social complexity , but in both regions agriculture remained dominant .
On the other hand , there is some evidence that the sui generis event .
The model I highlight above is very stylized , and I am aware that most societies go through multiple cycles of cultural , and possibly biological , adaptation .
The putative massive die off of native populations of the New World may have resulted in a reversion to simpler hunter - gatherer cultural forms in many regions ( North America , the Amazon ) , and also reduced morbidity as diets once more became diversified and indigenous infectious diseases abated due to increased physiological health and decreased population density .
In China between 1400 and 1800 there was a massive expansion of population beyond the equilibrium established between the Han and Song dynasties .
The reasons for this are manifold , but one was perhaps the introduction of New World crops .
Clearly in Ireland the introduction of the potato initially resulted in greater health for the population of that island , as in the 18th century the Irish were taller than the English because of their enthusiastic adoption of the new crop .
Over the long term , at least from the perspective of contemporary humans , agriculture was not a disaster .
Dense populations of farmers eventually gave rise to social complexity and specialization , and so greater productivity .
Up until the 19th century productivity gains were invariably absorbed by population growth or abolished by natural responses ( e.g. , in the latter case Sumerian irrigation techniques resulted in gains in productivity , but these were eventually diminished by salinization which entailed a shift from wheat to barley , and eventually an abandonment of many fields ) .
Additionally , the rise of mass society almost immediately birthed kleptocratic rentier classes , as well as rigid social forms which constrained human individual choice and possibilities for self - actualization .
The noble savage who lives in poverty but has freedom may look ludicrous to us today , but from the perspective of an 18th century peasant who lives in poverty but has no freedom it may seem a much more appealing model ( though these sorts of ideas were in any case the purview of leisure classes ) . *
But 10,000 years of crooks who innovate so that they could continue to steal more efficiently eventually gave rise to what we call modern capitalism , which broke out of the zero-sum mentality and banished Malthusian logic , at least temporarily ( remember that it is critical to note that population growth leveled off after the
I should qualify this though by noting that we can't know if the emergence of modern capitalism was inevitable in a historical sense .
It happened once in Western Europe , and has spread through the rest of the world through emulation ( Japan ) or demographic expansion ( the United States ) .

We do n't have data on independent shifts toward modern capitalist economies .
I suspect that the shift toward capitalism is probably inevitable over the long term because I do n't think pre-modern agricultural civilizations would ever have been exploitative enough of the natural resource base that they would have been subject to worldwide collapse in any normal timescale .
So there would always be potential civilizations from which modern post - Malthusian technological civilization could have emerged .
For most of the human history we 've been hunter - gatherers .
But over the past 10,000 years there was a switch in lifestyle , farming has emerged independently in several locations , and filled in all the territory in between .
One truism of modern cultural anthropology is that this was a big mistake , that hunter - gatherer lifestyles were superior to those of peasant farmers , less miserable with much more free time .
I think this is somewhat unsubtle , which is ironic since cultural anthropologists really love to deconstruct the errors of others which they themselves are guilty of ( i.e. , in this case , the normative aspect immediately jumps out in the scholarship .
There 's little doubt as to who they 're " rooting " for ) .
I am willing to grant that the median hunter - gatherer exhibits somewhat less morbidity than the median farmer .
They 're taller and have better teeth than farmers .
Compared to modern people living in developed countries though the differences will seem trivial , so remember that we 're talking on the margins here .
So why did societies transition from hunter - gathering to farming ?
I doubt there 's one simple answer , but there are some general facts which are obvious .
There 's plenty of evidence that farming supports many more people per unit of land , so in pure demographic terms hunter - gathering was bound to be doomed .
They did n't have the weight of numbers .
But why did the initial farmers transition from being hunter - gatherers to farmers in the first place ?
Remember , there 's a big difference between existing in a state of land surplus and one of labor surplus .
American farmers were among the healthiest and most fertile human populations which had ever lived before the modern era .
Pioneers had huge families , and continued to push out to the frontier .
This was not the lot of Russian serfs or Irish potato farmers .
But eventually frontiers close , and Malthusian logic kicks in .
The population eventually has nowhere to go , and the surplus of land disappears .
At this point you reach a " stationary state , " where a peasant society oscillates around its equilibrium population .
I suspect that new farming populations which slam up against the Malthusian limit suffered even more misery than their descendants .
This is because I believe that their demographic explosion had outrun their biological and cultural capacity to respond to the consequences of the changes wrought upon their environment .
First and foremost , disease .

The collapse of the Western Roman Empire and the highland Maya city - states seems to have resulted in lower population densities and reduced social complexity , but in both regions agriculture remained dominant .
On the other hand , there is some evidence that the Mississippian societies might have experienced die offs on the order of 90 % due to contact with Spanish explorers , and later ethnography by European settlers suggests much simpler tribal societies than what the Spaniards had encountered .
Though these tribal groupings , such as the Creeks , still knew how to farm , it seems that judging from the conflicts which emerged due to European encroachment on hunting grounds that this population drop was great enough to allow for a greater reversion to the pre-agricultural lifestyle than was able to occur elsewhere .
But then the pre-Columbian exchange and the exposure of native populations to the 10,000 years of Eurasian pathogen evolution was to some extent aevent .

How to Feed Your Family on $ 4 a Week
In this video for Good Morning , America , a mother shares her secrets for buying a week 's worth of meals for just $ 4 .
Dec. 16 , 2009  -- British teenager Tom Reid visited a nightclub the day after enrolling in college .
It seems the loud music he heard there may have killed him .
According to reports in the British press , Reid died at a London nightclub after complaining that the bass was affecting his heart rate .
While definite answers have been hard to come by , an underlying condition may have played a role in his death .
While details remain unclear , experts in the United States say that given the circumstances , the death matches the profile of someone with a rare genetic disorder known as long QT syndrome , although they can not say for sure .
" Any time someone in a setting of excitement has a sudden cardiac arrest , especially at a young age with a seemingly normal heart , you have to consider [ an inherited condition ] such as long QT , " said Dr. Richard Page , chair of medicine at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health and president of the Heart Rhythm Society .
" One of the genetic variants is especially predisposed to having an arrhythmia when exposed to loud sound . "
While loud sounds have been known to set off irregular heartbeats in patients with long QT syndrome , it is unclear whether the thumping bass , in particular , had any effect .
" I do n't think the bass is the problem per se , just the loud noise , " said Dr. Anne B. Curtis , chief of cardiovascular disease at the University of South Florida .
Reid 's family could not be reached by ABCNews.com for comment .
But while the genetic disorder is rare , many have been affected by long QT syndrome .
" My story is one of thousands , " Mary Jo Gordon , executive director of the Cardiac Arrhythmias Research and Education ( C.A.R.E. )
Foundation , Inc. told ABCNews.com .
Gordon became involved in research and advocacy for heart conditions after her sister suffered cardiac arrest at the age of 17 , in 1979 .
While Gordon 's sister survived , she requires round - the - clock care today because of the brain damage that resulted .
A Silent Disease , Triggered by Noise
Gordon has since worked as a medic and in the medical devices industry .
But it was years after her sisters attack before she learned she , too , had long QT .
" I did n't find out until 1993 , " she said , explaining that , as one of eight siblings , they all were tested .
" Of the eight of us , five of us have the disorder . "
Gordon said another sister had cardiac arrest at the age of 22 , while a nephew has had cardiac arrest twice .
Typically , she said , it is a result of symptoms or a family member when the disorder will be discovered .
Fortunately , however , testing can be done , in the form of an ECG or EKG , which will detect the vast majority of cases , and through medication , a pacemaker or a defibrillator , " If they find it , it 's treatable , " said Gordon .
Long QT syndrome derives its name from the fact that on a heart monitor , the phase of the heartbeat between points known as Q and T would be lengthened .
It comes in a few variants , and they can be triggered by a variety of conditions .
In some cases it can be caused by exercise , and in other variants , being in the water seems to cause it .
" My sister 's cardiac arrest was caused by a minor car accident , " said Gordon , explaining that a sudden startling event can play a role .
In her nephew 's case , the cardiac arrest was triggered by an alarm clock , and in one family she spoke with recently , a 6 - year - old patient suffered cardiac arrest because of a security alarm .
The 6 - year - olds parents , however , saved the child 's life by doing CPR -- a successful story that may provide a lesson for anyone worried about losing a loved one to a sudden heart attack .
" I do n't think that this is a call for action for not standing near a loud speaker .
But I do think that any time a young person dies it is an opportunity to remind all of us that public places should have AEDs , and we all should know CPR , " said Page .
In Reid 's case , it seems unusual only because the music was continuous , and does not appear to have been the result of a single loud burst of sound .
" The usual description of auditory - triggered arrhythmias and death have been those that occurred suddenly such as an alarm clock or an explosion , not usually a continual loud noise , " said Dr. Thomas McDonald , a cardiologist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York .
" Of course , I have no idea of the tempo or volume dynamics of the music in this concert . "
Lessons from Tragedy
While diagnosing long QT syndrome can prove difficult after death , it can be important for relatives of someone who dies from sudden heart failure to get a genetic test .
One thing that should be done in the case like Reid 's is " they should do post mortem genetic testing to get a definitive cause of death .
This would have implications for family members , " said Dr. Laurence Epstein , chief of the arrhythmia service and Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston .
Indeed , diagnosing long QT syndrome after death can prove tricky without genetic testing .
When the coroner does the autopsy , " There 's not [ an ] enlarged heart , there is n't necessarily plaque in their arteries , " said Gordon .
In an annual screening event her group does at Madison Square Garden , where they give free ECGs to 200 children , Gordon said they ask about a history of sudden death in families as well as unexplained fainting , convulsions , seizures or dizziness in individuals .
But as shocking as the sudden death of a young person may be , long QT syndrome is not something the average person needs to worry about .
" It is infrequent and there is no reason for public alarm , if indeed this is the cause of death in this individual , " said Dr. Douglas P. Zipes , editor - in - chief of HeartRhythm and a cardiologist at the Indiana University School of Medicine .
In the end , Page said , the vast majority of people at a loud nightclub should have bigger concerns than their hearts .
" I feel that people are more at risk for damage to their ears rather than heart arrhythmias from loud music , " he said .

A Happy New Year to all of you !
We hope you all had a nice holiday season , ate yummy meals and enjoyed some quality time with your family and friends .
While doing exactly the same as everybody , the Amarok developers did also sneak out in the middle of the night to sit at their computers and add a bugfix here , a usability improvement there , and polish all around to make sure you will truly enjoy our new release : Amarok 2.2.2 !
As already announced for the beta release , we focused on improvements and bugfixes , but let us remind you of the new features in this release first :
The Custom Labels are back and allow you to add your personal touch to your music .
Another new addition that will add quite some color to your music experience : the moodbar makes his entry in the 2.2 series so you can change the progress bar to fit with your current mood , be this normal , angry , frozen or just happy :)
To help you setting this up we prepared a wiki page with the necessary instructions .
Editing the lyrics is made much easier now since you can just click on the lyrics applet , press F2 and you can correct the misspelled words and occasional mis-hearings :)
A little tweak in the settings page of the applet allows you to also change the font settings .
You always wanted to see the Beats Per Minute of a track ?
You can now edit , filter and sort your music by that criteria .
The podcasts section has seen many new features and improvements , since you can now show the HTML information for podcasts supporting it , import podcast subscriptions from OPML and gain some considerable memory usage by limiting the simultaneous download to a maximum of four as well as modify the update interval in the configuration file .
The grouping of podcasts has improved and you now also have automatically downloaded logos for each subscription .
Already existing files are not downloaded again and you can remove downloaded episodes when removing a subscription ..
We also made some small changes to streamline some functionality : The Playlist Layout Editor is now part of the Tools menu in the menu bar , while the playlist actions are at the bottom of the playlist panel .
This has the big advantage to see immediately if you did activate a random , repeat and / or favor mode by a visual indicator .
There are many more features to discover , many changes and an impressive list of bugfixes in this release .
Below are the changes since the release of 2.2.2 Beta 1 .
Let us just mention one other important change : Amarok now depends on KDE 4.3.x and Qt 4.5 .
Expect a few very nice new things in the month to come , while we will be making use of the many new features provided by those KDE and Qt versions .
Kinder , die Kurznachrichten über ihr Handy verschicken und dabei sehr häufig Kürzel wie LOL , plz oder l8er nutzen , haben weniger Probleme beim Lesen und Schreiben der regulären Sprache als andere Kinder .
Das hat die Psychologin Clare Wood von der Universität im britischen Coventry durch Langzeitbeobachtung von 63 Schülern im Alter von 8 bis 12 Jahren laut Mitteilung herausgefunden .
Die Neigung der Kinder zum Verfassen von SMS mit Abkürzungen nimmt nach Woods Beobachtung mit dem Alter zu ; in der vierten Klasse betrieb ungefähr ein Fünftel der Kinder " textism " , in der sechsten Klasse rund die Hälfte .
Die Wissenschaftlerin schließt daraus , dass zum Verfassen solcher Nachrichten fortgeschrittene sprachliche Fertigkeiten nötig sind .
Die Nutzung von Abkürzungen fördere sogar die Lese - und Schreibfähigkeit .
Es gebe insgesamt einen derart engen Zusammenhang , dass vom Ausmaß der Nutzung von Abkürzungen auf die Entwicklung der " phonological awareness " der Kinder geschlossen werden könne , also auf die Fähigkeit , Sprachmuster zu entdecken , einzugrenzen und zu verändern .
Beispielsweise bewegten sich Kinder , die sagen können , welche Wörter sich reimen , in dieser Hinsicht auf einem höheren Niveau .
Wood und ihre Kollegen wollten nach eigenen Angaben mit der Untersuchung herausfinden , ob es Belege für die über die Medien verbreiteten Vermutungen gebe , Kurznachrichten schadeten sprachlichen Fähigkeiten und insgesamt dem englischen Wortschatz .
Die Forscher geben an , selbst überrascht von den Ergebnissen der Studie gewesen zu sein .
Zur Nutzung von Abkürzungen seien offenbar dieselben Fähigkeiten wie beim korrekten Buchstabieren von Wörtern nötig .
Zudem sei " Texting " eine wertvolle Form der Kontaktaufnahme in geschriebenem Englisch , durch die sich Kinder täglich im Lesen und Schreiben übten .
Es gebe insgesamt unter Kindern eine Tendenz zu mehr Lese - und Schreibproblemen , aber nicht wegen , sondern trotz der Nutzung von Kurznachrichten , teilte Wood mit .
Weitere Forschungen in dieser Richtung sollen auch zu einem Umdenken bei Lehrern und Eltern beitragen .
Nächstes Jahr soll ein abschließender Bericht vorliegen .

Tourists visiting the remote site of Machu Picchu , the ancient Inca city in the Peruvian Andes , are waiting to be airlifted out of the area by helicopters after torrential rain caused landslides to block the railway line which is the only major land route to the site .
Up to 40 landslides are believed to have cut the railway , a 70 - mile ( 112 km ) line from the city of Cuzco which snakes its way through a narrow , steep - sided river valley .
The line was cut on Saturday and may remain blocked until later in the week .
Two Peruvians , one a baby , were killed when mudslides engulfed homes .
The Peruvian authorities have declared a state of emergency and have designated 10 helicopters to evacuate visitors .
Reports tonight said some people were being airlifted from the site .
Sarah Child , a British tourist on a tour with Intrepid Travel , has been stranded in Machu Picchu for two days .
She estimated there were 1,500 tourists , mainly Australian and American , trapped there .
Most would have expected to stay just a night at the site , which has only one hotel , which has been providing food and shelter for those marooned .
Child 's tour group has been put up at the hotel , but she said some people were sleeping in the city 's square .
The 25 - year - old said reports of tourists already being airlifted out were wide of the mark .
She said there had been little communication from the Peruvian authorities ; she had only seen two police helicopters in the last 48 hours and the only person she had seen evacuated was the city 's mayor , who was going to plead for help from the government .
" We 're running out of food and water , they 're running out of gas , " she said .
" There 's no hot water , no gas to cook with . "
Child said plans to bring in helicopters to airlift people out had so far been thwarted by the weather .
" The river is really , really high and ferocious . "
She said most of the tourists were in good spirits , but added : " We are scared that as supplies are running low the mood might change . "
The rains have also ruined crops and caused damage in Cuzco and at the nearby Inca fortress of Sacsayhuamán , part of which has collapsed .
Claire Southern , from the travel company Responsible Travel , who has experience as a guide in the region , said : " It is not entirely unusual for the line to be cut , but the rains have been particularly heavy this year .
There have been relentless downpours .
If the line is cut , only helicopters can land .
There are no cashpoints so some people may find themselves relying on the goodwill of local people . "
Machu Picchu , the lost city of the Incas , is thought to have been built in the 15th century and was hidden for many years until being found by the American explorer Hiram Bingham in 1911 .
In many states across the US , it 's getting easier to carry a gun – and many say it 's the result of a campaign by the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) .
A nationwide review by Associated Press found that , over the past two years , 24 states , mostly in the south and west , have passed 47 new laws that relax gun restrictions .
Among other things , legislatures have allowed firearms to be carried in cars , made it illegal to ask job candidates whether they own a gun , and expanded agreements that make permits to carry handguns in one state valid in another .
The NRA , the leading gun- owners lobby in the US , has blocked attempts by Washington to tighten firearms laws for years , but has been increasing its efforts at the state level to chip away at gun restrictions .

" This is all a co-ordinated approach to respect that human , God - given right of self - defence by law - abiding Americans , " says Chris W Cox , the NRA 's chief lobbyist .
" We 'll rest when all 50 states allow and respect the right of law - abiding people to defend themselves from criminal attack . "
Tennessee and Montana , for example , have passed laws that exempt weapons made and owned in - state from federal restrictions .
Tennessee is the home of Barrett Firearms Manufacturing , the maker of a .50 - calibre shoulder - fired rifle which the company says can shoot bullets up to five miles ( eight kilometres ) .
The rifle is banned in California .
There have been gun-friendly law changes in other states .
Arizona , Florida , Louisiana and Utah have made it illegal for businesses to bar their employees from storing guns in cars parked on company lots .
Some states have made handgun permit information confidential , and others have allowed handgun permits to be issued to people who have had their criminal convictions expunged or their full civil rights restored .
Associated Press compiled the data on new laws from a range of groups , including the Legal Community Against Violence , which advocates gun control , and the NRA .
Public attitudes toward gun control have shifted strongly over the past 50 years , according to Gallup polling .
In 1959 , 60 per cent of respondents said they favoured a ban on handguns except for " police and other authorised persons " .
Gallup 's most recent annual crime survey in October found 71 per cent opposed such a ban .
The NRA boasts that almost all states grant handgun permits to people with clean criminal and psychological records .
In 1987 , just 10 states did .
Only Wisconsin , Illinois and Washington DC now prohibit carrying concealed handguns entirely .
" The NRA has a stranglehold on a lot of state legislatures , " said Kristin Rand , legislative director of the Violence Policy Centre , a gun-control group in Washington .
" Basically , they have convinced lawmakers they can cost them their seats , even though there 's no real evidence to back that up . "
Tennessee 's new laws came after the Republican takeover of the General Assembly this year , but most other states that loosened restrictions did n't experience major partisan shifts .
Most of the states where the new laws were enacted have large rural populations , where support for gun rights tends to cross party lines .
While some states have tightened gun laws during the same period , the list of new restrictive laws is much shorter .
In 2009 alone , more than three times as many laws were passed to make it easier on gun owners .
New Jersey 's 2009 law limiting people to one handgun purchase per month is the most notable of the more restrictive laws .
Other examples this year include Maryland 's ban on concealed weapons on public transport and Maine 's vote to give public universities and colleges the power to regulate firearms on campus .
The most contentious of Tennessee 's new gun laws was one allowing handguns in bars and restaurants that serve alcohol .
It took effect in July after lawmakers overrode a veto by the governor .
Last month , a Nashville judge struck down the law as unconstitutionally vague , but supporters have vowed to pass it again .
A similar Arizona law which took effect in September allows people with concealed - weapons permits to bring their guns into bars and restaurants that have n't posted signs banning the practice .
While Tennessee 's law was in place , many bars chose not to let customers bring guns in .
Likewise , more than 70 communities have opted out of allowing guns in parks .
" People go in there and start drinking , and then they want to start a fight .
What are they going to do if they got a gun in their hand ? " said Larry Speck , 69 , who works at an auto repair shop in Memphis .
" I 've got a gun permit and I 'm not carrying mine in there , even if they have a law . "
Academics are divided on the effects of liberalised handgun laws , and determining the impact is complicated by the move in several states to close handgun permit records .
A Violence Policy Centre project that surveyed news reports found that more than 100 people have been killed by holders of handgun - carry permits since 2007 , including nine law enforcement officers .
The project originally intended to list all gun crimes by permit holders , but there were too many to keep track of , said Kristin Rand .
" They shoot each other over parking spaces , at football games and at family events , " Ms Rand said .
" The idea that you 're making any place safer by injecting more guns is just completely contradicted by the facts . "
While Ireland has made a lot of progress in terms of broadband availability and uptake in the past few years , it is still behind EU competitor countries in both its NGN rollout and number of broadband subscribers , says a report published today by Forfás .
The report stated “ Ireland is lagging at least three to five years behind competitor countries in terms of rolling out infrastructure capable of high - speed next - generation broadband , ” with only only 0.6 pc of total broadband connections in the form of fibre connections .
In contrast , 11.3 pc of subscribers in OECD - 28 countries currently access the internet over fibre connections , with 21 pc in Sweden , 46 pc in South Korea and 51 pc in Japan .
How many broadband connections
The report found that broadband connections now account for 90pc of internet connections in comparison to 58 pc just over three years ago from Q1 of 2007 but the number of broadband subscribers per 100 inhabitants is 21.4 in comparison to the OECD average of 22.4 and the 37 per 100 and 38.1 per 100 of Denmark and the Netherlands respectively .
In terms of business broadband offerings , the speed , cost and choice of providers has improved in the past few years but the highest business speed of 24 M bps is only available in parts of the main cities while 12 M bps is more readily available .
“ Businesses in many other countries can also procure significantly faster services for the prices charged in Ireland , particularly those subscribing to the 12 M bps service , ” stated the report .
The report went on to say that “ in terms of residential connections , Ireland compares very poorly with leading countries in terms of the fastest speed broadly available ” .
Fastest residential speed
The fastest residential connection in Ireland is 20.48 Mbps at a cost of € 423 per annum ( ex VAT ) , available to 35 pc of Irish households , while the EU - 15 average is a connection speed of 50.8 M bps at an annual cost of €430 .
Forfas reports that in South Korea , France , Sweden , Finland and the Netherlands some residential customers can avail of speeds of more than 100 Mbps .
In fact , in Ireland only 5 pc of broadband connections are above 10 M bps in stark contrast to Portugal ’s 47 pc , Belgium ’s 45 pc and Sweden ’s 34.5 pc .

Dec. 27 , 2009  --
You may not be Christian , or religious , but if you live in almost any developed country , you will find it hard to get away from Christmas rituals at this time of year .
Of course , many of them are secular : where would the holidays be without rampant consumerism , drunken partying , over - indulgence and family feuds ?
Then there are the rituals whose religious origins have all but faded , such as Santa Claus .
But while Christmas rituals can be exciting for children , they certainly do n't have any of the high drama of those practiced by other faiths .
Take the Australian Aboriginal religious initiation rites that includes scalp biting , fingernail extraction and cutting the initiate 's penis with a stone knife , without which a man is not considered spiritually mature .
Or the extremes of the sacred fire dances performed in New Guinea , where in order to commune with their ancestors men enter a trance state wearing masks decorated with blood drawn agonisingly from their own tongues .
By contrast , the most extreme ritual a Christian is likely to engage in is being dunked during baptism .
Why do some religions have rituals that are so much more traumatic than others ?
This question has been exercising University of Oxford anthropologist Harvey Whitehouse for over two decades .
He is not the first to note that religions tend to fall into two distinct types -- those based on extensive teachings , such as Christianity and Islam , and those based on iconography and personal interpretations , including most small - scale religions and cults .
Whitehouse 's particular take , though , is to suggest that rituals themselves generate this dichotomy .
In recent years , several researchers have developed the idea that religion taps into intuitive ways of thinking .
Even as young children we seem predisposed to believe in the supernatural , which probably explains why we develop beliefs in spirits , an afterlife and gods as we get older .
This appears to explain many of the shared characteristics of religions across the globe .
But it cannot be the whole story , says Whitehouse , because it also describes beliefs in non-religious supernatural beings , such as the tooth fairy and Father Christmas .
So what distinguishes the fairies from the gods ?
Whitehouse points out that even when religions are founded on intuitive ideas , acquiring religious knowledge often comes at a cost , and it is this difficult - to - acquire knowledge that is most highly valued .
Indeed , it is the complex concepts that are hard to acquire and understand that give any religion its unique identity .
This , he believes , is what distinguishes religions from other beliefs , such as superstition .
And this is where the rituals come in , he argues .
It helps the religious grasp the hard ideas underlying the religion .
It is not clear whether willingness to indulge in ritual is an inherited trait .
Whitehouse suspects it is , and is planning studies with children to find out .
Clearly , though , ritual is not the exclusive preserve of religion .
Obsessive hand - washing , drinking tea in a certain way and crossing oneself with holy water all have one thing in common : " Rituals are by their very nature puzzling activities that invite interpretation , " says Whitehouse .
Rituals also have an emotional aspect - ranging from a comforting feeling of security or togetherness to extreme terror .
And rituals can be repetitive - although the frequency of repetition varies enormously .
These three traits are what make religion and ritual such good bedfellows .
They provide the all - important elements that allow a religion to flourish : meaning , motivation and memory .
A complex web of interactions link rituals to religion , but for Whitehouse , any attempt to tease out a thread must start with memory .
" The reason why there are only two types of religion is that there are only two basic systems of memory that matter , " he argues .
The first is semantic memory , which deals with things we are conscious of remembering and stores what we have learned about the world .
Then there is episodic memory , which hangs onto memorable events from our own lives .
Whitehouse argues that to persist and spread , a religion must elicit the help of rituals that reinforce memories in both these systems .
Consider some of the most extreme rituals .
According to Whitehouse , they are all classic examples of rituals that invoke episodic memory -- creating personally significant events that are imprinted into the initiate 's mind .
They are characteristically infrequent , often once - in - a - lifetime experiences , and all are highly traumatic .
Being personally consequential and shocking , they are likely to evoke intensely vivid memories , known as " flashbulb memory " of the kind experienced by people with post - traumatic stress disorder .
They also leave participants struggling to make sense of the experience , and so constructing elaborate personal meanings for what has happened .
Such low - frequency , high - arousal rituals are the lifeblood of " imagistic " religions -- cults and other religions based on iconography , analogy and intense cohesion .
The second type of ritual is exemplified by Muslim prayer , called salat .
Muslims pray at least five times a day , following a highly prescribed routine that includes facing Mecca , bowing to Allah and reciting extracts of the Koran .
Like Catholic mass and the Jewish Sabbath observance , salat is a high - frequency , low - arousal ritual - the sort characteristic of doctrinal religions .
Repetition fixes the information in semantic memory so that believers acquire a deep knowledge of their particular religion 's liturgy , no matter how complex or counterintuitive .
This way of doing things has advantages over the imagistic mode in that it keeps the ideas at the core of a particular religion cohesive and stable .
As a result , doctrinal religions spread easily - so all the world 's major religions fit this pattern .
By contrast , imagistic religions , with their more creative , fluid and idiosyncratic rituals , tend to be small - scale and localized .
So how come doctrinal religions have n't overrun imagistic ones ?
Religions driven by frequent , unexciting rituals face their own problems , Whitehouse says .
The most crushing of these is what he has dubbed the " tedium effect " .
An obvious solution would be to make the rituals more emotional , but he says this risks inspiring participants to generate personal interpretations and so fracturing the religion .
They would undermine the doctrinal orthodoxy that is crucial for these sorts of religions to flourish .
One strategy is to employ charismatic preachers to offset the tedium and use more committed members of the religion to police it and keep the flock in check , which might explain the hierarchical nature of organized religion .
Whitehouse 's theory is compelling because it integrates many aspects of religion , from the psychological to the socio-political , but how reliable is it ?
One advantage is that it makes testable predictions .
For example , religious rituals are unlikely to be both low frequency and low arousal - because such rituals would not be easily remembered - or high frequency , high arousal - because most people will not willingly undergo too much torment even in the name of religion .
It also predicts that doctrinal religions will tend not to have low - frequency , high - arousal rituals because they undermine orthodoxy , and imagistic religions will tend not to have high - frequency , low - arousal rituals because these undermine exclusivity .
Whitehouse and his colleagues are currently compiling the world 's largest database of religious rituals to test such predictions .
It is part of an ongoing project , EXREL ( Explaining Religion ) , but preliminary indications suggest that religious rituals do indeed cluster around two forms that associate respectively with the two types of religion .
He describes the observed pattern as " bunching with some outliers " , and points out that you would expect the occasional anomaly because there is nothing stopping the emergence of an exciting , high - frequency ritual or a boring , low - frequency one .
However , he expects to find that such rituals are a flash in the pan because they do n't have what it takes to glue together compelling religion .
Not everyone is convinced by Whitehouse 's argument .
Robin Dunbar , also at the University of Oxford , says it fails to address the key question of why we have religion at all .
He believes religion evolved as a survival mechanism and that the main purpose of rituals is social cohesion , which is at the core of our success as a species .
And Whitehouse 's theory does n't explain why even within major religions there are pockets of extreme behaviour , such as the self - flagellation rituals practiced by some Shia muslims during the holy day of Ashura , the practice of anaesthetic - free infant circumcision in conservative Jewish circles , or the re-enactments of crucifixion by some Christians in the Phillipines .
Christmas itself is probably a little too racy to fit neatly into Whitehouse 's theory .
But Whitehouse has an explanation .
Feel - good , annual events tend to be a feature of doctrinal religions , he says .
Happy or euphoric experiences are not remembered in the way traumatic ones are , so you can have the occasional knees - up to boost motivation without undermining doctrine .
" You just need to find the sweet spot , " he says .
Which at this time of year is probably good advice for anyone of any religious persuasion , or indeed none at all .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Corporations can spend freely to support or oppose candidates for president and Congress , the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday , a landmark decision denounced by President Barack Obama for giving special interests more power .
Supreme Court Justices gather for an official picture at the Supreme Court , September 29 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jim Young
“ The Supreme Court has given a green light to a new stampede of special interest money in our politics , ” Obama said after the 5 - 4 ruling that divided the nation ’s high court along conservative and liberal lines .
“ It is a major victory for big oil , Wall Street banks , health insurance companies and the other powerful interests that marshal their power every day in Washington to drown out the voices of everyday Americans , ” Obama said .
Obama said he instructed administration officials “ to get to work immediately with Congress on this issue ” and “ talk with bipartisan congressional leaders to develop a forceful response to this decision . ”
The ruling , a defeat for Obama and supporters of campaign finance limits , is expected to unleash a flood of money to be spent in this year ’s congressional election and the 2012 presidential contest .
Writing for the majority , Justice Anthony Kennedy said the long - standing campaign finance limits violated constitutional free - speech rights of corporations .
“ The government may regulate corporate political speech through disclaimer and disclosure requirements , but it may not suppress that speech altogether , ” he wrote .
The four liberal dissenters said allowing corporate money to flood the political marketplace will corrupt democracy .
RULING COULD UNDERMINE INTEGRITY -DISSENT
In his sharply worded dissent , Justice John Paul Stevens wrote , “ The court ’s ruling threatens to undermine the integrity of elected institutions across the nation . ”
The justices overturned Supreme Court precedents from 2003 and 1990 that upheld federal and state limits on independent expenditures by corporate treasuries to support or oppose candidates .
In the 2008 election cycle , nearly $ 6 billion was spent on all federal campaigns , including more than $ 1 billion from corporate political action committees , trade associations , executives and lobbyists .
The ruling will almost certainly allow labor unions to spend more freely in political campaigns also and it posed a threat to similar limits that had been imposed in about half of the country ’s 50 states .
The top court struck down the part of the federal law that restricted broadcast advertisements for or against political candidates right before elections that are paid for by corporations , labor unions and advocacy groups .
The 2002 campaign finance law at issue was named after Senator John McCain , the unsuccessful Republican presidential nominee in 2008 , and Democratic Senator Russell Feingold .
Republican Party Chairman Michael Steele praised the ruling and said , “ Free speech strengths our democracy . ”
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell , long an opponent of the law , said , “ For too long , some in this country have been deprived of full participation in the political process . ”
But the law ’s supporters said the ruling will allow corporations to spend unlimited sums to influence elections .
“ The bottom line is , the Supreme Court has just predetermined the winners of next November ’s election .
It wo n’t be the Republican or the Democrats and it wo n’t be the American people ; it will be corporate America , ” Senator Charles Schumer , a Democrat from New York , said .
The decision was a victory for a conservative advocacy group ’s challenge to the campaign finance law as part of its efforts to broadcast and promote a 2008 movie critical of then - presidential candidate Hillary Clinton .
She later became Obama ’s secretary of state .
The Obama administration defended the law ’s restrictions on election - related spending by corporations , unions and interest groups .
The court ’s conservative majority , with the addition of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito , both appointees of then - President George W. Bush , in the ruling made a dramatic change in the campaign finance law designed to regulate the role of money in politics and prevent corruption .
You would think that with all the new competition in the smartphone market , that the long - in - the - tooth Motorola Droid would start slowing down in sales , well you ’d be wrong .
Despite the popularity of rival HTC’s Incredible , demand for the Droid at Verizon Wireless stores is still strong , said co-Chief Exec Sanjay Jha .
Demand is so strong in fact , that the only thing limiting sales is the availability of the Droid itself .
Jha informed reporters that they have been suffering from supply chain constraints .
“ Sales are going extremely well .
If I could build more , I ’d sell more . ”
I wonder if the extremely large modding community for the Droid has anything to do with this ?
The final tidbit of information said by Jha was that this year ’s phone line - up would include two to four phones with front - facing cameras that could be used for video conferencing .
It looks like Motorola is playing a little catchup with the iPhone and HTC EVO .
At least with the Android - based Motorola phones , you wo n’t be restriced to wifi . ;)

The web is turning writing into a conversation .
Twenty years ago , writers wrote and readers read .
The web lets readers respond , and increasingly they do — in comment threads , on forums , and in their own blog posts .
Many who respond to something disagree with it .
That 's to be expected .
Agreeing tends to motivate people less than disagreeing .
And when you agree there 's less to say .
You could expand on something the author said , but he has probably already explored the most interesting implications .
When you disagree you 're entering territory he may not have explored .
The result is there 's a lot more disagreeing going on , especially measured by the word .
That does n't mean people are getting angrier .
The structural change in the way we communicate is enough to account for it .
But though it 's not anger that 's driving the increase in disagreement , there 's a danger that the increase in disagreement will make people angrier .
Particularly online , where it 's easy to say things you 'd never say face to face .
If we 're all going to be disagreeing more , we should be careful to do it well .
What does it mean to disagree well ?
Most readers can tell the difference between mere name - calling and a carefully reasoned refutation , but I think it would help to put names on the intermediate stages .
So here 's an attempt at a disagreement hierarchy :
DH0 .
Name - calling .
This is the lowest form of disagreement , and probably also the most common .
We 've all seen comments like this : u r a fag !!!!!!!!!!
But it 's important to realize that more articulate name - calling has just as little weight .
A comment like
The author is a self - important dilettante .
is really nothing more than a pretentious version of " u r a fag . "
DH1 . Ad Hominem .
An ad hominem attack is not quite as weak as mere name - calling .
It might actually carry some weight .
For example , if a senator wrote an article saying senators ' salaries should be increased , one could respond :
Of course he would say that .
He 's a senator .
This would n't refute the author 's argument , but it may at least be relevant to the case .
It 's still a very weak form of disagreement , though .
If there 's something wrong with the senator 's argument , you should say what it is ; and if there is n't , what difference does it make that he 's a senator ?
Saying that an author lacks the authority to write about a topic is a variant of ad hominem — and a particularly useless sort , because good ideas often come from outsiders .
The question is whether the author is correct or not .
If his lack of authority caused him to make mistakes , point those out .
And if it did n't , it 's not a problem .
DH2 . Responding to Tone .
The next level up we start to see responses to the writing , rather than the writer .
The lowest form of these is to disagree with the author 's tone .
E.g. I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such a cavalier fashion .
Though better than attacking the author , this is still a weak form of disagreement .
It matters much more whether the author is wrong or right than what his tone is .
Especially since tone is so hard to judge .
Someone who has a chip on their shoulder about some topic might be offended by a tone that to other readers seemed neutral .
So if the worst thing you can say about something is to criticize its tone , you 're not saying much .
Is the author flippant , but correct ?
Better that than grave and wrong .
And if the author is incorrect somewhere , say where .
DH3 . Contradiction .
In this stage we finally get responses to what was said , rather than how or by whom .
The lowest form of response to an argument is simply to state the opposing case , with little or no supporting evidence .
This is often combined with DH2 statements , as in : I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such a cavalier fashion .
Intelligent design is a legitimate scientific theory .
Contradiction can sometimes have some weight .
Sometimes merely seeing the opposing case stated explicitly is enough to see that it 's right .
But usually evidence will help .
DH4 . Counterargument .
At level 4 we reach the first form of convincing disagreement : counterargument .
Forms up to this point can usually be ignored as proving nothing .
Counterargument might prove something .
The problem is , it 's hard to say exactly what .
Counterargument is contradiction plus reasoning and / or evidence .
When aimed squarely at the original argument , it can be convincing .
But unfortunately it 's common for counterarguments to be aimed at something slightly different .
More often than not , two people arguing passionately about something are actually arguing about two different things .
Sometimes they even agree with one another , but are so caught up in their squabble they do n't realize it .
There could be a legitimate reason for arguing against something slightly different from what the original author said : when you feel they missed the heart of the matter .
But when you do that , you should say explicitly you 're doing it .
DH5 . Refutation .
The most convincing form of disagreement is refutation .
It 's also the rarest , because it 's the most work .
Indeed , the disagreement hierarchy forms a kind of pyramid , in the sense that the higher you go the fewer instances you find .
To refute someone you probably have to quote them .
You have to find a " smoking gun , " a passage in whatever you disagree with that you feel is mistaken , and then explain why it 's mistaken .
If you can't find an actual quote to disagree with , you may be arguing with a straw man .
While refutation generally entails quoting , quoting does n't necessarily imply refutation .
Some writers quote parts of things they disagree with to give the appearance of legitimate refutation , then follow with a response as low as DH3 or even DH0 .
DH6 .
Refuting the Central Point .
The force of a refutation depends on what you refute .
The most powerful form of disagreement is to refute someone 's central point .
Even as high as DH5 we still sometimes see deliberate dishonesty , as when someone picks out minor points of an argument and refutes those .
Sometimes the spirit in which this is done makes it more of a sophisticated form of ad hominem than actual refutation .
For example , correcting someone 's grammar , or harping on minor mistakes in names or numbers .
Unless the opposing argument actually depends on such things , the only purpose of correcting them is to discredit one 's opponent .
Truly refuting something requires one to refute its central point , or at least one of them .
And that means one has to commit explicitly to what the central point is .
So a truly effective refutation would look like :
The author 's main point seems to be x .
As he says : < quotation >
But this is wrong for the following reasons ...
The quotation you point out as mistaken need not be the actual statement of the author 's main point .
It 's enough to refute something it depends upon .
What It Means
Now we have a way of classifying forms of disagreement .
What good is it ?
One thing the disagreement hierarchy does n't give us is a way of picking a winner .
DH levels merely describe the form of a statement , not whether it 's correct .
A DH6 response could still be completely mistaken .
But while DH levels do n't set a lower bound on the convincingness of a reply , they do set an upper bound .
A DH6 response might be unconvincing , but a DH2 or lower response is always unconvincing .
The most obvious advantage of classifying the forms of disagreement is that it will help people to evaluate what they read .
In particular , it will help them to see through intellectually dishonest arguments .
An eloquent speaker or writer can give the impression of vanquishing an opponent merely by using forceful words .
In fact that is probably the defining quality of a demagogue .
By giving names to the different forms of disagreement , we give critical readers a pin for popping such balloons .
Such labels may help writers too .
Most intellectual dishonesty is unintentional .
Someone arguing against the tone of something he disagrees with may believe he 's really saying something .
Zooming out and seeing his current position on the disagreement hierarchy may inspire him to try moving up to counterargument or refutation .
But the greatest benefit of disagreeing well is not just that it will make conversations better , but that it will make the people who have them happier .
If you study conversations , you find there is a lot more meanness down in DH1 than up in DH6 .
You do n't have to be mean when you have a real point to make .
In fact , you do n't want to .
If you have something real to say , being mean just gets in the way .
If moving up the disagreement hierarchy makes people less mean , that will make most of them happier .
Most people do n't really enjoy being mean ; they do it because they can't help it .

The durability of the Mars rovers has been nothing short of staggering .
Kids who were n't even born when they were launched have now started Kindergarten .
When they landed in 2004 , Ars did n't even have a dedicated science section — and would n't for over another year .
NASA 's cautious estimate was that the rovers would be able to travel a kilometer ; they 're now so confident , that they 've started Opportunity on trip that will take several years and cover nearly 20 km .
Still , all good things must come to an end , and Opportunity 's twin , the Spirit rover , has now reached the end of its traveling .
Spirit has been operating with only five of its six wheels for years , but about ten months ago , the remaining wheels wound up stuck in some soft , sandy material ; another wheel died recently .
After several attempts to free it , NASA has now decided that it 's best to simply orient it to soak up as much sun as it can during the Martian winter .
The cold and reduced sunlight mean that it 'll be much harder to keep Spirit active over the winter , which may send it into a hibernation mode for many months .
Winter temperatures will be close to the design limits of the rover 's electronics , so there 's a chance it wo n't revive when spring returns to its hemisphere on Mars .
Assuming the rover survives , NASA plans on using it for two experiments : long - term monitoring of changes in nearby soils , with the possibility of detecting some sort of water cycle , and providing fine - grained positional information that will allow researchers to detect wobbles in Mars ' rotation , which can be used to infer details of the planet 's interior .
Neither of these was possible when six functional wheels gave its handlers " the imperative to drive it , " as one of the team leaders put it .
That imperative is still very much in effect when it comes to Opportunity , which is on its way to the Endeavor crater , about 19 km away from the previous crater that it had explored .
On its way , it seems to have found an unusual rock , which is going by the name of " Marquette Island . "
This rock appears to be a basalt , formed by the slow cooling of molten rock within the crust and then blasted to its current location by an impact .
It 's the first of its sort to have been observed , and researchers are excited about the data obtained after Opportunity drilled into its interior .

The last surviving US veteran of World War I has urged members of Congress to rededicate a Washington monument to the memory of his fellow combatants .
Frank Buckles , 108 , said the US capital needed a symbol to honour all those who fought in the Great War .
A bill , named after Mr Buckles , proposes to rededicate an existing memorial on the National Mall in honour of all Americans who fought in WWI .
More than 100,000 Americans lost their lives during the campaign .
Mr Buckles , who travelled to Capitol Hill from his home in West Virginia , told a panel of senators it was " an excellent idea " .
The official title of the bill is the Frank Buckles World War I Memorial Act .
It aims to rededicate the District of Columbia War Memorial which currently only commemorates the citizens of the District of Columbia who served in WWI .
Alternative plans
However , the bill has its opponents .
Some Washington politicians object to a national takeover of a local monument .
And in Missouri , campaigners want to designate a memorial in Kansas City as the National World War I Memorial .
The 217ft ( 66 m ) monument was dedicated in 1921 by Gen John Pershing and four Allied military leaders .
Mr Buckles joined the US Army at the age of 16 - two years younger than the legal limit - and drove ambulances on the Western Front .
In World War II , he worked for a US shipping company in the Philippines and was captured by the Japanese , spending three years in a prison camp .
His daughter , Susannah Buckles Flanagan , said that although her father uses a wheelchair and has difficulty hearing , he still enjoys reading and daily exercise .
Remember all those SF movies where it takes suspended animation to travel to a distant planet or galaxy ?
Ripley , the buff female protagonist in the film Aliens , spends 57 years in “ hypersleep ” — without aging — before being rescued .
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) is now funding research that may one day bring humans to a zombie - like form of hibernation .
The motivation , however , is not so much space travel as emergency trauma care for wounded soldiers on the battlefield .
Actual hibernation occurs when an animal such as a squirrel goes into a state of suspended animation : heart rate , metabolism and body temperatures drop significantly .
When a mammal is in hibernation , its body temperature is usually only 2 - 4 º C above freezing ( as opposed to perhaps 38 º C ) , oxygen consumption is 2 % of normal rates , and heart rate decreases by a factor of one hundred .
DARPA is committing $ 9.9 million to the Texas A&M Institute for Preclinical Studies ( TIPS ) to research how hydrogen sulfide can block the body ’s ability to use oxygen and induce a state of suspended animation .
Because they have a cardiovascular system similar to humans , TIPS researchers Theresa Fossum and Matthew Miller think they can accurately predict human results from trials with anesthetized pigs .
Using swine , the researchers are testing various compounds — some containing hydrogen sulfide — to find one that can safely keep the hemorrhaging animals “ as close to death as possible . ”
Here ’s a video on the TIPS research :
As reported by Popular Science , nearly half of soldiers killed in action die of severe blood loss after being wounded by gunshots or IEDs .
When emergency trauma care is administered during that first “ golden hour , ” soldiers ’ odds of survival are relatively good , but after that their odds begin to drop quickly .
That ’s why TIPS researchers are looking for a way to send the human body into a state of suspended animation , essentially “ shutting down ” the heart and brain until proper care can be administered .
To understand the mechanics of hibernation , researchers have turned to squirrels .
During the winter months , squirrels go through an amazing metamorphosis : their 300 beat - per - minute heart rate slows to a mere two to ten beats , their oxygen consumption drops to one - fiftieth of normal , and their body temperatures fall essentially to zero .
And yet they emerge from hibernation no worse for wear .
One Stanford University project ( also funded by DARPA ) tried using a pancreatic enzyme found in both species to put humans into a state of squirrel - like hibernation , and another used hydrogen sulfide to stop wounds from bleeding by stopping heart function in rats and worms .
Stanford ’s Craig Heller discovered how squirrels and other hibernators manage to regulate their core body temperatures , even as they become zombie - like .
Those trials lead to an examination of the human temperature - control system , which led to a specialized glove - like device , built for the military .
Cheng Chi Lee , an associate professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston , discovered that the 5 - prime adenosine monophosphate ( 5 ’ - AMP ) molecule can induce a short hibernation - like state in mammals ( such as humans ) that do n’t normally hibernate .
He ’s now trying to find ways to maintain that state long enough to perform major , live - saving surgeries .
Turning pigs into “ zombies ” could mean the difference between life and death for wounded soldiers on the battlefield .
According to the Cybercast News Service , when an animal hibernates , its cells are deprived of the oxygen it receives during its waking hours .
The cells can better endure this low - oxygen state when the animal reaches a state of hypothermia and its metabolism slows .
Similarly , a heart attack or stroke starves organs of oxygen .
According to Dr. Lee , physicians have long been using cooling procedures to help human cells survive these conditions .
“ If you follow the ambulance services now in response to heart attack — the first response when you reach a heart attack patient is to bring the body temperature down as quickly as possible while the patient is being transported to the hospital , ” says Lee .
“ If you cool the body temperature down , then you expand the window of preventing ischemia [ oxygen - shortage ] damage .
It ’s really simple , because if the cell is cooled , it needs less oxygen . ”
Lee said the same principle applies to organ transplants .
When the organ donor and recipient live in different parts of the country , the organ is preserved in an ice cooler or other refrigeration system during transport .
More recently , a US - Chinese team of researchers has identified differences in expression levels between proteins and messenger RNA ( mRNA ) between hibernating and non-hibernating arctic squirrels , suggesting “ substantial post - transcriptional regulation of proteins during torpor - arousal cycles of hibernation . ”
The study , published in a recent issue of the ProteoMonitor , asserts that hibernation “ involves complex mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming and tissue protection . ”
Previous studies looked primarily into changes at the mRNA level .
The newly published study identifies “ significant differences ” in mRNA levels in hibernating and non-hibernating ground squirrels — the transcripts of mRNA “ are protected while translation is inhibited during torpor .
Therefore protein variety and abundance can be very different from corresponding gene expression at the mRNA level , and differential protein expression may more directly reflect regulatory changes related to hibernation . ”
A form of squirrel - like hypersleep - hibernation would help solve a great many of the problems involved in sending humans interstellar distances .
And metabolic and genetic research is zeroing in on what makes squirrels tick .
But more immediately , turning pigs into “ zombies ” could mean the difference between life and death for wounded soldiers on the battlefield .
Every family has a different holiday tradition .
Some of these traditions are based on religion , ethnicity , or heritage .
For instance , many Italian - American families eat cioppino on Christmas eve as part of the Feast of Seven Fishes .
Other traditions just crystallize over the years ; my family 's Christmas morning always began with the intoxicating aroma of bacon .
The other components of Christmas breakfast varied : sometimes eggs , sometimes pancakes , but always bacon .
It 's just me and my boyfriend on Christmas this year , and breakfast is my responsibility .
I 'm vegan , he 's not , and finding a compromise can be tough .
He would very much like to continue my family 's bacon legacy , but I 'm not too keen on that idea .
A scrambled tofu burrito is right up my alley , but that would put him in a soy - coma .
Cinnamon rolls are a tradition for many families , and their ooey , gooey , cinnamon - sugar , carb - overload goodness appeals to both of us .
Of course , vegans can't just pick up a box of Cinnabon or plop a can of Pillsbury onto a baking sheet .
I could veganize a typical cinnamon roll recipe , but Christmas morning is not the time to take risks .
So , I 've scoured the blogs to find a suitable alternative .
Below are a number that all look delicious , yet differ by preparation time and ingredients .
Hopefully one will suit your tastes .

What do the mid-recession housing boom and the Harper Conservatives ' rise in the polls have in common ?
Answer : the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 's massive sub - prime mortgage scheme that is keeping up the appearance of an economic recovery .
Reading the newspapers these days , you have to wonder whether Canada was on another planet when the global credit crisis hit .
House prices have actually increased in some provinces and now there is a shortage of houses for sale in southern Ontario .
Credit is flowing everywhere .

Tyee Reporter Katie Hyslop Celebrates 10 - Year Tyeeversary
She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
But what few Canadians realize is that the housing market has avoided collapse ( prices are down 32 per cent in the U.S. ) because the Harper Conservatives directed the CMHC to change the mortgage rules to effectively make the Canadian government the biggest sub - prime lender in the world .
What 's almost as alarming as this reckless policy is that no one in the financial media is talking about it , even though everyone knows the facts .
I was alerted to the scandal by David Lepoidevin , a financial advisor with National Bank Financial , in a warning letter to his clients .
The facts are that over 90 per cent of existing mortgages in Canada are " securitized . "
That is the practice of pooling mortgages ( or other assets ) and then issuing new securities backed by the pool -- MBSs , or Mortgage Backed Securities .
That 's what happened with the sub - prime mortgages in the U.S. which ( because the whole pool was so diversified ) received triple - A ratings by the rating agencies .
Losses around the world amounted to hundred of billions of dollars
Credit is still tight in the U.S. because no private investor has the stomach for such risky MBSs .
That 's because those losses were private and not back - stopped by any government .
In Canada , mortgages have been securitized for years .
The Canadian - issued securitizations are called National Housing Act , Mortgage - Backed Securities .
Unlike the failed U.S. pools , says Lepoidevin , " In order to find buyers for securitized mortgage pools , the Government of Canada has put guarantees on them " by directing CMHC to guarantee all Canadian mortgages .
Propping up the real estate market
So long as borrowing requirements were tight , the percentage of loans that were securitized remained modest .
But in 2007 the Harper government allowed the CMHC to dramatically change its rules : it dropped the down payment requirement to zero per cent and extended the amortization period to 40 years .
In light of the mortgage meltdown in the U.S. , Finance Minister Flaherty moderated those rules in August 2008 ( it 's now five per cent down and 35 years ) .
But these are still relatively very loose requirements and securitization has taken off .
By the end of 2007 there were $ 138 billion in NHA securitized pools outstanding and guaranteed by CMHC --17.8 per cent of all outstanding mortgages .
By June 30 , 2009 , that figure was $ 290 billion , a figure Lepoidevin says , " exceeds the total value of mortgages offered by CMHC in its 57 years of existence ! "
CMHC 's stated goal was to guarantee $ 340 billion by the end of this year and is on track to reach $ 500 billion by the end of 2010 .
Total mortgage credit in Canada will grow by 12 - 14 per cent of GDP in 2009 .
In an effort to prop up the real estate market in 2008 ( when affordability nosedived ) , the Harper government directed the CMHC to approve as many high - risk borrowers as possible and to keep credit flowing .
CMHC described these risky loans as " high ratio homeowner units approved to address less - served markets and / or to serve specific government priorities . "
The approval rate for these risky loans went from 33 per cent in 2007 to 42 per cent in 2008 .
By mid-2007 , average equity as a share of home value was down to six per cent -- from 48 per cent in 2003 .
At the peak of the U.S. housing bubble , just before it burst , house prices were five times the average American income ; in Canada today that ratio is 7.4:1 -- almost 50 per cent higher .
Putting off the inevitable
This high - risk policy actually prevents the natural playing out of the recession -- that is , the purging of the excesses of the previous boom period .
CMHC 's easy - money resulted in a 9.3 per cent increase in Canadian household debt between June 2008 and June 2009 .
Even bank economists admit to being concerned about a housing bubble .
In a September research note , Scotiabank economists Derek Holt and Karen Cordes said , " lenders have been scrambling to get enough product to put into the federal government 's Insured Mortgage Purchase Program over the months , and that may have translated into excessively generous financing terms . "
Holt suggested that in two or three years -- or whenever the Bank of Canada increases interest rates -- many of these mortgages would be at risk .
The banks themselves have taken on virtually no new risk .
According to CMHC numbers in the two years from the beginning of 2007 to January 2009 , Canadian banks increased their total mortgage credit outstanding by only 0.01 per cent .
Fully 90.5 per cent of all growth in total Canadian mortgage credit outstanding since 2007 has been accounted for by Mortgage Backed Securities .
Of course , the banks have no interest in saying no if you have qualified for a securitized CMHC loan -- because they bear no risk if you default .
Murray Dobbin's Bloggin ' Now
The popular
Tyee columnist now publishes his own blog : murraydobbin.ca .
If that sounds like sub - prime mortgages , it should .
Sub - prime is any loan below prime .
If a bank refuses you a loan , and CMHC gives you one , the loan is sub-prime .
As Lepoidevin says in his warning letter , " Every single U.S. lender specializing in sub- prime has gone bankrupt .
The largest sub - prime lender in the world is now the Canadian government . "
Economic fiction
This is the ticking time bomb Prime Minister Stephen Harper has tossed at the Canadian taxpayer .
Why ?
So that he can maintain the fiction that he is a good economic manager and win a majority in the next election .
The problem is no opposition political party wants to expose the looming disaster and risk being responsible for a dramatic fall in house prices .
As Liberal finance critic John McCallum told The Globe and Mail : " I do n't think we want the government to be rationing Canadian home - buying . "
The price of political cowardice will be very high .
And in the end the housing bubble will burst anyway , putting taxpayers on the hook for tens of billions of dollars in defaulted mortgages .

DWIGHT EISENHOWER observed in his “ Atoms for Peace ” speech in 1953 that nuclear technology originally developed for military purposes could also be put to peaceful uses , namely generating electricity .
His speech led to the dissemination of nuclear technology for civilian purposes and the establishment of the first nuclear power stations .
Many of these early reactors , built during the cold war , made a virtue of the “ dual use ” nature of nuclear technology .
Designs were favoured that could create weapons - grade material as well as electricity .
Today those priorities have been reversed .
America and Russia are taking steps to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear weapons , and the international community is trying to prevent their acquisition by new states .
Under America's “ Megatons to Megawatts ” programme , weapons - grade material from retired warheads is being broken down to provide fuel for civilian nuclear power stations .
With 53 new reactors under construction around the world and dozens more planned , the main difficulties facing nuclear scientists now are to reduce the threat of proliferation , improve efficiency and do something about the growing stock of nuclear waste in indefinite temporary storage .
These new priorities favour new sorts of reactor .
Taking the lead in the development of the next generation of reactors is an international programme called the Generation IV International Forum ( GIF ) , a collaboration between the governments of America , Argentina , Brazil , Britain , Canada , China , France , Japan , Russia , South Africa , South Korea and Switzerland , plus Euratom , the EU 's nuclear body .
Established in 2001 , the GIF has drawn up a shortlist of six of the most promising designs , which range from updated versions of existing reactors to radically different approaches .
All nuclear reactors rely on nuclear fission , a process discovered in the 1930s .
When certain heavy atoms are struck by a neutron , they absorb it , become unstable and split apart .
This results in two lighter atoms , and two or three neutrons are ejected .
The process releases large amounts of energy , much of it in the form of the kinetic energy of the fast - moving fission products .
This energy is converted to heat as the fission products slow down .
If the ejected neutrons hit other atoms nearby , those too can break apart , releasing further neutrons in a chain reaction .
When enough neutrons produce further fissions — rather than escaping , bouncing off or being absorbed by atoms that do not split — the process becomes self - sustaining .
The technology underpinning civilian nuclear power - generation has not progressed much since the 1950s when a small number of prototype commercial reactors were first brought online .
Based on the military reactors developed for weapons programmes and naval propulsion , these “ generation I ” systems pioneered the pressurised water reactor ( PWR ) design , which is the basis for most of the “ generation II ” nuclear reactors now in operation .
In a PWR ordinary water , kept at a high pressure to prevent it from boiling , is used both to cool the reactor core and to “ moderate ” the nuclear reaction by reducing the speed of the neutrons in order to maximise their ability to cause further fissions .
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , of the 436 nuclear reactors in operation today , 356 are either PWRs or boiling - water reactors — a simplified version of the same design .
The vast majority of current reactors use a “ once through ” fuel cycle , in which each batch of fuel spends a single term in the reactor core , and the leftovers are then removed and placed in storage .
This spent fuel presents a storage problem , but it also offers an opportunity .
According to the World Nuclear Association , an industry body , the spent fuel recovered from a reactor still contains around 96 % of the original uranium , as well as plutonium that has been formed in the core .
If the nuclear renaissance takes off at the rate that many are predicting , this inefficient use of the uranium fuel is likely to prove unsustainable , says Bill Stacey , a professor of nuclear engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology .
The original series
In the near term most new reactors will continue to be PWRs .
A forthcoming crop of “ generation III ” and “ generation III + ” reactors build on the light - water design with new safety mechanisms .
Some can also run on mixed oxide ( MOx ) fuel , which is produced by reprocessing spent fuel to extract the plutonium and uranium and combining them to make a new fuel .
But although MOx is currently used in around one - third of French reactors , the idea of reprocessing is controversial and has yet to gain widespread international support .
Critics say it is uneconomic and increases the risk of proliferation .
The technology underpinning civilian nuclear power - generation has not progressed much since the 1950s
The six most promising “ generation IV ” designs identified by the GIF from an original list of over 100 concepts depart markedly from the light - water moderated , once - through models that dominate the existing fleet .
Even those reactors that draw upon aspects of current designs add some new twists .
Start with the supercritical water - cooled reactor ( SCWR ) .
Although it uses water as the coolant , like existing designs , the water is at a much higher temperature ( above 374{degree}C ) and pressure .
Under these conditions the water exists in a single , supercritical phase , rather than as liquid or steam .
This eliminates the need to transfer heat from the coolant water to steam ( via a secondary heat - exchanger ) to drive a steam turbine , as is the case with current PWRs .
Instead , supercritical water from the core drives a turbine directly .
Doing away with the need for separate pumps , pressurisers and steam generators results in higher thermal efficiency : 45 % rather than the 33 % of existing PWRs , according to Idaho National Laboratory .
The simplicity of the design should also make it cheaper .
The GIF estimates that an SCWR could be built at a cost of $ 900 per kilowatt of generating capacity — about a quarter of the expected cost of current generation III + reactors .
Some industry observers , however , are sceptical that these cost savings can be achieved .
Given that it builds on existing reactor designs , and also borrows from supercritical fossil - fuel boilers , which are also an established technology , the SCWR is likely to be one of the first generation - IV designs to be implemented .
The GIF is aiming to have a demonstration version ready by 2022 .
But several technical challenges remain .
In particular , says William Cook of the University of New Brunswick in Canada , “ current reactor materials that do not crack corrode excessively , while materials that do not corrode excessively crack . ”
New alloys will be needed that do not crack or corrode under stress .
The second design with roots in existing technology is the Very High Temperature Reactor ( VHTR ) .
It has a once - through uranium cycle , but instead of water it uses graphite as the moderator and helium gas as the coolant .
( Helium has the advantage that it is chemically inert and has only a limited tendency to become radioactive when exposed to neutrons . )
As its name suggests , the VHTR is designed to run at very high temperatures , heating the coolant to around 950 { degree}C , compared with 315 { degree}C for a standard PWR , making it more thermally efficient .
Like the SCWR , the VHTR will require the development of new materials .
Although the helium coolant presents fewer corrosion problems than supercritical water , creating core materials and fuel casings that can withstand the high temperatures involved is a daunting task .
Nevertheless , the VHTR has sufficiently impressed the Obama administration , which in September announced $ 40 m in funding for research and development of the Next Generation Nuclear Plant , a reactor based on the VHTR design .
Unlike the SCWR and the VHTR , which build on current reactors , the other four generation - IV designs take a completely different approach to the nuclear - fuel cycle .
Three of them are “ fast neutron ” reactors , which do not include a moderator to slow down free neutrons during the fission process .
With more free neutrons flying about , fast reactors can consume or “ burn up ” existing nuclear waste , a characteristic that endears them to waste - reduction advocates who see them as a means of “ closing ” the nuclear fuel cycle .
In keeping with the Janus - faced nature of nuclear technology , however , fast reactors can also be used to produce or “ breed ” new fissile material — converting uranium - 238 into the notoriously dual - purpose plutonium , for example .
Opponents of fast reactors worry about the costs and proliferation risks .
But the prospect of being able to extract useful energy from nuclear waste , and also reduce its volume and toxicity , give fast reactors obvious appeal .
The three shortlisted fast - reactor concepts — sodium - cooled , gas - cooled and lead - cooled — are differentiated primarily by their use of coolant .
Each has its own pros and cons .
The most successful of the three designs to date has been the sodium - cooled fast reactor ( SFR ) , which has racked up the highest number of reactor - years of operation in prototype form .
One of the merits of the SFR is that “ we really can build one , ” says Robert Hill of America 's Argonne National Laboratories .
He points to the Russian BN600 , a reactor that has been running since the 1980s .
Sodium is favoured as a coolant because of its good heat - transfer properties , its ability to operate at lower pressures than other coolants and its relative “ transparency ” to fast neutrons , which means it does not interfere in the fission process , says Dr Hill .
According to the IAEA , Russia , South Korea and India are all currently operating versions of the SFR , and China is due to bring a prototype online in mid-2010 .
The gas - cooled fast reactor ( GFR ) , in contrast , has yet to be demonstrated on a commercial scale .
But many see it as a better bet than the SFR due to its technical similarity to generation III gas - cooled designs .
Like the VHTR , the GFR uses pressurised helium both to cool the reactor core and drive a turbine , yielding higher thermal efficiency than systems with a secondary heat - transfer loop .
As with a VHTR , the other advantages of a gas coolant , says Tom Wei , a senior engineer at Argonne , include its non-corrosive characteristics and its capacity for use at high temperatures ( the GFR would operate at around 850 { degree}C ) .
But , like the VHTR , the GFR will require new materials to enable its cladding and fuel assemblies to withstand such high temperatures .
The third fast - reactor concept uses molten lead as the coolant , an approach historically favoured by the Soviet military , which used early lead - bismuth cooled fast reactors to power its submarines .
Since the late 1990s there has been renewed interest in the lead - cooled fast reactor ( LFR ) , particularly in Europe .
A distinctive advantage of the LFR concept is its potential to be adapted to smaller “ battery ” designs , which can be manufactured as self - contained systems with a “ lifetime core ” .
Such reactors could provide a way to extend civilian nuclear power to new countries without giving them access to the sensitive parts of the nuclear - fuel cycle .
Although a commercial fleet of fast reactors would be attractive from a waste - management perspective , it presents its own set of proliferation - related problems .
According to Charles Ferguson , a nuclear expert at the Council on Foreign Relations , a think - tank , the commercial adoption of fast reactors would require “ near real - time monitoring capabilities ” via secure video links to ensure that the reactors were not being used to make weapons .
Getting countries to agree to such intrusive measures , he says , would be very difficult .

In the belly of the beast
The sixth shortlisted design , the molten salt reactor ( MSR ) , works by dissolving nuclear fuel in a fluoride solution , which acts as both the fuel and the coolant in the reactor core .
The molten salt , which has good heat - transfer properties and can be heated to temperatures above 1,000 { degree}C without boiling , is moderated using graphite .
The circulation of the fuel in this way eliminates the need for fuel fabrication and allows for continuous online reprocessing .
It also makes the design well suited to the use of existing fissile material , which can be easily blended into the fuel mixture .
And like fast reactors , the MSR can be designed to burn up many of the longer - lived byproducts of the fission process , resulting in nuclear waste that is much less radioactive than that produced by the once - through cycle .
One form of MSR , the liquid fluoride thorium reactor ( LFTR ) , has garnered particular enthusiasm among those who regard thorium as an attractive replacement for uranium and plutonium in the fuel cycle .
( Thorium is both cheaper and more abundant than uranium . )
According to Kirk Sorensen , an engineer at NASA who also runs a blog on the merits of the thorium cycle , natural thorium provides at least 250 times more energy per unit than natural uranium .
However , unlike fissile uranium , natural thorium must be “ seeded ” with external neutrons in order to get it to fission .
Another obstacle for the MSR is finding materials capable of withstanding hot , corrosive , radioactive salt .
Flicking the switch
Which of these designs will prevail in the coming decades ?
After all , not all the generation - IV reactor concepts are likely to make it to commercialisation .
Ideally , the strongest approaches will win out through “ natural selection ” , says Thierry Dujardin at the OECD 's Nuclear Energy Agency ( NEA ) in Paris .
But with each of the designs closely connected to different national research programmes — and international variations within each of the categories — governments are unsurprisingly reluctant to see their particular projects sidelined .
Harold McFarlane at the Idaho National Laboratory reckons the VHTR and SFR are almost ready to move out of the research phase and into the design stage .
Others share this view : the British government has identified the VHTR , GFR , and SFR as high - priority designs , and Japan , France and America agreed last year to work together on SFR prototypes .
Dr Ferguson thinks the prospects of the entire generation - IV programme are contingent on the level of investment allocated to nearer - term projects .
“ Do we commit to generation III or do we leapfrog to generation IV ? ” he asks .
Two important considerations for answering his question are regulatory compliance and economic viability .
With regard to the former , the NEA 's Multinational Design Evaluation Programme is considering an international licensing scheme to standardise safety requirements for the new reactors .
As for the latter , the success of generation IV reactors is likely to hinge on large amounts of government support .
In the near term this support should take the form of increased research - and - development funding , says Dr Stacey of Georgia Tech .
In the longer term , governments have an important role to play in the provision of loan guarantees , which are vital for overcoming engineering and “ first of a kind ” risks , says Joe Turnage at Unistar , a commercial nuclear joint - venture between Constellation Energy , an American utility , and EDF , a French one .
But whatever the next generation of nuclear power - stations looks like , it is clear that the research being done around the world to develop such a variety of new reactors , rather than new nuclear weapons , has fulfilled Eisenhower 's wish , back in 1953 , that “ the miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to his death , but consecrated to his life . ”
Statement
For several years I worked as theatre costume and accessories maker , creating also a wide range of jewellery for stage use .
I developed a strong interest for contemporary jewellery and I dedicated myself to it .
What characterized my early work was the use of very thin metal sheets and wires , experimenting with hollowness and fullness .
In later work , I started using even thinner metal sheets , as if working with paper sheets , creating pieces that were voluminous and light at the same time .
My more recent work is characterized by having more solid looking elements and also by the introduction of color , not previously explored .

Abstract :
An important part of our information - gathering behavior has always been to find out what other people think .
With the growing availability and popularity of opinion - rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs , new opportunities and challenges arise as people can , and do , actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others .
The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis , which deals with the computational treatment of opinion , sentiment , and subjectivity in text , has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first - class object .
This survey covers techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion - oriented information - seeking systems .
Our focus is on methods that seek to address the new challenges raised by sentiment - aware applications , as compared to those that are already present in more traditional fact - based analysis .
We include material on summarization of evaluative text and on broader issues regarding privacy , vulnerability to manipulation , and economic impact that the development of opinion - oriented information - access services gives rise to .
To facilitate future work , a discussion of available resources , benchmark datasets , and evaluation campaigns is also provided .

ROCKFORD —
Trying to make people happy was a way of life for former Rockford High School athlete Lindsey John .
So when battling cancer meant chemotherapy sessions , the 23 - year - old made others laugh by showing up at her appointments wearing colored wigs or costumes .
“ She would dress as a banana and bring bananas to pass around .
She dressed up as a mailman and delivered Payday candy bars .
She did all sorts of stuff like that , just trying to make people happy , ” said her father , Michael John .
This week , John lost her three - year fight with inoperable brain cancer .
True to her spirit , she will be buried in a hot pink casket .
John ’s health struggle began when , after a short run , the former high school track star noticed her left leg was numb .
She ’d had similar issues with her lip and a finger on her left hand .
After a battery of tests , she was diagnosed with a brain tumor on Dec. 26 , 2006 .
The news launched her family on an emotional roller coaster .
But they were helped along the way by John ’s positive attitude and by a plethora of friends who supported the family , Michael John said .
“ It ’s been mostly happy times .
We ’ve tried to enjoy her life .
It was three years of living life to the fullest , ” he said .
She visited Ireland and France and went to parties with her friends , who would pick her up and bring her home , even when she started using a wheelchair .
“ She was n’t sitting around , moping or getting depressed , so we could n’t sit around and mope . ”
John graduated with honors from Rockford High in 2004 and was a state champion in track and cross country .
She studied marketing at Michigan State University and graduated with honors in May , despite having to travel from East Lansing to Grand Rapids for chemotherapy treatments every other week .
She had hoped to be the maid of honor at her sister Shayna ’s wedding last Saturday , but was hospitalized the past two weeks as her health declined .
Instead , the family arranged to have the wedding broadcast online via Skype , with a friend reading the toast Lindsey had prepared for her sister , Michael John said .
For Jenny Moulds ,
John ’s positive attitude made a huge difference after her 7 - year - old daughter , McKenna , was diagnosed with a brain tumor .
John become a friend to the Rockford girl , helping alleviate some rough moments as McKenna went through more than 26 months of chemotherapy and medical procedures .
Seeing John always was a thrill for McKenna , who now is in clinical remission .
“ They would show off their port scars to each other , ” Jenny Moulds said , referring to the access areas where their chemotherapy drugs were administered .
“ McKenna and our youngest daughter , Kayla , had a ball wearing all of John ’s brightly - colored wigs .
“ She showed her strength and courage to all of us who knew her . ”
In addition to her father , John is survived by her mother , Darlene , her brother Jason John , her sister and brother - in - law , Shayna and Trent McCloskey , many family and friends .
Visitation will be 3 to 9 p.m. Friday at Pederson Funeral Home in Rockford .
A funeral Mass will be 11 a.m. Saturday at Our Lady Of Consolation Catholic Church in Rockford .

" I still find it astonishing that we got the record with Thrust SSC , " says Green , " even more so when you realise just how hard it is .
I feel a great deal more comfortable about this attempt because of two things .
Firstly , we know so much more about what we need than we did with Thrust ; we are much more technically advanced .
Second , the level of intellectual debate is so much more sophisticated this time around . "
Inquiries from Jonathan Leake of the Sunday Times resulted in the following statement on Jan 22 , 2010 by Graham Smith , Deputy Commissioner , Information Commissioner ’s Office .
Smith stated that David Holland ’s FOI requests were “ not dealt with as they should have been under the legislation ” , that it is an “ offence for public authorities to act so as to prevent intentionally the disclosure of requested information ” , but that the particulars of the offence only came to light after the six - month statute of limitations under the FOI Act had expired .
Smith stated that the Information Commissioner ’s Office would request a change in the law to enable the prosecution of such time - barred cases .
While Smith did not propose a name for the amendment to the FOI law , it seems to me that the logical name would be the Jones et al ( 2010 ) Amendment ( Jones et al being Jones , Philip W. , Michael Mann , Keith Briffa , Caspar Ammann and Eugene Wahl . )
This might prove a more permanent contribution than any of the Team hockeysticks .
The full statement :
Norfolk Police are investigating how private emails have become public .
The Information Commissioner ’s Office is assisting the police investigation with advice on data protection and freedom of information .
The emails which are now public reveal that Mr Holland ’s requests under the Freedom of Information
Act were not dealt with as they should have been under the legislation .
Section 77 of the Freedom of Information
Act makes it an offence for public authorities to act so as to prevent intentionally the disclosure of requested information .
Mr Holland ’s FOI requests were submitted in 2007 / 8 , but it has only recently come to light that they were not dealt with in accordance with the Act .
The legislation requires action within six months of the offence taking place , so by the time the action taken came to light the opportunity to consider a prosecution was long gone .
The ICO is gathering evidence from this and other time - barred cases to support the case for a change in the law .
It is important to note that the ICO enforces the law as it stands – we do not make it .
It is for government and Parliament to consider whether this aspect of the legislation should be strengthened to deter this type of activity in future .
We will be advising the University about the importance of effective records management and their legal obligations in respect of future requests for information .
We will also be studying the investigation reports ( by Lord Russell and Norfolk Police ) , and we will then consider what regulatory action , if any , should then be taken under the Data Protection Act . ”
My guess is that this is not the end of this particular story .
The six month statute of limitations would not apply to the consideration of these actions by the various universities under their investigations .
It is also possible that the Information Commissioner ’s Office may consider other approaches to the problem with longer statutes of limitations .

8:54 a.m. : Trial resumes with expert witness
The Proposition 8 trial has resumed this morning with the continued testimony of Nancy Cott , a Harvard University historian and expert for the plaintiffs .
Her task to start the second day of trial is to knock down one of the central arguments of gay marriage foes : that the state has a compelling interest in restricting marriage to heterosexual couples because of the procreative purpose of marriage .
Asked by plaintiffs attorney Theodore Boutrous whether procreation is a central purpose of marriage , Cott scoffed , nothing that President George Washington , “ the father of our country , ” was sterile by the time of a later marriage .
“ Procreative ability has never been a qualification for marriage , ” she testified .
9:44 a.m. : Expert insists no reason to deny same - sex marriage
Harvard Professor Nancy
Cott is wrapping up her testimony under direct questioning from plaintiffs lawyers , insisting that based on historical trends in marriage , there is no reason to deny same - sex couples the right to marry .
Among other things , she notes the parallels between the country moving to allow interracial marriage in the last century and providing that rights to gays and lesbians .
She is now being cross-examined by Proposition 8 lawyers , who are trying to suggest she is more advocate for same - sex marriage than independent expert .
( Cott testified in court challenges in Iowa on the issue . )
The plaintiffs ’ next expert today will be George Chauncey , a Yale University expert on the history of discrimination against gays and lesbians .
The trial proceedings are a bit quieter today .
The courtroom is for the most part filled , although there area fewer lawyers , fewer spectators and no demonstrations outside the federal building .
10:21 a.m. : Defense presses expert on same - sex views
The judge took a brief recess , as Professor Nancy Cott is under cross-examination from Proposition 8 lawyer David Thompson , who is pressing her hard on her views about same - sex marriage .
Cott is an academic to the bone , so Thompson is having a hard time pinning her down , but is clearly trying to show she has offered inconsistent statements in the past on the marriage subject .
11:02 a.m. : Witness appears impatient with cross-examination
Professor Nancy Cott , the historian , is back on the witness stand , and appears to be getting a little impatient with the cross-examination of Proposition 8 lawyer David Thompson .
Thompson is challenging one of Cott ’s ideas that modern marriage laws are shaped now by civil law and social developments ; the defense attorney is pushing hard on the anti-gay marriage thesis that heterosexual marriage is tied to history and religion restricting unions to men and women .
He repeatedly suggested in his questions that marriage laws are tied to Christianity .
At one point , asking Cott about monogamy being the result of the teachings of Jesus and his apostles , the professor got a little impatient .
“ I know very little about Jesus Christ and his apostles , ” Cott shot back at Thompson .
The cross-examination continues .
12:20 p.m. : First expert witness wrapping up testimony
After more than two hours under cross-examination , Harvard ’s Nancy Cott is now wrapping up her testimony under more cordial questioning from plaintiffs lawyer Ted Boutrous .
Proposition 8 lawyer David Thompson used her time on the stand to give Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker a script of questions outlining the Proposition 8 side ’s view of why traditional heterosexual marriage should remain the law , from its origins in Christianity to its “ pro-child ” elements .
At one point , Thompson asked Cott in more of a statement than question : “ Marriage is not an infinitely elastic contract between two people , correct ? ”
“ I ca n’t answer that question , ” Cott replied .
Yale University professor George Chauncey takes the stand for the plaintiffs this afternoon as an expert on the history of discrimination in the U.S. against gays and lesbians .
It looks like an all - expert day in the trial , and it wo n’t be the last as Walker establishes a record on the same - sex marriage issue and the big constitutional questions at stake in the case .
12:31 p.m. : Trial breaks for lunch
Judge Vaughn Walker just broke the Proposition 8 trial until 1:30 .
He wrapped up Professor Nancy Cott ’s testimony with a few questions of his own , including asking her what the state ’s interest is in regulating marriage .
As has been the case often Cott answered with a mouthful ( clearly , she ’s a very accomplished scholar ; however , Cott ’s long - winded testimony drew a few friendly jabs from the judge and lawyers all morning ) : “ Bundling certain social needs with the duties imposed on the couples by the state … to incentivize stable household creation ” was at least part of her answer .
The judge , of course , has the benefit of transcripts to decide the case .
12:49 p.m. : Defense attorney calls plaintiff ’s expert testimony a ‘ disaster ’
Well , that did n’t take long .
Professor Nancy Cotts finished her testimony , and within about 10 minutes , Proposition 8 counsel Andrew Pugno held a news conference and called her performance on the stand “ a disaster for the plaintiffs . ”
Pugno contends his legal team was able to show through some of Cotts ’ past statements and writings that many of her positions were actually “ very favorable to our position . ”
Cotts , however , repeatedly said in her testimony that , based on her study of history , same - sex couples should now have the legal right to marry .
No word yet from plaintiffs side , but safe to say they did n’t view Cotts ’ testimony the same way as their adversaries .
1:51 p.m. : Ivy League professor takes the stand
It is on to the next Ivy League history professor in the Proposition 8 trial .
George Chauncey , a Yale professor and expert on the history of discrimination against gays and lesbians , has been called to the stand by the plaintiffs .
“ Lesbians and gay men have experienced widespread and acute discrimination , ” he testified under questioning from Therese Stewart , San Francisco chief deputy city attorney .
Chauncey ’s testimony would be relevant to the plaintiffs ’ attempt to persuade Judge Vaughn Walker that gays and lesbians should be a “ protected class ” under the federal constitution , important to make a claim under the equal protection clause that denying them the equal right to marry is a violation
1:32 p.m. : Professor details history of discrimination against gays
Professor George Chauncey of Yale is now walking the judge through the history of discrimination against gays in the country .
He ’s talked about how gays were through much of the first half of the 20th century the target of criminal enforcement by local police whenever they gathered .
“ They had to hide the fact they were gay , ” he testified , describing sweeps of bars where gays and lesbians were found .
Chauncey then moved forward in history , through banning gays from the military at the outset of World War II and up through employment discrimination in more modern times .
He ’s about to respond to San Francisco deputy city attorney Therese Stewart ’s questions about censorship campaigns .
3:22 p.m. :
Yale professor says gays and lesbians demonized for decades
Yale professor George Chauncey is testifying about the public campaigns “ demonizing ” gays and lesbians for decades , from newspaper accounts in the 1930s to Anita Bryant ’s famous campaign against homosexuality during the 1970s .
Plaintiffs lawyers plan to attempt to link those campaigns and their impact on gays and lesbians to the Proposition 8 campaign and other efforts to thwart same - sex marriage ..
Chauncey will face cross-examination in the morning .
The plaintiffs have three witnesses slated to follow him : Dr. Edmund Egan , chief economist for San Francisco who will testify about the economic impact of Prop 8 on local governments ; Dr. Ilan Meyer , a Columbia University expert on how discrimination causes a mental health toll on gays ; and Dr. Letitia Peplau , a UCLA prof who will testify about the personal benefits of being married
4:17 p.m. : Defense attacks expert ’s credibility ; second day of trial ends
The second day of the Prop 8 trial is now in the books .
Yale historian George Chauncey finished up his testimony under questioning from plaintiffs attorney Therese Stewart , describing the campaign to enact Prop 8 as part of a historical trend of demonizing gays and lesbians .
Judge Vaughn
Walker then allowed Prop 8 lawyers to start their cross-examination , and it ’s clear from just a few minutes of it that they intend to portray Chauncey they same way they attempted to portray Harvard expert Nancy Cott earlier in the day : as a gay marriage advocate , not an expert .
Chauncey conceded he supports the right of gay couples to marry , but insisted his historical research on discrimination is untainted .
The cross-examination will continue Wednesday morning , and the plaintiffs have three more experts lined up on the runway .
Meanwhile , the biggest news to expect Wednesday will take place outside the federal building .
The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide by 1 p.m. whether to lift a stay on Walker ’s order allowing delayed broadcasts of the trial to be posted via YouTube .

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) is diagnosed through a number of symptoms and pathologies , but the most predominant and well known characteristics are repetitive thoughts , feelings , and behaviors that never successfully subdue a need or anxiety .
The classic example is the irrational and insatiable washing of hands despite the hands being cleansed .
3D Dot Hero is a game that has a poorly rendered character taking his wooden sword on a journey to save a kingdom by going through six elementally based dungeons .
Luckily you have a small fairy companion and a legendary sword at your disposal .
Wikipedia has the plot listed as :
The game follows a hero on a quest to rid the Dotnia Kingdom of a dark plague caused by the forces of evil in order to restore peace to the land .
Legend tells of an evil king known as the Dark King Onyx who brought tragedy and darkness to the kingdom by stealing six magical orbs .
However a hero rose up against the Dark King and with his legendary sword as well as the power of the orbs , he sealed Onyx away within another orb .
However , the forces of evil rose again as the Dark Bishop Fuelle stole the orb and threw the Kingdom of Dotnia into a state of chaos once more .
The game ’s main protagonist is the grandchild of the brave hero who sealed away the Dark King and thus is entrusted with the responsibility to save the land .
Now if you are like me , and think that this sounds a bit familiar … it ’s because it is ….
this is almost completely identical to the Legend of Zelda , which is a series often praised and criticized for having similar game play , level design , characters , and basically is completely identical other than graphical upgrades and some minor changes .
Not only is this a rip off of another game , it is a rip off of a game that has been replicating itself for nearly twenty years .
Now I am not saying that 3D Dot Hero is the mentally disabled clone like in Multiplicity ; I am sure it ’s a fun game , but something about this worries me .
Another game that seems to be following this pattern is Quantum Theory .
This game seems be a doppelganger of Gears of War , and I do n’t think it is really ashamed of that .
This is not really a new pattern , most of the classic games we all love have repeated themselves with only small differences and have been cloned countless times .
Here is a list of , which follow a similar pattern :
The Legend of Zelda Series
Castlevania Series
Halo Series
Call of Duty Series
Mr and Mrs. Pac-Man
Super Mario Series
Kirby Series
God of War Series
Grand Theft Auto Series
Guitar Hero / Rock Band
Ratchet and Clank
If you get my drift after this very short list , almost all these incredibly popular games suffer from the self - replication syndrome .
So what has this got to do with OCD ?
Well my argument is that games that clone each other or self replicate are the sinks , and we are the OCD patients who continue to wash our hands over and over and over and over again .
What happens is that it is no longer about the fulfillment of playing the game , but about the ritual of going through the process itself .
It is almost like an addiction in nature .
When we first started playing games , they were new adventures that had our imaginations running wild with excitement .
New genres and game mechanics were invented with every coming year and us gamers could roll with the punches , and adapt and learn .
Today as we are already addicts , it is no longer about the pleasure and the imagination , but instead about the ritual of going through the same pattern .
It is accepted that there are a limited amount of genres , that we have capped out .
We no longer want that feeling of excitement , instead we are only concerned with getting the job done , by going through the same old games over and over .
Now if your first reaction after reading this is “ If it ai n’t broke , do n’t fix it ” I ask you to think about this motto at a deeper and more profound level which looks at the effect this has on our industry .
These companies that create big budget AAA games generally are able to hire the best developers , artists , programmers , directors , etc .
These are the incredibly creative and amazing innovators who come up with the first title in a series that change the industry , but as time wears on they are stuck making the same game over and over because of gamer demand .
Why is it that Bungie over the last five years has desperately been trying to escape the grasp of Microsoft ?
The answer I believe is that they are sick of having to make the same game over and over again .
They want to move on and use their creativity and innovation in a new way .
This is the same reason that J.K.
Rowling does n’t just write Harry Potter books forever even though God knows they would sell .
This is not the fault of the game companies ( well not entirely ) ; this is our fault .
We , the gamers , are the ones who have an insatiable appetite for the same experience , and we punish game companies harshly if they vary from our routine .
The first example I will cite is Super Mario Sunshine , which many would say is the worst of the 3D Adventures Mario has gone on .
The problem with this is the majority of the gameplay was changed radically from previous titles .
For example , you now had a waterpack / gun as your primary weapon , and our goal was to clean the environment , and not solely to save the princess .
Same can be said for Luigi ’s Mansion .
Essentially , Nintendo took the soap away from our sink and we panicked .
Soon that panic turned to rage , and the game , console ( GameCube ) , and industry suffered .
If this game had been called “ Super Eddy Sunshine ” and had been the exact same game minus Mario , it would have been more than likely praised as one of the coolest and most exciting IPs of the year .
Instead it was disseminated into obscurity as “ the failed Mario game . ”
Is it any surprise that the next two Mario titles were so stuffed full of nostalgia that it was almost criminal ?
Nintendo learned their lesson .
Gaming is the only technology field where innovation is actually frowned upon because of a serious threat of low sales .
Another example is Starfox Adventures for the Nintendo Gamecube .
As soon as Fox stepped out of that ship , every gamer began to sweat with withdrawal symptoms .
We began to panic like someone had locked the bathroom door after we just shook hands with a very sweaty King Hippo .
We , as gamers , freak out at the signs of change and ultimately this hurts us , developers , and industry as a whole .
So what does this have to do with 3D Dot Hero and Quantum Theory ?
Well these games are dangerous indicators of what may be to come .
It is one thing for an individual company to remake their own game in sequel form , or HD update it , but when other companies begin to shamelessly rip off nostalgia and game play from previous titles and gamers are excited about it …… well then we are in for trouble .
Where this leads is for game makers to begin thinking backwards rather than forwards .
Companies are going to begin thinking , how can I repackage an already socially approved formula , rather than invent my own .
Sadly to say , with rising development costs , and low sales of new and innovative IPs , this seems to be the direction we are going .
It is for this reason that there really has n’t been that much of a major change in gameplay since the don of the 3D age .
We are still doing the same things in FPS that we were doing in Quake or Doom fifteen years ago .
Same goes for platformers , RPGs , RTS , and racing titles .
For goodness sake , Mirror ’s Edge , which was praised for being incredibly innovative was really just a FPS with no guns … except you did have guns after all .
As if the developers started to do something cool and innovative , but then the management in fear of retaliation choked the leash back , and had to have some insurance guns in the game , just in case .
Point being , these companies can only make slight changes in order to not get the retaliation of the gamers wallet .
One company I would really like to praise is Team Ninja for pushing Metroid in a direction that is incredibly new and innovative , but still keep a healthy touch of familiarity .
Hopefully for their sake , hardcore Metroid purists will be able to look past their own anxiety around change and accept something new .
For hypothetical reasons , lets say this game flops , and is plagued with issues .
Well I guess I would be happy that it tried something new and failed , than the team dogmatically recreated an identical title and succeeded .
And who knows , even if it did flop , maybe it would inspire other developers to learn from their mistakes and do it right .
Imagine if this kind of innovation was applied to all old franchises ?
If Mario , Zelda , GTA , and Ratchet and Clank would be pushed any way game developers wanted , without having to adhere to the OCD of gamers .
Finally , I would like to point out a Henry Ford quote
“ If I had asked people what they wanted , they would have said a faster horse ! ”
The comic below , that comes from underwhelmed.com , and is the best summary of what I believe is the irony of this issue .
‘
The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of Kipp Pietrantonio .
Central heating may keep your house warm , but it can also make the air stuffy .
A new ventilation system that works like the nose of a small desert rat might let your house “ breathe ” , freshening the air while maintaining cosiness .
So claims Steven Vogel of Duke University in Durham , North Carolina .
Like some other desert creatures , the bipedal kangaroo rat , he says , helps maintain its body temperature using a clever nasal architecture .
On exhaling , the rat ’s nasal passageways are heated by the outgoing air .
When it inhales , those warmed passageways heat the incoming air .
This heat exchange ensures little body heat is lost .
Home comforts
Vogel wondered if a house or apartment could be made to breathe this way – gaining fresh air with low heat loss – and he built a model of a one - room dwelling to try it .
He calls it the Nose House .

Using two fan - driven heat exchangers , he was able to mimic the rodent ’s trick .
As one exchanger pushes air into the room , the other lets air out – then their roles reverse .
Each exchanger comprises a 40 - centimetre - long plywood chamber , 5 - centimetres - square in cross-section .
Inside each chamber there are 17 half - millimetre thick aluminium plates that store heat as warm air leaves it , and which warm the air that is sucked in on the next “ breath ” .
“ This was as crude an analogy as I can imagine but it worked , ” Vogel says .
“ This non -optimised version saved over half the heat that would have been lost using steady - flow fans alone .
“ Well - sealed houses are very unpleasant and this may get around it . ”
Big problems
Vogel is not sure if his idea will scale up , though : to warm the average house , the chambers would need to be 6 metres long .
But he plans to test whether the system might work .
Patent searches have shown no similar heat exchange system working in anti-phase to mimic breathing , he notes .
Peter Gammack , concept design director for Dyson in Malmesbury , Wiltshire , UK , is impressed .
“ This is a very interesting biomimetics - inspired idea .
Small animals have evolved to work in very efficient ways and the clever use of two alternating heat exchangers is elegant , ” he says .
“ It could be a good way of improving air quality in buildings in an energy - efficient manner . ”
Gammack adds that Vogel is right to be concerned about moving to full - scale machines , as Dyson discovered when developing its bladeless fan recently .
“ We had to extensively test even the minutest size change – it ’s surprising how dramatically scale affects effectiveness . ”

Implementing a blog in Common Lisp
by Vetle Roeim - last updated 2009-01-15
Update : Unfortunately , the Hunchentoot API seems to have been changed since this was written , so it 'll probably not work anymore .
( 2010 -03 - 28 )
This tutorial shows how a blog can easily be implemented in Common Lisp , using a few frameworks .
Installing these frameworks is not covered , and neither are details on getting Common Lisp implementation up and running .

Police were forced to call for back up after New Year 's Eve revellers at South Bank hurled abuse at officers , who were arresting a man for the alleged sexual assault of a woman .
Brisbane Magistrates Court was told patrolling officers arrested and handcuffed Owar Obongo , a 29 - year - old student , after receiving a complaint he had indecently assaulted a woman at South Bank .
The incident , at about 11.30 pm on New Year 's Eve , resulted in Obongo struggling with officers and nearby revellers becoming involved in the arrest .
" Members of the public then verbally abused police for arresting the defendant , " said police prosecutor Sergeant Peter Treloar .
Back up was requested , he said , but the woman declined to make a formal complaint of sexual assault against Obongo .

[ An MP3 audio version of this article , read by Floy Lilley , is available as a free download . ]
If Ron Paul succeeds in getting the Fed audited , the consequences could be far - reaching .
Assuming the audit is n't rigged to protect the guilty , as a similar bill was in 1978 , the Fed will need every obfuscating Keynesian to testify and write editorials on its behalf , to reassure the public that monetary matters really are best left to the gods who rule us , such as Ben Bernanke and Timothy Geithner .
Monetarists , too , would likely join the " Save the Fed " crusade , perhaps arguing that even a great free market economist like Milton Friedman considered the Fed useful for preventing and curing recessions .
But the really appetizing part of auditing the Fed is knowing what stands behind it .
The Fed is a racket at heart , a con game writ large — what else can you call an organization with the exclusive privilege of printing money in the trillions and handing it over to friends ?
But if this is true , what does that say about the state , the organization that created and sanctions it ?
Is the Fed an honest mistake in the state 's otherwise undying efforts to preserve our liberty , or might it be a key component of a bigger racket ?
Without the power of the state , there would be no proposal to audit the Fed because there would be no Fed to audit .
Like any cartel , it exists to protect its members from market retribution , and only the police power of the state can make us shoulder that burden .
A bill to audit the Fed could by force of logic become a state audit , much like the investigations of the 1972 Watergate burglary exposed the grinning skull behind the government 's public persona .
During a
Fed audit , for example , would it not be reasonable to ask why the people 's elected representatives continue to support a banking system that secretly steals wealth from their countrymen and other dollar holders ?
Or are we to take the naïve position that most elected officials really are clueless about the Fed 's policy of currency debasement and the effects such policies have had in history ?
Partners in Crime
There are any number of ways a Fed audit could bring the state itself under close scrutiny , but let us sketch just one line of argument :
It is well known that banks engage in fractional - reserve lending , meaning that bankers use their deposits in lending operations , with only a part of their loans covered by money reserves .
Fractional reserves expand the money supply , which , until the age of Keynes and Fisher , was called inflation . [ 1 ]
It is also common knowledge that when banks extend too much credit , depositors quite naturally get nervous and start withdrawing their money .
Although fractional reserves would seemingly qualify as a form of embezzlement — the act of taking for personal use other people 's property without their knowledge or consent — government court rulings have never viewed it as such .
As Murray Rothbard observed , a bank that fails to meet its deposit obligations is just another insolvent , not an embezzler .
Following the British ruling in Foley v. Hill and Others in 1848 , US courts consider that money left with a banker is , " to all intents and purposes , the money of the banker , to do with as he pleases . "
[ 2 ]
This holds even if the banker engages in " hazardous speculation . "
Thus , according to the state , there can be no embezzlement because the money belongs to the bank , not the depositor .
But was there ever a depositor who thought he was turning his money over to the banker so he could " do as he pleases " with it ?
Furthermore , when the banker , in loaning the customer 's deposit to another party , essentially creates two claims to the same piece of property ( the money deposited ) , there is no way he can meet his obligations to both depositor and borrower at the same time .
Why does the state exempt banks from the law of contradiction ?
Without a central bank , fractional - reserve banking leads to repetitive crises , as banks are incapable of meeting redemption demands .
Banks that have trouble meeting their obligations need money fast , and this is one of the problems a central bank addresses .
" The very existence of a fractional - reserve banking system invariably leads to the emergence of a central bank as a lender of last resort , " Jesus Huerta de Soto tells us . [ 3 ]
True , but as de Soto recognizes , central banks do n't emerge from open and candid discussions within the banking community , unless one regards their wish for " a more elastic currency " as an instance of brute honesty .
To succeed , central banks need protection from competition ; they need to be the monopoly supplier of bank notes .
But monopolies in this sense do n't emerge on a free market .
A deal needs to be cut between big bankers and influential politicians to create a bank with legal privileges .
This arrangement is then forced on us not , presented not as a special privilege but as serving the public interest .
And we need to be forced to accept the privileged bank 's fiat money in trade for real goods or services .
It bears repeating : a central bank " is not a natural product of banking development , " as Vera Smith concluded in her well - known study . [ 4 ]
" It comes into being as a result of government favors . "
What does a government get in exchange for these favors , a Fed auditor might ask ?
With a central bank , fractional - reserve banking leads to repetitive crises , but they may differ from crises without a central bank in two respects : one , because a central bank enforces a uniform rate of inflation ( credit expansion ) , one bank can't jeopardize the rest by overexpanding more than others ; consequently , the day of reckoning is delayed , and the correction needed is more severe .
And two , when the crisis hits , the central bank provides a means for more monetary wrongdoing .
Since the requirement of redemption limits the inflationary potential of a central bank , governments sooner or later get around to outlawing money itself and force us to use exclusively what was formerly only a money substitute .
Governments , in other words , outlaw gold and make us use their paper .
Question from the auditor : how does this arrangement qualify as a free market , as so many commentators today tacitly believe when they blame the crisis on the free market ?
With gold gone the central bank becomes government 's genie , able to grant it almost unlimited spending .
Massive spending in the '30s did n't cure the Depression , though it did make government a much heavier load for the market to bear .
Does the central bank 's ability to orchestrate inflation have any connection with a government 's involvement in war ?
Might the world wars have been far shorter and less destructive of life and property , while propagating fewer bloody shoots of their own , without the aid of central banking and a fiat - paper standard ?
The enormous monetary outlays of war go to politically favored firms , which thus have an incentive to foster a more belligerent and interventionist foreign policy .
Is this military - industrial - congressional complex killing us ?
How eager will politicians be to go to war or police the world if they no longer have a printing press to pay for their adventures ?
Might we all be better off with a money and banking system that is completely severed from government ?
And might we be better off with a government that can't feed on inflation ?
The Pujo Committee
Prior to passage of the Federal Reserve Act , Wisconsin Senator Robert LaFollette and Minnesota Congressman Charles Lindbergh Sr. delivered scathing speeches attacking " the money trust " for causing booms and busts .
LaFollette charged that the entire country was controlled by just fifty men , a claim that a Morgan partner rejected as totally absurd .
He knew firsthand the number was not more than eight .
Following Lindbergh 's resolution , Congress created the Pujo Committee to investigate the big bankers , but the committee was firmly in the hands of the trust itself .
During the summer of 1912 , the committee scared the wits out of people with statistics and testimonies showing the power Wall Street had over the economy .
To the public , Congress seemed to be doing its job by cracking down on corruption , though at no time were Lindbergh or LaFollette called to testify , nor did anyone seem to attach any significance to the fact that the biggest bankers were leading the charge for reform .
The committee concluded that banking reform was urgent and necessary to bring Wall Street under control , and a year later Congress and President Wilson gave the country a central bank as an early Christmas present .
[ 5 ]
As Rothbard notes , the composition of the first Federal Reserve Board more or less reflected the power structure of those present at the Fed 's founding meeting at Jekyll Island in 1910 , with Morgan man Benjamin Strong actually running the system as head of the New York Fed . [ 6 ]
Power grabs are a frequent and predictable outcome of government investigations .
However , any audit that exposes the Fed 's relationship to the state will be worth doing , even if the Fed 's friends keep it where it is .
OTL : Friday Night Lite
ORTLAND , Ore. --
Somewhere between home and the football field , Christian Swain 's driver 's side window short - circuited .
This had better not be an omen , he thought .
He 'd waited his whole life -- all 33 years -- to be a high school head football coach , and he did n't want his first season to be a clunker .
He kept pressing the electric buttons inside his beat - up gold ' 99 Ford Taurus , but the window stayed stuck wide open .
As he turned onto Interstate 5 , the wind stung his face .
Good thing it was summer .
He drove onto campus and parked next to a stadium with no stands .
The school -- Roosevelt High in north Portland -- was a notorious bottom - feeder located in the poorest part of the city .
It had no cheerleaders , no marching band , no press box and , as far as Swain could tell , no quarterbacks .
But still three months away from opening night , the coach had reason to believe he could pull this off .
He had grown up just east of campus , on the wrong side of the bridge himself , and he knew if these kids were anything like him -- hungry , a little nuts and searching for a better life -- he could win a game .
Maybe even two .
When the school hired him last January as campus monitor -- i.e. , to keep peace in the hallways -- Swain was curious to know why the team had just gone 0 - 9 .
At that time , he had just applied for the head - coaching job and was desperate to read the pulse of the school .
From his career as an undersized middle linebacker at nearby Lincoln High in the mid-'90s , he remembered Roosevelt as having tough , reputable teams .
Built in 1923 , the school resembled an East Coast prep academy complete with a picturesque bell tower .
He had always seen potential there .
Little did he know the place was rotting from the inside out .
Maybe it was the infiltration of gangs or the school 's abysmal test scores or the decaying facilities .
Either way , parents in the area were hesitant to send their kids into the chaos , and because the city of Portland had open enrollment -- meaning you could attend any school in your district -- there had been a mass exodus .
The best students and athletes fled to Grant , Lincoln , Benson or Madison .
Roosevelt was generally left with three kinds of students : kids too poor to leave , kids too naive to leave and kids too apathetic to leave .
If every local student had been forced to attend , Roosevelt 's enrollment would 've been a bustling 1,300 .
But that number was fewer than 700 by the spring of '09 when Swain was finally named interim coach .
And from what he heard , only 18 of them played football .
Tom Hauck for ESPN.com Christian Swain , Roosevelt
High 's first - year football coach , conducts practice .
280 pounds of mixed message
One of those 18 squeezed into Swain 's detention room that spring , barely fitting through the door .
Junvonte Tillman was 6 - foot - 2 and 280 pounds of intrigue .
On one hand , he'd been sent to detention for being late to a final exam .
On the other hand , he carried in a poem he'd just written .
Swain ordered the man-child to take a seat , and Tillman -- who knew Swain would be his coach -- asked him to read his poetry :
Sean Meagher / OregonLive.com
Junvonte Tillman knew in the early going that the Roughriders had their coach .
I am strong .
I pretend I do n't care
I feel happy for what I have
I touch my family 's hearts
I worry I will do something bad
I AM strong
While Swain was reading -- and thinking , " This kid really wants me to know him " -- Tillman started bantering with a girl seated nearby .
Their teasing escalated until the girl took an ink pen and marked up Tillman 's shirt .
The next sound Swain heard was Tillman screaming , " F - -- you ! "
He had blown a gasket .
It was his favorite Duke Blue Devils T - shirt , something he wore at least twice a week .
He was n't made of money ; none of the students was .
So he threw something at the girl and continued to swear .
Swain tried calming him down , but Tillman groused at the coach for not suspending the girl on the spot .
He then burst out of the room .
After the bell , Swain searched the school and found Tillman seated in his next class .
He ordered him straight to his office and said calmly but pointedly : " We 'll get you another T - shirt if we have to , but you can't freak out like that .
Do n't you ever disrespect me again or come in my room cussing out students .
I 'll always do anything I can to help you , but you can't flip out that way . "
Tillman could not remember a teacher ever being this firm and caring at the same time , and he apologized profusely .
That night , the T - shirt stain came out in the wash .
And he put the word out to the other 17 : We got ourselves a coach .
Thin , fair - skinned , but born to coach
One of the other 17 already had stopped him in the halls to ask , " Is that you , Coach Swain ? "
" Nolan ? "
Swain responded , startled .
" Yeah , it 's me , Nolan . "
Nolan Stewart , now a 255 - pound center , had played on one of Swain 's first teams , back in Pop Warner , back when Swain was at a crossroads in his young adult life .
Coming out of junior college , Swain drove a truck for Pepsi -Cola , but he had always had an itch to coach and mentor kids .
Thin and fair - skinned , he did n't look the part , but , Lord , he talked it .
Every time he saw a kid skateboarding on the street , he 'd invite him to play catch or show him the football helmets in his garage .
And before long , he was asked to coach for the Police Athletic League near Marshall High School in southeast Portland .
Stewart -- a cherubic motormouth -- was one of his early kids , and Swain adored him , as he did all his players .
Swain decided coaching was his future , so he quit his job at Pepsi to go earn his degree at Western Oregon University in Monmouth .
While he was enrolled , he volunteered to help coach at nearby McKay High School in Salem , and the McKay administrators ended up hiring him to work with emotionally disturbed kids in their special ed program .
These were kids from foster homes , kids from broken homes and kids who blew gaskets .
Kids not unlike Junvonte Tillman .
In other words , Swain was a perfect Roosevelt fit , and Tillman and Stewart -- two of the more popular kids in the school -- became the first football players to buy in .
Swain took it from there .
Because of his campus security job , he could roam the hallways all day , sizing up potential players , and he would ask almost anyone with a pulse to join the team .
A couple of times , the response was : " Are you f---ing kidding me ?
Football ? "
He felt as if he had offended them .
But Swain was only warming up .
Tom Hauck for ESPN.com Swain persuaded Javon Johnson , a 6 - foot - 1 forward on the basketball team , to rejoin the football team .
He knew the basketball team was a consistent winner ( it helped that it needed only five guys ) , so he began to recruit its players .
He told a 6 - 1 forward named Javon Johnson that if he played wide receiver , he could post up 5 - 7 cornerbacks for touchdowns , the same way he posted up smaller players in hoops .
Johnson , who had quit the football team two years before , came aboard .
By the time spring practice began , 35 kids were on the field ready for action .
That did n't mean they were any good .
Swain ended up having to teach several kids how to throw , catch and get into a three - point stance .
" It 'd be like coaching third - graders who had never played before , " he said .
He met with local youth coaches who told him none of their Pop Warner kids had ever stayed in the area to play for Roosevelt .
That floored Swain .
When he coached Pop Warner in the Marshall area , he remembered a stud running back / linebacker named Nick Pietrzyk whose family was going to send him to Marshall High School no matter how awful the program was .
Swain needed families like the Pietrzyks at Roosevelt , and he invited all the youth teams -- from third grade on up -- to hold their practices on Roosevelt 's field .
This way , he could get to know all the kids and their families .
The more questions Swain asked , the more dire the situation seemed .
The previous year 's coach , Cam McFarland , now the athletic director , told Swain he 'd started with 40 - plus players , but most kids would quit or become academically ineligible , which is why , by the 2008 season finale , only 18 suited up .
Swain also had heard how the crumbling stadium bleachers had been condemned , torn down and never replaced .
Curiously , the bleachers at nearby Lincoln had been condemned , too , and replaced right away .
Since the city was looking to shut down some of the struggling schools in the area , some took that to mean district officials were thinking about closing Roosevelt altogether , unless somebody or something could save the place .
By June , the strong spring turnout ( only 10 kids quit ) persuaded Roosevelt 's administration to remove Swain 's interim tag .
Better yet , he was allowed to borrow players from the three alternative high schools in the area -- Open Meadow , L.E.P. ( Leadership and Entrepreneurial Public Charter School ) and De La Salle -- and two of those kids happened to be dynamite .
One of them , Ilyjah Spires , was a ripped 6 - 1 , 205 - pound tailback who also could play quarterback in a Wildcat formation .
Another was rangy 6 - 4 receiver Aaron Casey , who could snatch anything thrown his way .
Swain decided he would build around those two and Tillman .
And he figured if he could find just one more explosive , experienced player , he might have a chance to shock the city .
Later that month , Swain 's cell phone rang as he was heading home in his beat - up Taurus .
Because of the jammed window , the wind made it difficult to hear .
But he could tell it was the school 's secretary , Connie Verbout .
" Christian , there 's a guy down here with his mom who just moved from Seattle , and he looks like he might be a pretty good football player , " she said .
" Are you still around ? "
One U - turn and 20 minutes later , Swain took his first look at a sleek 17 - year - old named Javontae Perry .
" You play ball ? " the coach asked .
" My whole life , " Perry said .
" There is a God , " Swain thought to himself .
The NFL QB from heaven
The phone calls and the heavens were n't finished .
About the same time , Swain was told that Neil Lomax -- a former Pro Bowl quarterback for the St. Louis and Phoenix Cardinals and a local legend out of Portland State -- wanted to chat .
Swain called him back , and the first words out of Lomax 's mouth were , " God told me to help you . "
Tom Hauck for ESPN.com Neil Lomax , a former NFL quarterback , dedicated himself to helping the Roosevelt players .
The former NFL star was n't joking .
A devout man who used to lead the Cardinals in prayer , Lomax was a member of the community - minded SouthLake Foursquare Church in nearby West Linn .
A year earlier , in June 2008 , SouthLake 's worship leader , Wilson Smith -- one of Nike 's early Air Jordan designers -- had been urged by Kevin Palau of the Luis Palau ministries to begin a " Season of Service . "
The idea was for churches to adopt a school and / or cause , and beleaguered Roosevelt became SouthLake 's choice .
That same month , more than 1,000 church members descended on the campus to paint over graffiti , landscape the quad and generally sanitize the building .
" There were literally weeds taller than me , and I 'm 5 - foot - 9 , " said Kristine Sommer , one of the project leaders .
But SouthLake was n't a hi-and - bye operation .
The church placed Sommer permanently at the school and , among other things , opened a " clothes closet " so at - risk students always would have new shoes and outfits .
One homeless student who lived in a car just wanted soap for herself and her mother , and Sommer 's staff took care of that , too .
The church entrenched itself in the school , and when a columnist at The Oregonian newspaper , Steve Duin , wrote that Roosevelt 's winless girls ' basketball team averaged only six fans per game , SouthLake members packed its final home game , bringing the girls to tears .
In early June 2009 , church members returned to campus to shine the locker rooms , scrub the gutters and organize cluttered classrooms .
In an ensuing Sunday sermon , pastor Kip Jacobs showed a video of the Roosevelt project to the entire congregation .
Neil Lomax watched it all and felt ashamed .
He had n't been out to Roosevelt once .
On the drive home that day with his wife , Laurie , Lomax said out loud , " Really , God ? OK , I will . "
Laurie asked him what he was talking about , and Lomax told her he was going to call the Roosevelt football coach , that he was going to offer to join his staff .
When Swain heard about this , his jaw dropped .
At Portland State , Lomax had once thrown seven touchdowns in a quarter .
He 'd held 90 NCAA records , and his coach , Mouse Davis , had basically been the father of the spread offense .
And now Lomax was just going to show up at Roosevelt 's door ?
Swain invited Lomax in for a face - to - face meeting and asked what he had in mind .
Lomax told him he'd be thrilled to call plays and be the offensive coordinator , and Swain took him up on it .
Now all they had to do was find a quarterback .
Right away , Swain warned Lomax he was in for a culture shock .
Lomax 's sons Nick and Jack had been star quarterbacks for local prep power Lake Oswego .
They had earned scholarships to Boise State and Oregon State , respectively .
They had lifted weights year - round , watched film and competed in seven - on - seven passing leagues .
They ate and breathed football .
Roosevelt kids were just happy to have something to eat , period .
Few of these kids knew football .
They did n't play " Madden . "
When they went 0 - 9 the previous year , they slammed their helmets , pointed fingers , cursed the refs and griped at their coach .
Most of them did n't have fathers at home to set them straight .
Swain guaranteed Lomax that these kids would break his heart , that he would design some elaborate game plan and they would forget the plays .
He told Lomax that he had better not be coming in to win nine games , that his goal should be to help these boys become men .
One win , he told him , would be gravy .
At the first summer workout in July , eight players showed up .
Lomax was upset , but Swain grinned and said , " This is good ! "
Recent Roosevelt teams had never even held summer workouts ; to the head coach , this was progress .
Lomax brought out the footballs , and his initiation came in the form of an early four - on - four drill ( because they did n't have enough to go seven - on - seven ) .
One of the Roosevelt wide receivers ran a hitch pattern , caught the pass and just stood there , obviously pleased with himself .
" Do n't you think you ought to turn upfield ? " Lomax asked .
" Oh , yeah , " the player said .
When the official preseason practices began , the roster ballooned to about 40 , including the junior varsity , and the staff actually had to explain how to put a uniform on .
" Most of these kids had no football IQ , " Swain said .
" I 've got kids asking me if thigh pads are knee pads or knee pads are thigh pads .
They 'd ask where the butt pad goes .
I 'd say , ' Uh , by the butt . ' "
Tom Hauck for ESPN.com Swain , right , had told Lomax to be prepared for a culture shock .
Lomax 's comment to Swain : " The football players left here 15 years ago . "
But that did n't mean he was n't staying positive .
" My job is to coach 'em up and love 'em up , " Lomax said , and as Roosevelt headed into its season opener against Benson Tech , the staff began to settle on a lineup .
The quarterback would be a two - headed monster : Spires running the Wildcat and junior Josh McCloud shot - putting an occasional pass .
McCloud was n't big on form or spirals , but the hope was that Spires would carry 20 times and shoulder most of the load .
Casey and Perry would be the receivers along with the basketball player , Javon Johnson , and the behemoth Tillman would be both left tackle and noseguard .
Elsewhere , Stewart was the center and co-captain , and a 4.0 student named Marlon Mejia was the other captain and tight end .
The team even had a transfer from Dallas , Roman Thompson , although he had n't had enough practices yet to be eligible .
Thompson , a safety / receiver , told the team he'd been sent to live with his great - grandparents in Portland because he had a lethal temper .
He did n't go into detail , but he said he would try to control himself .
When game day arrived Sept. 4 , Swain was privately optimistic .
He had warned Lomax not to expect victories , but now his competitiveness was surfacing .
His staff had held structured practices and walk - throughs .
The plays had been carefully scripted .
They watched film and studied tendencies .
They tried to conduct themselves like Lake Oswego .
Swain believed they could conceivably win .
Then , three hours before kickoff , everything blew up .
Sitting in his office , Swain was handed a pair of transcripts : Spires and Casey had flunked off the team .
The bus was almost ready to leave , and now he had to tell his two best players to take off their pads .
He felt ill .
Both kids attended the alternative school L.E.P. , which is why their grades from the previous semester had slipped through the cracks .
Part of him wanted to play them anyway .
They went to a different school ; no one would 've known .
But he knew that would 've been unconscionable , so he rushed the transcripts to his AD , McFarland .
He then walked away alone and punched a locker .
All of a sudden , his offense belonged to McCloud and a 5 - 3½ , 150 - pound junior tailback , Jerome Smith .
It did n't look promising , and Roosevelt trailed 23 - 0 by halftime .
Benson had gone to a no-huddle offense , and because Swain had only 15 legitimate varsity players , his team was quickly gassed .
The players could n't keep up .
In the press box , Lomax had been shouting , " We 're not lined up right !
What are we thinking ? ! "
And it got worse .
In the second half , the players quit trying .
The holes were gaping .
Benson would score , and Roosevelt 's players would refuse to get into three - point stances for the extra point .
The final score was 59 - 0 , and all Swain could say afterward by way of encouragement was , " I love you unconditionally , and it does n't matter if you win or lose . "
He wondered what he 'd gotten himself into .
And as he was walking toward the bus , he could n't help noticing a tiny toddler scurrying up to Smith , his new 16 - year - old starting tailback .
" Daddy ! " the little girl said .
" Good game , Daddy . "
The kid tailback and his kid
The first day of school was the next Tuesday , and Jerome Smith brought his 22 - month - old daughter and sidekick , Anajah , with him .
He pushed her through the front door in a stroller , carrying his backpack full of pens , notebooks and diapers .
He then walked her to the school 's child care center , kissed her on the cheek and said he'd see her after football .
Somehow , 59 - 0 did n't feel as ghastly now , not after Swain witnessed that .
Not only had Smith become a father at 14 but he was raising the baby and fighting for full custody .
The first five months of her life , Anajah had lived with Smith 's 15 - year - old girlfriend and her parents .
But when police were called to the girlfriend 's home after an alleged domestic incident , they seized Anajah .
According to Smith 's grandmother , Roberta Robinson , the cops found the baby famished and unresponsive and recommended she go to foster care .
Three days later , Robinson was granted temporary custody , and she and Smith went to retrieve her .
The baby looked gaunt and was crying hysterically .
But the minute she laid eyes on Smith , Anajah sighed and calmed down .
Tom Hauck for ESPN.com Tailback Jerome Smith ran hard for Roosevelt .
Robinson had been down this road before .
She 'd been a mom at 15 herself , and her daughter had been a mom at 15 , too .
This could be done , she thought .
She told Smith , " This is your baby .
This is your job .
You got her . "
She was putting her grandson in complete charge .
Smith took it seriously .
His father had died of cancer when he was 12 , so he had money from Social Security checks .
And he poured almost every bit of that cash into Anajah .
He bought her clothes , diapers and toys .
He took her to doctor 's appointments .
He helped with the rent .
He loved designer clothes , but now was not the time to spend money on himself .
He applied for emancipated minor status , hoping a judge would grant him the rights of an 18 - year - old .
From there , he could go to court and ask for custody of Anajah .
That was his dream .
At the first practice that week , Swain put his arm around his tailback .
Smith had run hard in the 59 - 0 loss , and although there were still some sullen faces on the field , Swain noticed how joyful his tailback was .
" I feel like football 's his chance to be a kid for a couple hours a day , " Swain said .
" And you can see it when he 's out there .
The weight 's off his shoulders , and he can just be silly and laugh and joke .
In the halls at school , he 's always got this serious , stressed - out look on his face .
But you really see him light up when he's at football practice . "
For Swain and Lomax , it was a much - needed reality check .
Game scores were obviously secondary .
Lomax had a 15 - year - old son himself : Mitch , a budding tight end / linebacker at Lake Oswego .
Could he imagine Mitch , in high school , raising a baby daughter ?
Never .
So the edge was definitely off 59-0 .
Before the second game against Woodburn , Swain addressed the team 's attitude .
He knew last year 's team had pointed fingers , and that was the lone positive from the 59 - 0 debacle :
There had n't been infighting .
He told the players his only gripe was that they had quit in the second half , and he would n't put up with that .
Losing was fine as long as they gave him 48 hard minutes .
So that became their mantra going into Week 2 : " Give Us 48 . "
Too bad the bus driver was about 48 minutes late .
The team ended up hitting rush - hour traffic , arrived at Woodburn behind schedule and was out of sync from the opening kickoff .
The Roughriders gained three first downs and were throttled 47 - 0 .
" They kicked our butt , " Swain said .
" I 'm thinking , ' Oh boy , there wo n't be anyone at practice on Monday . '
But then they showed up again . "
Something was bringing the players back , most likely the unyielding support from the community .
Back in the summer , Lomax had sent out a mass e-mail to the members of his church asking whether anyone had experience as an athletic trainer .
He was flummoxed that Roosevelt had no ice machine , no one to wrap an ankle properly and only three water bottles .
There was n't a single medical kit at the school , no gauze or Ace bandages , and he was concerned for the kids ' safety .
The one church member who responded was Rachel Thomas , a former student athletic trainer at USC .
She 'd been on the sideline for the famous " Bush Push " at Notre Dame and , in her time at the school , had gotten to know Troy Polamalu and become the first female trainer for the baseball team .
She was now a fourth - year medical student in Portland , and when she read Lomax 's plea , she gladly volunteered .
Thomas began coming in twice a week , plus game nights , to treat injured players , and it was a good thing because most of the kids did n't have health insurance .
Injuries were mounting , including several concussions , and she helped the players find free clinics .
If they did n't have rides , she would make sure Swain or a staff member drove them , and if the players had lingering muscle injuries , she would ask a friend who was a physical therapist to print out treatment plans .
Her husband , Justin , a Marine who had served in Iraq , became her assistant , and they began rounding up ice from a Roosevelt alumnus who owned a local restaurant .
Rachel taught the players how to stretch their hamstrings , and they enjoyed having her around .
She was their big sister .
Duin , the Oregonian columnist , wrote about much of this , and soon , retired 78 - year - old orthopedist Thad Stanford , who had lettered at Michigan 1951 - 53 , was volunteering to be team doctor .
Good Samaritans were everywhere .
A local videographer , John Percich , had showed up during the summer to do film work and help coach the offensive line .
Mike Funderburg , a retired head coach from the area , joined the staff as defensive coordinator .
A local Sports Authority store donated water bottles .
A group of moms from Sunset High School in Beaverton cooked hot dinners for the team every Wednesday .
" Trust me , no one ever missed practice Wednesdays , " Lomax said , cackling .
Behind the scenes , Lomax was doing even more .
He had gotten Nike -- which had dozens of employees at SouthLake -- to donate 70 pairs of cleats and several crates of gloves .
Many of the other 5A high schools , such as Madison , Cleveland and Jefferson , had similar issues , so Lomax sent cleats to Madison and gloves to the other places .
He told no one about it ; he was n't in it for publicity .
He also spoke to Nike about Roosevelt 's stadium aspirations .
The school 's development manager , Rich Recker , had drawn up a business plan to install FieldTurf , bleachers , a track and tennis courts -- a $ 2 million project .
The school district likely would be willing to help finance it if Recker could raise enough private funds , and Lomax began using his connections .
So the least the Roosevelt players could do was stick out the season .
But when they took the field for their home opener against Liberty High School , reality hit .
Only about 50 people were watching .
Most of them were fans of the other team , and Lomax could n't believe the press box was three chairs and a table on top of a brick shed .
He had to climb a shaky ladder to get up there and ended up witnessing a 34 - 0 loss .
The team had now been outscored 140 - 0 in three games , although , on the plus side , there was still no dissension .
In fact , Jerome Smith seemed particularly upbeat as he left the field .
A group of moms had handed him a bag of clothes for Anajah .
Tom Hauck for ESPN.com Smith , with daughter Anajah , embraces fatherhood .
Keeping it simple
The following Sunday evening , Swain and his staff huddled in the film room .
It actually was the shower room , but the players would never shower at school .
So the coaches turned it into a theater .
The more they studied the losses , the more they shook their heads .
Players were going the wrong way , blocking the wrong men , using the wrong techniques .
Big Junvonte Tillman was particularly lost .
On running plays , he would pass block , and on pass plays , he would run block .
Lomax and Swain came up with a plan .
For their next game against Parkrose , they would give him a wristband with instructions on it .
They would number the plays 1 - 20 , and if play No. 13 was " near right , zip , fake blast , pass , Z clear , " they would simply write the following on Tillman 's wristband :
13 . Pass block .
Right away , they sensed that it uncluttered his mind .
And , on game day , they particularly noticed how bubbly Tillman was .
Someone asked why he seemed so fired up , and Tillman said his dad , who did n't live with him and had never seen him play , was coming to the game .
" If I could 've done a backflip , I would 've done one , " Tillman said later .
From the opening kickoff , Tillman was throwing people around .
Lomax ran the offense straight through him , and in the first quarter , McCloud swept 6 yards for Roosevelt 's first touchdown of the season .
Swain will never forget the look on Lomax 's face because the ol ' quarterback 's eyes welled up .
" I 'm not gonna lie -- I was excited , " Lomax said .
" I said , ' Let 's keep doing this . ' "
On defense , Tillman was even more of a force , a Reggie White .
Parkrose could n't block him , and in the first quarter and two - thirds , he had five sacks , eight tackles for losses and one recovered fumble .
He kept looking for his dad in the stands .
Beth Nakamura / The Oregonian Junvonte Tillman is carried off the field after breaking his ankle .
Eventually , Parkrose managed to jump ahead 7 - 6 , but Perry , the transfer from Seattle , ran the ensuing kickoff back for a touchdown .
Roosevelt 's lead was 12 - 7 , and it was clear Parkrose was flustered by Tillman .
Lomax said he could hear the opposing coach screaming to his left guard , " You 've got to stop this guy .
Hold him , cut him , do whatever you can . "
Finally , late in the first half , the Parkrose guard dove at Tillman 's leg from an awkward angle .
Tillman felt a horrible pop and was yelling " They broke my ankle " before Rachel could even get to him .
She did n't have a splint , so she rolled paper bags and stray newspapers to stabilize his leg .
He wept as they carried him off , and before leaving for the hospital , he rounded up his his teammates and said , " This is my last year .
They done broke my ankle .
I want you to do this for me .
Beat them , please . "
It was an emotional halftime , and when the third quarter began , Roosevelt 's defense forced a fourth - and - 12 .
But Parkrose went for it , and a pop pass to their tight end turned into a long touchdown .
Now Roosevelt trailed 13 - 12 , and without Tillman , the offensive line was a wreck .
" We stuck a kid in there who'd just gotten his pads last week , " Lomax said .
" We 're getting killed .
We can't run it ; guys are dropping balls .
It 's chaos . "
By the fourth quarter , it was 19 - 12 Parkrose .
The three players Swain and Lomax had intended to build the team around -- Spires , Casey and Tillman -- were history , and basically all they had left was the kid from Seattle .
Swain hoped
Perry might break a long run , and if they could score , the coach planned to go for two and the win .
But on their next drive , McCloud threw a ball 10 yards behind Perry .
It was intercepted and returned for a touchdown .
Lomax groaned and said , " How could he do that ? "
But he calmed himself and told McCloud , " Do n't worry , I 've done it , too . "
ROOSEVELT SCORES , LOSES TILLMAN
Click here to watch a video from OregonLive.com , as the Roosevelt Roughriders play hard , but lose a top player to an injury .
The final was 26 - 12 , and Swain 's postgame chat focused mostly on Tillman .
He told them that the kid had played the game of his life , that his lightbulb had finally come on .
He then said every young man on the team had his own lightbulb to turn on and that it could happen in practice or in a game or in school .
He said , " We 're going to play this season for Junvonte Tillman .
Because that lightbulb went off , did n't it ?
For a half , he lit this place up .
And boy , I see some other guys whose lightbulbs are flickering , man .
And when they all go off , we 're going to light this place up . "
Problem was , no one else 's lightbulb weighed 280 pounds .
The 300 - pound great - grandma 's boy
On second thought , there was a 300 - pounder on the roster , assuming they could get him to practice .
His name was Ray Brown , and every afternoon , the coaches would peer at the side of road , wondering when he would make his grand entrance .
Usually , about 20 minutes into the team 's drills , they 'd see a car race up , driven by an elderly woman .
And out would walk their biggest player , late once again .
" You can always tell they 've fought a battle to get him here , " Swain said .
Beth Nakamura / The Oregonian Ray Brown waits for his great - grandmother , June Terry , to pick him up after school .
During the summer , Brown 's 84 - year - old great - grandmother , June Terry , had asked the coach to mentor the kid because he had seven sisters , no brothers , no male role model and a tendency to follow the wrong crowd .
Swain invited him to their offseason conditioning program , but because Brown attended one of the alternative schools , Open Meadow , Swain could n't always keep track of him .
Then , in July , he heard some troubling news : Brown had been shot .
He 'd been hanging out on a corner near his house and was the victim of a drive - by .
Wrong place , wrong time .
Doctors told him that he'd been hit in his collarbone and that the shell was too deep to remove .
In other words , he would have to play football with a bullet in his back .
Once the season began , it became Terry 's mission to keep her grandson off the streets .
Hell or high water , she was going to deliver him to Swain , anywhere from 20 minutes to 90 minutes late .
Eventually , every afternoon , Brown would trudge onto the field and try to fill Tillman 's shoes at nose tackle .
" If Grandma does n't come to practice to check on him , he 'll leave sometimes , " Lomax said .
" There 's been several times where all of a sudden we 're saying , ' Where 's Ray Brown ? '
And Christian 's going , ' Grandma will be pissed if she finds out . '
Then all of a sudden , this car comes pulling up and we 're all going , ' OK , Grandma must 've found where Ray - Ray was . ' "
The coaches could chuckle about it because they liked the kid .
Brown , a sophomore , had an easy smile and quick wit and was a big fan of Swain .
But at the same time , they were worried about the message this was sending .
In almost any other football program , a chronically late player would not be tolerated .
Anyplace else , Ray Brown would have been given the boot .
But it was n't just Brown .
At various times , eight or nine players were skipping practice .
Johnson had a set of young twins in his family , and his mother often needed him to baby - sit during practice .
Smith would miss time to attend parent meetings for Anajah or to take her to the doctor .
Other players were in academic danger and had work to make up .
Some of these were legitimate excuses , but it was all undermining the team .
They 'd practice sometimes with as few as 19 varsity players , and it had Lomax saying , " We should 've cut half these guys and told the other half they should n't be playing . "
Lomax felt the players were treating football " like it 's a club , like the glee club or choir . "
He doubted they watched games in their spare time -- " You mention [ USC quarterback ]
Matt Barkley , and they 'll go , ' You mean Charles Barkley , the basketball player ? ' " -- and it showed on the field .
The mental errors every week were killing them .
Roosevelt had a bye week after the Parkrose game , and the coaches held a meeting to discuss the issue .
One of them suggested they cancel the season , just shut the program down , to send a message that there are no shortcuts in life .
The publicity would be huge ; the headlines would scream : Coaches choose life lessons over football .
But Swain considered that the easy way out .
He could n't live with himself if he sent Ray Brown back to the streets .
Of if Jerome Smith did n't have his two - hour escape .
No , he definitely was n't going to shut the team down .
Instead , his new rule was if you were going to miss practice , you had to at least call first .
And if you missed three times without calling , you were off the team .
But he could n't in good conscience pull the plug completely .
Football was survival to some of these kids .
Maybe he did n't have a ton of players who loved the game , but he had a few .
And one of them happened to be crying himself to sleep .
Death of an inspiration
Javontae Perry played football for one person -- and that person lay dying in a Seattle hospital .
Since his arrival at Roosevelt , Perry had amazed Lomax and Swain with his work ethic and grit .
He never missed practice .
His ankle was sprained and swollen , but he never used it as an excuse .
If anyone had reason to quit , it was this kid .
His mom , Tanya , was jobless .
His 4 - year - old brother , Jakai , had a brain injury .
Their apartment had no furniture , and he slept on a mattress on the floor .
But he'd been taught not to complain , taught by the man who was dying .
Tom Hauck for ESPN.com Javontae Perry 's grandfather taught him to never quit .
The man on the respirator was Wilson Perry Jr. , Javontae 's grandfather , and Wilson Perry was always full of advice .
When Javontae was in fourth grade , he was the smallest kid on his football team and sensed the other players did n't respect him .
One day , while the whole team was running wind sprints , another kid clotheslined Javontae for no reason .
He decided to quit -- until Wilson gave him a talking - to .
His grandfather told Javontae that he loved football more than anything in the world , and that when he was young , his parents would n't let him play on a team .
He said he would 've given anything to play on a real field , with lines and referees and goalposts , and he did n't want Javontae to miss out .
He told him Perrys were n't quitters , and from that day on , Javontae was a football player for life .
Throughout the years , the sport could be cruel to Javontae .
His prep team at Tyee High School was a perennial loser , winning a high of two games his sophomore year .
But his junior year was the worst .
Late in the season against Renton , a Tyee defensive end decked the Renton quarterback , starting a brawl .
The benches cleared , and 20 Tyee players received two - game suspensions .
The problem was there were still two games left , and Tyee had only six eligible players , Javontae being one of them .
He wanted to play six - on - 11 , but instead , the team was forced to forfeit the rest of its season .
The kid had gotten to see life without football after all .
And , as Wilson had suspected he would , Javontae despised it .
He and his family left Seattle that summer for Portland , and after the Parkrose game , Javontae heard that his grandfather was in a coma back home .
It devastated him , but he never let Swain or his teammates know .
Instead , as their best player , he tried carrying them to a win over Jefferson in their 5A league opener .
But Jefferson was ranked seventh in the state and showed no mercy .
Jefferson put up 41 points in the second quarter alone and led 54 - 0 at halftime .
On one play , a pass bounced off Perry 's hands and was intercepted and returned for a touchdown .
Perry could n't help it ; his mind was in Seattle .
The next Thursday , a day before the Roughriders '
Week 6 game against Madison , Tanya drove her son to see Wilson Perry one last time .
The kid said his goodbyes that night as his hero was taken off the respirator .
If he wanted to play the next evening , he needed to get back for a full day of school Friday -- a league rule -- so Tanya got up at 4 that morning to drive him to Roosevelt .
She knew Wilson would n't want Javontae to miss a game , especially on his account .
That Friday night against Madison , Josh McCloud scored on a keeper to give Roosevelt an early 6 - 0 lead .
Madison jumped back ahead 7 - 6 , but Perry returned the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown and a 12 - 7 lead .
( The team had n't converted an extra point all year . )
Madison then embarked on a 17 - play drive , cruelly scoring with three seconds left in the half .
Perry had been all over the field and barely missed a touchdown - saving tackle .
But the 180 - pounder and the rest of the team were absolutely fatigued now .
Nine of the 11 starters played both ways , and players such as Ray Brown were n't fit enough to hold up .
In the second half , the game turned into a 51 - 26 blowout .
The week before , Roosevelt had been torched by 6 - foot - 7 Jefferson quarterback Elisnoa Aluesi , a former Roosevelt Pop Warner kid .
And against Madison , a receiver named LJ Sly - Cain , another former Roosevelt Pop Warner kid , scored on a long punt return and slant pattern .
" I have 50 studs at other schools right now , " a wistful Swain said .
" Put these guys with Javontae , and we'd be in the playoffs . "
There was good news , though : 0 - 6 Cleveland High School was next on the schedule .
The bad news was that Swain 's entire team was starting to cough .
An epic battle between 0 - 6 teams
The swine flu had arrived , and fast .
The Monday before the Cleveland game , only 10 varsity players showed up for practice , and the worst news was that the quarterback , McCloud , was home in bed with body aches , nausea and a raging fever .
Swain canceled the workout , held a short film session and called McCloud 's father for an update .
" I 'm not sure he 'll be back for the game , " Swain was told .
The only backup was a scrawny 10th - grader , Juan Montoya , who could throw a tight spiral but had little ability to take a hit .
It was all moot anyway , because by Wednesday morning , Montoya had a 101.8 fever himself and was sent home from school .
Suddenly , the team had gone from two quarterbacks to none , and other bodies were going down left and right .
On Tuesday , center Nolan Stewart 's temperature reached 103 , and receiver Javon Johnson was bedridden , too .
And somebody else was about ready to join them : the coach .
Tom Hauck for ESPN.com
A group of moms provided dinner for the team on Wednesdays .
Swain was already exhausted from a long season of 80 - hour weeks .
His job as a school monitor was draining enough , but even after school , he'd be summoned from football practice to mediate campus fights or drive home a kid who'd had a knife pulled on him .
Throw in his football duties , and his day was endless .
He did all the team 's laundry himself , and , because the school 's dryers had no heat , it could take an entire week for the uniforms to dry .
He 'd change sprinkler heads on the field , too .
Even on Saturdays -- at the expense of his wife and three children -- he'd be at the school from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. , showing his face at all the Pop Warner games .
His coaching stipend for this was $ 5,500 , and his yearly salary was $ 30,000 altogether -- plus , he had a family to support .
Some nights , he would drive players home all over town , in his windowless Taurus .
And although the players adored him for it ( and busted his chops for having a run- down car ) , it was all taking a toll .
By the week of the Cleveland game , Swain looked pale and emaciated , and left practice early Thursday to sleep .
" Otherwise , I might not make it to Friday 's game , " he said .
In his absence , Lomax conducted the practice , and the ol ' quarterback was at the top of his game .
He decided Perry would play quarterback exclusively in a Wildcat offense .
He drew up a series of eight plays to be run from varying formations , and the hope was that Perry could will them to a victory .
" We 're going to run this sucker down their throat with the guys we got , " Lomax told the team late Thursday afternoon .
" We got eight plays , and we 're going to run the snot out of those eight plays .
They 're going to figure out right away we do n't throw the ball , and we do n't care . "
By game day , Lomax 's pep talk seemed to have resonated , because one of Roosevelt 's players went into an Oregonian chat room predicting a 45 - 0 rout .
Too bad the rest of the school did n't have the team 's back .
That Friday afternoon , just like every Friday , there was no buzz about the game , no signs in the hallways screaming , " Go Roughriders ! "
There would n't be any cheerleaders until basketball season , and to be fair , there were n't any fans for them to lead cheers for anyway .
Home attendance was generally a few sets of parents , and the student body was mostly hostile to the team .
Swain called many of these students " snipers , " kids who would see football players in the hallways and say , " You suck . "
Normally , 10 to 20 students would attend the home games -- hanging out on the track because there were no bleachers -- and do n't even mention away games .
The contest against Cleveland , for instance , was being played on the road , 25 minutes from campus , and by kickoff , exactly three Roosevelt students had showed up to watch : two girls and a guy .
" Well , Javontae invited us to come , " the girls said .
Perry had every reason to want an audience ; he 'd never played quarterback before .
But to win , he was going to need help from his healthy teammates , Jerome Smith and Roman Thompson , the Texas kid with the temper .
Thompson , a safety , was the Roughriders ' hardest hitter on defense and actually had more size and speed than Perry .
He simply needed to be more coachable and disciplined .
When Swain -- up to his ears in Advil -- called the team together before kickoff , he counted heads .
Stewart , the starting center and kicker , was back , and so were the receiver Johnson and the backup quarterback Montoya .
But McCloud was still in bed , and Swain told the group it would rally around Perry and " make lemonade out of lemons . "
He warned , " This other team is n't going to just roll over because they 're 0 - 6 .
We 're 0 - 6 , too .
The team that makes the most mistakes is going to lose . "
Yes , Coach , the players shouted .
Tom Hauck for ESPN.com
The coaches turned the showers into their film room .
The opening kickoff set the tone .
Stewart , a straight - toed kicker who strangely would approach the ball soccer - style , angled an onside pooch kick , and Roosevelt recovered .
A couple of minutes later , Smith took an inside handoff 11 yards for a score , his first high school touchdown .
Too bad Anajah had n't made the trip .
Leading 6 - 0 , Stewart pooch - kicked again , only this time Cleveland recovered .
Then , on Cleveland 's first play from scrimmage , there was a horrible sound : Perry screaming in pain .
He had reinjured his ankle and needed to be carried off the field .
As Montoya began to loosen up , Rachel retaped Perry 's foot .
His mother , Tanya -- who was already shouting " Let 's go , defense ! " on the sideline -- was n't worried : " He does n't quit , did I tell you that ? "
When Perry returned six plays later , the defense had Cleveland in a fourth - and - 13 hole at the 24 .
But the Warriors completed a high lob for a touchdown over 5 - 3 Smith .
The two - point conversion made it 8 - 6 .
The rest of the half was a slugfest .
Ray Brown used his 300 pounds to stuff a fourth - and - 1 Cleveland dive play -- with Great - Grandmother hovering near the bench --- but Perry could n't move the chains , either .
His O - line was having trouble with false starts ; again , just a lack of practice time and discipline .
Eventually , Cleveland broke through on a 40 - yard pass to the 3 - yard line .
The receiver made a tumbling circus catch that in the NFL would 've been the subject of a long review .
But there was no replay booth at Cleveland High , and the subsequent touchdown made it 14 - 6 Cleveland at halftime .
In the locker room , Swain and Lomax were encouraged .
They could actually win !
Cleveland 's scores had been the result of a fourth - down chuck and a questionable catch .
Brown 's big body was coming in handy .
Swain told the team , " We 're in a dogfight , and I would n't have it any other way .
Nobody 's ever handed us anything .
Nobody 's ever given us anything in life .
To go out and get our first win , you 're going to have to scrap for it .
It 's going to come down to who 's tougher : you or them .
Who wants it more ? "
We do !
All season long , these kids had faded in the second half .
And with nine of them going both ways and seven of them coming off the flu , it was reasonable to expect a flop .
Right away , they recovered Cleveland 's onside kick to start the half , and on a third - and - 13 , Smith got stuck at the line of scrimmage .
But a Cleveland player taunted him , and the refs threw a flag for unsportsmanlike conduct .
For once , it was somebody else coming unglued .
During a timeout , Lomax pulled a fast one : He asked Perry to throw .
It was n't one of the eight plays on his wristband , but the call suckered the Cleveland defense , and Perry rolled right and hit Thompson for a 20 - yard score .
Down 14 - 12 with 4:29 left in the third , Swain decided to go for two .
Perry hurtled in to tie the score at 14 , but there was a flag on the ground : illegal motion .
Another sloppy mistake .
Lomax sent Montoya in to throw a fade pattern , but the kid got smothered .
Roosevelt still trailed by two .
Cleveland took over and started running straight at Brown .
At one point , Brown was called for a neutral zone infraction , and one of the coaches shouted , " Get Ray off the field . "
Swain had a calm chat with the kid , but before long , Cleveland had a second - and - goal at the 2 .
The Roosevelt bench began chanting , " Dee - fense , " which is exactly what it got .
On an inside handoff , the Cleveland fullback fumbled .
Roosevelt recovered on its own 3 as the third quarter ended .
The Roughriders had n't forced a game - changing turnover like that all season , and when the fourth quarter opened , Lomax got another idea : throw from the end zone .
He called Pick - 22 , a play in which a receiver picks the linebacker , freeing up another receiver in the flat .
It 's predicated on the defense 's applying man coverage , and when Perry sent a man in motion and saw a defender following him , he knew it was the perfect call .
He got so excited , he took a premature peek into the flat .
But when Stewart snapped the ball , Perry still was n't looking .
The football hit him in the face mask .
Tom Hauck for ESPN.com
No matter the outcome , parents encouraged their sons .
Here , Javontae Perry 's mother , Tanya , lends her support .
Perry recovered the loose ball in the end zone : a safety .
Roosevelt was down 16 - 12 with 11:53 left , and it needed a stop .
Cleveland tried running up the gut again , and this time , Thompson came in from his safety spot to make a sturdy tackle .
He screamed , " Let 's go ! "
In response , he says , he heard a Cleveland player say , " Shut up , n-----. "
All Thompson felt in his head was rage .
In Texas , he says , he would lose his temper " if someone looked at me wrong I could n't control my anger for nothing . "
Down there , he 'd gotten into all - out brawls over words much tamer than that and had even been stabbed in the hand .
His own mother had banished him to Portland because of all the fights , unconvinced he could ever change .
And now here was some anonymous Cleveland kid calling him the N - word .
Thompson stomped his feet and stewed , but he did n't smack anyone or kick anyone or get himself a 15 - yard penalty .
" Normally , I would 've grabbed his face mask and done who knows what , " he said .
Instead , the referee walked him over to Swain , who heard what happened and put his arm around him .
One play later , Thompson was back on the field helping the defense get the ball back with 4:02 remaining .
Roosevelt needed a touchdown to win , and on first down , from his own 25 , Perry broke free down the left sideline .
Soon , he was across the 50 with only two defenders to beat .
Swain was hightailing it down the sideline with him .
But Perry 's ankle was tender , and when he stutter - stepped and cut back , he stumbled .
The run went for 55 yards to the Cleveland 20 , but somehow , it felt like a missed opportunity .
On the very next play , a lineman was penalized for a false start .
Now , it was first - and - 15 from the 25 , and the bench seemed stressed .
Smith gained 7 yards , but Perry got smothered twice in a row in the backfield .
On fourth - and - 10 , Lomax sent Montoya in to throw a fade route to Johnson .
It 's the play Swain had sold Johnson on four months before :
Post up a 5 - 7 defender and outrebound him for the touchdown .
But both Johnson and Montoya still were weak from the flu , and the fluttering pass was intercepted .
The final score was 16 - 12 .
Afterward , Swain called the team together .
" These hurt the worst , men .
You battled .
Heck , I almost beat Javontae Perry down the field on the last run .
We made some mental errors that killed us .
We had a false start on that last drive .
That 'll cost you in close games .
But does it mean I do n't love you ? "
No , Coach !
" I love you unconditionally .
And I got to tell you , Roman Thompson moved here from Texas because he got in trouble , could n't control his temper .
And , tonight , he had a kid call him the N - word , and he needed to come out for a play .
He was pretty hot .
But you know what ?
After the game , he shook the other team 's hands and did it with class .
That 's a lightbulb going on .
Another lightbulb .
Roman , you 're going to be a better man because you 've learned to do that .
I 'm proud of you , son . "
The ride home on the bus was somber .
This had been a winnable game , and next week 's contest against 6A power Lincoln definitely would not be .
The best chance for a victory was going to be the Roughriders ' season finale , their homecoming game against winless Marshall .
That 's the night Swain badly wanted to put on a show .
Especially when he heard there were going to be bleachers .
Tom Hauck for ESPN.com
Private fundraising helped with the construction of new bleachers .
A real stadium
Money had been pouring in .
Between the church and the articles in The Oregonian and Roosevelt alumni such as local District Attorney Mike Schrunk , the stadium project had gained sufficient steam .
People went door - to - door asking for donations .
One family gave what it could afford -- $ 5.44 -- and a city philanthropist pitched in 20 large .
All this private fundraising enabled the school to pay for new bleachers , and the week before homecoming , Roosevelt 's decrepit football field finally moved into the 21st century .
It had permanent seats .
The next step was to fill them , and that was a job for SouthLake .
The same people who had packed the Roosevelt gym for the girls ' basketball team were planning to rock the Roosevelt football stadium for the season finale against Marshall .
They would organize a bonfire , have a free barbecue and give out 3,000 free double - quilted Roosevelt sweatshirts .
They would fill every seat and invite the entire student body .
The idea was to help save a high school and to make 25 battered football players feel relevant .
Motoya Nakamura / The Oregonian Lomax shares some thoughts with McCloud .
After the Cleveland loss , Swain was concerned about some of his guys .
Perry had to return to Seattle for his grandfather 's funeral , and Thompson had a hamstring problem that had turned chronic .
McCloud was still fighting the flu , and it seemed as if Brown was catching it , too .
So the game at Lincoln became more about surviving than winning .
Perry and his mom did n't return from Seattle until the morning of the contest , and , although the kid was an emotional wreck , he gained 118 yards on 11 carries in the 49 - 6 loss .
When the team bus pulled into the Roosevelt parking lot afterward , Swain saw Perry 's mother slumped over , exhausted .
She asked the coach whether he would drive her son home , and Swain asked , " Do you want me to get him something to eat , too ? "
She answered , " That 'd be great . "
These were the moments , Swain thought , that made coaching worthwhile , and he stopped at a Taco Bell to buy dinner for the whole Perry family .
His best player was also probably his best kid , and he badly wanted to rescue him .
Perry 's mom had been tirelessly searching for a nursing assistant 's job , but nobody was hiring .
So every weekend , Perry would rake leaves for money and give half to her .
" She can't buy me nothing , so I do n't ask her for nothing , " Perry said .
Earlier in the season , Swain had arranged for Perry to be part of the local Shop with a Cop program , meaning he would go to a Fred Meyer superstore with $ 150 to spend .
The kid bought towels and clothes for his mother , sister and brother -- nothing for himself .
He wore borrowed shirts and year - old shoes .
At school , he was barely getting by with a 2.1 grade - point average , but it was n't from a lack of effort .
He met with teachers in his free time and was studying an SAT prep book for an hour a day .
Swain was convinced Perry could play cornerback in college and was trying to persuade Portland State or Pacific University to evaluate his film .
And if he could also get one victory for the kid , in the season finale , that would be icing on the cake .
Swain did n't think the idea of a win was far - fetched .
He told the staff that if the team could start the season over knowing what it knew now -- for instance , how to line up -- it might have two wins by now .
But the key was getting the entire roster to practice , which was a pipe dream .
Thompson 's hamstring kept him out of Monday 's session , and McCloud had missed so many days of school that he had to stay after the bell making up work .
Three offensive linemen were also in academic jeopardy and missed the Tuesday workout .
Smith needed to finish a U.S. history project and was out , too .
JV kids had to fill in the gaps .
But by Thursday , the day before the game , a sound in the hallways piqued the players ' interest .
Students from a music class were marching through the school pounding snare drums , the first hint of a special 48 hours .
The players were summoned to the gym , where they saw something they 'd never seen before : a pep rally .
There were cheerleaders high - kicking and students clapping in unison , and when the football team emerged , Nolan Stewart , the co-captain and arguably the most popular kid in the school , grabbed a microphone :
" Hey , come out and support us tomorrow night , " he said .
" It 's our last game , and we plan on getting a big win against Marshall ! "
The whole team then took center stage , rocking back and forth , chanting , " We ready .
We ready .
We ready . "
It was almost as if they had done this before .
Tom Hauck for ESPN.com
By season 's end , Roosevelt had a solid group of supporters .
Meanwhile , in the coaching office , Lomax was digging into his bag of tricks .
All season , he had scaled back his playbook , tossing out about four or five plays a week .
He had gone from about 40 plays to 11 .
But this week , he was adding plays .
He called the Marshall game " our ' Hoosiers ' moment our playoff game , " and he found himself diagramming throwback passes to Perry , sprint rollouts for Perry -- anything to get the ball into the kid 's hands .
" He 's the best player we got , and he 's going to have 35 carries , " Lomax said .
He was planning to have Perry throw it , too .
He drew up a pass play in which Perry would dash right , then throw a seam route across the field to tight end Mejia , who had been a decoy all season .
Lomax figured that if all else failed , that one would be a sure touchdown -- assuming Mejia could catch it .
All week , Lomax could n't wait to do a dress rehearsal , but even at Thursday 's walk - through , players were missing .
Johnson had to baby - sit , and Smith was still tied up with his history project .
Lomax figured at the very least he would test the plays in the pregame walk - through .
But when 4:30 Friday afternoon arrived , he and Swain were in a semipanic : Perry and Thompson were absent .
Swain went to find Stewart , who knew everything about everybody , and Stewart told the coach they were both getting their hair cut .
It was homecoming .
There 'd be a dance after the game .
They felt they needed haircuts .
They were just late because of a long line at the barbershop .
Perry 's mom finally dropped them off at 5 , and it was almost pitch - dark when Perry took his place under center to practice the throwback pass .
He could n't see and kept dropping the snap .
They would just have to wing it in the game .
As they headed off the field , two hours before kickoff , the campus was jumping .
The bonfire was under way , a rock band was jamming on the quad and the barbecue smelled delicious .
Normally , about about 10 students would come to their games .
But now five buses from SouthLake were pulling up to the curb .
And that was only the half of it .
Late Thursday night , a squadron of Nike employees had secretly painted and decorated Roosevelt 's locker room .
There were slogans on the walls and decals in the corridor and a poster over the clubhouse door that said " Give Us 48 . "
The stunned players walked in saying , " This looks tight . "
The gang graffiti was gone .
All they had to do now was win .
" I hate to say it , but this is a big , big deal to win this game , " Lomax said , standing in the quad 90 minutes before kickoff .
" I really believe that .
I just think it 's important to kind of go , ' Hey , we made a statement .
Things are going to change here . '
This is our Hollywood ending .
Most people say winning 's not everything , but I 'm going to do everything I can to win the game .
It might be two or three fake punts .
Or if I have to play quarterback myself . "
Tom Hauck for ESPN.com
Swain gives his pregame speech .
One last chance for a " W "
The line to get inside the stadium was 400 deep , and in his pregame speech , Swain alluded to the standing - room - only crowd and said , " They 're here to let you know that other people do care and you are loved . "
As the team exited the locker room , the players all hand - slapped the Give Us 48 sign .
In all , 36 Roosevelt players , including JVs , took the field -- twice as many as the year before .
The seniors were introduced to the crowd , and a Nike vice president , Craig Cheek , announced that his company was making a significant donation , purported to be $ 150,000 , to help finance new turf for next season .
Lomax addressed the crowd , too , exhorting all his SouthLake friends to shout " First doooooooown " every time Roosevelt gained 10 yards .
And standing on the other sideline , looking like dead meat , were 19 players from Marshall .
That 's the part everyone forgot .
There was another team out there just as desperate , just as bare - bones and just as forgotten .
Marshall High School also was located in a lower - income area , southeast Portland , and many of its better athletes also had transferred out .
The school had n't even had enough players to field a JV team that week .
The only difference was that Marshall had mostly white kids .
Other than that , the school was in the same predicament .
Those kids ' school was in danger of closing .
They could 've used SouthLake 's help , too .
All of that was n't lost on Swain as he peered over to the other sideline .
He had started his coaching career in the Marshall area and knew those were good kids over there , from good homes .
Remember the Pietrzyk family he admired so much ?
Remember how they were going to send their son Nick to Marshall , come hell or high water ?
Well , all these years later , Marshall 's best player was Nick 's younger brother , Casey .
He 'd already accounted for more than 1,500 yards of total offense and 15 touchdowns .
Swain knew what no one else seemed to be aware of : Nineteen players or not , winless or not , Marshall was n't going to cave in .
The opening kickoff proved that point .
The Marshall kicker hit a line drive off the thigh of a Roosevelt player , and Marshall recovered .
The Minutemen came out in a double - wing offense , a bunched - up formation full of misdirection handoffs and pitches .
If a defense was weak against the run , it would find itself in trouble against a double wing .
And without Junvonte Tillman , Roosevelt was in trouble .
Tom Hauck for ESPN.com Swain talks with Roman Thompson during the season finale .
On the third play of the game , Pietrzyk carried four Roosevelt players on his back for 9 yards .
A minute later , Marshall wingback Chris Owens scored on an 11 - yard reverse for a 6 - 0 lead .
Lomax knew he needed to get Perry and Thompson , his two swiftest players , out in space , but a week of rain had turned the field into a sloppy mess .
The ball was slick , and later in the first quarter , Perry fumbled away a snap .
Marshall then went ahead 12 - 0 when 245 - pound fullback Abraham Cabatic side - stepped Ray Brown for a 6 - yard score .
Lomax decided to dial up one of his throwback passes .
Perry rolled right and threw crossfield to a wide - open Johnson , but Johnson dropped a possible touchdown .
On the same series , Lomax called another throwback from McCloud to Perry , but Marshall stayed at home this time and creamed Perry for a loss .
Roosevelt punted , and Pietrzyk returned the kick 65 yards for a touchdown .
It was 19- 0 ; SouthLake , the cheerleaders and the band were silent .
Lomax gave up on the gadgets .
He simply asked Thompson to run a go route , and Perry , morphing into an actual quarterback , hit him in stride for a 50 - yard touchdown .
Stewart pooched an onside kick , and Roosevelt recovered .
Lomax smelled blood and called the same go route , and this time , the defender climbed Thompson 's back for pass interference .
A minute later , Perry scored on a 21 - yard dash up the middle .
While the band played , Roosevelt then converted its first extra points of the season on a rollout pass from Perry to Johnson .
The score was suddenly 19 - 14 with 8:09 left in the half .
All the Roughriders needed was a stop , but Pietrzyk zigzagged 58 yards for a touchdown .
It was a dagger .
Finally , Lomax went to his sure thing , the throwback pass to Mejia .
As he suspected , the tight end was 10 yards in the clear , but Mejia lost the ball in the lights .
He looked at Lomax and shrugged .
A few minutes later , Pietrzyk rumbled 67 yards for a touchdown to make the halftime score a devastating 33 - 14 .
Half the crowd went to the bonfire to get warm , but it was hotter in the Roosevelt locker room .
Swain was yelling for the D - line to stay low , but the problem was that he needed to teach the defenders how to stay low , which is why they should 've come to practice .
The coach then calmed down and laid it out for his team : " It does n't matter how many people we bus out here tonight , how many people paint the field , how many people come in and redo your locker room .
They still can't give you a win .
I can't go over there to Marshall and say , ' Hey , just let us win today . '
And I know you do n't want that , anyway .
You do n't want that , do you ? "
No , Coach !
" We 've got to win the second half 21 - 0 .
Period .
If they score , we 've got to win 28 - 7 .
We 've got nothing to lose , guys .
We 're all we got .
These people are out here tonight to make you feel special , and they 're going to love you no matter what the scoreboard says .
But this is n't about that .
It 's about us .
I still think we can do something special tonight .
Matter of fact , I know it .
Because I 'm just crazy like that .
And you guys better get crazy like that in the second half .
Go kick their ass ! "
The team was stirred up , but even with eight men in the box , Roosevelt could n't solve the double wing .
Marshall kept pitching it to Pietrzyk , who dashed 15 yards for his fourth touchdown .
Worse than that , Perry was on the ground -- and not getting up .
Eventually , four teammates had to carry him off the field , his ankle twisted again .
But he asked Rachel to retape it and missed only three plays .
Lomax kept calling the kid 's number , and he ended up scoring on an 8 - yard run to make it 39 - 20 .
As Perry limped off the field , Lomax yelled , " Stud , you 're a stud ! " right to his face .
That was the last pleasant moment .
Smith fumbled , and Pietrzyk later rambled 79 yards for his fifth touchdown and 350th yard .
Ray Brown sprained his knee and had to be carried off .
Javon Johnson injured his shin and did n't return .
Rachel and Doc Stanford were running here and there .
The final was 53 - 20 , officially ending an 0 - 9 season .
Tom Hauck for ESPN.com Nolan Stewart shows his emotions after the loss .
Swain called the team over to one of the end zones .
It started to rain .
He praised the seniors .
He told the underclassmen they needed to get in the weight room .
Roman Thompson raised his hand and thanked everyone for treating him " like I 've been here forever . "
Nolan Stewart started weeping .
Swain then told everyone what Nike was planning .
That next year , they 'd probably be playing on FieldTurf instead of slop .
" But remember , " he said , " you guys were the ones that built this stadium .
You 're the ones that fought it out in the mud . "
He told them they had lost nine battles but won a war .
He looked around at his core players .
For the most part , their lightbulbs had flickered on .
Smith had begun making plans to get his own apartment for just him and Anajah .
Javon Johnson 's teachers told Swain he had made more progress in one year than any student they could remember .
Junvonte Tillman and Nolan Stewart were hoping to play football at Swain 's old school , Shasta College in Redding , Calif .
Mejia was planning to study engineering at Oregon State .
Thompson , now an A student , was going back to Texas to show his mom he had wised up .
Ray Brown was giving church a try and playing pickup basketball to firm up his body .
Perry was looking to take some night classes for extra credit .
Even the ol ' NFL quarterback Neil Lomax was a new man .
He said he had learned to " ignore the scoreboard " for the first time in his life , but more than that , Lomax had become one of them .
The week before the Marshall game , Brown had contracted the flu and vomited all over the locker room floor after practice .
And when Swain walked in later that evening , after all the players had left , he found Lomax , on his hands and knees , cleaning up the vomit with a towel .
" Neil was talking about , ' Ah , man , poor Ray , he 's feeling bad .
I told him to drink some water , we 're all in this together , ' " Swain remembers .
" You tell me how many NFL quarterbacks would be there cleaning up puke in the locker room at 8 o'clock at night at Roosevelt High School .
He 's a special , special person . "
All of this had made Swain thankful , and he did n't want to leave the locker room .
While he was milling around , he bumped into a seventh - grader , Kimane Bomena , arguably the best middle school quarterback in the city .
Bomena was another Roosevelt Pop Warner kid who lived about a mile from the school and had watched the game out of curiosity .
Swain embraced him and said , " You 're coming in two years , right ?
Help 's on the way , right ? "
And Bomena answered , " Oh , yeah , I 'm coming .
I like the way you coach . "
It was n't until midnight that Swain exited the building , the last one to leave as usual .
It was 41 degrees and pouring as he jumped into his gold ' 99 Taurus .
The driver 's side window was still stuck wide open , and when he pulled out of the parking lot , his face was immediately drenched .
That was fine with him .
Now nobody would be able to tell whether it was rain or tears .
Tom Hauck for ESPN.com
Swain told his players that it did n't matter if they lost a game , as long as they gave 48 minutes of strong effort -- thus , " Give Us 48 " became the team 's mantra for most of the season .
Join the conversation about " Friday Night Lite . "
OTTAWA–The United Church of Canada and other Canadian churches are demanding Prime Minister Stephen Harper explain why one of his cabinet ministers accused them of being anti-Semitic .
The United , Catholic and Anglican churches are part of KAIROS , an aid group that was shocked to hear Immigration Minister Jason Kenney say its funding was lifted as part of the Conservatives ' effort to cut off anti-Semitic organizations .
" It 's a horrible charge to make , and to do it with so little thought cheapens the reality of anti-Semitism in the world and diminishes the very careful attention that it deserves , " said United Church spokesperson Bruce Gregersen .
" We 're quite disappointed in the government on this .
" The policies of KAIROS have all been approved by the collective board of KAIROS , so in a sense what Mr. Kenney is doing is accusing Canadian churches of being anti-Semitic and I think that 's really unfortunate , " Gregersen said in an interview .
Sam Carrière , director of communications for the Anglican Church of Canada , said the church supports a statement released Friday by KAIROS , which condemned Kenney 's remarks as false and warned the Harper government against letting politics dominate Ottawa 's foreign aid priorities .
Besides the United and Anglican churches , Toronto - based KAIROS 's members include the Presbyterian Church in Canada , the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada , the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Mennonite Central Committee – Canada .
Working with 21 partner organizations around the world , KAIROS sponsors projects promoting social and economic justice in Africa , Asia , Latin America and the Middle East .
Canada 's development community appeared stunned after Kenney , in a speech in Jerusalem , cited Ottawa 's decision to end 35 years of funding for KAIROS as an example of the Conservatives ' push to cut funding for anti-Semitic groups .
KAIROS was " defunded , " Kenney said , because it took a leadership role in " the boycott , divestment and sanctions campaign " against Israel .
" Minister Kenney 's charge against KAIROS is false , " the group said in its public response .
KAIROS has raised questions about Israeli government policies but rejected the idea of a national boycott against Israel two years ago , its executives pointed out .
" To label KAIROS 's criticism of Israeli government actions as `anti-Semitic ' silences dissent and honours no one , " the statement said .
" KAIROS has a clear position of support for the legitimate right of the Israeli people to a safe and secure state . "
After its request for $ 7 million in funding over four years was turned down last month , International Cooperation Minister Bev Oda told KAIROS it was because the group did not fit the government 's priorities of food security , helping youths and economic growth .
The Toronto - based group Friday called on Ottawa to restore its funding and explain the discrepancy between Oda's and Kenney 's comments .
" Minister Kenney 's statement , in a highly charged environment , raises very disturbing questions about the integrity of Canadian development aid decisions , " KAIROS said .
Oda and Kenney were not available for interviews Friday .
Alykhan Velshi , Kenney 's director of communications , explained the decision by citing several non-government sources of information on Middle East political issues going back to 2006 that were critical of KAIROS 's activities .
Gerry Barr , president of the Canadian Council for International Co-operation , said Kenney 's remarks have compromised the integrity of the Canadian International Development Agency 's entire foreign aid funding operation .
" Any aid manager will now be looking two or three times to see what is on the table and wondering what is underneath , " he said .
Liberal and New Democrat MPs said Oda should be brought before a House of Commons committee to explain the KAIROS decision .
" There needs to be a larger discussion about CIDA 's decision - making than merely what 's happened to KAIROS , but KAIROS would be the classic example , " said the Liberals ' John McKay .
Based on KAIROS 's experience , McKay said , a non-governmental organization " could be absolutely welded to the ' priorities ' of the government as stated by Minister Oda , but if you fall outside of the government 's particular dictum of political correctness , you 're toast . "

Oracle has publicly committed to enhance MySQL under the GPL , not force third parties to GPL their storage engines and increase spending on MySQL development .
The promises were part of ten commitments in a press statement which Oracle says is the result of " constructive discussions with the European Commission " .
This is a reference to the hearings which took place on Thursday and Friday at the Commission , which is deciding on whether to allow Oracle to acquire Sun Microsystems , current owner of MySQL .
It is believed that the Commission may make a decision today ( Monday the 14th ) or within the next two weeks as a result of the hearings .
Oracle says that in the future it will develop MySQL under the GPL , simultaneously releasing enhanced versions of MySQL Enterprise Editions with enhanced versions of the GPL licensed MySQL Community Edition .
It also promises that it will not make buying support services from Oracle a requirement of getting a commercial license for MySQL .
Oracle says it will continue to make the MySQL Storage Engine APIs available to third parties and that it will not assert , or threaten to assert , GPL requirements on storage engine developers .
Commercial OEM licensees with existing licenses will be offered extensions to their licenses on the same terms until December 2014 .
The company also says it will , for each year over the next three years , spend more than Sun spent in the most recent fiscal year on development of MySQL , that it will , within six months , create two advisory boards for MySQL customers and MySQL storage engine vendors , and that it will keep the MySQL reference documentation available for no charge .
Whether these promises will sway the European Commission 's decision - making has yet to be seen .
Update - The European Commission issued a press release which confirmed that it had " engaged in constructive discussions with Oracle regarding the maintenance of MySQL " and called the commitments from Oracle " an important new element to be taken into account in the ongoing proceedings " .
Neelie Kroes , Competition Commissioner , restated her previous comment that she is " optimistic that the case will have a satisfactory outcome " .

I am standing on the helicopter deck of the famous science - drilling ship JOIDES Resolution , the snow - capped mountains of South Island , New Zealand , glistening gently along the far western horizon .
It is a privilege and a pleasure to be here .
The group of 50 scientists and technicians on board are drawn from the best in the world , and from the many country members of the International Drilling Program ( IODP ) .
For a research proposal to be allocated a drilling leg on JR - which lasts 2 months and costs about US $ 15 million to conduct - the science involved has to survive the most rigorous international peer - review .
The drilling leg in which I am participating has been fostered by a group of scientists who are vitally interested in the topic of ancient sea -level and climate changes .
Faintly , for it is far away , I remember that these issues are supposed to be the focus of international discussions in Copenhagen this week .
I grimace at the thought , because the study of climate change , under the aegis of " dangerous global warming caused by human carbon dioxide emissions , " has long since been captured by the small group of well connected , well networked and well funded atmospheric scientists and computer modellers who advise the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , and whose nearly every utterance confirms their ignorance of the true course of climate history and change on our planet - a topic that is the domain of geologists , not meteorologists and computer jockeys .
However , the stately progress that the IPCC was making towards achieving international action at the COP15 climate conference against carbon dioxide , an environmentally beneficial trace gas , has been shattered by the Climategate affair .
" Climategate " refers to the recent leaking of a copious file of emails , technical papers and computer codes from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia , which is the research group that provides the IPCC with its iconic global temperature curve since 1860 .
The Climategate files have demonstrated the scientific malfeasance of an influential and internationally well networked segment of the climate research community .
A small group of scientists and computer modellers - with the aid of an enormous supporting cast of environmental activists and organisations , self - interested business groups , and crusading journalists - have managed to turn the global warming issue ( which in 1990 was an entirely sensible matter to have raised ) into the scientific scam of the century , if not the biggest ever .
Since the original leak in mid-November , which was not covered by the mainstream press , Climategate has surpassed 30 million hits on a Google search
The IPCC is the official UN body that has presided over this fiasco .
It is an organisation that was specifically set up to provide advice to national governments ( including Australia 's ) for their use in setting climate policy .
The IPCC 's incompetence is manifest in its failure to detect the corrupt science that has for so long permeated the activities of the international jetsetters of the climate science power group .
The organisation should be closed down ( without tears ) , and the Copenhagen COP - 15 meeting would be a good place to start this process happening .
That the global warming scare should turn out to be precisely the scam that climate rationalists have been banging on about for years is shocking enough ; many future PhD theses and books will undoubtedly be written about it .
Yet it is but the tip of the iceberg so far as the public prostitution of science is concerned .
Climategate being currently in full swing , the obvious question is when ( not if ) the parallel Reefgate , Murraygate and Fishgate scandals will erupt in Australia ?
All Australians should contemplate deeply the questions that are raised by the global warming scandal , including the systemic corruption of science and the dereliction of duty by media news organisations that it reveals .
Key questions include the following .
Why has our formerly excellent national science agency , the CSIRO , been allowed to become a consultancy arm for the government ?
Why , amongst other shameless activities , has CSIRO been allowed to go around selling region - customized reports that are implied to provide climate predictions , but which in fact contain projections that are statistically no better than flipping a coin ?
( CSIRO 's back is protected , of course , by the doubtless expensive lawyers who have insisted that the following disclaimer be inserted in all such reports : " This report relates to climate change scenarios based on computer modelling .
Models involve simplifications of the real processes that are not fully understood .
Accordingly , no responsibility will be accepted by CSIRO or the QLD government for the accuracy of forecasts or predictions inferred from this report or for any person 's interpretations , deductions , conclusions or actions in reliance on this report " .
Would you buy a used car from these people ? ) .
Why has the Australian Research Council been required to apply " national science priorities " as if any scientist , however distinguished , let alone a bureaucrat or politician , has the wisdom to discriminate between useful and " useless " research ?
Behind the corrupted science of Climategate and the fall of the IPCC , then , lie two things .
The first is the degradation , mainly by political interference , of research conditions and practices within modern government - funded research groups .
The second is the power and financial clout of the modern , ecoevangelistic Green movement , egged on by crusading media reporters and editors .
The world has probably never before seen a propaganda and political machine that is as well oiled , well funded and well organized as this modern army of apocalyptics and their media flag - wavers .
But voters who respond to the siren song of the Greens imperil both our standard of living and , ironically , the state of our natural environment .
For every dollar that is spent on a false environmental issue such as dangerous human - caused global warming is a dollar that is not available to be spent on a real environmental or social problem .

A strong aftershock has rocked Haiti , sending screaming people running into the streets , eight days after another quake devastated the country .
The extent of the damage is not yet known .
The magnitude 6.1 tremor struck west of Port - au - Prince at 0603 local time ( 1103 GMT ) .
An estimated 200,000 people died in last Tuesday 's quake and another 1.5 million were made homeless .
Despite an international aid operation , supplies are slow to reach survivors .
However , international teams are still rescuing people alive from the rubble , including a 69 - year - old woman pulled from the ruins of a church in the capital .
The US military has defended its handling of the rescue operation , as aid groups complained of long delays in getting vital supplies of food , water and medicine .
Haitian President Rene Preval said aid delivery was the main problem now .
Help came " very fast , " Mr Preval told a French radio station .
" When it arrives , the question is : where are the trucks to transport it , where are the depots ? "
Fresh panic
The US Geological Survey said Wednesday 's tremor was centred 35 miles ( 56 km ) north - west of the capital .
It struck at a depth of 6.2 miles ( 9.9 km ) , but was too far inland to generate any tsunamis in the Caribbean .

Some buildings already weakened by last week 's quake collapsed and wails of terror filled the air as frightened survivors poured out of unstable buildings , a BBC correspondent in the region said .
Although some aid has started to reach desperate survivors , hundreds of thousands are still without food or water , a full week after the disaster .
Medecins Sans Frontieres ( Doctors Without Borders ) said its cargo plane with 12 tonnes of medical supplies had been turned away from the congested Port - au - Prince airport three times since Sunday .
It said five patients died from lack of the supplies it carried .
" We were forced to buy a saw in the market to continue amputations , " the group 's Loris de Filippi told the Reuters news agency in Cite Soleil .
But the US military has defended its efforts in the face of vast logistical challenges .
" We 're doing everything in our power to speed aid to Haiti as fast as humanly possible , " said Gen Douglas Fraser , head of US Southern Command .
He said they plan to start using two other airports , at Jacmel in Haiti and San Isidro in the neighbouring Dominican Republic , in the coming days .
Amazing rescues
One full week after the magnitude seven quake devastated the country , search - and - rescue teams were emerging from the ruins with unbelievable success stories .
Ena Zizi , 69 , was rescued from the wreckage of the residence of Haiti's Roman Catholic archbishop on Monday , a day before crews recovered the body of the archbishop himself , Monsignor Joseph Serge Miot .
Another survivor , 25 - year - old Lozama Hotteline , was rescued from beneath a collapsed supermarket with the help of teams from Turkey and France .
Television pictures showed her smiling and singing as she was carried to safety .
The United Nations said early on Wednesday that 121 people had been rescued by international teams since the 12 January earthquake - an extra 31 people on Tuesday .
Aid challenges
In a bid to speed up the delivery of aid and stem looting and violence , US troops have stepped up their presence in the quake - ravaged country .
AT THE SCENE Mark Doyle , BBC News , Port - au - Prince Haiti was extremely poor even before the earthquake , and this disaster has now broken all the basic services , like phones and electricity .
But Haitians are resilient .
Everywhere there are volunteers filling some of the gaps created by the slow arrival of international aid .
A company which sells drinking water is distributing it free to people living in a school compound .
A Haitian Jesuit priest has mobilised local relief workers and international doctors to work together in a rural region just outside the capital .
In a slum area , a volunteer first - aider dressed the wounds of a girl who had been trapped in rubble .
These largely unsung heroes know they can't replace the big foreign aid agencies , but they 're doing what they can to fill the gaps .
US Black Hawk helicopters swooped down on the grounds of Haiti's wrecked presidential palace on Tuesday , dropping scores of US troops who moved to secure a nearby hospital and set up aid distribution points .
US Army Maj Gen Daniel Allyn , the deputy commander for relief operations in Haiti , said the military had delivered 400,000 bottles of water and 300,000 food rations since last Tuesday 's earthquake .
He said the number of US troops would grow to 10,000 in the coming weeks .
Meanwhile , the UN Security Council voted to temporarily boost its peacekeeping forces by 3,500 personnel .
UN officials said they would accompany US troops as they delivered supplies .
While military escorts are still needed to deliver relief supplies , the United Nations said fears of violence and looting had eased .
Improved security " The overall security situation in Port - au - Prince remains stable , with limited , localised violence and looting occurring , " the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said .
So far , feared infectious diseases have not shown up , although many injured faced the immediate threats of tetanus and gangrene , and hospitals are overwhelmed .
The UN says " localised looting " is occurring , but overall security is good The Pentagon said a navy hospital ship , the USNS Comfort , had received its first Haitian patients , even as it was still heading towards Haiti .
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates said the military is sending additional ships to help with earthquake recovery in Haiti , including one that could remove debris blocking the main port .
The World Food Programme said it was planning to bring in 10,000 gallons ( 40,000 litres ) of diesel a day from the neighbouring Dominican Republic as Haitian fuel supplies dried up .
Haitian officials say the death toll from the quake was likely to be between 100,000 and 200,000 , and that 75,000 bodies had already been buried in mass graves .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama launched an extraordinary attack on the Supreme Court on Saturday , saying a ruling on corporate donations to political campaigns this week “ strikes at democracy itself . ”
President Barack Obama speaks during a visit to Lorain County Community College in Elyria , Ohio January 22 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque
Obama ’s broadside was triggered by a 5 - 4 ruling by the court ’s justices on Thursday that removed long - standing campaign finance limits and allowed corporations to spend freely in campaigns for president and Congress .
In the ruling , the court ’s conservative majority said the limits had violated corporations ’ constitutional right to free speech .
The ruling is expected to unleash a flood of money into this year ’s congressional elections .
Obama ’s fellow Democrats face a struggle to retain control of the Congress amid voter unhappiness over double - digit unemployment , a record deficit , political gridlock in Washington and other matters .
“ This ruling opens the floodgates for an unlimited amount of special interest money into our democracy , ” Obama said in his weekly radio and Internet address .
“ It gives the special interest lobbyists new leverage to spend millions on advertising to persuade elected officials to vote their way -- or to punish those who do n’t .
This ruling strikes at democracy itself , ” Obama said .
In the 2008 election cycle , nearly $ 6 billion was spent on all federal election campaigns , including more than $ 1 billion from corporate political action committees , trade associations , executives and lobbyists .
REPUBLICANS PRAISE RULING
Democrats fear that a lot of the corporate money unleashed into U.S. political campaigns by the ruling will go to Republicans , traditional allies of big business .
Republicans already were expressing optimism about erasing the Democratic majorities in the House of Representatives and the Senate in November ’s elections .
Republican control of either the House or Senate could cripple Obama ’s ability to get key policy initiatives through Congress .
Republican Party chairman Michael Steele has praised the court ’s ruling , saying free speech strengthened democracy .
Obama blasted the ruling the day it was issued , and expanded on his criticism in Saturday ’s remarks .
The Supreme Court ruling dealt a powerful blow to efforts to rein in corporate influence and could even allow foreign corporations to “ get into the act , ” Obama said .
“ It will make it more difficult to pass common - sense laws to promote energy independence because even foreign entities would be allowed to mix in our elections , ” Obama said .
It also will impede efforts to pass financial regulatory reforms and will give the health insurance industry “ even more leverage to fend off reforms that would protect patients , ” he said , referring to the industry ’s opposition to his efforts to overhaul the $ 2.5 trillion U.S. healthcare industry .
Obama came into office vowing to curb the influence of powerful lobbyists for banks , health insurance companies and other special interest groups in Washington .
He said his administration had barred gifts from lobbyists to administration officials and “ closed the revolving door between lobbying firms and the government ” so that no one in his administration would make decisions based on the interests of former or future employers .
Obama said he had instructed his administration to work immediately with Congress to develop a forceful , bipartisan response to the ruling .
“ We have begun that work , and it will be a priority for us until we repair the damage that has been done , ” he said .
While monetarist clowns focus on so - called excess reserves and the huge surge in inflation that is supposed to bring ( See Fictional Reserve Lending And The Myth Of Excess Reserves )
I am watching the biggest plunge in consumer credit since WWII .
Please consider Consumer Credit in U.S. Drops Record $ 17.5 Billion .
Consumer credit in the U.S. dropped a record $ 17.5 billion in November as unemployment close to a 26 - year high discouraged borrowing and banks limited access to loans .
The slump in credit to $ 2.46 trillion was more than anticipated and followed a revised $ 4.2 billion drop in October , Federal Reserve figures showed today in Washington .
The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a decrease of $ 5 billion .
The series of 10 straight declines was the longest since record - keeping began in 1943 .
“ Double - digit unemployment is eroding consumer confidence and the uncertainty is prompting consumers to pay down their credit card debts , ” said Chris Rupkey , chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in New York .
“ We have not seen such a wholesale reduction in consumer credit since the last time we had double - digit unemployment rate following the early ‘ 80s recessions . ”
Revolving debt , such as credit cards , plunged by a record $ 13.7 billion in November , the Fed ’s statistics showed .
Non-revolving debt , including loans for autos and mobile homes , declined by $ 3.8 billion .
The Fed ’s report does n’t cover borrowing secured by real estate .
Bank of America Corp. Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan has said the largest U.S. lender needs to reduce the loss rate on credit cards , which ranked highest among the nation ’s six biggest card companies in November .
Bank of America ’s card defaults are “ still very high , ” Moynihan , 50 , said .
‘ Significant Bubble ’
“ As an industry , we over - lent and customers over - borrowed , and that led to a fairly significant bubble , ” Moynihan said Jan. 4 in an interview on Bloomberg Television in Raleigh , North Carolina .
“ We have to help lead the economic recovery .
At the same time , we have to be responsible lenders . ”

Total Consumer Credit Percent Change From Year Ago
Total Revolving Credit Outstanding
Consumers Attitudes Are Key To Deflation
We have to help lead the economic recovery .
At the same time , we have to be responsible lenders .
New Religion
Banks have a new religion on lending .
Consumers have a new religion on borrowing .
Addendum :
Last night I commented on your " Consumer Credit Drops Record $ 17.5 Billion ... " post , under the nickname Coyote on RocketSkates .
The subject of my comment was that I found a spreadsheet error in a sheet available at the Fed 's download page for G.19 .
The published data for June - November 09 repeats exactly the data for June - November 08 , and appears to affect the gross total ( nsa ) number from which the headline ( sa ) numbers are derived .
Assuming that the data over a five - month period did not repeat itself exactly for five months , exactly one year later , one has to conclude that the Fed 's auditing and reporting is sloppy , even on important releases .
Conspiracy and manipulation are plausibly deniable , bad auditing , less - so .
Next , I sent an email to ' Tyler ' over at Zero Hedge , and he soon posted an entry on the subject , here : http://www.zerohedge.com/article/blatant-data-error-federal-reserve
This morning , I availed myself to Ron Paul via email , in the hopes that this might add some straw to the camel 's back about the Fed 's audit procedures .

Albondigas soup is a traditional Mexican meatball soup ( “ albondigas ” means “ meatballs ” in Spanish ) that my mother has cooked for our family for more than 50 years .
It is our version of comfort food .
Video !
How to Make Albondigas Soup
A simple soup base is made with sautéed onions , garlic , broth , and tomatoes .
Into the bubbling soup you drop meatballs made with ground beef or ground turkey and rice .
The meat creates its own additional broth for the soup .
Carrots , green beans , and peas are also usually added to the soup .
What makes the flavor of albondigas soup distinctive is the chopped mint in the meatballs .
I once complained to a Mexican chef about the lack of mint in his cookbook ’s albondigas soup recipe , and he looked at me with surprise and said , “ my mother puts mint in her albondigas ! ”
You can , of course , skip the mint , substitute with a little fresh oregano or some cilantro , but to me , the soup ’s not the same without it .
You can also vary the vegetables added , depending on what you have on hand and what ’s in season .

You know how Google sometimes “ predicts ” what you might be searching for by giving you a little drop down menu of suggested search queries ?
These suggestions , of course , are based on what other users frequently search .
So I tried teasing out some gender differences .
Look at the pictures below .
This shows Google ’s remarkable power as a source of data on a range of human behaviors , emotions , and opinions .
It gives us insights into what people might care the most about concerning a given topic .
When people search a particular political leader , what are their main concerns ?
What are people secretly guilty about ?
For better or for worse , Google ’s obsession with collecting and refining data has given us a window into each other ’s fascinating and telling curiosities .
Mr. Drake teaches modern European history at the University of Montana .
He was educated at St. Michael ’s College ( B.A. 1963 ) , Brown University ( M.A. 1965 ) , and the University of California , Los Angeles ( Ph.D. 1975 ) .
He is the the author of several books including : The Revolutionary Mystique and Terrorism in Contemporary Italy ( Indiana University Press , 1989 ) .
Mr. President , in your speech at West Point on 1 December you spoke about the benign intentions of American foreign policy .
You said that since the days of FDR , “ our country has borne a special burden , ” fighting all over the world for freedom and the betterment of peoples .
You also said , “ For unlike the great powers of old , we have not sought domination … .
We do not seek to occupy other nations ’ resources or target other peoples because their faith or ethnicity is different from ours . ”
Although these words triggered an outburst of sustained applause from the audience , I think that your description of American foreign policy leaves out some important truths .
I would like to comment on some of these missing truths , the contemplation of which might lead to a negative judgment of your Afghanistan policy .
First , it would have been more accurate to begin your historical overview of American foreign policy with Woodrow Wilson , not with FDR .
It was Wilson in his war message to Congress on 2 April 1917 who issued the first fully articulated call for the U.S. to fight for the peace and liberation of the world .
He said that “ the world must be made safe for democracy . ”
Seeking nothing for itself , he concluded , the U.S. would serve as the champion of humanity .
Two days after the President ’s war message to Congress , Senator Robert La Follette , a Republican from Wisconsin , rose to speak in the Senate .
His speech lasted four hours .
He thought that far from going to war to make the world safe for democracy , the President ’s professed aim , we actually were going to war to make the world safe for Wall Street .
Ever since those fateful days of April 1917 , historians of American foreign policy have been split between , on the one hand , defenders of Wilson and , on the other , defenders of La Follette .
The policy makers themselves , especially since FDR and including you , Mr. President , have been Wilsonians .
After listening to your campaign speeches about change we can believe in — and being inspired by those speeches — it is disillusioning to me that in your West Point address you merely echoed the Washington consensus on American foreign policy .
Your speech revealed no sign of your having familiarized yourself with the opposition argument about the historical record of American foreign policy .
That opposition argument needs to be taken into account as a corrective to your assumption that the proposed surge in Afghanistan is in line with our country ’s foreign policy ideals .
The Afghanistan surge might be in line with an entirely different set of precedents , the ones bitterly denounced by Senator La Follette in his rebuttal to President Wilson ’s call for war in 1917 .
In a highly compressed way , I am going to draw on the arguments of William Appleman Williams for a synthesis of the dark view of American foreign policy .
He is , I think , the seminal thinker for the opposition argument .
In The Tragedy of American Diplomacy ( 1959 ) , he declares that from its inception the United States has been a roaring engine of domination and exploitation in the world .
Once the American continent had been swept clean of indigenous opposition , the U.S. turned outward .
He wrote in a later book , Empire as a Way of Life ( 1980 ) , that with the epochal Spanish - American War of 1898 , “ America was entering into the argument among the rich about how to control the poor . ”
Williams summed up American foreign policy in the twentieth century as “ the benevolent American desire to reform the world in its own image , ” i.e. , to become the preceptor and , in effect , the ruler of all mankind .
He had especially harsh words for FDR — a flamboyant , world - saving Wilsonian in his view — as I am afraid he would have for you , Mr. President .
Among American historians and political scientists who were or have been influenced by Williams , we find Walter Karp , Gabriel Kolko , Walter La Feber , Chalmers Johnson , and Andrew Bacevich .
Politically , these individuals span the entire spectrum of political opinion , from left to right .
There are Democrats and Republicans among them and some socialists .
Their books should be required reading for all American citizens , including Presidents .
Their ideas call into question the notion of American exceptionalism , on which your speech , Mr. President , is based .
In fact , we are very much like the great powers of old .
They , too , thought that they were doing good in the world .
As a rule , the only good they did was for their own ruling classes .
Thorstein Veblen , one of the more perceptive geniuses produced by the United States and in some important respects a precursor of Williams , devoted his entire career to the task of exposing the realities of power that lay behind the pieties of the elites who controlled and exploited the vast and variegated under classes of the world .
High - flown moralistic language he wrote , generally serves as a screen of diplomatic verbiage behind which the senior statesmen of the Great Powers continue their pursuit of political chicane and aggrandizement .
The kinetic energy behind American foreign policy inclines me to the belief that with the surge in Afghanistan we are getting not change we can believe in , but more of the old game .
A version of this open letter appeared in The Great Falls Tribune on December 27 , 2009 .
If you 're thinking to yourself , " that 's sort of a small window for a luxury hotel suite , " well , you 're right .
But it 's only because this room occupies the entirety of a repurposed Cold War-era East German aircraft .

OK , the view is n't anything special : the plane stays grounded outside the Teuge airport in the Netherlands .
But the room itself , dubbed the Vliegtuigsuite , is spectacular , including three flat screen TVs , a Blu-ray player , a sauna , and a jacuzzi .
Guests have access to the entire plane , from your king - size bed in the back all the way up to the cockpit .
My Dutch is n't quite what it should be , but from the looks of things a night in the aircraft will put you back €350 .
A bit steep , sure , but totally worth it if you 've always wanted to get it on in an airplane without worrying about a foot ending up in that weird blue toiletjuice .

TV cameramen and photographers who had squeezed into The New Inn at Wedmore cheered when the winner marched across the gallery to accept the prize , a turnip mounted on a six - inch nail .
Organisers said they were " delighted with the lack of effort taken to create the work " .
Ivor Prance , 69 , a former army sergeant from Worth near Wookey said : " I have entered this most coveted art award on several occasions and I really feel that the lack of effort this year has really paid off .
Ivor said the art took " no time at all " " I knew the moment I came up with the idea I could pull the wool over the judges eyes . "
Ivor who describes his work as " fluffy , furry and flocculent " said : " The work took no time at all to create .
I picked it off of a barbed wire fence whilst thinking how the voting public and unsuccessful competitors must feel after John Sergeant 's controversial exit from Strictly Come Dancing . "
Organiser Trevor Prideaux said : " This year 's event attracted a total of 69 entries , which by strange coincidence is exactly the same amount as last year .
" It 's fantastic that Ivor has won , he clearly has what it takes to be recognised in modern art circles ( which more often than not have no point ) and will be remembered in art history for no time at all .
" I believe that over the last ten years the artists entering The Turnip Prize have created by far better works than Nicholas Serota and The Tate Britain Gallery could ever wish to exhibit . "
The Turnip Prize , which recognises bad art , started in 1999 as a reaction to Tracey Emin 's installation ' My Bed ' which was short - listed in the Turner Prize .
According to the rules , there are no barriers to entry into the competition , they simply state : " You can enter anything you like , but it must be rubbish . "
Regulars at pubs in Wedmore , near Cheddar , then vote for the winner .
Previous entrants include ' Soap Opera ' ( a bar of soap on top of an operatic musical score ) , ' A Pair of Dice Lost ' ( two dice on top of a map ) and ' Birds Flew ' ( an empty birds ' nest with a box of flu remedy ) which took the honours in 2005 .
Some entrants are disqualified for being too good .
The Turner Prize was won by artist Mark Leckey , 44 , who collects £ 25,000 for his exhibition including cartoon characters such as Homer Simpson .
Muse 's latest album came top in the online poll
Enlarge Image
The eye - catching sleeve for the latest album by British rockers Muse has been named the best record cover of 2009 .
The artwork for The Resistance won the Best Art Vinyl prize , with Manic Street Preachers ' Journal For Plague Lovers coming second in the online poll .
Third place went to Fever Ray 's self - titled album , with Massive Attack and Green Day rounding out the top five .
A mixture of 50 obscure and well - known vinyl record sleeves from 2009 were shortlisted for the prize .
The winning sleeves will be featured in an exhibition at the Art Vinyl gallery in the Selfridges department store in central London .
' Unsung heroes '
They can also be viewed at three other locations in Birmingham , Folkestone and east London .
Art Vinyl director Andrew Heeps said the award , now in its fifth year , was " a great way to celebrate the unsung heroes behind the art and design of some of our favourite bands and artists " .
US indie band Fleet Foxes won last year 's top prize with their self - titled debut album .
The sleeve for The Resistance , released last September , was the work of London design firm La Boca .
Other previous recipients of the award include Hard - Fi's Stars of CCTV and Thom Yorke 's The Eraser .

Advertisement Fears are growing for the future of water supplies in one of Latin America 's fastest - growing urban areas - Bolivia 's sprawling city of La Paz and its neighbour El Alto .
Scientists monitoring the glaciers high in the Andes mountains - a key source of water - say the ice is showing signs of shrinking faster than previously forecast .
Faced with a booming population and a combination of glacial retreat and reduced rainfall , the governor of the La Paz region is even contemplating moving people to other parts of Bolivia .
Water is already in short supply among the poorest communities and has become a cause of tension .
It 's a problem that begins now but will become more serious as other , much larger glaciers melt as well
Dr Edson Ramirez
In pictures : Bolivia glaciers
In El Alto 's District 8 , I watched 13 - year - old Christian Muraga fill a bucket from a communal tap shared with 80 families .
I asked if the tap always produces water .
" No , there is n't water every day from this tap , sometimes nothing . "
The nearest alternative is nearly one kilometre away .
Campaign groups say as many as one quarter of the city 's population do not have ready access to water .
Sergio Criales of Oxfam told me : " The problem is getting worse because of climate change and because they do n't have enough water to cover all their demands . "
Water battle
The tap was established illegally and draws water from the scarce mains supply running in a neighbouring district .
Christian 's father Macario said that there are often disputes over access to water and that fights occasionally break out .
Water has become so precious that we even found a group of women cleaning plastic bags in a heavily contaminated stream that stank of raw sewage .
When I asked why they were doing this , one replied that she had no alternative .
Much of the city 's water supply comes from glaciers " There is no other water to use .
I know it is dirty and I am worried about my children .
But what can I do ? "
The shortage of fresh water is partly the result of the influx of tens of thousands of people to El Alto every year leaving the authorities unable to cope .
But another factor is a rise in temperature that 's faster than the global average and its effect on the snow - capped peaks that dominate the skyline .
Researchers say that the glaciers are in dramatic retreat across the tropical regions of the Andes .
When the rate of melting is faster than the accumulation of snow , the glaciers lose mass and no longer produce a steady flow of water .
We made the steep journey up to the site of one glacier on the mountain Chacaltaya .
At an altitude of 5,300 metres , it used to be the world 's highest ski resort .
All that 's left of the glacier now is a tiny patch of white amid a vast sweep of bare grey rock .
High impact Back in 2005 , glaciologist Edson Ramirez , from the University of San Andres in La Paz , predicted that the Chacaltaya glacier would vanish by 2015 .
In fact it 's happened several years sooner .
Dr Ramirez told me that the rate and scale of melting of the Andean glaciers at this altitude was an indicator of climate change .
" This is really a problem .
It 's a problem that begins now but will become more serious as other , much larger glaciers melt as well . "
And the impact is highly visible .
Visiting a reservoir fed by one glacier , we saw large areas of cracked mud around its edges as its level was far lower than normal .
Particularly vital to the water supply is the fate of the ice hugging the multiple peaks of Illimani , towering above La Paz .
The glaciers there have also been recorded as shrinking .
Local people need to obtain water where they can
A twisting trail cut through canyons and along cliff - faces took us to the slopes of this vast mountain and the village of Khapi .
In the dazzling sunshine and thin air , the scene looked idyllic with glacial streams watering tiny plots of vegetables .
But the village elders say the lower edge of the glacier they depend on has been advancing up the mountain .
They 've noticed how the flow sometimes surges with dirty yellow water unsuitable for irrigation but is generally reduced .
As Lucia Quispe tended one of her fields , she said : " Twenty years ago there was a lot more water .
We want to plant potatoes , maize and beans but we do n't have enough water .
" We are fighting between ourselves near the channel because one person wants to send the stream one way , and another the other way .
We just do n't have enough water . "
City limits
One fundamental question is whether this will become another reason for people to head for the cities .
In the last 10 years , 15 families have left Khapi - leaving just 45 families - and one reason mentioned is the falling supply of water .
And this drift from the countryside to the urban areas seems likely to accelerate if the forecasts about the glaciers are accurate in coming years - adding to the already creaking water infrastructure of El Alto and La Paz .
I asked the governor of the La Paz region , Pablo Ramos , how he was responding to the latest studies into the future of water supplies .
One answer is that new reservoirs may be built and underground sources tapped .
But it 's clear that these solutions may not be enough and Mr Ramos is starting to consider a far more radical solution - trying to move people away .
He told BBC news : " We are thinking about a planned programme of migration , mainly to the north of the region . "
On a large map in his office , he pointed to an area of well - watered rainforest and explained his plans for new settlements .
" For sure there 's going to be a huge movement of people - planned and unplanned . "
La Paz already has one global claim to fame : as the world 's highest capital .
If the most extreme climate predictions are right , and water shortages become severe , it may acquire another claim in coming decades : as the world 's first capital to run so dry that it has to turn people away .

Soldiers are concerned the markings could put them at risk if captured A US military contractor has said it will stop engraving Biblical references on rifles used by the US army .
The markings , in the form of coded references , have been appearing on products made by the US firm Trijicon , based in Michigan , for decades .
But on Thursday , US military chief Gen David Petraeus , said the practice of scripture references was " disturbing " and " a serious concern " .
The firm also sells the gunsights to Australia , New Zealand and the UK .
The inscriptions - which include " 2COR4:6 " and " JN8:12 " , relating to verses in the books of II Corinthians and John - appear in raised lettering at the end of the stock number .
The company pledged to remove the inscription reference on all products destined for the US military yet to be shipped and ensure all future procurements from the department of defence are produced without scripture references .
Religious sensitivities
It also said it would provide 100 modification kits to forces in the field to remove the references .
" Trijicon has proudly served the US military for more than two decades , and our decision to offer to voluntarily remove these references is both prudent and appropriate , " the firm , founded by a devout Christian , said in a statement released on Friday .
The references - first reported on by ABC News - had raised concerns that they broke US rules barring troops proselytising in the predominantly Muslim countries of Afghanistan and Iraq , where they are widely used by both the US and British military .
Gen Petraeus , head of the US Central Command , said : " Cultural and religious sensitivities are important considerations in the conduct of military operations . "
In a letter sent to the US president on Thursday , the head of the Interfaith Alliance said the gunsights " clearly violate " the rule .
" Images of American soldiers as Christian crusaders come to mind when they are carrying weaponry bearing such verses , " Welton Gaddy said .
Earlier in the week , the Church of England told the UK's Guardian newspaper : " People of all faiths and none are being killed and injured in these ­conflicts , on all sides , and any suggestion that this is being done in the name of the Bible would be deeply worrying to many ­Christians . "
On Thursday , New Zealand 's defence ministry said it was in talks with Trijicon about the best way to remove the markings without damaging the sights .
Australia too is reportedly assessing how best to respond .

Anthony and I are on the same page today .
See Anthony here .
Many CA readers have followed Richard North ‘s recent blog posts on Pachauri , whose recent travails have been also covered by Bishop Hill , Pielke Jr. , James Delingpole , Andrew Bolt , to name but a few .
Pachauri ’s travails were prominent in an excellent Times feature story .
Pachauri ’s recent travails have included the failure of the vaunted IPCC WG2 peer review process to correct a claim that Himalayan glaciers would disappear in 2035 .
The glacier claim proved to be based on a 2005 World Wildlife Fund pamphlet , which in turn was based on a 1999 New Scientist interview with Indian scientist Syed Hasnain ( see his joint interview with Richard North ) .
Pachauri blamed WG2 co-chairs , Martin Parry ( now of the Grantham Institute ) and Osvaldo Canziani for failing to pick up the error .
Dr Pachauri said that the IPCC ’s report was the responsibility of the panel ’s former co-chairs , British scientist Dr Martin Parry and Argentine meteorologist Dr Osvaldo Canziani .
“ I do n’t want to blame them , but typically the working group reports are managed by the co-chairs .
Of course , the chair is there to facilitate things , but we have substantial amounts of delegation , ” Dr Pachauri said .
“ Frankly , it was a stupid error .
But no one brought it to my attention , ” he added .
High Noon sponsored a conference in New Delhi , India on May 13 and 14 , 2009 ( see here ) .
A keynote presentation entitled the “ Road to High Noon ” included the following graphic ( also linked in Anthony ’s article ) as authority for the claim that “ Glaciers in the Himalaya are receding faster than in any other part of the world and , if the present rate continues , the likelihood of them disappearing by the year 2035 and perhaps sooner is very high if the Earth keeps warming at the current rate ”
The EU High Noon webpage also relied on the WWF article directly , citing it as authority as follows :
Future decline in glacier runoff will affect both mountain villages as small glaciers disappear and the four – five hundred million inhabitants of the entire Ganga basin as spring and autumn flows in particular decline , at differing timescales .
Reviews from the region suggest that the timescales are short , may be the 2040s ( World Wildlife Fund 2005 ) or the 2050s ( Xu Jianchu and others 2007 ) , although monsoon precipitation in the Indian and Nepal Himalaya appears to stave off glacier reduction in the central and eastern Himalaya by comparison with the Karakoram in the west ( Rees & Collins 2006 ) ….
Climate change will be another factor adding to the stress ( WWF , 2005 ) .
So IPCC is not the only organization using WWF pamphlets as authority .
EU High Noon did as well .
Nor were the IPCC WG2 reviewers the only climate scientists to overlook the lack of support for these particular IPCC assertions .
The High Noon conference had a lengthy list of presentations ( online here ) and , in a quick survey , none of the presentations appears to have taken issue with IPCC claims .
In resisting calls for his resignation , Pachauri denied that TERI benefited financially from the inadequate due diligence :
Pachauri also dismissed speculation that the think tank he heads in India – The Energy and Resources Institute ( TERI ) had benefited from the alarmist statement that Himalayan glaciers may disappear by 2035 .
“ TERI is not involved in this mistake , ” Pachauri said .
On May 19 , 2009 , the European Union announced a $ 4.5 million ( 3 million euro ) project to study retreat of Himalaya glaciers , with TERI being one of the institutions .
The EU has earmarked 3 million Euros ( approximately INR 19.5 crores ) for this 3 years project , bringing together leading research institutions in Europe : Netherlands , UK and Switzerland , and India : TERI , IIT - Delhi & Kharagpur .
The participation of Japan in this project is adding an international dimension .
TERI also recently announced participation in a glacier program involving Iceland and Ohio State .
Representing TERI in the project was Syed Hasnain … the source of the original 2035 claim .
The Ohio State representatives were not named ( Lonnie Thompson is the director of the Byrd Center . )
Update : Looking back to December blogs ( I recall noticing this at the time , but was otherwise occupied here ) , it seems that the story of IPCC problems was first raised on Dec 1 , 2009 in a guest post at Pielke Sr here , crediting Graham Cogley for spotting the problem .
Then at BBC on Dec 5 , where the IPCC WG2 author denied any problem :
Murari Lal , a climate expert who was one of the leading authors of the 2007 IPCC report , denied it had its facts wrong about melting Himalayan glaciers .
On Dec 22 , Pielke Jr and Anthony Watts both covered the story , referencing a blog post by Nielsen - Gammon here .
The moral compass of some public figures clearly went awry in 2009 .
Now new research better explains why some in the public eye do n't think like the rest of us .
Power increases " moral hypocrisy , " says Adam Galinsky , a behavioral psychologist at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston , Ill. , and co-author of a study published today in the journal Psychological Science .
Power does indeed go to your head , making those in the limelight such as celebrities , politicians , CEOs and athletes more prone to a double standard :
They 're stricter in their moral judgment of others but are more lenient about their own behavior , the study suggests .
" We gave people the opportunity to cheat , and those in a position of power were more likely to cheat , " says Galinsky , who conducted the study with researchers from Tilburg University in the Netherlands .
A rogues ' gallery
Among the once - powerful who fell from grace this year amid what Galinsky calls moral hypocrisy are former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich , South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford and U.S. Sen .
John Ensign of Nevada , with assorted violations of extramarital affairs or suspected misuse of public funds .
Last year , those figures included the auto executives who flew in private jets while their companies cut employee benefits , and politicians , including John Edwards and Eliot Spitzer , who did n't follow the values they espoused .
" It 's interesting to think about people in power and why they end up in scandals , " says Joe Magee of New York University 's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service .
" In their minds , they 're not being brazen .
They forget there are rules governing what they do .
They 're just pursuing their own desires . "
Feeling entitled
Magee and Galinsky are among a group of researchers across the country who , in the past decade , have focused attention on moral behavior , power and status .
" Power makes you kind of impulsive and self - serving and occasionally greedy , " says psychologist Dacher Keltner of the University of California - Berkeley .
" We hold up people in positions of power to exacting standards .
They should be more moral agents , when in fact , they are the opposite . "
Jennifer Overbeck of the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California - Los Angeles says her studies have found that ordinary people change when put in powerful position : " Just putting them in a position of power leads them to pursue their self - interest and things that they perceive are useful to them . "
In the new study , researchers conducted five experiments with about 350 subjects .
They found that giving people power makes them feel entitled and causes a disconnect in their judgment .
Those in high - power positions tend to judge morality of others while not practicing what they preach , Galinsky says .
" If they want to impose strict standards on others while violating those standards themselves , that 's when they become a hypocrite , " he says .
David DeSteno , a psychologist at Northeastern University in Boston , says his research has shown that " the potential for hypocrisy is in all of us . "
" What you see is the same action : ' It 's OK if I do it .
but not if you do it , ' " he says .
Why have Jane Campion 's well - reviewed Bright Star and its star Abbie Cornish so far been ignored in the awards race ?
There are several theories .
Advertisement
The question has been posed over at Cinematical , as well as in the aftermath of the Golden Globe nominations , which shut the film out entirely .
Advertisement
Blame the September release date , lack of studio mettle , or the relative unsexiness of poetry in a crowded year .
Or blame its subtle portrayal of a female character by a female director , as some of the folks over at Women & Hollywood did while pondering the recent Golden Globe nominations .
Said critic Caryn James ,
I do n't want to take anything away from Kathryn Bigelow ; The Hurt Locker is an amazingly - directed film .
But it is also a stereotypically macho film , while Jane Campion 's beaufitul , poetic Bright Star plays into stereotypes of what a woman filmmaker might do .
It 's true that awards rarely honor subtlety , male or female , and that has hurt Bright Star .
But it 's also true that the many nominations for Bigelow play into the old idea that women get ahead by behaving like men , in this case making a movie voters might expect a man to have made .
I 'm glad Bigelow made the film she wanted to make , but real progress will come when we stop looking at poetic films as if they exist in some lesser , female category .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Fellow respondent , Awards Daily 's Sasha Stone , had a slightly different argument — that Bright Star was n't feminine enough :
Campion 's refusal to make Bright Star and out and out weepy , combined with its distant romantic tale , fought off the very audience it would need to survive : romance - hungry women .
How awful to have it categorized like that but that is what women want .
Advertisement
Whether or not it's what women want , Bright Star was certainly not one of those period films that overcompensate with lusty bodice - ripping ; its idea of sensuality was extremely passionate hand - holding .
( The headline of the New York Times review semi-ironically referred to the film as an " Ode to Hot English Chastity . " )
But that 's no explanation for the snubbing of Abbie Cornish , of whom the Times review said , " She 's as good as Kate Winslet , which is about as good as it's possible to be . "
It 's hard to imagine higher praise .
Advertisement
Bright Star may have suffered by being squeezed on both sides — it demanded tremendous patience of the audience , which is asking a lot , but although critics liked it , it was never passionately championed .
Certain serious viewers outright rejected it .
The screening I attended of this film was followed by a panel of academics convened by the Keats Society of America : three men , one woman .
( Listen to its podcast here ) .
After Christopher Ricks stingingly criticized the film ( elaborating , later , in a New York Review Of Books article , " Undermining Keats , " sub. req 'd ) for being too literal and trying to force the poetry into visual cues , Susan Wolfson , an English professor at Princeton , remarked that Campion had been said she was drawn to Keats ' mistress Fanny Brawne , about whom little is known , because how much " invention " that could allow her .
Campion could imagine Brawne 's own subjectivity without being enslaved to the facts , even if it meant Keats , the great man , were a weak character .
" A lot of the energy was transferred to Fanny Brawne , " as Wolfson put it .
Advertisement
Using Keats ' poetry to explore the development and challenges of this woman has clearly charmed some and left others cold .
Is that a matter of gender ?
Is making a subtle , action - free movie an essentially female act ?
Is it fair to compare it to The Hurt Locker 's success thus far ?
Unless the Oscars break with the trend so far , it 's a debate we 'll have to have without them .

Updated : Even before their Massachusetts victory this week , Republicans enjoyed a multitude of advantages in this year ’s midterm elections .
The Supreme Court has most likely just delivered one more : money .
Today ’s ruling upends the nation ’s campaign finance laws , allowing corporations and labor unions to spend freely on behalf of political candidates .
With less than 11 months before the fall elections , the floodgates for political contributions will open wide , adding another element of intrigue to the fight for control of Congress .
At first blush , Republican candidates would seem to benefit from this change in how political campaigns are conducted in America .
The political environment – an angry , frustrated electorate seeking change in Washington – was already favoring Republicans .
Now corporations , labor unions and a host of other organizations can weigh in like never before .
But the populist showdown that was already brewing – President Obama on Thursday sought to limit the size of the nation ’s banks – will surely only intensify by the Supreme Court ’s ruling .
The development means that both sides will have even louder megaphones to make their voices and viewpoints heard .
Mr. Obama issued a statement – a rare instance of a president immediately weighing in on a ruling from the high court – and said his administration would work with Congressional leaders “ to develop a forceful response to this decision . ”
“ With its ruling today , the Supreme Court has given a green light to a new stampede of special interest money in our politics , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ It is a major victory for big oil , Wall Street banks , health insurance companies and the other powerful interests that marshal their power every day in Washington to drown out the voices of everyday Americans . ”
Republicans , of course , hailed the ruling as a victory for the First Amendment .
“ I am pleased that the Supreme Court has acted to protect the Constitution ’s First Amendment rights of free speech and association , ” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas , chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee .
“ These are the bedrock principles that underpin our system of governance and strengthen our democracy . ”
Democrats , not surprisingly , said the ruling would be bad for democracy .
“ Giving corporate interests an outsized role in our process will only mean citizens get heard less , ” said Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey , chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee .
“ We must look at legislative ways to make sure the ledger is not tipped so far for corporate interests that citizens voices are drowned out . ”
Senator Russ Feingold , one of the architects of the 2002 campaign finance restrictions known as the McCain - Feingold law , issued this reminder that the court ’s decision did not completely lift some boundaries for corporate money :
“ It is important to note that the decision does not affect McCain - Feingold ’s soft money ban , which will continue to prevent corporate contributions to the political parties from corrupting the political process .
But this decision was a terrible mistake .
Presented with a relatively narrow legal issue , the Supreme Court chose to roll back laws that have limited the role of corporate money in federal elections since Teddy Roosevelt was president .
Ignoring important principles of judicial restraint and respect for precedent , the Court has given corporate money a breathtaking new role in federal campaigns .
Just six years ago , the Court said that the prohibition on corporations and unions dipping into their treasuries to influence campaigns was ‘ firmly embedded in our law . ’
Yet this Court has just upended that prohibition , and a century ’s worth of campaign finance law designed to stem corruption in government .
The American people will pay dearly for this decision when , more than ever , their voices are drowned out by corporate spending in our federal elections .
In the coming weeks , I will work with my colleagues to pass legislation restoring as many of the critical restraints on corporate control of our elections as possible . ”
No word yet from his partner on these initiatives , Senator John McCain , Republican of Arizona .
As Mr. Feingold ’s statement expressed , these early comments are the opening volley in a battle expected to quickly begin on Capitol Hill , as Democrats push for new legislation to put some of the campaign finance restrictions back in place .
In the meantime , citizens , brace yourselves .
An even more intense barrage of advertising and advocacy – on television , the Web and beyond – will be at hand in the 2010 midterm elections .
Information overload awaits …
Euro bulls need to consider the implications of an EU bailout of Greece or the implosion of Eastern European debt in Lithuania and Latvia .
Some are even wondering about the prospects of Euroland itself .
With that backdrop please consider Almunia Says EU Officials Ready to Assist Greece in Budget Plan .
The European Commission “ stands ready to assist the Greek government in setting out the comprehensive consolidation and reform program , in the framework of the treaty provisions for euro - area member states , ” said Joaquin Almunia , who is in charge of economic and monetary affairs , in a statement late yesterday .
He did n’t say what form any assistance could take .
Almunia ’s comments come as investors debate whether EU governments would bail out Greece if it was unable to pay its bills .
Former German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck said in February that euro members would “ in reality ” rescue states in difficulty .
Almunia said yesterday Greece “ is a matter of common concern ” for euro nations , echoing language he has used since November .
He did n’t elaborate further .
“ The situation in Greece is very difficult , ” European Central Bank President Jean - Claude Trichet said Dec. 7 .
“ We all know the figures , and we all know the very important , courageous decisions that have to be taken to put the situation back on track . ”
Greece Government Bonds Tumble
The biggest drop in Greece bonds in more than a decade is n’t enough to entice some of Europe ’s biggest fixed - income investors amid deepening concern the nation wo n’t be able to fix its deteriorating finances .
Frankfurt - Trust Investment GmbH , Smith & Williamson Investment Management and Pictet Asset Management , which manage a combined $ 100 billion , say they are not ready to buy even after the biggest tumble in two - year notes since 1998 .
Standard & Poor ’s put the nation ’s debt on watch for a downgrade two days ago , and Fitch Ratings followed yesterday by cutting Greece ’s credit rating one level to BBB + from A - .
S&P said two days ago Greece ’s debt burden may climb to 125 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 , the largest among the 27 European Union nations , and stay at that level or higher in the “ medium term . ”
Fitch cited “ concerns over the medium - term outlook for public finances given the weak credibility of fiscal institutions and the policy framework . ”
Downward Pressure on Latvia and Lithuania
Fitch Ratings said Latvia and Lithuania ’s sovereign ratings remain under “ downward pressure ” as the Baltic states ’ economic plight sends their deficit and debt levels higher .
Latvia ’s BB + rating , the highest non-investment grade , and Lithuania ’s BBB rating , two levels above junk , are more at risk of a downgrade than Estonia ’s BBB + rating , Fitch said in a statement today .
The Baltic states are suffering the deepest economic contractions in the European Union after their debt - fueled property bubbles burst and their governments forced through tough austerity measures .
Can Euroland Survive ?
Social unrest across Europe is growing as Euroland ’s economy collapses faster than the United States ’ , the result of falling exports and a weaker fiscal response .
The controversial title of this brief is based on a belief that the nature of the euro itself limits Euroland ’s fiscal policy space .
The nations that have adopted the euro face “ market - imposed ” fiscal constraints on borrowing because they are not sovereign countries .
Research Associate Stephanie A. Kelton and Senior Scholar L. RandallWray foresee a real danger that these nations will be unable to prevent an
accelerating slide toward depression that will threaten the existence of the European Union ( EU ) .
Unlike the case where the U.S. federal government rescued New York State , however , the procedure to bail out a member state is unknown .
The ECB is practically prohibited from taking over the debts of member states , and , although it is impossible to surmise what the ECB might do in a crisis , there is enough uncertainty to create the possibility of a ( bank ) run stemming from an individual member ’s debt .
And , as discussed , there is no central fiscal authority that has anything like the responsibility of the U.S. Treasury .
Charles Goodhart ( 2006 ) summarizes the problem :
The federal institutions in the EU have neither the ability , nor the wish , to guarantee the deficits of the subsidiary state governments .
The ECB is admonished not to support failing State governments , and there is no fiscal competence at the federal level either to make inter-regional transfers in response to asymmetric shocks or to support the ECB in meeting the burden of bailing out a failing State government .
So the federal government in the EU neither can , nor wants to , carry out its part in the kind of implicit bargains observed in other federal systems .
Once markets begin to perceive a nation as a “ weak ” issuer , they can effectively shut down a nation ’s ability to stabilize conditions within its borders .
This is the fundamental weakness of the euro zone that we have warned about since its inception .
This means that bonds issued by Greece , Portugal , Ireland , and Italy are perceived to be instruments with less liquidity than those issued by Germany , France , or Finland .
Even though the government debt of all member states is homogenous in terms of denomination , bonds issued by the smaller countries “ will not have the same liquidity as those of larger countries ” ( The Irish Times 2009 ) .
On the one hand , we admire the willingness of the EU and Euroland to embrace its new members .
On the other hand , we suspect that expansion has made the prospects for changing the structure of the union virtually impossible .
Hence , there remains the possibility of a trend toward dissolution rather than greater unification .

An extremely rare 400 - year - old Chinese map , which put the emerging superpower at the centre of the world , went on display yesterday at the Library of Congress in Washington .
Inspiring delight and reverence from the world 's leading cartographers , it is the first Chinese map to combine both eastern and western cartography and show the Americas .
The document , which became the second most expensive rare map ever sold when it was bought for $ 1 m by the James Ford Bell Trust in October , is the work of Matteo Ricci , an Italian Jesuit missionary from Italy .
One of the first westerners to live in what is now Beijing in the early 1600s , Ricci was famed for introducing western science to China , where he created the map in 1602 at the request of Emperor Wanli .
Shown publicly for the first time in North America , the map provides an impressively detailed vision of the different regions of the world with pictures and annotations .
Africa is noted as having the world 's highest mountain and longest river , while Florida is identified as " the Land of Flowers " .
A description of North America mentions " humped oxen " or bison and wild horses , and there is even a reference to the little - known region of " Ka-na -ta " .
Ricci , revered and buried in his adopted home , provided a brief description of the discovery of the Americas .
" In olden days , nobody had ever known that there were such places as North and South America or Magellanica , " he wrote , using a label that early mapmakers gave to Australia and Antarctica .
" But a hundred years ago , Europeans came sailing in their ships to parts of the sea coast , and so discovered them . "
The map also includes several places in Central and South American , including " Wa - ti - ma - la " ( Guatemala ) , " Yu - ho - t' ang " ( Yucatan ) and " Chih - Li " ( Chile ) .
Ricci's map , which measures 3.6 by 1.5 meters and is printed on six rolls of delicate rice paper , has become something of a holy grail for map experts , earning the nickname the " Impossible Black Tulip of Cartography " because its discovery proved so elusive .
The Ricci map , one of only two to survive in good condition , will be displayed alongside another of the world 's rarest maps , the Waldseemuller world map , bought by the library for $ 10 m in 2003 .
For those who cannot make the pilgrimage to Washington , there will still be the chance to see the precious document .
The Library plans to scan the map for the World Digital Library , so scholars and students around the world can pore over it online .
Ford W Bell , co-trustee of the James Ford Bell Trust , and grandson of General Mills founder James Ford Bell , said the map was " one of the most significant cartographical documents ever produced " .
He added : " The map brings together the best of western science , mathematics and geography to respectfully show China , the western hemisphere and five continents in their relative positions . "
The map , held for years by a private collector in Japan , made its way to the US via London , where it was bought from rare book seller Bernard J Shapero .
It will eventually reside in the Bell Library at the University of Minnesota .
A crisis is unfolding that no one is talking about .
It 's not financial .
And it 's not about oil .
Yet scores of Fortune 500 companies are worried about it .
And at the same time , dozens of companies are salivating over the opportunity it presents .
The crisis revolves around water or , more precisely , the growing lack of it .
Of course , the steady supply of freshwater has been in question for some time now .
Whether from increased demand , out - of - control pollution , population growth , or changing weather patterns ... the political and business worlds are seriously worried about future water supply scenario .
The worry has grown so much that several extensive studies have recently been commissioned to determine the possible outcomes of a water - constrained world .
( These are studies that relate to the business aspect — not the humanitarian aspect — for which the UN and other bodies already have endless research . )
Results from those studies will not only surprise you , they can provide you with the insight necessary to walk away with handsome profits in the water industry .

The Widening Water Gap
Some of the most startling conclusions I 've seen came from a report put out by McKinsey & Company called , Charting our water future : Economic frameworks to inform decision - making .
The report was commissioned by the World Bank in conjunction with such stalwarts as Coca Cola , Nestle SA , and Syngenta , among others .
The main takeaway from the report is that demand for water already exceeds supply .
But it also put forth some great data , statistics , and models that show just how valuable water will become over the next few decades .
For investors , the most important sentence of the entire report is this one :
By 2030 , under an average economic growth scenario and if no efficiency gains are assumed , global water requirements would grow from 4,500 billion m3 today ( or 4.5 thousand cubic kilometers ) to 6,900 billion m 3 ... this is a full 40 percent above current accessible , reliable supply .
Reverting to elementary school word problems , that means we 'll need 10 apples .
But there will only be six available .
The report concludes that it will take " an annual capital requirement of approximately $ 50 to $ 60 billion to close the water resource availability gap . "
That 's if we take the " least costly " route , which includes drastic increases in efficiency .
That amount , spent every year until 2030 , comes out to a cool $ 1.2 trillion .
Finding Drops in the Bucket
I 've often heard proposed solutions to our energy and water woes referred to as a drop in the bucket .
But when your bucket holds $ 1.2 trillion , finding a few drops is all you need .
A good place to start is knowing the respective cost levels for various proposed water solutions .
You can be sure the cheapest measures will be taken first , followed by more costly measures .
You should invest accordingly .
And from a bird 's - eye view , cost structures for water solutions closely mirror those for energy solutions ...
Efficiency is by far the cheapest approach , so those measures will be taken first .
Some of those ideas — like taking shorter showers — are not investable .
But others have a massive profit angle , like smart water meters provided by Itron Inc. ( NASDAQ : ITRI ) , or advanced agricultural irrigation equipment made by Lindsay Corp . ( NYSE : LNN ) .
Solutions like these are attractive because of their low capital costs ( or savings ) compared to the costs for addressing supply - side challenges .
And as with energy ... after efficiency is tackled , supply must be addressed .
We can't make more water , so supply - side efforts will center around distribution infrastructure .
This will mean heavy investment in environmental engineering , new treatments plants , and billions worth of new parts ( pumps , valves ) and pipes .
There 's a bevy a public companies that will benefit as this spending gets underway .
To get broad access , you 'll want to be holding a water exchange traded fund ( ETF ) .
The PowerShares Global Water ( NYSE : PIO ) has already started to pull away as billions of stimulus dollars are poured on the sector :
You may want to check out a few others , as well .
But to really harness the coming bull , seeking out the best individual companies is a must .
This new report will help you do just that .
From irrigation to purification to desalination ...
I 've sifted through hundreds of water stocks to find the best one for my readers .
I truly expect 2010 to be a breakout year for the water sector , so make sure you do n't miss out .
Have a great holiday ,
Nick

Participants were asked to choose the sound that corresponded to the story People are able to recognise negative sounds , like expressions of disgust , across cultures , say scientists .
A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences tested understanding between two groups .
Westerners were compared to semi-nomadic people from a remote area of Namibia in southern Africa .
The researchers found sounds indicating negative emotions were widely understood by both groups but positive emotions were mainly culture - specific .
Dr Disa Sauter from University College London travelled into remote northern Namibia to find members of the semi-nomadic Himba people to take part .
" It was important to find a group which had not had cultural exchanges with other groups , " said Dr Sauter .
Both groups enjoyed the experiments .
" The people we tested seemed to find the task hilarious .
It was fun to do a task that most people enjoy , which for psychology experiments is n't always the case , " she added .
The participants were told short emotional stories , for example , a sad one .
They were then played two sounds , one sad and one representing another emotion , and asked to match the corresponding sound with the story .
Universal laughter
If someone tastes something and goes ' eeeurgh ' that 's ... got a much more basic role
Professor Sophie Scott
University College London
The so called " basic " emotions of anger , sadness , fear , disgust and surprise were most identifiable .
Happiness was divided up into achievement or triumph , relief , amusement and sensual pleasure .
Only amusement , signified by laughter , translated well .
" It 's rather nice that laughter has this apparent universality and it would make sense , " said Professor Sophie Scott , another member of the research team .
" Laughter would seem to be found in all human cultures and humans are n't the only mammals that laugh . "
Professor Scott explained that communicating negative emotions is important .
" If I make an angry sound it 's important that you should know what that means and if I make a fearful sound it 's important you recognise that too because it might be because of something that would scare you too . "
The scientists believe that positive emotions may not travel as well because they are used in more culture - specific ways to manage social bonds .
Cheering for example was not recognised .
" If someone tastes something and pulls a disgusted face and goes ' eeeurgh ' that 's forming quite a different role .
It 's not to do with group cohesion .
It 's got a much more basic role saying ' stay away from that ' , " said Professor Scott .
The researchers plan to look next at why some emotional expressions are infectious , such as laughter , and the social role that plays .

“ ‘ There is exactly one overriding question in contemporary philosophy . . . .
How do we fit in ? . . .
How can we square this self - conception of ourselves as mindful , meaning - creating , free , rational , etc. , agents with a universe that consists entirely of mindless , meaningless , unfree , nonrational , brute physical particles ? ’
For the scientific naturalist , the answer is , ‘ Not very well . ’ ”

In other respects this man was pleasant and fun .
He was a good teacher .
What if I told and he was taken away ?
That might upset my parents .
I felt I could not tell my parents because of the friendship they had with him ; also because I had not fought back , and at least initially had enjoyed some of the acts .
Any mother or father would be mortified and feel guilt if their child felt they could not so confide .
This guilt is wrong because they are also victims of this man .
A person 's social setting also has an influence on how they deal with such things and whether they tell anyone .
My family were , and are , decent people .
They are known by many in the church and from other connections .
I thought of the incredible furore that would ensue if I told them .
There is absolutely no fault that can be aimed at my parents – but still they would always have felt ill about this .
Japan on Saturday morning launched an intelligence - gathering satellite to spy on North Korea 's military facilities .
The optical satellite carries devices that can distinguish objects on the ground with a resolution of 60 cm and will supply the highest - definition photographs of all Japanese reconnaissance satellites , which have a resolution of up to 1 m .
Japan improved the definition when regulations were eased in August last year and is hoping to enhance it further to the level of American commercial satellites , which have a resolution of up to 40 cm .
Tokyo decided to develop the new satellites right after the North test - fired a long - range missile in 1998 .
Since then , it has launched five satellites .
The latest will replace the first , launched in 2003 , which has reached the end of its life cycle .
Two more optical and radar satelli tes are to be launched by 2011 .
Transport Minister Seiji Maehara , who is in charge of Japan 's space development , said the new optical satellite is the " core of the satellite system for Japan 's security .
It 's important for Japan to gather intelligence on its own . "
The satellite was carried by an H2A rocket developed by Japan with its own technology .
People have a hard time predicting the future especially when it comes to economic behavior .
Many people saw the housing boom and bust but few had the wherewithal to take action at optimal points .
Once the herd catches wind , it is usually too late .
How many people rushed in at the tail end of the technology bubble only to see their investments vaporize into thin air ?
How many people overpaid for homes during this boom only to be left with mortgages that do n’t reflect the value of the item they are supposed to reflect ?
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve know full well that bubbles and their subsequent busts are only part of human nature .
We learned painful lessons during the Great Depression and reigned in the banking sector .
It took a full generation to forget all those important rules of the road .
Yet we do n’t even need to go back so far .
We can look at the 1970s and 1980s to see how quickly things can spiral out of control with mortgage rates and all things connected to the interest rate .
I did some sleuthing and pulled up some fascinating articles in older newspapers showing how the typical mortgage rate went from 7.25 percent in the early 1970s to a record 17.5 percent in 1981 .
In less than a decade rates went up 100 + percent .
It is hard for people to imagine this but let us walk through what happened with the benefit of hindsight .
Let us chart out the average 30 year fixed mortgage , Fed funds rate , and CPI rate of change :
During the start of the 1970s the 30 year fixed mortgage rate started at 7.25 percent .
By the late 1970s the rate was already over 10 percent and by 1981 it reached a peak at approximately 17.5 percent .
The 30 year fixed rate did n’t go under 10 percent again for another five years until 1986 .
The Federal Reserve with the help of Paul Volcker brought inflation under control by raising the Fed funds rate over 17.5 percent .
Unlike the current U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve , we had someone at the head of the ship concerned with the viability of the dollar and put mortgages on the back burner .
This current Fed and Treasury is concerned more with appeasing the crony bankers on Wall Street .
But let us walk through the above chronologically with snippets from papers :
The Milwaukee Journal – Jul 6 , 1973
Competing with other forms of deposit vehicles , banks and savings and loans were allowed to raise interest rates to attract money .
As you might remember Americans were actually saving some money at this time so banks did have to compete for major deposits instead of getting massive bailouts from the government .
So banks started increasing their deposit rates .
At the time mortgage rates were around 7.75 percent on 30 year fixed loans .
Some did n’t think rates could go up much higher during this time but then again as we are now finding out forecasting is not a strong skill of the financial sector .
Sarasota Herald - Tribune – Feb 16 , 1975
You have to remember that in the early 1970s the U.S. went off the gold standard .
What followed was rampant inflation .
The U.S. basically decided to give itself a 30 year deficit spending party that is now finally coming to an end .
The above is a fascinating advertisement from 1975 .
Rates are now moving on up .
By 1975 the 30 year fixed mortgage is now up to 9 percent but home prices are going up .
This was the decade of stagflation but incomes were also going up so there was a form of balance at least .
The ad is interesting because it talks about buying today assuming home prices will go up no matter what .
So what if rates go lower ?
This ad was for a product that locked in your rate should rates go down .
Today , we have nowhere to go but up .
You ca n’t go any lower than the zero bound .
Our current predicament is a troubling one .
The CPI for the entire decade looking at owner ’s equivalent of rent completely missed the entire housing bubble .
The biggest item in a household balance sheet and the entire CPI missed it .
So when we look at our first chart , inflation might seem subdued during the 2000s but it was running rampant in housing prices .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve knew this so housing prices going up was of no worry ; in fact this was their desired goal .
But as the 1970s went further into inflation madness , things started getting out of hand .
Eugene Register - Guard – Oct 11 , 1979
Now the above piece is fascinating .
When was the last time you saw the National Association of Home Builders attack the Federal Reserve ?
The Fed at this time had its eyes set on controlling inflation and commodity speculation .
This was the goal .
In our current crisis it seems that getting people to buy homes no matter what is the ultimate goal .
People forget that during these times many sellers were allowing borrowers to assume their mortgages at their old lower rates .
This was common practice .
Today many loans have a clause that force new buyers to get a new loan to pay off an old one .
Welcome to the new world of finance .
By 1979 mortgage rates were reaching 14 percent .
Home building was already taking a hit .
Inflation was running rampant .
The Fed was jacking up the Fed funds rate fast and aggressively .
Yet today , the fear of inflation is largely absent .
Or is it ?
For the entire decade the CPI missed the biggest housing inflation ever recorded .
So where are we really ?
If our best measure is not looking at the entire picture then something is amiss .
That is why I have argued that the BLS with the CPI and employment numbers does n’t really reflect reality .
By 1981 mortgage rates hit their peak .
St. Petersburg Times – May 7 , 1981
Mortgage rates hit a massive peak topping in at 17.5 percent .
Can you imagine a 17.5 percent interest rate today ?
Can you imagine getting 17 percent in your savings account ?
It is hard to even imagine such a time but that was 1981 .
Today you are lucky to get 0.5 percent on your savings account even though the U.S. dollar is getting slammed into oblivion by the Federal Reserve .
By 1981 the Fed was winning the battle against inflation but housing was taking it on the chin .
Apparently saving our economy was more important than saving Wall Street and the housing industry .
Today , the Fed is more concerned about the banks and the housing industry than the actual real economy .
Remember those previous articles from the 1970s ?
Did anyone see these rates coming ?
Absolutely not .
And this is an important case study in behavioral economics .
Today does not equal tomorrow .
So those thinking interest rates can stay this low forever are out to lunch .
Higher rates will crush prices further .
But by 1982 with the Fed controlling inflation mortgage rates also came lower .
N.Y . Times , October 24 , 1982
“ ( NY Times ) Prices will not rise soon , Mr. Downs said , because ” there is a tremendous supply of houses on the market – for the next six months or a year , I think prices will remain relatively flat . ”
Mr. Downs and others believe that lower interest rates will lead to less seller financing .
One commonly held theory among housing and real - estate specialists is that interest rates must get back down to 12 percent before most families will be able to afford to buy a home .
But even though rates on mortgages guaranteed by the government may be at 12.5 percent , different lenders have different forces to respond to and it could take time before many of them drop their rates that low .
Many savings and loan associations cannot afford to offer such low rates because they are paying high rates to depositors ; some types of savings accounts are paying 16.55 percent interest and will be for the next 18 months . ”
12 percent to make homes affordable ?
Hah ! 12 percent today would rock the entire market to its foundation .
Yet the Fed did manage to control inflation and mortgage rates went lower and lower until they went under 10 percent in 1986 .
But this was a decade of high mortgage rates .
To think what we are going through right now is normal is wrong .
The average 30 year mortgage rate over 40 years is 9 percent .
Do you think we can handle a 9 percent rate ?
Some will argue that rates are low because they reflect low inflation risk and the Fed can print freely .
Yet the risk is appearing in the declining U.S. dollar .
The mainstream media seems to ignore this but something else similar happened in the 1970s .
Gold soared :
Source : BBC
In the 1970s gold went from $ 35 an ounce in 1970 to nearly $ 850 in 1980 .
This was a reflection of the U.S. coming off the gold standard but also rampant inflation .
So if we had little to no inflation this decade , why is gold now up over $ 1,100 ?
Because the U.S. dollar is tanking , that is why .
And why would n’t it be ?
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve , unlike Paul Volcker , only care about Wall Street and the banks since they are governed by crony politics .
They are more worried about people buying homes with no jobs than getting people to have jobs with good wages so they can buy homes .
It really is backwards .
That is why anytime the U.S. dollar makes a strong move up gold gets slammed but also the stock market .
I ’m no gold bug but I do follow the markets .
In the 1970s gold shot up because of the U.S. going off the dollar standard and rampant inflation .
Today , gold is rising more because the U.S. dollar is being crushed by the enormous amounts of debt .
The fact that we are bailing out banks with trillions is simply inexcusable with no actual reform on the table .
So what can we gather from the above ?
Over the next few years things are going to happen that many of us cannot predict .
The unemployment rate is still up at 10 percent and if we add in the underemployment rate , we are up to 17 percent .
The government is blowing through money that would be normal if we were entering a world war .
With banks offering 0 percent on savings accounts Americans are nearly forced to gamble in the stock market if they want any sort of return .
Social Security has already stated they will offer no cost of living adjustments for the next two years .
All the while the U.S. dollar is doing this :
A few things are certain :
- Mortgage rates can only go up .
We are at the lower bound .
It is a matter of when they go up .
- We will never ever pay off our debt .
Anyone who believes otherwise does not understand arithmetic .
We are spending more than what we are bringing in ?
Paying it off ?
Hah !
To the contrary , we are spending even more .
I doubt Keynes envisioned fiscal stimulus in the form of trillions to a select group of crony bankers .
- U.S. households are being crushed by enormous amounts of debt .
The Fed hopes to generate massive inflation so we can pay off current debts with cheaper dollars .
In their mind , big deal to have a $ 500,000 mortgage if the median income is $ 200,000 .
Clearly they are not following the employment market .
As we look at the 1970s and 1980s we can learn many things .
First , massive inflation is no party and this is what the Fed is trying to induce .
Second , many financial “ experts ” have no clue where things will be heading .
Yet spending more than you earn never ends well .
The signs are all there .
We just need to be open to history and listen to what it is telling us .

If you want to encourage the kind of conspiracy theories that have prospered in the wake of last year ’s financial crisis — those that describe a secret cabal of elites running the world — try doing the following :
1 . Have a group of 30 high - powered economists , government officials and bankers meet under the auspices of an international group that shares ideas on how to run the global financial architecture .
2 . Make sure the group ’s name can be reduced to a “ G ” and a number .
( In mimicking the G7 or the G20 , this keeps outsiders guessing :
Are these guys from the government , or the private sector ?
Is there a difference ? )
3 . Have your Board of Trustees led by an influential former Federal Reserve chairman who ’s now working as a senior advisor to the president of the United States .
4 . Name the former vice chairman of bailout behemoth AIG as the group ’s Chairman and CEO .
( Also , if you want to reach the Zionist conspiracy theorists , it helps that he and another prominent member of the Group have very close ties to Israel . )
5 . Ensure that membership includes the likes of these : A former Treasury Secretary and president of Harvard who also now works as a top presidential economic advisor ; an outspoken liberal economist - cum New York Times columnist ; Citigroup ’s senior vice chairman ; and top representatives of the world ’s four most important central banks .
6 . Hold two days of closed - door meetings at the New York Fed , scene of many a desperate deal to rescue the financial sector in 2008 , conveniently located a few blocks from Goldman Sachs .
7 . Do not publicize a list of attendees and leave everyone guessing about the agenda .
These were the circumstances surrounding Friday ’s start to the 62nd plenary meetings of the Group of 30 , whose formal name is “ The Consultative Group on International Economic and Monetary Affairs , Inc . ”
Journalists were given a modicum of access : a preliminary sit - down inside the New York Fed ’s fortress on Thursday afternoon with G30 Chairman Jacob Frenkel , the ex-AIG vice chairman and former governor of the Bank of Israel .
Frenkel and two other G30 members — Stanley Fischer , a former IMF deputy managing director and the current governor of the Bank of Israel , and Arminio Fraga , ex-president of the Central Bank of Brazil and one - time managing director of Soros Fund Management — shared their thoughts on matters such as the disequilibrium in the global balance of payments , IMF reform , monetary stimulus exit strategies and central bank independence .
But that was it .
All that ’s known about the meeting itself is that attendance is expected from most of the remaining 27 members , a group that includes the following luminaries : Paul Volcker , the chairman of the G30’s Board of Trustees and currently head of President Obama ’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board ; Lawrence Summers , director of the White House ’s National Economic Council ; Paul Krugman of Princeton and the New York Times ’ opinion page ; Citigroup ’s William Rhodes ; European Central Bank President Jean - Claude Trichet ; Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa ; San Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen ; and Mervyn King , the governor of the Bank of England .
This is far less sinister than a conspiracy theorist would have it .
The G30 , which was founded in 1978 with the worthy goal of encouraging brainstorming between leading financial and economic minds from both the private and public sectors , is essentially a powerless institution .
Unlike the G20 , it does not have the weight of official authority behind it .
Its proposals can only have effect if governments choose to follow them .
In fact , the Group ’s proposals — often on arcane matters such as IMF governance — are usually eminently sensible and broadly in the public interest .
But in this climate , when the general public ’s seething anger against central bankers and their Wall Street counterparts is manifesting in the backlash led by Ron Paul ’s “ End the Fed ” groupies , a more open - door approach to the G30 meeting might have been more constructive .

Supreme Court considers whether prosecutors can hold offenders beyond their original sentences
The Supreme Court will hear two cases about the rights of defendants in the criminal justice system .
One of the cases , challenges a law that gives the government the authority to keep convicted sex offenders behind bars after their sentences have been completed .
In another case , lawyers contested the right of criminal defendants to question the lab technicians who compile forensic evidence reports .
The sex offender case is perhaps the more controversial of the two .
It deals with the Adam Walsh Child Protection Act of 2006 , a law named after the murdered son of America 's Most Wanted host John Walsh .
The law allows the government to detain indefinitely those who are deemed " sexually dangerous . "
It also established the national sex offender registry and strengthened child pornography laws .
The act exceeds Congress 's authority , according to the defendants .
( The registry and pornography aspects of the law are not being challenged in the case before the Supreme Court . )
One of the respondents , Graydon Earl Comstock , was certified as " sexually dangerous " six days before the end of his 37 - month prison sentence for receiving child pornography .
As a result , he has remained imprisoned in North Carolina 's Butner penitentiary for more than three years , one of more than 60 other people in that state being held because of the law .
Both the district and appellate courts agreed that the law allowing him to be held without new evidence of criminal behavior was unconstitutional .
The Justice Department is fighting to keep the law on the books .
The case is an interesting one in part because of the ideological coalition that opposes the current law .
Liberals , conservatives , and libertarians alike have bristled at the dangerous precedent they think the law represents .
The high court should overturn the " blatant government overreach , " Randy Barnett and David Rittgers , both from the libertarian Cato Institute , wrote in an amicus brief .
The high court heard a case dealing with the " confrontation clause " in the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution , which gives defendants the right to challenge in court those who accuse them of crimes .
The case , Briscoe v. Virginia , is a response of sorts to a case heard last summer , Melendez - Diaz v. Massachusetts , in which justices ruled in a 5 - to - 4 decision that defendants have the right to cross -examine the forensic lab technicians who compiled evidence for their case .
Implementing that ruling has proved problematic , in part , because putting technicians on the stand reduces the time they have to work on other cases .
At issue in the Briscoe case is the state of Virginia 's contention that a " certificate of a forensic laboratory analysis " is enough to satisfy the constitutional requirement that a defendant can confront his accuser .
Forcing the actual forensic analyst to testify is not necessary , prosecutors argue .
The defendant , Mark Briscoe , was charged with possession of cocaine after the state crime lab concluded that the drug was present in the defendant 's car .
Briscoe disputed that the substance found in his house and car was indeed cocaine .
In court , the state presented only certificates from the crime lab , rather than making the expert available for testimony .
Defense attorneys contend that the onus to provide technicians ' testimony is minimal , but prosecutors disagree , saying that technicians ' time already is overwhelmed with processing evidence and that their testimony is nearly always routine .
Backlogs in evidence - processing at crime labs can stretch for years , a problem exacerbated by shrinking state budgets .
Two months ago , 26 attorneys general from around the country said that requiring testimony is " proving unworkable . "
Justice Sonia Sotomayor will be a key vote in the case , particularly as a former prosecutor , but her views on the case are unclear .
( C ) 2010 U.S. News & World Report
04 January 2010
Annual industry data released by the Department of Energy show that shipments of PV in 2008 reached 986,504 kW , comprised of 586,558 kW of imports and 462,252 kW of exports .
There were 66 companies involved in the survey behind ‘ Solar Photovoltaic Cell / Module Manufacturing Activities 2008 .'
In 1999 , 19 companies shipped 76,787 kW , of which 4,784 kW were imports and 55,585 kW in exports .
The total shipments in 2008 were up 90 % from levels reported in 2007 .
“ This surge in growth was partly due to the 30 % federal investment tax credit for commercial photovoltaic projects and the 30 % investment tax credit , capped at US $ 2,000 for residential photovoltaic projects , set to expire on December 31 , 2008 , ” the report explains .
“ In response , the solar industry rushed to complete projects by the end of 2008 as the deadline for the investment tax credits drew near . ”
In October 2008 , President Obama signed the Emergency Economic Stabilization
Act of 2008 into law , which extends the 30 % solar investment tax credits for eight years until 2016 .
The Act also eliminates the US$ 2,000 cap on residential PV installations and allows public utilities to claim the solar investment tax credits .
The number of active PV manufacturers or importers that ship PV cells and modules increased 43 % from 46 companies in 2007 to 66 in 2008 , which is “ one indication that the emerging solar market has become attractive to investors desiring to start or expand businesses in this market . ”
Of these companies , 20 expect to introduce crystalline silicon products , 11 plan to introduce new thin - film products , and two expect to provide new concentrator photovoltaic products in 2009 , which indicates that “ many companies believe that stronger government support in the United States will fuel new market expansion . ”
Employment in PV - related activities increased 82 % from 6,170 person - years ( PY ) in 2007 to 11,245 PY in 2008 .
This compares with 19 companies providing 2,013 PV of employment in 1999 .
In 2008 , the average conversion efficiency for crystalline silicon ( single - crystal ) PV was 19 % , 14 % for cast , 13 % for ribbon , 8 % for thin - film ( amorphous silicon ) PV , 12 % for thin - film CdTe or CIGS , and 34 % for concentrator PV cell / module .
Revenue for the US industry doubled in one year , from US $ 1.7 billion in 2007 to US$ 3.3 bn in 2008 , even though the average price went only from US $ 3.37 per peak watt for modules and US $ 2.22 for cells in 2007 , to US $ 3.49 and US $ 1.94 respectively in 2008 .
Although the market for thin - film modules has grown steadily for many years , crystalline silicon continues to dominate the PV industry and accounted for 67 % of total shipments in 2008 , the report notes .
The easing shortage of raw high - purity silicon contributed to a doubling of crystalline silicon shipments but crystalline silicon “ still faces a long - term downward trend in market share of previous years .
In response to demand and competition , many crystalline silicon cell and module manufacturers have been working to minimize the use of silicon , increase efficiency , and decrease manufacturing cost .

The Federal Government has ruled out supporting a Senate inquiry into the Church of Scientology .
Last month Independent Senator Nick Xenophon called for an inquiry into the church and its tax - free status after raising allegations of criminal conduct by the church .
Senator Xenophon told Parliament he had received letters from former followers detailing claims of abuse , false imprisonment and forced abortion .
" I am deeply concerned about this organisation and the devastating impact it can have on its followers , " he told the Senate .
" Do you want Australian tax exemptions to be supporting an organisation that coerces its followers into having abortions ?
Do you want to be supporting an organisation that defrauds , that blackmails , that falsely imprisons ?
" Because on the balance of evidence provided by victims of Scientology , you probably are . "
But a spokesman for Government Senate Leader Chris Evans says it is not the role of Parliament to inquire into those matters .
He says the Government believes the allegations should be dealt with by the Taxation Commissioner and police .
At the time of Senator Xenophon 's allegations , a spokeswoman for the church , Virginia Stewart , said she was shocked to hear the claims , as no-one within the church seemed disgruntled .
Ms Stewart said the church tried to contact Senator Xenophon earlier this year after he spoke about Scientology on television but " he did n't even bother to reply " .

The Holocaust We Will Not See
Avatar half - tells a story we would all prefer to forget
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 11th January 2010
Avatar , James Cameron ’s blockbusting 3 - D film , is both profoundly silly and profound .
It ’s profound because , like most films about aliens , it is a metaphor for contact between different human cultures .
But in this case the metaphor is conscious and precise : this is the story of European engagement with the native peoples of the Americas .
It ’s profoundly silly because engineering a happy ending demands a plot so stupid and predictable that it rips the heart out of the film .
The fate of the native Americans is much closer to the story told in another new film , The Road , in which a remnant population flees in terror as it is hunted to extinction .
But this is a story no one wants to hear , because of the challenge it presents to the way we choose to see ourselves .
Europe was massively enriched by the genocides in the Americas ; the American nations were founded on them .
This is a history we cannot accept .
In his book American Holocaust , the US scholar David Stannard documents the greatest acts of genocide the world has ever experienced ( 1 ) .
In 1492 , some 100 m native peoples lived in the Americas .
By the end of the 19th Century almost all of them had been exterminated .
Many died as a result of disease .
But the mass extinction was also engineered .
When the Spanish arrived in the Americas , they described a world which could scarcely have been more different from their own .
Europe was ravaged by war , oppression , slavery , fanaticism , disease and starvation .
The populations they encountered were healthy , well - nourished and mostly ( with exceptions like the Aztecs and Incas ) peacable , democratic and egalitarian .
Throughout the Americas the earliest explorers , including Columbus , remarked on the natives ’ extraordinary hospitality .
The conquistadores marvelled at the amazing roads , canals , buildings and art they found , which in some cases outstripped anything they had seen at home .
None of this stopped them from destroying everything and everyone they encountered .
The butchery began with Columbus .
He slaughtered the native people of Hispaniola ( now Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) by unimaginably brutal means .
His soldiers tore babies from their mothers and dashed their heads against rocks .
They fed their dogs on living children .
On one occasion they hung 13 Indians in honour of Christ and the 12 disciples , on a gibbet just low enough for their toes to touch the ground , then disembowelled them and burnt them alive .
Columbus ordered all the native people to deliver a certain amount of gold every three months ; anyone who failed had his hands cut off .
By 1535 the native population of Hispaniola had fallen from 8 m to zero : partly as a result of disease , partly as a result of murder , overwork and starvation .
The conquistadores spread this civilising mission across central and south America .
When they failed to reveal where their mythical treasures were hidden , the indigenous people were flogged , hanged , drowned , dismembered , ripped apart by dogs , buried alive or burnt .
The soldiers cut off women ’s breasts , sent people back to their villages with their severed hands and noses hung round their necks and hunted Indians with their dogs for sport .
But most were killed by enslavement and disease .
The Spanish discovered that it was cheaper to work Indians to death and replace them than to keep them alive : the life expectancy in their mines and plantations was three to four months .
Within a century of their arrival , around 95 % of the population of South and Central America had been destroyed .
In California during the 18th Century the Spanish systematised this extermination .
A Franciscan missionary called Junipero Serra set up a series of “ missions ” : in reality concentration camps using slave labour .
The native people were herded in under force of arms and made to work in the fields on one fifth of the calories fed to African - American slaves in the 19th century .
They died from overwork , starvation and disease at astonishing rates , and were continually replaced , wiping out the indigenous populations .
Junipero Serra , the Eichmann of California , was beatified by the Vatican in 1988 .
He now requires one more miracle to be pronounced a saint ( 2 ) .
While the Spanish were mostly driven by the lust for gold , the British who colonised North America wanted land .
In New England they surrounded the villages of the native Americans and murdered them as they slept .
As genocide spread westwards , it was endorsed at the highest levels .
George Washington ordered the total destruction of the homes and land of the Iroquois .
Thomas Jefferson declared that his nation ’s wars with the Indians should be pursued until each tribe “ is exterminated or is driven beyond the Mississippi ” .
During the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864 , troops in Colorado slaughtered unarmed people gathered under a flag of peace , killing children and babies , mutilating all the corpses and keeping their victims ’ genitals to use as tobacco pouches or to wear on their hats .
Theodore Roosevelt called this event “ as rightful and beneficial a deed as ever took place on the frontier . ”
The butchery has n’t yet ended : last month the Guardian reported that Brazilian ranchers in the western Amazon , having slaughtered all the rest , tried to kill the last surviving member of a forest tribe ( 3 ) .
Yet the greatest acts of genocide in history scarcely ruffle our collective conscience .
Perhaps this is what would have happened had the Nazis won the second world war : the Holocaust would have been denied , excused or minimised in the same way , even as it continued .
The people of the nations responsible – Spain , Britain , the US and others – will tolerate no comparisons , but the final solutions pursued in the Americas were far more successful .
Those who commissioned or endorsed them remain national or religious heroes .
Those who seek to prompt our memories are ignored or condemned .
This is why the right hates Avatar .
In the neocon Weekly Standard , John Podhoretz complains that the film resembles a “ revisionist western ” in which “ the Indians became the good guys and the Americans the bad guys . ” (4) He says it asks the audience “ to root for the defeat of American soldiers at the hands of an insurgency . ”
Insurgency is an interesting word for an attempt to resist invasion : insurgent , like savage , is what you call someone who has something you want .
L’Osservatore Romano , the official newspaper of the Vatican , condemned the film as “ just … an anti-imperialistic , anti-militaristic parable ” ( 5 ) .
But at least the right knows what it is attacking .
In the New York Times the liberal critic Adam Cohen praises Avatar for championing the need to see clearly ( 6 ) .
It reveals , he says , “ a well - known principle of totalitarianism and genocide – that it is easiest to oppress those we cannot see ” .
But in a marvellous unconscious irony , he bypasses the crashingly obvious metaphor and talks instead about the light it casts on Nazi and Soviet atrocities .
We have all become skilled in the art of not seeing .
I agree with its rightwing critics that Avatar is crass , mawkish and cliched .
But it speaks of a truth more important – and more dangerous – than those contained in a thousand arthouse movies .

Property prices in Nairobi are soaring , and Somali pirates are getting the blame .
The increase in real estate prices in the Kenyan capital has prompted a public outcry and a government investigation this month into property owned by foreigners .
The investigation follows allegations that millions of dollars in ransom money paid to Somali pirates are being invested in Kenya , Somalia 's southern neighbor and East Africa 's largest economy .
Even as housing prices have dropped sharply in the United States , prices in Nairobi have seen two - and threefold increases the past half decade .
" There is suspicion that some of the money that is being collected in piracy is being laundered by purchase of property in several countries , this one being one of them , " said government spokesman Alfred Mutua .
" Especially at this time when we are facing global challenges of security such as terrorism and others , it is very important for us to know who is where and who owns what . "
The investigation will also help the government catch tax evaders , he said .
Kenya may be the most attractive spot for pirates to launder their money because it shares a roughly 500 - mile border with Somalia and has investment opportunities , and a large Somali community of as many as 200,000 people , Mutua said .
In a neighborhood of Nairobi now called " Little Mogadishu " because of its Somali community , large businesses and apartment buildings have sprung up .
A similar explosion of real estate development can be seen in higher - income areas of the city .
Somali pirates have been paid more than $ 100 million in ransoms the past two years , said Roger Middleton , a piracy expert at the London think tank Chatham House .
The average ransom is also up , from $ 1 million per vessel a year ago to about $ 2 million today .
Pirates in Somalia say they invest their ransom money outside their war - torn country , including in Kenya .
One pirate who gave his name as Osman Afrah said he bought three trucks that transport goods across East Africa .
A second pirate , who only gave his name as Abdulle , said he 's investing in Kenya in preparation for leaving the pirate trade .
" Pirates have money not only in Nairobi but also other places like Dubai , Djibouti and others , " said Abdulle .
" I have invested through my brother , who is representing me , in Nairobi .
He 's got a big shop that sells clothes and general merchandise , so my future lies there , not in the piracy industry . "
Kenya also does not have stringent laws against money laundering , though a bill to curb the practice is being debated in parliament .
The U.S. State Department in its annual report by the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs describes Kenya as major money - laundering country .
The investigation has drawn angry reactions from the Somali community , and business leaders said Somalis would not cooperate with the investigation and may go to court to try to stop it .
" This is very , very unfair discrimination , " said Hassan Guled , the chairman of the Somali business community .
" We consider this order rubbish . "
Guled said Somalis living in Kenya have acquired property by pulling resources together and borrowing from banks .
Somalis here also depend on money sent by a large Somali population in Europe and America who cannot invest in those economies because of religious beliefs , Guled said .
Bellow Kerrow , a former member of parliament and a Kenyan national of Somali descent , said it is high demand , not money from piracy , that is behind the rise in property values .
But Pius Khaoya , a real estate agent , said factors outside the economy are influencing property prices .
" The prices have gone through the roof and it does not tally with the performance of the country 's economy , " said Khaoya , who works for Crystal Real Estate .
Khaoya said under normal circumstances in Kenya , it would take 10 years for property values to double , but that real estate prices have tripled in the past five years .
A real estate agent who spoke only on condition he was n't identified so as not to draw the wrath of Somali customers said some Somali businessmen pay double a property 's worth just to easily and quickly complete the sale .
Such a market puts home ownership out of reach for some Kenyans .
Frank Mbata said he left college 15 years ago with a plan to climb the corporate ladder and buy his dream home in Karen , a leafy up - market Nairobi suburb .
But because of a huge rise in property prices , a four - bedroom home in Karen that would have sold for $ 200,000 five years ago sells for $ 500,000 today .
" This is something I was aspiring for , but today it is not possible unless something drastically changes , " Mbata said .

No. 10 Element 114 Confirmed
In a cyclotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , a beam of calcium atoms slammed into a plutonium target , producing a pair of element 114 atoms for the second time in human history .
Years earlier , a Russian team made similar claims , but their accomplishment remained in doubt .
It turns out that the Russians were right .
But their results were somewhat disappointing .
Each atom lasted for only tenths of a second .
An older generation of scientists had hoped that humanity would someday find a way to make extremely heavy elements that last a long time .
That search continues .
No. 9 Progress Toward a Vaccine for Dengue Fever
Several vaccines for dengue fever , a disease that strikes roughly 230 million people each year , showed promise in preliminary human trials .
Larger scale tests began this year , and researchers should know just how effective they are by 2012 .
The most promising experimental vaccine is made by combining a crippled yellow fever virus with proteins that are produced by each variety of dengue fever .
In theory , those proteins can train the immune system to recognize and attack the deadly microbes .
Four thousand children in Thailand will get the shot , which may offer protection from all four types of the virus .
Earlier this year , researchers prematurely announced the first successful test of an HIV vaccine .
They claimed that two ineffective vaccines could offer a modicum of protection when combined .
But their analysis was too optimistic .
Other scientists were quick to tear down the findings .
Israel Institute of Technology
No. 8 Breathalyzer Detects Lung Cancer
Researchers at the Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa built a sensor that can smell cancer .
It uses gold nanoparticles to check for a telltale set of volatile organic chemicals that are emitted by malignant cells .
The device could be used to give patients an early warning that they have the disease , which should increase their odds of survival .
Each sensor has nine sets of gold nanoparticles .
When those sensing elements come in contact with a particular chemical , their electrical resistance changes in a predictable manner .
Other researchers have developed similar gadgets , but they do not perform well in high humidity , and human breath is pretty moist .
Mass spectrometers can also detect the distinctive aroma of melanoma or lung cancer , but they are bulky and not very user friendly .
No. 7 Computer Program Predicts Drug Side Effects
If you have a rare disease , do n't count on big drug companies to find a cure .
Your best shot is to find out whether drugs that are already approved by the FDA for other purposes might work as a remedy for your illness .
This year , a team of researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of California , San Francisco developed a computer program to do that .
Their software compares the shape of each drug to thousands of other drugs and natural chemicals , and uses that information to predict which biological buttons the drug can push .
By looking at the constellation of proteins the drug affects , they can predict how it may affect the body .
The program could help big pharma too .
Drug companies often spend millions of dollars testing the safety and effectiveness of a chemical , only to learn that it has unacceptable side effects or is useless .
With this simulation technique , they could catch those problems sooner and avoid costly mistakes .
No. 6 Jellyfish Stir Oceans
Until recently , marine animals were thought to play but a small part in stirring Earth 's waters .
Scientists thought that hydrological friction would absorb the forces of flippers and fins , just as desk fans can't stir air in buildings across the street .
But geophysicists underestimated the power of induced fluid drift , or the tendency of liquid to stick to a body as it moves through water .
In what is almost certainly the most poetic discovery of 2009 , studies now suggest that jellyfish may stir the oceans with as much power as winds and tides .
No. 5 Bisphenol A in Plastics Harms Humans
For years , the plastic additive Bisphenol A was the center of a bitter environmental health battle .
Researchers pointed to studies showing that its estrogen - mimicking qualities caused cancer and developmental damage in laboratory animals , and might do the same in people .
Plastic manufacturers said animal tests were no substitute for human studies , which did n't exist .
The U.S. public — of whom 90 percent have detectable levels of BPA in their bodies — was caught in the crossfire .
In November , epidemiologists produced a study of BPA in humans .
In 164 male Chinese factory workers exposed to high levels of BPA , severe sexual dysfunction was rampant .
Their exposures were far higher than most people , but it can no longer be argued that BPA affects only lab animals , not people .
No .
4 Life Extension Breakthrough ( for Rodents )
In the first major pharmaceutical extension of lifespan in a mammal , scientists gave elderly mice Rapamycin , an immunosuppressant used to slow cell growth in cancer patients .
After taking the drug , the rodents lived a mouse equivalent of 13 extra years .
Even longtime longevity - enhancement skeptics were stunned by the results , which were duplicated independently in multiple laboratories on different mouse strains , showing that whatever was responsible for the results was n't an accident .
There 's no way of knowing whether Rapamycin could theoretically extend human lifespans .
Because of the drug 's severe side effects , it 's unlikely that anyone will try it .
But the drug will be used in lab animals to investigate as - yet - unknown cellular mechanisms of aging , raising hopes that the human lifespan will someday be lengthened .
National Human Genome Research Institute .
No . 3 Schizophrenia in the Genome
When the Human Genome Project was roughly completed in 1999 , citizens and scientists alike expected that genetic explanations of complex diseases would soon follow .
When this did n't happen , researchers predicted that genome - wide association studies , which compare the genomes of thousands of people at a time , would find the genetic clues .
In July , three separate teams of researchers returned the results of just such a study for schizophrenia , a disease that had defied other attempts at genetic analysis .
The researchers analyzed more than 50,000 genomes in their search for clear disease patterns .
They did n't find them .
Instead they found approximately 10,000 genetic variants , each responsible for a miniscule percentage of disease risk .
Some commentators likened the results to a genomic Pearl Harbor , or the Battle of Dunkirk .
But though the findings set back the notion that complicated diseases have simple genetic explanations , they were not a scientific setback .
If anything , they were the opposite .
Researchers are now embracing the complexity of disease , treating those genes — and others found in similarly baffling genomic studies — as threads leading them to as - yet - undiscovered biological networks and interactions .
After all , an answer in the form of a puzzle is still an answer .

No. 2 Ardi Usurps Lucy
Ever since a 3.2 million - year - old Australopithecus afarensis skeleton named Lucy was unearthed from an Ethiopian riverbed in 1974 , humanity imagined that its first bipedal steps were taken on the savanna .
But in October , paleontologists unveiled Ardipithecus ramidus , or Ardi — an upright - walking primate who lived in Ethiopia a full million years before Lucy .
But rather than dwelling in the savanna , Ardi evolved in light woodlands
Moreover , Ardi — the closest creature we have to the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees — looked far less chimplike than expected .
It 's not just Homo sapiens who 've evolved , it 's the other great apes too .
Whether Ardi falls directly on the evolutionary branch that produced humans , or belongs to an early offshoot , is still being argued .
But there 's no argument about Ardi 's importance .

No . 1 Gene Therapy Makes a Comeback
This year , four teams of gene - therapy researchers had major victories in finding ways to safely treat human volunteers .
Their success is all the sweeter after the years of tragedy and failure the field has suffered .
In 1999 , 18 - year - old Jesse Gelsinger died after receiving an experimental treatment for a liver disorder that would n't have been fatal otherwise .
His loss became a symbol of recklessness by genetics researchers .
Several years later , five children developed leukemia after receiving a gene that was meant to boost their immune systems .
To top it off , the first doctor to perform a gene - therapy procedure , French Anderson , is serving a lengthy prison sentence for child molestation .
Despite those setbacks , many scientists continued their work in the tumultuous area of research .
Nanotech researchers concocted dozens of tiny particles that may be able to carry fragile DNA and RNA through the bloodstream and into the cells where they 're needed .
Biologists have refined a method for clipping disease - causing DNA sequences out of any genome with extreme precision .
But the greatest success this year belongs to doctors who treated blindness , brain disorders , immune system deficiencies and a severe skin condition with an array of different gene - therapy techniques .
Two boys with X - linked adrenoleukodystrophy , a disease that ravages the brain , are doing well after French doctors gave them a gene that helps to maintain the delicate myelin coating on their nerve cells .
A woman with Pachyonychia Congenita , a painful skin condition , watched one of her sores fade after doctors switched off the offending protein with a newer kind of gene therapy called RNA interference .
Twelve patients who were blinded by Leber 's congenital amaurosis showed signs of recovery after getting a genetic treatment in one of their eyes .
Italian researchers announced that most of the 10 patients who received gene therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency , or " bubble boy disease , " are doing very well eight years after the procedure that repaired their defenses against infection .
Also this year , researchers at the University of Washington cured two adult monkeys of colorblindness by giving them injections of a gene that produces pigments necessary for color vision .
After the treatment , the animals scored higher on a computerized color blindness test .
In the coming years , gene therapy will be tested as a remedy for all sorts of inherited diseases , cancer , viral infections and even high cholesterol .

The first definitive history of the Clinton scandal is about to arrive .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Monica 's back - says Clinton lied
In the years since their bitter battle , both former President Bill Clinton and independent counsel Ken Starr have predicted they ’d be vindicated in the history books .
Now the first definitive history of the Clinton scandal is about to arrive — and neither man can be completely happy about his portrayal in its pages .
Advertisement
“ The Death of American Virtue , ” due out in February , asserts that Clinton had yet another extramarital affair , with Susan McDougal of Whitewater fame .
Also in the book , Monica Lewinsky tells author Ken Gormley that she believes the president lied under oath when he described their encounters .
At the same time , Gormley offers a harsh portrait of Starr as a man out of his depth and who lost all sense of proportion .
His interviews offer new ammunition to critics who contend the Lewinsky investigation was marred at its outset by improper questioning of Lewinsky in January 1998 by Starr ’s lieutenants , who continued to grill her even after she asked for a lawyer .
Two presidents later , the saga feels like a far - off chapter in the nation ’s history , but the book makes clear that the principals , including Clinton himself , remain keenly interested in squaring the historical record to their liking .
In three interviews with the author , Clinton makes clear — to no surprise of longtime observers of the 42nd president — how aggrieved he continues to feel over the whole episode , unspooling a stream of choice invective about his other accusers .
In Clinton ’s telling , the head of the House impeachment team , Henry Hyde , is a “ bitter right winger ” and “ hypocrite ” and the judge who cited Clinton for civil contempt was merely currying favor with the conservative wing of the GOP .
Through 769 pages , Gormley , a Duquesne University law professor , offers a detailed , even scholarly retelling of an epic saga of grand jury depositions , fevered partisans and a single stained blue dress that once transfixed a nation — but which many Americans are surely eager to leave in the past .
Even so , the book represents an attempt by a law professor and prominent legal pundit to write what he is billing as the most complete and evenhanded account of the tumultuous criminal investigation that explored Clinton ’s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky , nearly ended his presidency and ultimately boomeranged on Starr , staining the professional reputation of one of America ’s foremost constitutional scholars .
But with one of the principals still very much in the public eye — the former president turned globe - trotting chief of his own foundation — the revelations are sure to dredge up the unpleasant details of a president and prosecutor locked in legal combat .
Among the book ’s most attention - grabbing claims :
— Confirmation of a long - rumored romantic affair between Clinton and McDougal , an Arkansas woman who spent 18 months in jail for refusing to answer questions from Starr ’s prosecutors before a grand jury and later received a presidential pardon from Clinton .
Gormley writes he is now certain “ some intimate involvement did occur , ” though he will not say precisely how he knows it to be true .
“ I feel very , very comfortable with that conclusion after having conducted extensive interviews and seen documents that were not generally accessible to the public , ” Gormley told POLITICO .
While Gormley says his evidence confirms the long - standing suspicions of Starr ’s prosecutors that McDougal had a secret extramarital affair with Clinton , the author says he does not believe that entanglement , which took place years earlier , had anything to do with her refusal to testify about Bill and Hillary Clinton ’s involvement with the Whitewater land deal or with the president ’s decision to pardon her in 2001 .
McDougal has previously denied any affair with Bill Clinton .
Efforts to contact her for this article were unsuccessful .
— Lewinsky now believes Bill Clinton lied about their relationship during his grand jury testimony .
“ There was no leeway [ there ] on the veracity of his statements because they asked him detailed and specific questions to which he answered untruthfully , ” she wrote to Gormley earlier this year .
Longtime Clinton attorney David Kendall declined to comment .
— Starr ’s successor Robert Ray was prepared to indict Clinton soon after he left office if he did not agree to admit that he made false statements about Lewinsky under oath and accept disbarment .
Ray “ was ready to ‘ pull the trigger ’ if the conditions he imposed were not satisfied , ” Gormley writes , and had to be “ cajoled ” by a colleague into signing off on the final deal .
“ President Clinton would never fully grasp how close he came to being indicted , ” Gormley writes .
— Prosecutors on the case clashed with a special counsel who sharply criticized them for questioning Lewinsky without her attorney present during a pivotal Jan. 16 , 1998 , interview at a Pentagon City hotel .
“ I would n’t have touched her with a 10 - foot pole , ” said the lawyer hired to examine the episode , Jo Ann Harris , breaking her silence about her findings on the effort to lure in Lewinsky for questioning .
“ The minute she says , ‘ Can I call my lawyer ? ’ you stop … .
And when she says it for the sixth or seventh time , you really stop … .
There are limits . ”
Harris conceded that the department ’s formal policies on the issue were “ all over the place , ” but she maintained that Starr ’s deputies had been less than forthcoming with the Justice Department ’s inquiry into the matter and that at least one prosecutor showed “ poor judgment ” in the confrontation of Lewinsky .
Gormley also reports that Harris accused Ray of mischaracterizing her findings .
However , in an interview with POLITICO Thursday , Ray said , “ I do n’t believe I misrepresented what she said … .
It ’s not how I characterized it .
It ’s that I did n’t agree with it . ”
Ultimately , one of Starr ’s prosecutors hired an attorney who successfully persuaded a court panel to keep Harris ’s assessment of the episode under seal .
— Secret Service Director Lewis Merletti grew deeply suspicious and distrustful of the FBI as the investigation unfolded , believing that the agency was trying to entice him to conspire with Clinton .
Merletti claims that at an August 1998 conference , a senior FBI official shared negative lab results about a dress suspected of being stained with Clinton ’s DNA .
“ There ’s nothing there …that thing ’s clean , ” Merletti said the official told him without prompting .
The Secret Service chief felt the comment was a deliberate effort to see if he would pass the pivotal test results to the White House .
“ They ’re either trying to set me up , or they ’re trying to set the president up , or they ’re setting both of us up , ” Merletti told Gormley .
The top Secret Service agent said he resolved at the time not to mention the episode to anyone .
Later , Merletti was subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury two days before Clinton left office and just as Ray was still trying to hash out a deal with the departing president .
The Secret Service head recalls an unusually confrontational interview at the Justice Department where an FBI agent accused him of covering up Clinton ’s trysts with Lewinsky in exchange for the director ’s job and help procuring women for himself .
“ There ’s only one person left who can give us the president of the United States , and that ’s you .
And we know that you were involved in a conspiracy with him , and we want to hear it today , ” Merletti recalled agent Jennifer Gant telling him .
Gormley reports that Gant denied making such accusations , but Merletti said he left the encounter “ insulted ” and offended .
— Starr deputies prepared a draft indictment of Hillary Clinton and her former law partner , Webb Hubbell , but it was unanimously rejected by prosecutors more focused on the Lewinsky case .
“ The object of the conspiracy was to conceal , by unlawful means , the true facts relating to Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s and Webster Lee Hubbell ’s relationship with ….
Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan and Madison Financial Corporation … [ to ] avoid and evade political criminal and civil liability , fraudulently secure additional income for the Rose Law Firm and safeguard the political campaigns of William Jefferson Clinton , ” said a “ theory - of - the - case ” memo distributed in advance of prosecutor Hickman Ewing Jr. ’s three - hour presentation to Starr and other prosecutors on April 27 , 1998 .
However , Gormley reports that the session ended with a unanimous vote against an indictment .
“ The pattern was fairly damning in a lot of ways , ” said one member of the team , Paul Rosenzweig .
“ But she [ Mrs. Clinton ] was n’t a mafia figure ; she was a sympathetic figure .
We were going to have to do it in Washington or Arkansas , where the juries did n’t like us …
So we were going to get our asses kicked . ”
No indictment was ever brought against Hillary Clinton .
— While Bill Clinton was steaming mad about Judge Susan Webber Wright ’s decision to cite him for civil contempt in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and accused her of political bias , Clinton and his defenders failed to acknowledge that Wright “ could have ended his presidency with the stroke of a pen ” by initiating criminal contempt proceedings against him while the impeachment case was still pending .
Gormley cites a source that said she weighed a criminal citation against Clinton but decided against it .
Wright declined to comment for this article .
The book is also replete with quotes from key political players venting their grievances , regrets and convictions about the showdown .
Former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott ( R - Miss . ) said he remains baffled by the public response to impeachment despite clear evidence that Clinton “ demeaned the office . ”
“ That does n’t jibe with all the other stuff I hear about women ’s rights and feminism and , you know misconduct in the office place and workplace and all that .
It ’s one of the real anomalies , I think , of American political history . ”
Hyde ( R - Ill . ) , who headed up the House impeachment team and died in 2007 , expressed no regrets .
“ Bill Clinton is making the most of his retirement .
I ’m glad he has no more pardons to sell .
The country is safe to that extent .
Bill Clinton could have been one of our great presidents .
I think he had the brains and the energy and the ambition , but he lacked the vision .
And the character .
And that ’s the sad part .
What might have been , ” Hyde told Gormley .
Clinton retorts : “ They were disgraced , and he [ Hyde ] knows it .
They ran a partisan hit job run by a bitter right winger , Henry Hyde , who turned out to be a hypocrite on the personal issues ….
Yeah , I will always have a asterisk after my name , but I hope I ’ll have two asterisks : one is ‘ They impeached him , ” and the other is ‘ He stood up to them and beat them , and he beat them like a yard dog . ’ ”
Starr has expressed some regrets about taking on the Lewinsky aspect of the case , but he still seems rankled by Clinton ’s lack of abject contrition .
“ Everybody ’s been saying , ‘ Stop it .
Stop it .
Admit it .
Get it behind you . ’
And he will not do it , ” Starr said in the book .
“ It is shocking that the president of the United States would conduct himself as a witness in such a way to essentially ‘ lie till he dies . ’
We all know the truth .
And yet here he is [ still ] mocking the system . ”
The author , Gormley , said the title and cover art are deliberately ambiguous , allowing readers to decide whether Clinton or Starr did more to besmirch American values .
By and large , Gormley avoids sweeping judgments about the central figures , but he occasionally tips his hand as he tackles specific issues .
The author calls the prosecutors ’ approach to Lewinsky “ botched ” and says Starr should have begged off of the Lewinsky inquiry .
The professor also scores Clinton for “ blatant violations ” of Wright ’s orders in Jones case and scoffs at claims that the president never lied to the grand jury .
“ There ’s no question that he very skillfully cleaned up and kind of fixed some problems that originally existed with the Jones deposition , in the grand jury — that was artfully done , but when it came to certain things , there was no way to conclude they were not false , ” Gormley said in an interview .
However , Gormley also suggests the August 1998 testimony should never have happened because Starr should have pursued his inclination to turn the entire matter over to Congress several weeks earlier .
Instead , he deferred to aides who wanted to keep control of the probe .
“ In one of the great tragedies filled with many catastrophic moments , Ken Starr was overwhelmingly outvoted by his staff , ” the author writes .
“ His penchant for deferring to his prosecutors and seeking consensus like a wise judge finally led to his own professional meltdown . ”
Gormley met four times with Bill Clinton and spoke with Starr eight times in preparation for the book .
The most notable omission on Gormley ’s list of interviews : Hillary Clinton .
Gormley said he asked repeatedly to speak with her for the book but was never offered a meeting .
We know it ’s not headed for the US anytime soon , but that wo n’t stop us from fawning over it .

Britain's new bomber command :
The $ 2bn aircraft aiming for world peace
The world 's most expensive aircraft has a devastating new bomb that may yet end North Korea 's nuclear pretensions .
More to the point , they 've just tossed the keys to an RAF pilot .
LIVE reports from a top secret USAF base in Missouri on a very British coup
The Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri .
The B - 2 flies combat missions across the planet from here
There are two ways for a Briton to get close to the world 's most expensive bomber .
One involves a year of emails , faxes and phone calls involving the Pentagon and the U.S. State Department to obtain permission to visit Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri , where the B - 2 Spirit stealth bombers are based .
The other is to join the RAF .
There , you must spend years flying fighter jets and apply for the one spot that opens up every three years on the world 's most exclusive exchange programme .
The advantage to this approach is that you could eventually pilot a $ 2 billion aircraft that gets more technically advanced each month - and is soon to carry one of the biggest bombs ever built .
It is also this avenue that means a Brit may be in charge of the first strike of the next war .
Whiteman is just off U.S. Route 50 , among the rolling green fields of Missouri , and dwarfs its nearest neighbour , the tiny town of Knob Noster .
A country road through forest leads past a trailer park to the base 's main gate .
Once inside , Whiteman is like a quiet , ordered new town - complete with supermarket , coffee shop , bar and restaurant , and even a swimming pool and a baseball diamond - but you can't just drive through .
A B - 2 takes off at Whiteman .
Its ' advocates believe it retains strategic value in an uncertain world
As instructed , I wait in the car park of a nearby golf course where I 'm met by members of base staff , who check my papers and remain within a few feet of me at all times .
I 'm transferred to another car and driven onto the base , which is home to nearly 4,000 active - service personnel along with their families and reservists .
We 're in the heart of the U.S. , thousands of miles from any border , but the B - 2 flies combat missions across the planet from here , so Whiteman is classed as a front - line base .
Consequently , much of the detail of how the B - 2 gets to and from its targets , undetected by radar , remains secret .
One B - 2 carries 40 tornados - worth of munitions .
It 's a huge deal to be involved
Some critics believe that the B - 2 is a Cold War relic that was rendered obsolete when the Berlin Wall came down months after its first flight in 1989 .
They say there 's no point having an aircraft that 's invisible to radar when the US and its allies are fighting insurgents armed with Fifties rifles and home - made bombs .
However , the B - 2's advocates believe it retains strategic value in an uncertain , ever - changing world .
The ageing aircraft is currently undergoing upgrades to ensure it remains the most capable weapons platform on Earth .
B - 2 Spirit Of Mississippi in its dock
' The objective is never to use the B - 2 in war , ' says Brigadier General Robert Wheeler , commanding officer of the 509th Bomb Wing - the man in charge of the B - 2 fleet - when I meet him in Whiteman 's HQ .
' When I train my folks , I say : " When we use this , we 've already failed . "
But there 's virtually no target in the world that we cannot hit , and if the National Command Authority ( the U.S. President and Secretary of Defence ) , in conjunction with our allies , decide that we have to take something out , it 's gonna happen - and nobody can stop that .
The B - 2's objective is to deter other nations from doing things the wrong way . '
RAF Sqn Ldr Jon Killerby , who is qualified as a B - 2 instructor
The latest stage of the B - 2's evolution will see it carry the new Massive Ordnance Penetrator ( MOP ) .
The 30,000lb precision - guided ' bunker - buster ' bomb , 20ft long , is designed to blast through 200m of reinforced concrete and destroy buried targets .
Many experts assume it is being readied for possible use on nuclear weapons factories in Iran or North Korea .
My paperwork is scrutinised again at a second checkpoint .
The car is checked to make sure stones or other debris are n't going to be brought near to the aircraft .
Ahead are the ' docks ' - a row of 14 purpose - built air - conditioned hangars housing the B - 2s .
I 'm driven across the taxi - way to one of the docks , the door slides open and there it is : aircraft serial number 82-1071 , the Spirit Of Mississippi , a vast , dark grey set of sweeping curves etched in titanium and secret materials .
Apart from the three sets of wheels beneath the middle of the aircraft , and the massive bomb - bay doors that hang open underneath its swollen belly , there are no vertical surfaces : just one huge , rippling wing .
The B - 2's unearthly looks reflect its unique role - to kick down the door at the beginning of a war , clandestinely taking out radar installations and air - defence batteries and ensuring control of enemy airspace .
Unlike other American bombers , the B - 2 would do this without being seen by radar .
With its conventional shape , huge tail and eight wing - mounted engines , the famous B - 52's radar cross section ( RCS ) is huge : to a trained radar operator , it 's no challenge to track an object that appears to be the size of a warehouse .
The B - 2 is said to appear on radar no bigger than a moth .
Only 21 B - 2s were built .
That number became even smaller in February 2008 when the unthinkable happened , and aircraft 89 - 0127 , the Spirit Of Kansas , crashed during take - off at Andersen Air Force Base on the Pacific island of Guam .
The first paragraph of the summary of the investigation into that accident reads : ' The Mishap Aircraft was destroyed at a total loss of $ 1,407,006,920 . '
Maintenance crew wash the wheels of a B - 2
The tiny B - 2 fleet has fought in three wars so far : in Serbia in 1999 ; in Afghanistan in October 2001 ; and in the air war against Saddam Hussein in 2003 .
Wheeler 's team at Whiteman have to be ready for whatever America 's political leaders want them to do .
The continual improvements to the aircraft and its armaments give military planners ever more sophisticated options : later this year , a B - 2 could take to the air with an MOP in one bomb bay and as many as 100 smaller GPS - guided missiles in the other , and use each bomb against a different target on a single flight - all from 50,000 ft , and without an enemy even knowing it was there .
But it 's not only the aircraft that are being prepared at Whiteman : just as vital are the pilots .
Since 2004 , of the 80 or so people qualified to fly the B - 2 at any one time , one has always been British , thanks to a special extension to the Royal Air Force / USAF Personnel Exchange Program .
As I arrive at Whiteman , Flight Lieutenant Adam Curd , a Tornado GR4 pilot from RAF 's 14 Squadron , is training to fly the B - 2 , while his fellow Tornado pilot , Squadron Leader Jon Killerby , is now coming to the end of his three years in Missouri , during which time he has qualified as a B - 2 instructor .
' Fewer people have flown this aircraft than have flown in the Space Shuttle , ' says Squadron Leader Killerby , who is only the second Briton to fly the B - 2 .
A dummy 30,000lb ' bunker - buster ' Massive Ordinance Penetrator bomb in the bomb bay
' You may not be flying a fast jet and pulling Gs , but one B - 2 carries 40 Tornados - worth of munitions .
It 's a huge deal to be involved . '
Killerby was the mission commander when two B - 2s flew in to RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire in 2007 : a B - 2 dock has been built there , so it can be used as a forward operating location .
The exchange also gives British pilots insights into how to use stealth aircraft ahead of the arrival of the RAF 's first stealth jet , the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter , which should enter service around 2016 .
Some of the differences from conventional aircraft are inescapable .
' The first thing that struck me when I came out here was the aeroplane 's size , ' says Killerby .
' But it handles much like a smaller aeroplane would .
Also , we do a lot of low - level flying in the UK , but most of the stuff we do here is at airliner altitudes . '
The longest flight Killerby has made in a Tornado was eight hours : a B - 2 training flight from Whiteman to Alaska and back took him almost 25 hours .
' It 's interesting to find yourself at the end of a 24 - hour sortie having to fly a $ 2 billion aeroplane on approach , sometimes in bad weather .
I 'd say up to 16 hours is easy , but on the 24 - hour sorties I 've done , I 've felt great , then I 've got down on the ground and I 've felt wiped out . '
Whiteman employs a physiologist who examines rest , sleep and nutrition , tailoring special timetables for each pilot so that the main pressure points - take - off , landing , refuelling , weapons drop - happen at the peaks of their circadian rhythms .
Sleeping time is tightly controlled ( there is a small space in the cockpit where crew members can have a nap ) and pilots are also prescribed ' go - pills ' - amphetamines and similar medicines often used to treat sleep disorders - to ensure they remain alert .
13th Bomb Squadron changing room
It 's a flying experience that demands high levels of concentration and patience , so those who are selected for the programme are usually very experienced airmen .
Many come from an engineering or mathematical background : among the current B - 2 pilot cadre , six have maths degrees from the renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Before getting airborne in a B - 2 , a new recruit has to master the smaller Northrop T - 38 jet .
The small number of aircraft means that an active B - 2 pilot may only fly the bomber twice per month , mostly to bombing ranges in the U.S. , or electronically simulating attacks on buildings , bridges and other targets within a couple of hours ' flying time of Whiteman .
' When you 've got the basics , they put you into the simulators , then they start introducing weapons and tactics , ' says Flight Lieutenant Curd .
Once the simulator work is complete - including a 24 - hour virtual mission - a trainee must make 11 flights in the pilot seat of the B - 2 , with an instructor alongside .
A further , 12th ' check flight ' is in effect a B - 2 driving test .
As it passes its 21st birthday , parts of the B - 2 are showing their age .
It was designed and built with Seventies and Eighties technology .
One of the companies that makes components for the B - 2 was forced to scour eBay for spare test equipment when it discovered that a mains unit that needed replacing was no longer in production .
Back in 1995 , the B - 2's manufacturer , Northrop Grumman , had offered to build a further 20 B - 2s at a ' flyaway price ' of $ 566 million each .
The U.S. government did not take Northrop up on their offer , and the production lines were closed down .
Yet the current upgrades show that the B - 2 is only perhaps now coming of age .
Halting production may come to be seen as one of the shortest - sighted decisions in the history of military aviation .
' I think one of the biggest mistakes we made with this aircraft was to call the damn thing a bomber - we should 've called it a weapons platform , ' says Ken Gallagher , site manager for Northrop at Whiteman .
' If only we 'd known what was coming in the future . '
Behind the seats , once the cockpit door is closed , the ladder pulled up and the floor panel replaced , there is just enough room for one pilot to put down a sleeping bag and take a short nap while the other crew member flies the aircraft .
Some B - 2s have also been fitted with a microwave oven so crews can prepare hot meals .
The one part of the aircraft the crews are n't happy with ?
Apparently , the cup holders ( out of shot ) are too small ...
Engines are started while the aircraft is in the dock - the rear door of the dock is opened so that the exhaust blast does n't blow a hole in the wall .
The aircraft is towed in and out of the dock , much like a passenger jet , but it taxis under its own power once outside .
The pilot sits on the left , with the mission controller , who ensures the weapons are correctly deployed , on the right .
The aircraft 's shape makes it difficult to operate manually , so , in common with many advanced modern aircraft , it uses a ' fly - by - wire ' system , which means its computers are in control of the minute - by - minute basics .
Today 's smart bombs are guided to targets by GPS and laser targeting , so the mission commander will ' fly ' the B - 2 by punching target information into the computers , which will then steer the aircraft to the right place from which to launch its weapons at the target .
Here , we 've highlighted some of the essential controls in the cockpit - the location of the switch that fires the missiles is , of course , classified ...

For some reason many of us rely more on doctors , and the medical industry in general , for our health .
When we are tired for an extended period of time , or have low energy , we go to the doctor .
I have heard more in the past year , than in the 10 or 20 before , that blood test results are showing these people have nutrition deficiencies .
The most common that I hear about are the b vitamins or magnesium .
We also know that certain illnesses and quite a few medications also cause nutrients to be depleted by our bodies to the extent that we do n’t have enough of them to have overall good health .
Fatigue , low energy and more serious lifestyle related side effects can result from inadequate nutrients available for our bodies to use .
We need these vitamins and minerals to have enough energy and to be healthy .
Many teenage girls and women take birth control pills .
Did you know that these oral contraceptives are associated with many changes in the body , including using up many of the body ’s nutrients .
B - Complex is one of those nutrients and is also needed by the cells to produce energy .
Vitamin C , beta carotene , zinc , and magnesium can all be depleted as well when taking birth control pills .
This creates an important reason for girls and women who use them to supplement with vitamins and minerals every day .
Anti-diabetes drugs , high blood pressure drugs , high cholesterol drugs , estrogen replacement therapy meds , anti-inflammatory meds , antidepressants and antibiotics can all cause nutrition deficiencies .
While these drugs are necessary for many people , so are the nutrients they deplete in the body .
We have known for years that certain vitamins and minerals , in addition to helping us feel energized , might also actually prevent serious diseases such as high blood pressure .
Most people eat for taste and not not nutrition .
Even if we do choose our food more in terms of healthy choices , there are various factors that result in the fact that we do n’t always get enough of the nutrients that our bodies need every day .
All of these factors should point us in the direction of taking vitamins and minerals every day , the same as we take our medications .
Vitamins and minerals help us build good health in different ways .
They help us prevent illness and disease in different ways as well .
Vitamins and minerals give us energy and overall sense of well being .
In order to have the insurance that we get all of the vitamins and minerals we need to fight off most of the health challenges we are exposed to , the best thing to do is to stay faithful to a daily nutrition program that supplements the food we eat .
Even the former director of the National Institutes of Health , Dr. Bernadine Healy , stated ( years ago ) that , “ Whatever the RDA ( recommended daily amount of nutrients we get from our food that is suggested for good health ) or the medical community may recommend officially , I will tell you that increasing numbers of medical professionals are , themselves , taking supplements of these vitamins .
I take supplements of calcium , the antioxidant vitamins , and a multi-vitamin .
My husband and children also take vitamins . ”
Since the time that statement was made , other vitamins and nutrients that have become important to supplement ( in addition to calcium , antioxidants Vitamin C , E and beta carotene , and multi-vitamins ) are : magnesium , fish oil ( for inflammation related challenges ) , probiotics , and B vitamins .

The Doctor Who story you never got to see
Shada was to be the climax of the 1979 - 80 Dr Who season but was never shown
By Shaun Ley
Radio 4 , Shelved
Why spend thousands of pounds to make an episode of one of the most popular TV series of the time , only to leave it gathering dust in the archive ?
Thirty years ago , with only three channels to choose from , Doctor Who and Secret Army on BBC One and The Professionals on ITV routinely delivered audiences bigger than even the most successful programmes do today .
Yet between 1978 and 1979 , the producers of all three programmes shelved a story from each .
The explanation has much to do with that period : economic decline , political inertia and industrial unrest creating a combustible combination .
Doctor
Who A strike does help explain the non-appearance of Shada - a six - part Doctor Who story - yet this is perhaps the most inexplicable of the three .
Shada was formally droppped from the 17th season of Doctor Who in December 1979
It was officially cancelled in June 1980 A version of the story was eventually released on video in 1992 with Tom Baker providing a narration to cover the missing scenes
At the time , just as now , Doctor Who was a major part of the BBC 's schedule .
Shada was the climax of the season and location filming took place in Cambridge , which lead actor Tom Baker recalls with great affection .
" We were staying just outside St John 's College in a pub called the three tons or three nuns and the music scholars , the singers , would come to me in the pub and I would buy all the drinks and they would sing to me , in harmony .
It was a very happy time , " he says .
The broadcasting unions , however , targeted the programme for industrial action .
A planned night shoot was disrupted when the technician in charge of the lighting was ordered to withdraw his labour .
Studio recording was disrupted by the strike but it was all over the day before Shada was due back in the studio .
Yet it never made it .
The programme was left two - thirds finished and then dropped altogether .
Thousands of pounds - worth of work came to nothing .
Christmas specials
So why did the BBC abandon six weeks - worth of programmes for one of its most popular series ?
Until now , the conventional answer has been that the strike in autumn 1979 so disrupted the recording of programmes that when the studios were back in action priority had to be given to Christmas specials .
Doctor
Who 's slot went to Morecambe and Wise .
But Professor Jean Seaton who is writing the latest volume of the BBC 's official history suggests a different reason .
She sees Shada as a line in the sand .
In the past , programmes disrupted by strikes were simply re-mounted afterwards and therefore the industrial action had no visible consequences to the outside world .
This time , thinks Professor Seaton , the BBC decided enough was enough .
It scrapped a key peak - time programme in order to demonstrate to the unions that strikes have consequences .
So Shada was not just shelved ; she believes it was sacrificed as well .
The Professionals The Professionals followed the adventures of Bodie and Doyle , a former mercenary and an ex-policeman who worked for a shadowy government department .
The Professionals ran on ITV from December 1977 to March 1983
But spies and fisticuffs aside , the show 's co-creator Brian Clemens wanted to use the series as a vehicle for social comment .
The last episode of the first series , Klansmen , was scheduled to air in spring 1978 .
Its subject was racism - very topical at the time .
The National Front was very active , provoking confrontation on the streets .
At the last minute , LWT - the ITV company which commissioned the show - took fright .
It was dropped from the schedule .
Clemens , who also wrote the episode , has never understood why .
" We were making an episode which was hopefully going to change attitudes not reinforce them , " he says .
" And anyway , if it had been controversial , if there had been complaints and letters , so much the better because all these racist things , you have to bring them out from under the stone and air them , " he adds .
One former LWT employee suggested it was not the racist language which would have stopped it being aired , but more likely she suspected that it might have been the wrong kind of series in which to debate such sensitive questions .
Whatever the reason , Klansmen has never been shown on terrestrial television in the UK .
As recently as the autumn it was dusted down by ITV with a view to broadcasting , but once again the decision was taken to return it to the archive .
Secret Army What Did You Do in the War , Daddy ? was planned as the final episode of Secret Army .
Set in occupied Belgium during the World War II , the series chronicled the bravery of the resistance , who smuggled out allied airmen shot down over the country .
Secret Army ran for three series from 1977 to 1979 Uniquely , the last episode was set 25 years after the liberation and centred on a reunion involving the main characters .
It questioned the whole point of the resistance and went so far as to suggest that fighting the Nazis had led the allies to miss the main threat - communism .
The official explanation as to why the episode was dropped was that strike action had made it impossible to finish editing in time for its scheduled broadcast in December 1979 .
In fact , What Did You Do In The War , Daddy ? was finished .
So why was it suppressed ?
Professor Seaton thinks the real reason was that the tone would have offended many who had fought in the war , not least many BBC executives .

EA ’s take of bringing a new horror title was Dead Space .
It offered a new type of horror gameplay which many of us thoroughly enjoyed .
It brought something new to the table , a title which frightened gamers throughout the game .
Gamers will have the chance again to relive the joy of being greeted by a 50 ft mutated monster .
EA have announced the long awaited sequel to the Dead Space franchise .
Dead Space 2 will be released on the across all platforms , but the date of the release is yet to be confirmed but it it ’s fair to say that we ’ll see a 2010 release at least .
Isaac will embark on a new adventure by “ taking the fight to the Necromorphs ” this time , with new weapons , new characters , and “ epic zero - G environments ” .
“ In Dead Space 2 , not everything is exactly as it seems .
Expect plot twists that will surprise you and a huge cast of twisted , disgusting monsters that are sure to scare the daylights out of you ” , said the Executive Producer : Steve Papoutsis .

For me functional reactive programming ( FRP ) has been mainly about two principles .
One is denotational design ( i.e. , based on simple , precise denotational semantics ) , which has been integral to FRP since the first incarnation as ActiveVRML .
I ’ve written several things recently about denotational design .
My second core principle is continuous time , which has been present since Fran & ActiveVRML ’s predecessor TBAG .
Today I read a confusion that I ’ve heard many times before about continuous time , which I ’d like to bring up , in part because I love continuous time , and in part because there ’s a much broader underlying principle of software design .
[ …] I do n’t see why the lack of continuous streams leaves a “ gap ” .
In the end all streams are discrete .
“ In the end ” , yes .
Just as in the end , numbers are displayed as ascii numerals .
However , programming is more about the middle than the end , i.e. , more about composition than about output .
For that reason , we do n’t generally use strings in place of numbers .
If we did , composition operations ( arithmetic ) would be very awkward .
Similarly , continuity in space and in time is better for composition / modularity , leaving discreteness to the output step .
Another name for “ continuous ” is “ resolution - independent ” , and thus able to be transformed in time and space with ease and without propagating and amplifying sampling artifacts .
As another example , consider the data types in a 3D graphics API .
In the end , all graphics is pixels , is n’t it ?
So what gap is left in a pixel - oriented API that does n’t address higher - level continuous notions like triangles or curved surfaces ?
( Hint : it ’s not just speed . )
One could go further than strings and pixels , and say that “ in the end ” my data types will end up as phosphors or electrical impulses , so programming at those levels is perfectly adequate .
Again , composability would suffer .
Another example is functional vs imperative programming .
It ’s all side - effects in the end .
Functional programming excels in composability , as explained and illustrated by John Hughes in Why Functional Programming Matters .
And I ’m not just talking about pure functional programming , but the availability of compound expressions , as introduced in Fortran ( controversially ) , despite that machines just execute sequences of atomic , side - effecting statements in the end .
Another example , and really the heart of John ’s paper , is finite vs infinite data structures .
We only access a finite amount of data in the end .
However , allowing infinite data structures in the middle makes for a much more composable programming style .
Some unsolicited advice to us all : Next time you see someone doing something and you do n’t understand their underlying motivation , ask them .
Many issues are not immediately obvious , so do n’t be shy !
Reading papers can help as well .
For more on continuous time :
Edits :
2010 - 01-03 : Trimmed & tweaked the unsolicited advice .
Hopefully less peevish / patronizing now .

Pontiff 's playlist : Is Pope Benedict XVI a secret rap lover ?
If his playlist is any indication , the Pope has the most catholic of musical tastes .
A selection posted on the Myspace website in the name of the Vatican features tracks from artists ranging from Shirley Bassey to rapper Tupac Shakur .
The list is one of several offered in a new music service from Myspace in which celebrities are asked to name their favourite songs .
His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI is said to be a fan of a huge variety of music including 2 Pac and Shirley Bassey Stars from Beyonce to Katie Price list the music that provides the sound track to their lives .
The Vatican list is far from an ecclesiastical top ten , although it does include songs from the album Music From The Vatican and Mozart 's Don Giovanni .
The most surprising inclusion is Changes by Tupac Shakur , also known as 2 P ac .
The song charts the grim life of drugs , crime and violence on the streets of a poor neighbourhood .
It talks about suicide , stealing and crack cocaine .
Lyrics include ' Is life worth living , should I blast myself ? ' and ' My stomach hurts so I am looking for a purse to snatch ' .
At another point he sings : ' Cause both black and white is smokin ' crack tonight ' .
2 Pac , Dame Shirley Bassey and Muse are all favourites of Pope Benedict
From left , members Muse , Matthew Bellamy , Chris Wolstenholme and Dominic Howard .
Some of their tracks feature on the Vatican selection
The 12 - strong Vatican list was put together by Father Giulio Neroni , artistic director of St Paul 's Multimedia , a church publisher .
He was the man behind the recent Alma Mater album , which combined Gregorian chants and prayers with classical music and the voice of Pope Benedict speaking in five languages .
Another song on the list is a Shirley Bassey track , After The Rain , taken from her recent album .
British band Muse and U.S. folk group Fleet Foxes also feature in the Vatican selection .
It is not known if the Pope has ever heard any of the songs .
A far more likely explanation is that the list has been put together with an eye to making the Catholic Church more accessible to younger worshippers .
Beyonce 's choices includes Mariah Carey 's Vision of Love , I Ca n't Help It by Michael Jackson and Marvin Gaye 's Distant Lover .
Katie Price 's list features X Factor judge Cheryl Cole 's song Fight For This Love .

January 23 , 2010 --
In my reflection of January 14 , two days after the catastrophe in Haiti , which destroyed that neighbouring sister nation of Haiti , I wrote :
In the field of healthcare and other areas , Cuba –- despite being a poor and blockaded country -– has been cooperating with the Haitian people for many years .
Around 400 doctors and healthcare experts are offering their services free of charge to the Haitian people .
Our doctors are working every day in 227 of the country ’s 337 communes .
On the other hand , at least 400 young Haitians have trained as doctors in our homeland .
They will now work with the reinforcement brigade which traveled there yesterday to save lives in this critical situation .
Thus , without any special effort being made , up to 1000 doctors and healthcare experts can be mobilised , almost all of whom are already there willing to cooperate with any other state that wishes to save the lives of the Haitian people and rehabilitate the injured ...
The head of our medical brigade reported : " The situation is difficult , but we have already started saving lives .
Hour after hour , day and night , the Cuban health professionals have worked non-stop in the few facilities that were able to stand , in tents , and out in the parks or open - air spaces , since the population fear new aftershocks .
[ Also see http://links.org.au/node/1469.]
The situation was far more serious than was originally thought .
Tens of thousands of injured were clamouring for help in the streets of Port - au - Prince ; innumerable persons lay , dead or alive , under the rubbled clay or adobe used in the construction of the houses in which the overwhelming majority of the population lived .
Buildings , even the most solid , collapsed .
Besides , it was necessary to look through the destroyed neighborhoods for the Haitian doctors who had graduated from the Latin American Medicine School .
Many of them were affected , either directly or indirectly , by the tragedy .
Some UN officials were trapped in their dormitories and tens of lives were lost , including the lives of several chiefs of MINUSTAH ( the UN United Nations Stabilisation Mission ) .
The fate of hundreds of other members of its staff was unknown .
Haiti ’s presidential palace crumbled .
Many public facilities , including several hospitals , were left in ruins .
The catastrophe shocked the whole world , which was able to see what was going on through the images aired by the main international TV networks .
Governments from everywhere on the planet announced they would be sending rescue experts , food , medicines , equipment and other resources .
Cuba responds
In conformity with the position publicly announced by Cuba , medical staff from different countries – namely Spain , Mexico and Colombia , among others – worked very hard alongside our doctors at the facilities they had improvised .
Organisations such as the Pan American Health Organization , other friendly countries like Venezuela and other nations supplied medicines and other resources .
The impeccable behaviour of Cuban professionals and their leaders was absolutely void of chauvinism and remained out of the limelight .
As it had done under similar circumstances when Hurricane Katrina caused huge devastation in the city of New Orleans and the lives of thousands of American citizens were in danger , Cuba offered to send a full medical brigade to cooperate with the people of the United States , a country that , as is well known , has vast resources .
But at that moment what was needed were trained and well - equipped doctors to save lives .
Given New Orleans ' geographical location , more than 1000 doctors of the “ Henry Reeve ” contingent mobilised and readied to leave for that city at any time of the day or night , carrying with them the necessary medicines and equipment .
It never crossed our mind that the President of the the United States would reject the offer and let a number of Americans , who could have been saved , die .
The mistake made by the US government was perhaps the inability to understand that the people of Cuba do not see in the American people an enemy ; it does not blame them for the aggressions our homeland has suffered .
Nor was that government capable of understanding that our country does not need to beg for favours or forgiveness of those who , for half a century now , have been trying , to no avail , to bring us to our knees .
In the case of Haiti , our country immediately responded to the US authorities ' requests to fly their aircraft over the eastern part of Cuba , as well as offering other facilities they needed to deliver assistance , as quickly as possible , to the US and Haitian citizens who had been affected by the earthquake .
Such have been the principles characterising the ethical behaviour of our people .
Together with its equanimity and firmness , these have been the ever - present features of our foreign policy .
And this is known only too well by whoever have been our adversaries in the international arena .
Cuba will firmly stand by the opinion that the tragedy that has taken place in Haiti , the poorest nation in the western hemisphere , is a challenge to the richest and more powerful countries of the world .
Haiti is a net product of the colonial , capitalist and imperialist system imposed on the world .
Haiti ’s slavery and subsequent poverty were imposed from abroad .
That terrible earthquake occurred after the Copenhagen climate change summit , where the most elemental rights of 192 UN member states were trampled upon .
In the aftermath of the tragedy , a competition has unleashed in Haiti to hastily and illegally adopt boys and girls .
UNICEF has been forced to adopt preventive measures against the uprooting of many children , which would have deprived their close relatives of their rights .
Sustainable development
There are more than 100,000 victims dead .
A high number of citizens have lost their arms or legs , or have suffered fractures requiring rehabilitation that would enable them to work or manage their own .
Eighty per cent of the country needs to be rebuilt .
Haiti requires an economy that is developed enough to meet its needs according to its productive capacity .
[ After the second world war ] the reconstruction of Europe and Japan , which was based on the productive capacity and the technical level of the population , was a relatively simple task compared to the effort that needs to be made in Haiti .
There , as well as in most of Africa and elsewhere in the Third World , it is indispensable to create the conditions for a sustainable development .
In only 40 years ' time , humanity will [ number ] more than 9 billion , and right now it is faced with the challenge of climate change that scientists accept as an inescapable reality .
Haiti occupied
In the midst of the Haitian tragedy , without anybody knowing how and why , thousands of US marines , 82nd Airborne Division troops and other military forces have occupied Haiti .
Worse still is the fact that neither the United Nations Organization nor the US government have offered an explanation to the world ’s public opinion about this relocation of troops .
Several governments have complained that their aircraft have not been allowed to land in order to deliver the human and technical resources that have been sent to Haiti .
Some countries , for their part , have announced they would be sending an additional number of troops and military equipment .
In my view , such events will complicate and create chaos in international cooperation , which is already in itself complex .
It is necessary to seriously discuss this issue .
The UN should be entrusted with the leading role it deserves in these very delicate matters .
Our country is accomplishing a strictly humanitarian mission .
To the extent of its possibilities , it will contribute the human and material resources at its disposal .
The will of our people , who takes pride in its medical doctors and cooperation workers who provide vital services , is huge , and will rise to the occasion .
Any significant cooperation that is offered to our country will not be rejected , but its acceptance will fully depend on the importance and transcendence of the assistance that is requested from the human resources of our homeland .
It is only fair to state that , up until this moment , our modest aircraft and the important human resources that Cuba has made available to the Haitian people have arrived at their destination without any difficulty whatsoever .
We send doctors , not soldiers !

5:30 p.m .
Yesterday the President of the largest gold mining and production company , Barrick Gold , noted that after ten years of declining production it is time to recognize that the world has seen the peak in gold production .
To maintain production ore is being mined with increasingly less gold in it .
( The grade of the ore , or metal content , defines whether it is profitable to mine . )
Gold serves two purposes .
Firstly , it has provided down through history a form of currency , though it is not clear whether it was Croesus or the Egyptians who used it in trade .
Both date back to around 5-600 B.C. , and gold coins have flourished since that time .
( Before then gold was mined around Mestia , in what is now Georgia , back at the time of Jason and the Golden Fleece ( before 1300 B.C. ) and used for ornamental wear and art objects . )
But gold also has a useful function as a metal .
Gold conducts electricity , does not tarnish , is very easy to work , can be drawn into wire , can be hammered into thin sheets , alloys with many other metals , can be melted and cast into highly detailed shapes , has a wonderful color and a brilliant luster .
Gold is a memorable metal that occupies a special place in the human mind .
It is even , on occasion , used as a roofing material .
Gold roof to the Small Gold Tile Hall of the Ta’er Temple in Qinghai Province , China .
As with peak oil , the fact that global production has peaked does not mean that there is no gold left to mine .
Rather it means that less gold will be mined each year into the future .
It will likely , in time , bring back into debate the environmental costs of mining .
For there are deposits of gold still in the ground that are being not mined , in part because of the environmental cost .
If you go , for example , to the Malakoff Diggins in California ( a state park north of American Hill ) , you will find tall sandstone cliffs that used to be mined using streams of water from large monitors .
However , in excavating the rock it was also disintegrated , and the clay particles were carried down into the Sacramento River , gradually filling the river bed , to the point that in heavy rains the river flooded the surrounding communities .
Thus , back in 1886 Judge Sawyer restricted the practice , which largely fell into abeyance .
But the gold is still “ in them thar hills . ”
Similarly if one goes up to the valleys outside Fairbanks in Alaska , there is gold in the gravel beds – but is has been largely too expensive , both commercially and environmentally , to recover to this point .
One of the more recent discoveries in Alaska has become known as the Pebble Mine Project .
While there may be up to 3 million ounces of gold in the region , there has been strong opposition to development -- even though that development continues .
Gold has been a valuable mineral for a long time and for nations all around the world .
All the good and easy places to find it , therefore , have been sought after and largely found .
The gold deposits that are worked have become smaller of lower value and found in places that are harder to get to .
With lower availability , greater demand and higher price , it became more practical to mine and process lower grade deposits and to go deeper into the Earth for the higher grades .
Mines in South Africa and in South Dakota have been worked down to more than 2 miles below the surface , to recover the ore .
And techniques have been developed that recover it in even very small quantities – 3 gm per tonne is an ore that contains very little gold ( 3 divided by 1000 = 0.003 kg divided by 1000 = 0.000003 tonnes or 3 parts per million ) .
So , while miners can still find the odd nugget when they pan for gold in streams around the country ( and there are lots of maps available to tell you where to look ) , for the large scale levels of production that make a significant impact on the market , you need large deposits of gold with the potential for greater yields , and those places are getting harder and harder to find .
And even as one goes deeper , the grade of the gold does n’t necessarily continue .
Harmony Gold said yesterday that it may close two more mines over coming months due to poor ore grades .
Gold production in South Africa had fallen 9.3 % year - on - year last September - - this in the country that once led the world in gold production .
We have n’t run out of gold yet
Barrick produced 1.9 m ounces of gold last quarter , down from 1.95 m a year earlier .
Costs have been " trending down " to $ 456 an ounce , though rising energy prices pose a fresh threat .
Total reserves are 139 m ounces , far ahead of rival Newmont Mining at 86 m .
But production will continue to fall as the reserves become even harder to extract .
Beyond a certain point there is not a lot that technology can do , except perhaps to fund ways of getting gold out of veins that are too small and costly to mine at present .
But that wo n’t yield the millions of ounces that are needed to maintain supply .
And the industry was not one , in recent years , to invest in that future .
When gold can be recovered by soaking crushed rock in a solvent at relatively low cost , there is not a lot of incentive for new ideas .
The days of the industrial innovations that used to come from the research labs in South Africa are likely now over .
So , as the oil industry starts its travels down a similar path past peak and into decline , there are a couple of thoughts I would offer .
Firstly it could be pointed out that the gold industry has been able to see the declining production and lack of available prospects for some time .
But it is only now , some 9 – 10 years after the decline started , that the industry is publically recognizing the problem .
Secondly one might ask whether there should not be an agency of the government that can independently warn the government and the nation of this before it happens , so that either better mining methods , access to restricted reserves , or the development of alternate materials could be hastened .
Well actually there was -- it was called the U.S. Bureau of Mines , and all those tasks were in its charter .
But the mining community is a small one , and has not nearly the clout or popularity in Washington that it is thought to have .
Thus , in 1996 the agency was closed .
Thirdly , even though the story is out there it is unlikely , for a while , to get much media attention , and the vast majority of the world ’s population will not either know of the predicament that is now approaching , nor understand why it is going to be something that will impact many aspects of their lives .
Until , of course , it does .
And of course gold is only a pre-cursor of other minerals that will soon run short .
Few folk realize the role that metals and minerals play in providing their lifestyle , and do not recognize that the value of many metals comes , in part , because there is nothing that can substitute as well for that particular metal in doing a particular job .
Unfortunately , doing something about it requires vision for an industry that is not favorably viewed by much of the population .
It will be interesting to see if that perception changes , or if the industry becomes the target of blame as shortages lead to even further cost increases .
And then , of course , will come oil . . . . .
Frank Herbert 's sci- fi classic , last seen in cinemas in David Lynch 's 1984 lurid adaptation , looks set for another screen outing under Pierre Morel
It proved something of a grand folly for David Lynch , whose 1984 adaptation was a commercial and critical flop , while Salvador Dalí and Orson Welles were set to star in a 10 - hour version almost a decade earlier .
Now Dune , the bestselling science - fiction novel of all time , looks set to be revamped for the 21st century with French director Pierre Morel at the reins .
According to Variety , Morel , best known for directing the Liam Neeson - starring revenge thriller Taken , will also work to hone a screenplay by Peter Berg and Josh Zetumer into a finished product .
Berg , of Hancock fame , was previously set to direct , but has decided to work on the forthcoming adaptation of board game Battleship instead .
Morel is said to be a long - time fan of Frank Herbert 's 1965 novel , which launched a series that eventually spanned six books .
It centres on a sprawling feudal interstellar empire where planetary fiefdoms are controlled by noble houses .
The first book tells the story of the ongoing battle to control the valuable " spice melange " which is found only on the desert planet of Arrakis .
Dune may represent something of a poisoned chalice for Morel .
Lynch 's lurid 1984 version , starring Kyle MacLachlan , Sting , Sean Young and Patrick Stewart among others , was bedevilled by the film - maker 's battles with producers and financiers .
He eventually distanced himself from the movie , declaring that he had not been given final cut .
Before that , Alejandro Jodorowsky was set to direct a 10 - hour feature in 1975 , featuring the likes of Salvador Dalí , Orson Welles , David Carradine and Mick Jagger .
HR Giger , the Swiss artist who would later create the terrifying extraterrestrials for Ridley Scott 's Alien , was brought in to work on the central building , the Harkonnen Castle .
Dan O'Bannon , who wrote Alien 's screenplay , was in line to work on the special effects .
Unfortunately , the financing fell through before the shoot began .
• This article was amended on Friday 8 January 2010 .
Dune ( the book ) was first published in 1965 , not 1969 has we said .
This has been corrected .
HONOLULU — Missing moon rocks from the first and last human lunar landings have been discovered in a locked cabinet in Hawaii .
The rare rocks from the Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 missions were found last week during a routine inventory of gifts to the Hawaii governor 's office over the years .
The rocks were given to the people of Hawaii during the Nixon administration , but they were presumed lost when a noted moon rock tracker and former NASA employee said their whereabouts were unknown .
Lenny Klompus , a spokesman for Hawaii Gov. Linda Lingle , says the rocks were never actually missing .
He says state employees knew the rocks were in a secured cabinet , but they did n't know which cabinet .
He says the moon rocks will probably be put on public display soon .

Ridley Twp. Police Officer Brian Decker is being investigated for allegedly beating a Wawa employee after she carded him before buying chewing tobacco .
A witness , who spoke exclusively to NBC Philadelphia on the condition of anonymity , said she was forced to put herself between employee Monique Brunson and Decker after he began to wail on the woman .
" They got to the doorway of the stockroom and I saw him grab her and his fists went flying , " the witness said .
" I ran to the back and he was literally punching her with both fists clenched in the face , in the neck , in the chest in the head – whoever he could hit . "
Ridley Twp. Police confirmed Decker , 33 , who was off - duty at the time , was involved in an incident at the convenience store located across the street from the station , but would not release further details .
Other witnesses called 9 - 1 - 1 while the unidentified woman tried to stop the attack .
She said Decker then threatened her – raising his fists to her face .
" I said ' Stop !
Just stop ' and then he just stood there and then he put his fists up , " the woman recalled .
" I just looked at him and I said , ' Ugh , you do n't even wanna go there . ' "
The woman said Decker was not handcuffed when Ridley Twp.
Police responded to the emergency call .
She says when she questioned why , the officer told her " if you 're smart , you wo n't get involved . "
Ridley Twp. Police suspended Decker with the intent to dismiss .
They have also turned over the case to the Delaware County D.A. 's office to avoid a conflict of interest .
Attempts to reach Decker for comment were unsuccessful and the Fraternal Order of Police lodge that represents him , offered no comment .
There are so many ways to have a play with CouchDB .
This time I thought about using CouchDB as a TileCache storage .
Sounds easy , so it was .
What is a tilecache
Everyone knows Google Maps and its small images , called tiles .
Rendering those tiles for the whole world for every zoom level can be quite time consuming , therefore you can render them on demand and cache them once they are rendered .
This is the business of a tilecache .
You can use the tilecache as a proxy to a remote tile server as well , that 's what I did for this benchmark .
Coding
The implementation looks quite similar to the memcache one .
I have n't implemented locking as I was just after something working , not a full - fledged backend .
When I finished coding , it was time to find out how it performs .
That should be easy , as there 's a tilecache_seeding script bundled with TileCache to fill the cache .
So you fill the cache , then you switch the remote server off and test how long it takes if all requests are hits without any fails ( i.e. all tiles are in your cache and do n't need to be requested from a remote server ) .
The two contestants for the benchmark are the CouchDB backend and the one that stores the tiles directly on the filesystem .
Everyone loves numbers
We keep it simple and measure the time for seeding with time .
How long will it take to request 780 tiles ?
The first number is the average ( in seconds ) , the one in brackets the standard deviation .
Filesystem : real 0.35 ( 0.04 ) user 0.16 ( 0.02 ) sys 0.05 ( 0.01 )
CouchDB : real 3.03 ( 0.18 ) user 0.96 ( 0.05 ) sys 0.21 ( 0.03 )
Let 's say CouchDB is 10 times slower that the file system based cache .
Wow , CouchDB really sucks !
Why would you use it as tile storage ?
Although you could :
easily store metadata with every tile , like a date when it should expire .
keep a history of tiles and show them as " travel through time layers " in your mapping application
easy replication to other servers
You just do n't want such a slow hog .
And those CouchDB people try to tell me that CouchDB would be fast .
Pha !
Really ??
You might already wonder , where the details are , the software version numbers , the specification of the system and all that stuff ?
These things are missing with a good reason .
This benchmark just is n't right , even if I would add these details .
The problem lies some layers deeper .
This benchmark is way to far away from a real - life usage .
You would request much more tiles and not the same 780 ones with every run .
When I was benchmarking the filesystem cache , all tiles were already in the system 's cache , therefore it was that fast .
With 40 games in the bag , it 's time to assess what we have on our hands here .
Favorite ?
Underdog ?
Underachievers ?
Lovers ?
Fighters ?
Some of our earlier intuitions have been confirmed through the first half while others have proven false .
The club as it operated through the final portion of 2009 was at times wholly dominant and at others cannon fodder .
Here , Robert Cleave and I will discuss the issues that have caught our eye and how we see them affecting the club 's drive to make it past the first round in April .
As always , feel free to share your own thoughts in the comments .
1. ) Rene Bourque was probably the Flames best all around forward in the first half of the season .
Do you agree ?
If so , who would you slot behind him as a first half MVP type ( outside of Kipper , that is ) ?
Robert : Outside of Kiprusoff , probably Bouwmeester , simply because of the minutes he 's had to log with Sarich on the shelf .
One other thing that occasionally gets lost in the whole debate over a defenceman 's value is their work on the PK .
That 's a place where a coach 's choice can tell you what he really thinks of a player 's defensive skill , and that 's where Jay Bouwmeester is clearly ahead of Phaneuf in terms of performance .
Brent Sutter 's utilization of the two on the PK would suggest to me that he agrees with that analysis .
Kent : I 'm going to go with Curtis Glencross , despite the lackluster counting stats .
His underlying numbers ( corsi , scoring chances ) are stellar and his importance to the success of the third line ( that is Conroy and Moss ) has been revealed recently with their struggles in the wake of his promotion .
I would also like to throw in mentions for Daymond Langkow and Mark Giordano who have been consistently good since puck drop in October .
2. ) Alternatively , who has been the biggest disappointment on the club ?
Robert :
You should have phrased this like the first question , as in -" outside of Jokinen , that is " .
In that spirit , I 'd say David Moss .
He does n't look the same to me , although I think he 's been a victim of not having Glencross at his side every night .
I do n't expect third - liners to do it alone .
Iginla 's also been slightly less in terms of possession than we'd all like , but I think the boss ' insistence on pairing him with Jokinen was at the root of things .
If the new lines hold and Joker gets off the pot as well , he can get out of the doghouse , too .
I think the D have been pretty decent all around .
People , myself included , are hard on Dion , and his contract is a clear over - pay , but " clear over - pay " does n't equal " bad " .
Kent : Aside from Jokinen , I 've been fairly disappointed with Jarome Iginla .
His run in October was mainly percentages and he 's been bottom of the barrel by the metrics and by my eye far too many nights for a guy with his reputation and size of contract .
Some of that is no doubt circusmstances , given he was playing against the big boys with Olli Jokinen many nights , but the fact that he often could n't even battle up to respectable levels makes me wonder if his days of being a truly elite ES player are past .
Since I can't go with just one guy , I 'd like to add in Robyn Regehr , who has also had more off nights in the first half than I 'm used to .
There 's been some evenings where the action has looked a tad too fast for Robyn and he 's ended up making some curiously bad decisions .
That said , Reggie has gone through periods like this in the past and come out fine on the other end , so we 'll probably just have to wait it out .
3. ) The Flames possession and out - shooting numbers are well behind the numbers of last year 's edition .
Is the cause coaching or personnel ?
Robert : How 's that go ?
A little from column A , a little from column B ?
They 've missed Mike Cammalleri 's output , no question , and being one proper forward short in the top nine means one line always is underperforming .
With the recent moves , the third line has been sub-standard .
Forwards drive possession , IMO , so having one line in three struggling will hurt your team 's numbers .
Of course , I 'd rather have the third line a bit off than continue seeing the first line drown , because the likely consequences are more dire if your stars can't get it done .
The coaching aspect to this is in two parts .
First , Sutter 's bull - headedness regarding the Joker - Iggy pairing did the Flames no favours .
Olli Jokinen needs to not play straight P v P to have a chance at being productive , and Jarome Iginla needs players more suited to him to be at his best .
I think the possession numbers have been hurt by that stubbornness , so I 'm hopeful that the current arrangement continues to hold .
The second part of coaching is style .
The Flames have spent a lot of time using a 1 - 4 set - up , even in the early part of games , and it drives me a bit nuts .
It 's very hard to score if the puck is always in your end , right ?
That approach might be a product of Sutter not quite believing his players can force the issue for a full game , but it still seems not quite right , at least to me .
Kent : I agree that both at fault .
The loss of Cammalleri was a significant one .
In many ways , he was as good or superior to Iginla last year and Jokinen is nowhere close to an adequate replacement .
Also , losing Lombardi up the middle has probably had some sort of impact ; although he's not a legit top 6 forward , he was capable of moving the puck in the right direction against the weaker sisters .
He was also one of the team 's better face - off men , which has been a weak point for them this year .
On the coaching front , you touched on the ill - fated Iginla and Jokinen tandem , so I 'll go with the organization 's emphasis ( perhaps over - emphasis ? ) on defensive play and goals against .
It was roundly noted after Keenan 's firing that the team 's primary weakness was defense and that would be the focus of the new coaching staff coming into the new season .
As such , there 's a chance that the bench boss has focused the game plan around that goal to the potential exclusion of generating offense .
4. ) What do you see as the club 's primary weakness ?
As such , who would you target at the trade deadline and who do you see as trade bait ?
Robert : I 'd suspect the careful readers amongst you might suspect I 'd like to see one more forward for the top nine ;-)
In all seriousness , I love Curtis Glencross ' game , but I 'd love it a pile more on the third line .
The " how " part is where it gets tricky .
According to CapGeek , if the Flames do n't call any more players up for an extended period , on March 3rd they 'll have just over 6 million in full season cap space .
I do n't imagine Daz will try to run things as tightly as last year , so if the Flames do n't move a significant roster player in a trade , you 're talking about players making in the 2 - 4 million dollar range , and I 'd think it 'll be straight rentals that they want .
So , who ?
The usual suspects will crop up , I 'd guess .
Alex Tanguay , Ray Whitney , Alexei Ponikarovsky , that type of player .
Colby Armstrong , Alexander Frolov and Tomas Plekanec fit in terms of salary , but I 'd guess that their teams will try fairly hard to resign them , or want more than the Flames can offer .
No draft picks in the first two rounds make it hard for Calgary to take a run at some of these players .
The only player on the roster that I could see Calgary moving is Cory Sarich .
I have no idea what his perceived value is , but it may not be enough to get what the Flames want , and the two extra years on his contract are n't necessarily a point in his favour .
Beyond that , I 'd guess one of the Flames ' young D down in Abby might be on the move .
I do n't know that the Flames can keep them all , and T.J. Brodie and Tim Erixon will both need places to play in the next couple of years .
And no , I do n't see the Flames moving Dion Phaneuf or Olli Jokinen .
The only chance that Phaneuf goes is after another playoff failure , and even then , he may not be moved .
Jokinen has no value at the moment , and the Flames simply have to hope that things turn for him a bit .
They 're married to him until June 30th , I 'd wager .
Kent : Could n't have said it better myself .
Another target may be Paul Kariya , although one wonders how much he has left in the tank .
Nominal health spending in the United States grew 4.4 % in 2008 , to $ 2.3 trillion or $ 7,681 per person .
This was the slowest rate of growth since the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services started officially tracking expenditures in 1960 , yet once again outpaced nominal GDP growth ( 2.6 % in 2008 ) .
This brings health care spending to 16.2 % of GDP .
In 2003 the total health care spending was 15.3 % of GDP .
The huge amount being spent continues to grow to an even larger percentage of GDP every year .
The damage to the economy of the dysfunctional health care system in the USA is huge .
For comparison the total GDP per person in China is $ 5,970 ( the closest total country per capita GDP , to the health care spending per capita in the USA , is Thailand at $ 7,703 – World Bank data ) .
The average spending by OECD countries ( Europe / USA / Japan … ) was $ 2,966 per person in 2007 ( the USA was at $ 7,290 ) .
In 2007 Canada spent $ 3,895 ; France $ 3,601 ; UK $ 2,992 ; Japan $ 2,581 .
Hospital spending in 2008 grew 4.5 % to $ 718 billion , compared to 5.9 % in 2007 , the slowest rate of increase since 1998 .
Physician and clinical services ’ spending increased 5.0 % in 2008 to $ 496 billion , a deceleration from 5.8 % in 2007 .
Retail prescription drug spending growth also decelerated to 3.2 % in 2008 as per capita use of prescription medications declined slightly , mainly due to impacts of the recession , a low number of new product introductions , and safety and efficacy concerns .
Drug prices increased 2.5 % in 2008 .
Spending growth for both nursing home and home health services decelerated in 2008 .
For nursing homes , spending grew 4.6 % in 2008 compared to 5.8 % in 2007 .
Total health care spending by public programs , such as Medicare and Medicaid , grew 6.5 % in 2008 , the same rate as in 2007 .
Health care spending by private sources of funds grew only 2.6 % in 2008 compared to 5.6 percent in 2007 .
Private health insurance premiums grew 3.1 % in 2008 , a deceleration from 4.4 % in 2007 .
Remember many people lost their jobs and did without insurance .
Doing so results in reduced spending on health insurance but is far from a good sign .
Home health care spending growth decelerated from 11.8 % in 2007 to 9.0 % in 2008 .
Expenditures reached $ 64.7 billion in 2008 .
You can understand why investors ( and companies ) are looking to invest in home health care .
At the aggregate level , the shares of financing for health services and supplies by businesses ( 23 % ) , households ( 31 % ) , other private sponsors ( 3 % ) , and governments ( 42 % ) have remained relatively steady over time .
Between 2007 and 2008 ; however , the federal government share increased significantly ( from 23 to 25 % ) , while the state and local government share declined ( from 18 to 17 % ) .
Decades ago Dr. Deming included excessive health care costs as one of the seven deadly diseases of western management .
We have only seen the problem get worse .
Finally it seems that a significant number of people are in agreement that the system is broken .
I truly do not understand how the USA continues to subsidies those special interest in favor of the current obviously broken system .
How people can possible claim the USA is so bad at health care we can’t possible just pay say 20 % more per person to get results no better than other countries .
We are not comparing the USA to some idealized dream system .
We are comparing it to government run programs that are amazingly cheaper and have at least equal ( often better ) performance measures .
Do these special interests really expect us to accept that the USA system requires us to pay 243 % of the OECD average for worse outcome measures ?
And even then , tens of millions of people ’s lives caused great distress due to the lack of health care or financial ruin due to health care costs they must pay out of pocket ?
The apologist for the special interests have had decades to fix this system .
We ca n’t afford to keep letting them distort our economy for their benefit .
They have had decades to make gains .
We need to stop letting the special interests delay and start adopting sensible solutions now .

 The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation , and go to the grave with the song still in them . 
The above quote comes from the classic book  Walden written by Henry David Thoreau and speaks to anyone with an entrepreneurial spirit .
Im not trying to get all spiritual or new age on you , but I think the above quote is one of the most powerful and telling things I have ever read .
What this says to me is most of us go through our lives wanting more but accepting less .
We accept a life that is lacking passion .
We know we want to do more or make more of ourselves , and it tears us up inside , but we resign ourselves to accepting the status quo and not taking any action to make our life and the lives of those around us better .
 and go to the grave with the song still in them . 
I think this is the saddest part of the quote , because , to me , it says that not only do we know we want more and to make more of ourselves , but we have the ability to make the changes we want , but are simply too tired , drained , and discouraged to do so .
Pretty depressing , right ?
This Quote and You
So , how does this relate to you ?
First , if you feel this quote applies to you , work like heck to get out of your rut and start making some changes in your life , even if its something simple like driving a different route to work .
Sticking with your current routine should n’t be an option !
( Although , be smart about it .
Quitting your job or not paying the bills might feel good , but will probably leave you in an even worse bind ! )
Second , find something you re 100 % passionate about and spend time doing it .
For me , it s writing about entrepreneurship , personal finance , and the environment .
Whatever your passion is , find it and embrace it !
Third , if you re so inclined and want to take on the challenge , try and find ways that you can turn your passions into a business .
Even if its something that you do on the side in your spare time , I think youll find even more fulfillment in your passions by transferring them to your work . 
What are your thoughts ?
Are you one of the quietly desperate with a song in you ?
Have you broken free and made extraordinary changes in your life ?

See it after the jump .
On Wednesday morning , while the Denver City Council 's safety committee was going over member Charlie Brown 's latest pot proposal , two men tried to rob The Healthy Choice Wellness Center -- an incident that led to two elementary schools being locked down as well as loads of media coverage .
The heist attempt confirmed to councilman Michael Hancock that the council " is on the right track " regarding security provisions written into the proposed ordinance -- and he understands why folks at some dispensaries are arming themselves .
" From what we 've heard , a lot of these owners have concealed - weapon permits -- and would I do that if I was running one of these businesses ?
Probably , " Hancock says .
" It 's a high cash business , and it sells a product that some people who do n't need it as patients still might want to use recreationally .
" The ordinance calls for armed security offers on site , " he adds , " and hopefully things like that will be a deterrent to crime . "
In the wake of Wednesday 's safety committee hearing , word began circulating that Hancock planned to write a letter to Denver mayor John Hickenlooper asking him to impose an immediate moratorium on new dispensaries until the ordinance could take effect .
Hancock says that 's not the case , although the rumor had a basis in reality .
" I was never planning to write a letter , " he says .
" What I was looking into was whether the mayor could issue moratorium from Wednesday to the end of the month .
It was just a conversation , and I found out that the Mayor could n't legally issue an executive order on sales tax licenses and the city council would n't be able to act fast enough so that the moratorium would be in place immediately .
It would have taken at least two and a half weeks , and that would have taken us past the first of the year . "
Regarding matters of safety , Hancock says , " the ordinance addresses some important security issues , like having security officers at these facilities , and cameras .
Some of these men and women who are n't necessarily patients and who are thinking about robbing one of these facilities will hopefully think twice if they know that whatever they do will be recorded , and that they might run into someone who 's armed . "
Another section of the proposal calls for dispensaries to be located at least 1,000 feet away from schools -- which , as Hancock notes , is twice the distance required of liquor stores .
( Of course , there 's no such restriction on banks , even though they 've been the subject of a striking number of armed robberies lately . )
Not that Hancock thinks this figure should be reduced .
" Quite frankly , I 'd prefer that they were a mile away , but that 's impossible with the number of schools we have in Denver , " he says .
" But we just want to prevent a situation where these dispensaries are across the street or next door to schools . "
Especially when lead starts to fly .
It was the site of America 's first black - owned daily paper and first black radio station .
It was here Martin Luther King was born .
It was here King preached freedom from the pulpit of Ebenezer Baptist Church .
In the 1960s , as the civil rights struggle raged , Sweet Auburn was wealthy and middle - class .
Its businesses prospered , its nightclubs boomed .
Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin played at the Top Hat Club and partied at the Palamat Motor Lodge opposite .
As American blacks freed themselves from oppression , Sweet Auburn stood ready to reap the benefits .
It never happened .
Sweet Auburn is not very sweet today .
The Palamat is overgrown with weeds .
Auburn 's sidewalks line abandoned lots and shuttered buildings .
Homeless men ( all black ) cluster on street corners .
Freed from segregation , Auburn became an impoverished ghetto .
Perhaps nothing else so encapsulates the endless paradoxes of being black in America .
Never have blacks had so much legal freedom , yet there are record numbers in jail .
Traditional black neighbourhoods have collapsed into drug - ridden crime strongholds , even as the black middle class is the biggest in history .
It is now 40 years since the Voting Rights Act that secured the black vote .
It is 10 years since hundreds of thousands of blacks came to Washington in the Million Man March to demand a way out of poverty .
It is a single month since Hurricane Katrina exposed the racial faultlines that fracture the big cities .
Almost four decades after King was killed , there are still two Americas .
One is largely white and wealthy , one largely black and poor .
They live cheek by jowl in the same country yet in separate worlds .
The shocking thing about the TV pictures from New Orleans was not black poverty , it was the reaction of whites .
' Most whites were shocked about the amount of poverty in New Orleans , but black media have talked about poverty for the past 20 years , ' said David Canton , professor of history at Connecticut College .
Bare statistics tell the story .
Black life expectancy is six years shorter than that of whites .
Black unemployment is twice as high .
Blacks are twice as likely as whites to die from disease , accident or murder at every stage of their lives .
About 24 per cent of black families live below the poverty line , compared with 8 per cent of the white population .
Yet nothing about race in America is that simple .
In the Savoy Bar of Atlanta 's Georgian Terrace Hotel , young blacks sip Martinis and flirt , dressed up to the nines .
Outside , crowds spill out of the Fox Theatre dressed for an evening out .
They are all black .
' It is great to be black in Atlanta , ' said Monique Williams , a pretty 26 - year - old legal clerk at the bar .
' This is our city . '
Certainly Atlanta , unofficial capital of the New South , can sum up the best of black America .
It has a majority black population , a black mayor and an economy that is home to some of the biggest businesses in the world , including Coca - Cola and CNN .
It has wealthy black suburbs , black universities and offers every opportunity for aspiring young blacks .
It is a long way from the city of Gone With the Wind , where the only blacks were maids and slaves .
Mayor Shirley Franklin seems to sum up this hopeful city , often hailed as a beacon for black Americans .
As Atlanta 's first black woman mayor , she has won a national profile after a term aimed at rejuvenating a rundown downtown .
She is hard - working , putting in 12 - hour days and seven - day weeks , and has ended a series of corruption scandals that plagued previous administrations .
She is likely to win re-election next month , backed by black voters and white business .
But Atlanta 's politics are defined by race .
A new law , backed by Franklin , made begging illegal in the downtown area last month .
The move triggered a race row , with some politicians saying the law targeted young black men .
When it finally passed , emotions ran so high that police arrested seven people , including a clergyman and a former city councillor .
At every level of US politics race is never far away .
King , were he alive , would have rejoiced at the fact that successive Secretaries of State , Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice , have been black .
He would also have been impressed that one of the hottest Democratic tips for the White House , and a possible running mate of Hillary Clinton in 2008 , is Barack Obama , who is black .
But those stories have twists .
Powell and Rice sprang from solid middle - class backgrounds .
They have risen by playing down race .
They have also emerged in the Republican Party , not the traditional home of black support .
Moreover , Obama 's blackness does not come from America .
It is a legacy of a Kenyan father .
He was born in Hawaii and his mother is a white woman from Kansas .
In the world of race in America in 2005 nothing is ever as simple as black or white .
Yet the racial line often seems starkly clear .
Nowhere more so than in New Haven , Connecticut : home both to Yale University and one of America 's poorest black communities .
The border is well known and obvious .
It is where Elm Street , lined with Oxbridge - style student cloisters , suddenly changes to Dixwell Avenue , main thoroughfare of the black ghetto .
On one side is the world of the elite , where Ivy League students bustle from lecture halls to cafes .
On the other side is north - west New Haven , where Dixwell 's shops struggle to make ends meet , houses are in decay and drugs and crime are rife .
One world is mostly white , the other almost all black .
As he sits on New Haven 's famous green , surrounded by the trappings of Yale 's wealth , there is no doubt on which side of the divide Nelson Brown falls .
Black , poor and homeless , he pushes a shopping cart full of metal cans he picks up to recycle .
The cart is draped with a faded and dirty US flag .
' It 's all I can do to survive , ' he said of his latest haul of soft drink cast - offs .
New Haven is the reality of America 's urban black poor .
' People like the Katrina victims are living in every American city .
We just ignore it , ' said Robert Brown , a political scientist at Atlanta 's Emory University .
It is this world Katrina exposed to a white America that barely knew it existed outside of gangsta rap videos on MTV .
This is the world abandoned by America in the post - civil rights era .
It is a black underclass that failed to leave the inner city as whites fled to the suburbs , gutting cities of cash and jobs .
But there are other issues at work too .
The divide of black and white masks another chasm just as deep : the gulf between poor and rich blacks .
In fact , this divide is even more unbalanced than the racial one .
The wealth of black America is far more concentrated in its top few per cent than white America .
Poor urban blacks have been abandoned by wealthy black Americans who move into the suburbs and mainstream America as fast as they can .
The underclass they leave behind is a grim place and getting worse .
In 1940 the illegitimacy rate among blacks was 19 per cent ; today it is 70 per cent .
Only 30 to 40 per cent of black men graduate from high school .
That fact has prompted a bout of soul searching by middle - class blacks .
Some have condemned what they see as self - perpetuating joblessness , poor education and a culture that worships crime .
Others have appealed for more help , an increase in the affirmative action which has done apparently little to end black poverty .
The argument was crystallised in a spat between the black comedian Bill Cosby and the black author Mike Dyson .
Cosby began it with a public excoriation of bad ( and single ) parenting , slang English , unplanned pregnancies , dropping out of education , and high crime .
He even slammed black names ' like Shaniqua , Shaligua , Mohammed and all that crap ' .
Cosby then went on tour holding town hall - style ' call - outs ' in black communities .
It was an argument Dyson had little time for .
He dubbed Cosby 's roadtrip the ' Blame the Poor Tour ' and wrote a book called Is Bill Cosby Right ?
Or Has the Black Middle Class Lost Its Mind ?
Dyson said poor blacks could not be blamed for a society geared up to see them fail and which had stacked the odds against them before they were born .
Many leading blacks have joined the fight against Cosby .
' He unerringly and wrongly blames the poor .
He seems to think that if they would only change their minds , all their problems would go away , ' said Ronald Walters , director of the African American Leadership Institute at the University of Maryland .
There is one thing both sides agree on : the black experience of America has been unique .
Other immigrant groups have followed a familiar pattern of four stages .
They arrived poor , suffered prejudice , assimilated , then prospered .
So it went for the Irish , Italians , Asians and many others .
In fact , Asians are now more successful than white Americans .
They are more educated and get better jobs .
But much of black America is stuck at stage two , as it has been for generations .
Unless one believes in racist theories , the answer must lie within black America 's own historical experience .
They were the only ethnic group brought to America involuntarily .
For 250 years they were kept as slaves .
Until the late 1960s blacks in the South were denied the vote , forced to eat in separate restaurants and segregated from society .
Lynchings were still happening in the 1960s as the Beatles played in Liverpool and Bobby Moore lifted the World Cup in London .
The exhibits of the Martin Luther King museum on Auburn Avenue are most shocking for showing how recently an apartheid system was the norm in swaths of America .
That history lies heavy on black America 's back .
It is not a burden to be unshouldered in a generation or two .
Certainly that racist past is still alive for Robert Howard , a black civil rights worker in rural Georgia .
He remembers vividly the days when white people in and around his home in Walton County could beat - or even kill - black people with little fear from the law .
It was a time of segregation and deference , of living in fear when the word ' nigger ' came from the lips of white people and not rap artists .
A tall , thin , graceful man , Howard exudes a calm when talking about race relations now versus then .
' Things are better .
Of course they are .
But you'd be amazed by how much is still to change , ' he said .
Howard has worked tirelessly for a memorial to a Walton County lynching from 1946 when four local blacks were butchered by their white neighbours .
It has earned him both praise and insult .
' There 's some black people here right now who are still scared , ' he declared .
But things have changed .
Walton , like so many southern counties , used to be cotton country .
No longer .
The cotton fields have surrendered to strip malls or to forestry .
It used to be strictly segregated .
No more .
That everyday racism is long gone too .
Blacks have political power here , as they do now even in the deepest parts of the Deep South .
Where segregation still exists , it is largely voluntary and economic , and not a matter of law .
But therein lies the problem .
Even as the old racism lies dead , its legacy endures in the American economy .
As the black middle class grows and black politicians rise to the pinnacle of power , wealthy America - both black and white - has still not come to grips with the problems of its millions of poor black citizens .
' We are grappling with that .
Protest will not win these issues .
All the old racist laws have been stricken from the books .
Now it 's economics , ' said Brown .
It is a problem that can not be ignored for ever .
Martin Luther King 's most famous words summed up the optimism of the 1960s ' civil rights struggle with : ' I have a dream . '
Now the poet Langston Hughes best describes black America at the start of the 21st century .
' What happens to a dream deferred ? ' he wrote .
' Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun ?
Or fester like a sore - And then run ? '
Two worlds
In 2005 black unemployment in the US was 10.8 per cent , compared to 4.7 per cent for whites .
More than 70 per cent of whites own their homes .
Fewer than 50 per cent of blacks do .
Blacks are twice as likely as whites to die from disease , accident or murder .
Black life expectancy is six years less than white life expectancy .
Blacks are three times as likely as whites to be jailed and their sentences are often six months longer .
Net worth of a black household is 10 times less than a white one .
