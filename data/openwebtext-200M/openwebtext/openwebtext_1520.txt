UPDATE : NEW SHIRT BASED ON THIS COMIC !!!
Science Fiction TV - Movie Title Generator T - Shirt @ Topatoco !!!
There is also a PRINT of this design too !
BEHOLD !
I have decrypted the ancient science fiction alchemy from which unspeakable beasts are birthed !
What monsters will you create now that you know the secret ?
Dinoyeti ? Chupaconda ?
Arachnodile ?
Tractorsaurus ?
Sharkshark ?!
TO THE COMMENTS WITH YOU !
[ Edward shirts now at Topatoco ! ]
Feel free to use the chart to create your own monster pairings , and divulge what would be the climactic scene / death scene in the movie ( ie the megashark eats a plane out of the sky or the dinoshark eats a surfer mid-wave , etc ) .
Feel free to reuse prefixes and suffixes , mix the columns and add new animals or object modifiers as you see fit .
If you are feeling super frisky , why not draw one of these creatures and post a link to it in the comments .
Do n’t forget , this weekend is Comicpalooza in Houston , TX !!!
I will be doing a webcomics panel with Randy , Malki ! and Phil Foglio so come out and say hi and buy stuff and we ’ll have a good time .
Here are two inspiring water gardens I saw at the San Francisco Flower and Garden Show .
They could n’t have been more different .
The first was smoothly modern , taking its cue from architectural hardscapes .
The second hearkened back to natural forms .
Calm smooths the edges
In contemporary designs like this first one ( in Photos No. 1 and 3 above ) , the water element becomes architectural , its very flatness replicating the surfaces of the surrounding concrete , wood and metal .
I was totally attracted to this calm clean space .
The steel walkways invited me to cross over the water with all the allure that bridges possess .
The destinations included handsome wooden benches on one island , and very luxy seating on the other .
I could imagine this installation occupying an entire small backyard , especially in an urban setting .
Or it could be a pocket garden , tucked next to a house , for the added pleasure of water views from indoors .
It was a retreat where grown - ups retire at the end of hectic day , or friends gather — I did n’t see this area as appropriate for small children ; it would need some kind of discreet fencing .
The space was high on attractiveness and low on maintenance .
Designed by Huettl Landscape Architecture , the water garden employed the latest in biological filtration technology , installed by Concord Feed .
The water is kept clean and sparkling and chemical free , always a bonus in any gardening situation .
The surrounding plantings , in islands and in containers , both in and out of the water , softened the severe rectilinear approach .
Leaping salmon sculptures on the far wall also supplied the balance of curving shapes , and added a hint of levity to all that calm .
Nature bubbles through
The second display garden ( at left and Photo No. 2 above ) , put together by Ripple Effect Water Gardens , was a series of naturalistic meandering streams and pools .
The cheerful sound of the water flowing and the use of river rocks and tree limbs in the streams created a satisfying gardening experience that , with the right screening , could fit into any backyard setting .
The plantings on the surrounding banks were often natives , ferns , or other minimal - care woodland plants .
This water garden reminded me of my favorite streams in the woods , places where I played as a child .
It invited you to explore the banks , to find out what was growing there , and to peer into the water to see what you might discover .
Compare and contrast
What was the same for both gardens ?
Biological filtering .
Maintenance was actually very similar in both spaces .
Per square foot , water designs like these two can be one of the most easy - care gardens , consisting of weekly filter cleanings and quick sweepings for floating debris , along with a yearly deep clean , usually done in spring .
These disparate styles of water gardens worked for me .
To make a comparison , I think the first involved my head — the fabulous geometrics — and the second , my heart — naturalistic pulls me in .
Both , of course , would involve my hands , if I were the gardener in charge , but the minimal plantings in the first garden would probably take less time .
Which use of water do you like ?
In the end , it comes down to what you define as your own style .
Who knew water could be so versatile ?

This post was first published a little over two years ago , and it 's been one of the most viewed and shared posts ever since .
We 're still here in George Town , still eating around and taking in life in the city .
Sometimes it seems that things never change here , but of course they do .
And over five years after moving from Kuala Lumpur to Penang island we continue to stumble across new - to - us spots .
So it seemed time for an update :
Our experience of George Town is somewhat unique ; we 've been fortunate to know the city as tourists , a writer and photographer on assignment and for the last three - plus years , as residents .
We know what we like as folks living right in the heart of the city , right now .
But we can remember well what struck us as observers keen on finding a story , and what we wanted from and liked best about the city as travellers without a mission .
Every week I ( Robyn ) receive emails asking for recommendations -- for restaurants and hawker stalls , for hotels , for non-street food places to eat .
There 's already loads of Penang and George Town info on this blog as well as in articles I 've written for the New York Times , SBS Feast , Wall Street Journal Asia , Travel + Leisure Southeast Asia and other publications .
But now , as tourism to the UNESCO world heritage site I call home grows by leaps and bounds , it seems a good time to pull some loose ends together into a post that will hopefully insure visitors make the most of their time here .
If you 're planning a visit to Penang know first that George Town is the place to stay .
The island 's beaches just do n't rate , especially when compared with others in the region .
Penang is an increasingly urbanized island half of whose coastline is separated from a busy shipping port by a well traversed strait .-- which does n't make for pristine waters .
And , unfortunately , increasingly larger swathes of the island are falling to unsightly development ; head north up the east side of the island from George Town past kilometer after kilometer of eyesores and you 'll see what I mean .
Sure , there are spots outside George Town worth visiting : Balik Pulau , durian farms ( in season ) , Penang Hill ( not on a weekend ! ) .... but all can be done comfortably in a day trip .
George Town : a mostly lowrise , very walkable city .
Red tile roofs mark old shop houses .
Despite gentrification and a serious overstock of boutique hotels , cafes and trinket shops -- and the resultant loss of many long - time residents -- George Town is still , somehow , very ' real ' .
Moreover it is unique in the region for its historically rich ( and fairly intact ) cityscape , loads of authentic ( ie. not designed for tourists ) " street theater " ( the Hungry Ghost festival is on as I write this ) and fabulous food , especially on the street .
Best of all , George Town is completely walkable .
A reasonably fit individual can walk the heritage site end - to - end ( Penang Road to Weld Quay , Prangin Canal to Fort Cornwallis ) in less than an hour .
WHEN TO GO
Penang 's climate - much like that of many other places in the world - is a bit screwy : it rains during the dry season , is dry during the wet season .
In short , there 's really no bad time to visit George Town ( even when it rains showers never last all day ) , though there are some less - good and times than others .
Many Chinese hawkers close during the first week , or at least the first 3 days , of Chinese New Year and February , March and April are often beastly hot ( you wo n't want to be out walking between 11:30 AM and 4:30 or 5 pm ) .
August is a great time to visit Penang , both for the George Town Festival and for Hungry Ghost month , observances of which reach a frenzy in Penang not seen elsewhere in the region .
Photographers flock to Penang for Thaipusam ( January or February ; the festival is several days long and involves a procession from George Town 's Little India to a temple on a hill in the middle part of the island ) and the Nine Emperor Gods Festival ( September or October ) , which lasts for nine days and culminates in a night - time procession the ends with small unmanned boats filled with offerings being set afire in the waters off Weld Quay .
( Dave published a multimedia of the event here .
Turn your sound on to watch . )
WHERE TO EAT
This list is far from comprehensive , it could extend for pages .
I wo n't claim that any of these spots are The Best this or that -- is n't that a fairly useless exercise when taste is so subjective ? -- but they are places that I , and folks whom I refer , consistently enjoy .
There 's enough here to keep you busy and well - fed for a good 3 days or so .
Addresses are listed or are to be found in links .
Tek Sen
These days you 'll rarely find Tek Sen this quiet
Our first meal here was in 2009 , back when Teochew - Chinese - Malaysian restaurant Tek Sen was a glorified stall with tables occupying an alley and a five - foot way , before it had a Facebook page and an illustrated menu and a few years before its mention in a Lonely Planet guide made tourists as often seen here as locals .
When Tek Sen tripled its capacity by relocating to its current double shophouse premises we feared the worst .
But quality has remained high , probably because the family that opened the place 25 or so years ago is still on hand , in the kitchen and the front of the house , to insure that your bacon candy is every bit as savory - salty - sweet - lardy as it should be .
These days the queues are gruesome ( but it 's worth the wait , we promise ! ) , so go early ( around 6 pm ) , late ( around 830 pm but beware -- customers are often turned away by 8:45 ) , or for lunch ( 11 am to 2 pm ) .
After all these years Tek Sen is still the first place we take visitors for a meal , and for good reason .
Some of our favorite dishes from a very long menu : Teochew steamed fish with tomatoes , tofu and sour plum ; gully tumis ; French beans stir - fried with pork ; steamed homemade tofu ; pork belly with preserved mustard greens ; potato leaves stir - fried with sambal or garlic ; bean sprouts with salted fish ; tamarind prawns ; pig 's trotters stewed in Chinese black vinegar and of course -- bacon candy ( aka double - cooked pork with chilies ) .
Ask about the specials on the white board ( written in Chinese ) .
Foong Wei , Sri Bahari half a block from Penang Road
After Tek Sen , the dinner spot we recommend most often is this classic oldish Chinese - Malaysian restaurant just outside the core conservation zone .
Expect fluorescent lights , red tablecloths and brusque service -- along with very good kind - of - retro ( in a non-hipster way ) food .
We like the mango chicken , prawn spring rolls , roast pork leg and spinach with century egg .
You can also ask for recommendations .
Toh Yuen , Campbell Street near Cintra
Go to this old Cantonese spot for the tea and the atmosphere -- plenty of old - timers while away hours here .
There is poached and roast chicken rice which is good but not as good as that at Keng Pin ( see below ) , and the odd dim sum and pork buns which are OK .
We go for the handmade fish ball soup with greens , and always ask them to throw in a few sui gao ( pork dumplings ) ; ' veggie ' ( blanched choy sum a drizzle of oyster sauce and sesame oil ) and kiam chai boi , a sour - spicy soup - stew " leftovers " dish of meat ( duck , here ) cooked with mustard greens , chilies , tamarind , asam keping ( " sour slices " ) and chilies .
Noodle dishes are also excellent -- try the sang har meen .
Nasi Padang / nasi Melayu at International Hotel
Gado gado on the left , pineapple curry and fried tempeh with green chilies on the right , deep - fried fried fish up top
Simply the best nasi campur ( " mixed rice " , ie . rice and curries ) in George Town , perhaps on all of Penang island .
The owners of this stall migrated a couple decades ago from Sumatra , and the Indonesian island 's influences come through in dishes like deep - fried tempeh with green chilies and dried anchovies , long eggplants fried to silkiness and doused with fiery red chili paste , beef jerky deep - fried with red chilies and an addictive sambal made with grilled green chilies and tiny fish .
Pineapple curry , whole round eggplant in an Indian - ish curry leaf - flecked curry , papaya leaves stewed in coconut milk , chicken stewed in kecap manis and red chilies and fresh pineapple achar say " Malaysia " , and the Chinese touch can be seen in a mild tofu skin - and - rice vermicelli soup .
The amazing spread here includes several types of whole fish ( look for deep - fried specimens spilling crispy caramelised sambal - rubbed sliced onions ) , a few different sambals and plenty of vegetarian options including , occasionally , do - it - yourself gado gado .
Open till 4 or 5 , but this is really a lunch place .
Go by noon for the best selection , and know that this place gets really crowded ( as in No Seats ) on weekends .
Note : this stall remains open for lunch during Ramadan .
Cozy seating and darned fine nasi campur at International Hotel
Woodlands , Penang Street about half a block east of China Street , Little India
Our beloved Veloo Velas just up Penang Street , which I included in the original version of this post , has taken such a dive in quality that I can no longer recommend it .
Happily Woodlands , a fairly comfortable ( yet still ridiculously inexpensive ) air - conditioned cafe with a friendly staff , is still going strong .
We go Woodlands for tiffin , the southern Indian term for morning and evening meals that do not revolve around rice and curries and other dishes but are comprised of deliciously easy - to - digest specialties made with fermented rice batter : thosai , idli , uttapam , etc .
Nasi Kandar at Toon Leong Cafe
Is this the famous Penang nasi kandar stall that Anthony Bourdain ate at ?
NO .
It 's better .
Run by the grandson of its founder , this little stall is parked at a kopitiam ( coffee shop ) run by the grandson of the guy who opened it over 80 years ago .
Service is mornings only , most things are sold out by ten .
I became reacquainted with the fragrantly spicy beef curry a week ago and am thrilled to report it 's as tender and delicious as ever .
Toon Leong 's strong kopi beng ( iced coffee with sweet milk ) , surely one of the best in town , is especially nice sipped while sitting in one of the coffee shop 's unironically vintage booths .
The coffee shop sells its ground coffee in 10 - ringgit bags .
Hainan chicken rice at Keng Pin on Penang Road
Hainan chicken rice may be Singapore 's national dish but we 're lucky to have a mighty excellent version here in George Town .
If you 're one of those folks who does n't " get " this dish try the version here , served from about 1130 am ( Mondays off ) by an intense couple who do n't smile much but do know how to delicately poach a chicken to barest doneness and cook rice in the bird 's broth with garlic to perfection , grains tender and separate .
The sourish chili sauce is nice too .
Specify when you order , breast or leg / thigh , with or without skin .
Oyster Omelette stall , front of narrow shop on Carnavon three doors east of Kimberley Street
This vendor does not get enough love .
It pains me to see his stall so unappreciated when the vendor of the ' famous ' oyster omelette of George Town , at a coffee shop just two doors down , does a rip- roaring business .
Be bold -- skip the famous version ( which is really just OK ) and try this one , which is really different .
Instead of the usually greasy , gummy pile this stall serves of a thin and lacy , crispy pancake of tapioca and rice starch batter layered with egg , and tops it with a mess of oysters fried with chili and bean paste .
The garnish of cilantro leaves takes it over the top .
The beef noodles soup served at the other stall occupying this narrow ( and , admittedly , hot as heck ) shop deserves notice too .
Note : in September oyster omelette and beef noodles will move down Carnavon west towards 1st Avenue shopping mall to a wider and more airy shop on the same side of the street .
Curry Mee ( on the same street as " Famous Cendol " -- see below -- off Penang Road )
Note : as of two weeks ago this curry noodle vendor was on temporary hiatus .
I include her stall nonetheless , in the hope that she 'll be back soon .
I love Eng , the bubbly woman who runs this stall , and I love her curry mee even more .
She used to park her stall on Cintra Street , but moved when the building behind her was refurbished .
I thought she was gone forever until we stumbled upon her current location , in front of a cute little shop house whose three tables offer a cool , quiet respite from George Town 's hot noisy streets .
Be sure to order the loh han goh , an ( admittedly pretty sweet ) herbal drink made with a dried medicinal fruit that is said to be cooling -- more so if ordered with ice .
Read more here .
Lam Mee , just outside pork section of Campbell Street Market , Carnavon Road
In a town of curries and smoky fried noodles it 's easy to overlook this subtle dish of yellow noodles ( or rice vermicelli , or a mixture of the two ) with bean sprouts , sliced pork and perfectly cooked tender - crunchy prawns in rich meat broth , but I encourage you to give it a try .
This stall parked in front of the pork butchers at the back of dilapidated ( but lovely ) Campbell Street Market crowns each bowl with a flurry of cilantro leaves and offers alongside an unusually ( for Penang ) fiery chili sauce redolent of fishy - funky belacan ( shrimp paste ) .
The noodles here were a recent ' discovery ' of ours ( if you can call a stall that you 've registered while walking past several times a week a ' discovery ' ) and I deeply regret all the years e've passed not enjoying them at least once a week .
The adjacent coffee stall serves an excellent traditional Malaysian brew .
Char Siew on Carnavon ( corner of Cheong Fatt Tze / Hong Kong Street )
Arrive to this coffee shop by 12:15 or you 'll end up waiting quite a while for your sweet - sticky pork .
All hell breaks loose when this vendor , one of the few in George Town to BBQ his pig Kuala Lumpur - style ( with a sticky , smoky glaze rather than Hong Kong style , dryish and rimmed in red ) arrives at 12:30 , unpacks roast pork , char siew and roast duck from his motorbike and hangs the meat in his glass display case .
For my money the roast pork is not quite as impressive as the char siew , but it certainly is n't awful .
The duck is very good , but nowhere near as tasty as that cooked over charcoal at Kuala Lumpur 's old Sek Yuen restaurant .
But then again I 'm not sure there 's a roast duck in Malaysia to match Sek Yuen's .
Served with a kickass chili sauce , cucumbers , rice and gravy ( if you want it ) .
Asam laksa at Weld Quay
Judgment of whether or not an asam laksa is " good " or " bad " or somewhere in between comes down to chilies , tamarind ( and / or asam keping , aka " sour slices " ) and fish .
I like my asam laksa spicy , tart and full of piscene flavor .
If you do too get your asam laksa at the stall that parks at the corner of Weld Quay and Aceh from around 2 in the afternoon until 5 .
( Tip : Go late for a more concentrated broth . )
Read more here .
If you can score a dozen of the delicious battered and deep - fried bananas sold from the stall across the street you have better luck than I do ( customers frequently by them by the whole batch ) .
Cendol on Burma Road at Lorong MacAlister
There may once have been a day when George Town 's " famous " cendol , located on a lane just off Penang Road , was famous for a reason other than that it 's famous , but that day is gone .
Watery coconut milk , suspiciously vividly green mung bean " pasta " and sloppy presentation ( the latter due , I suppose , to the need for speed to appease the inexplicablly huge crowds that mob this stall ) make this version a No - Go for me .
Do yourself a favor : bypass the crazy queue .
Walk right past and take a right at the flyover .
Two or three blocks up Burma Road , on your left , you 'll find a cart whose owners dish up a cendol much more worth your time and your money .
The wait is short , the coconut milk is thick and rich and the gula Melaka is deep and butterscotchy .
After 12 pm , odd off days .
( Thanks to Bee of Rasa Malaysia for this tip . )
CAFFEINATE
Over the past 18 months George Town has seen a rash of cafe openings .
In the last two years cafes have sprouted in George Town like fungi in a pine forest after a long rain .
I 'll be honest -- after many dismal cups I stopped trying them .
Instead I stick with two tried and true favourites :
The owner of China House is an Australian caffeine addict and her love of the bean comes through in the coffees served at the cafe .
Her baristas know what they 're doing and the beans are imported from a boutique roastery in Singapore .
( Desserts and homemade ice creams are a bonus . )
And if you can catch it open , the owners of Ete Cafe , a blink and you 'll miss it spot on Lorong Carnavon off of Carnavon Street , lend their uniquely Taiwanese love of coffee to brewing a very good cup .
His beautiful French pastries and macarons and her quiche ( both trained at Le Cordon Bleu ) are a bonus .
Narrow Marrow , run by a young couple who take their coffee seriously and have a great design sense , occupies George Town 's narrowest shop house ; it 's worth a visit just to take in the space itself .
We do n't get there as often as I 'd like , especially now that the cafe is only open on weekends .
But the vibe is very friendly , the espresso drinks are fabulous ; the also serve fruit drinks and beer .
Carnavon Street opposite the entrance to Prangin Lane .
WHERE TO SHOP
Kedai Kek Sunflower , Hutton Lane a bit north of Penang Road
Kueh lapis , a lovely cake composed of many many super - thin layers that is made by pouring , baking , pouring , baking , pouring baking and so on for each individual layer , keeps and travels well -- making it an excellent gift or edible souvenir .
The good version is made with butter , as is the kueh lapis at this little shop where , the last time I was in , you could watch the co-owner make her cakes up front near the display case .
Go for the original version -- not chocolate chip or raisin or whatever other flavours they 've got going now .
Expect to pay around 20 ringgit for a cake , which is justified if real butter is used .
Chop Kongsi , Penang Street next to Ren I Tang Hotel , Little India
You never know what you 'll find at Chop Kongsi , an artist - run matchbox of a shop right next to Ren I Tang ( see Where to Stay , below ) .
Malaysian Foo May
Lyn does her own thing with needles , yarn , threads , lace , textiles , pen and pencils .
A nice change from the same - old same - old items sold in many shops around George Town .
Check out Chop Kongsi's wares on its Facebook page .
Kitchenware shops , Carnavon Road across from 1st Avenue shopping mall
Right next to the fruit store at the corner are two side - by - side shops selling almost everything for the kitchen , including new enamel ware ( from China , most likely ) .
Be willing to sweat a bit and poke around in the dust for wooden moon cake holds , colourful melamine plates and bowls , patterned ceramic ware and other odds and ends .
You 'll find many of these items for sale in cute shops nearer the centre of George Town -- for a lot more .
WHERE TO STAY
I live here so obviously I 'm not staying at hotels .
I include places that I have either viewed several times , that are run by people who have a reputation for being on top of service , or that have been recommended to me by at least three of my street food walk clients .
( FWIW George Town 's two oldest , and most ' classic ' hotels , consistently get the thumbs - down from folks staying there .
No need to mention names , but it seems to be a case of resting on laurels . )
My bias is towards smallish , unique hotels that are the result of a sensitive / smart refurbishment of older structures by owners who 've really put their heart (s ) into the project .
There 's a lot of sub - par refurbishment going on in ( formerly ) lovely old buildings around town ; know when you book a hotel that the word " heritage " in its name guarantees nothing .
7 Terraces
Stunning suites with very cool black and white mosaic tiled bathrooms arranged around a long courtyard on the second story of seven rebuilt terrace houses .
Very private ( only guests and their guests are allowed beyond the bar and restaurant ) with a small pool .
Read my full review for Wall Street Journal Asia here .
Campbell House
I included this early comer to George Town 's boutique hotel scene in my NYTimes Travel " 36 Hours in Penang " piece , which a few years ago was republished in a book of 36 Hours pieces .
As such rooms here can be hard to come by but it 's worth trying , because Campbell House is small and intimate and the welcome is warm , thanks to the hands - on management style of its Malaysian and Italian owners .
Note :
Do not be fooled by the copycat signage of the ' Campbell House guest house ' opened right next door .
It has no association with this hotel .
Ren I Tang
Ren I Tang lobby
Fabulously located in Little India , which to my mind is one of George Town 's main attractions , the rooms at this refurbished Chinese medicine hall are as beautiful as they are comfortable , and are varied in size and configuration so as to accomodate the needs of single travelers and families as well as couples .
The cafe downstairs is a great spot in which to cool off ( passion fruit soda highly recommended ) while people watching .
Sin Keh
Sin Keh describes itself as a " guest house " but has all the comforts of a hotel ; it occupies a stylishly refashioned old shop house sited in a neighborhood not yet pocked with same - same cafes and trinket stores .
There 's an arts workshop and performance space in the hotel , which makes for a good crowd .
The vibe is laid back and friendly and the roof deck is a great place to relax at sunset with a drink .
As one who often finds that the problem with hotels is not the hotel but inconsiderate guests I appreciate Sin Keh 's " Quiet at Night " policy .
Lang Hoose
More than ten street food walk clients have talked up this guest house located on Beach Street opposite Toh Aka Lane .
But it 's recently changed hands , and I have no idea how that will affect the guest experience , if it does .
Still , if you 're looking for something a bit more on the budget side of things it may be worth checking out .

No matter how well a terrorist covers their tracks , or how cool they are under pressure , the Pentagon wants to be able to detect , track , and even positively identify them from a distance .
And they want to do it using nothing more than the heat and sweat that emanate from a person 's pores .
The military 's been after scent - based detection systems for years now .
In 2007 , Pentagon research agency Darpa solicited proposals for sensors to sniff out terrorists using unique genetic markers found in human emanations .
The idea was based on research showing that mice each carried a unique " odortype " that was consistent despite variables like stress , hydration or diet .
And odortypes are so powerful , they stick around for around a month after their host body has fled the premises .
But the most state - of - the - art tech , known as E - Nose , has only succeeded in distinguishing between two different people , and relies on " detecting human odor from the armpit region . "
Now , the Army is launching Identification Based on Individual Scent ( IBIS ) , and wantsproposals for a more sophisticated detection system , that could " uniquely identify an individual based on scent , " at a geographical distance or after several hours or even days .
That 's no easy task – in 2005 , one professor described human odor as " a cocktail of hundreds of molecules , " – but the Army envisions myriad civilian applications for the tech , including " identifying and tracking persons from the scenes of various crimes . "
The Army 's also launching " Human Signature Collection and Exploitation via Stand - Off Non-Cooperative Sensing , " to refine technology that can detect hostile intent based on thermal imaging – an analysis of the heat radiating off a body .
And since research has shown that different faces radiate heat in unique patterns , they 're hoping to create sensors that can positively identify people , much like iris scans or fingerprinting .
The idea would be particularly useful in urban war - zones , where troops are often forced to pick threats out of a crowd , recognize dangerous groups or clue into the nefarious intent behind seemingly benign behavior .
The Army 's project would allow troops to simultaneously ID potential threats and detect " aggression or hostile intent " – all at a safe distance from any insurgent armpits .

Last month , we published a post where we said that thousands of motorcyclists were expected to demonstrate all over France in protest at a recent Government announcement to fine any bikers caught filtering through the traffic .
Well , the demonstrations took place yesterday , 13th March 2010 .
More than 60 cities and towns saw their roads blocked by thousands of angry bikers who said NON to the French authorities who keep treating motorbikes , scooters and mopeds like cars .
The French Government have recently announced their intention to take draconian measures against bikers who overtake cars and filter in between them in traffic jams by issuing expensive fines .
They expect every bike to stay in lane , like cars , behind each other , and not go any faster than them .
How stupid is that ?
Paris , for instance , but also Lille , Lyon , Marseille , Bordeaux and Toulouse are already very congested cities due to the high number of cars in circulation , and the Government is keen to add more pressure on the roads by forcing Powered Two Wheelers ( PTW ) to behave like cars .
They treat us like cars , we will behave like cars !
La Fédération Française des Motards en Colère ( FFMC – the French Federation of Angry Bikers ) urged all motorcyclists on the other side of the Channel to protest and , as a result , France saw a total of 40,000 motorcyclists gathered on the roads yesterday , with 10,000 of them in Paris alone .
Parisian motorcyclists joined the FFMC at 2 pm at Château de Vincennes , on the outskirts of Paris .
There were already 5,000 bikers at 1.30 pm , another 2,200 joined between 1.30 pm and 2 pm and the rest joined during the demonstration .
Angry bikers took over the whole périphérique ( the express road running around the centre of Paris ) , each occupying the space of one car in each lane .
Within minutes , an enormous traffic jam was created by these 10,000 motorcyclists , thus gridlocking the whole of Paris on a busy Saturday afternoon , when Parisians go out to do their shopping and visit friends and relatives .
The result was absolutely spectacular , car drivers were stuck in traffic until late in the evening by the time all the traffic jams cleared .
Let ’s cause massive disruption in the metro !
For anyone who decided to leave their car at home and take the metro instead , unfortunately that did n’t help .
In response to a statement made by the French Transport Secretary , Jean - Marc Belotti , who said “ If they [ bikers ] are not happy , they can take the metro like everyone else ” , protestors took over the Paris underground network .
While some bikers continued to block the roads and cause standstill overground , others went down the underground en masse and occupied an entire train , thus bringing the entire line to a complete stop .
We let you imagine the outcome if thousands of motorcyclists left their bike at home and commuted by tube .
This is valid in London too , if Westminster City Council continue to stealth tax bikers to park , thus increase the cost of motorcycling .
Next time , Mr Belotti will think twice before opening his mouth !
UK France Bikers are very proud indeed of the FFMC and their actions to protect the rights of motorcyclists in France .
The FFMC is a real example to follow for everyone .
It is now time that public authorities , wherever they are in the world , realise that they ’re not above everyone else .
To the contrary , they are there to serve the people who elected them .
They inconvenience us , we will inconvenience them !
Power to the people !

300 Acres is a webroots campaign to save 300 acres of imminently endangered Northern Amazon rainforest by raising $ 73,000 in only 30 days .
Once obtained , the land would be returned to its indigenous inhabitants , the Amazanga .
The project was founded by our friend Natalie Villalobos , Community Manager for Google Sidewiki , and Shalaco Sching after meeting the Amazangan leader during the recent Google Earth Outreach / Indigenous Mapping Summit .
I met many amazing indigenous people from all over the world – but one story stuck with me .
It was that of Flavio Santi , the Shuar / Quichua healer and leader of the Amazanga people in attendance from the far - reaches of Puyo , Ecuador .
He gave a captivating talk with poignant analogies that gently inspired the hearts of everyone that listened to him .
I was so taken by his story that it led me to the question – What can I do ?
His goal – purchase 300 acres of ancestral land that was taken from the Amazanga people … and do it in 30 days or less .
It ’s not that he threw out this gauntlet to see if we could achieve it .
He and his people only have 30 days to make this happen .
Currently , with 14 days remaining , 300 Acres remains $ 50,000 short of their goal .
Please consider helping them by making a ( tax deductible ) donation today .
UPDATE : An anonymous donor just came through today and is willing to match ALL funds made to 300 Acres over the next 13 days .

If people want to help an Open Source project with graphics or UI it is even harder to do , because most designers are not that familiar with source control and most of the time there are guidelines or any directions on how to contribute anything for improving UI or any usability part .
Probably it would be useful to have a paragraph with instructions for people like that .

poor usability I have experienced open - source as a very closed community , it is dominated by a developer mindset ( that is impenetrable to anyone who is not a developer ) that is extremely limiting it 's reach .

And if it is , I can pretty easily guess that it 's going to be fairly easy to contribute .
Of course , that does n't mean projects should n't also link to the main github branch or somewhere like it .
Github has gone a huge way towards reshaping this scenario as a rule .
My first instinct now on wanting to know more about how something was implemented in an open source project or to contribute to it is to check if it 's on github .
I do n't even bother looking for info in the README or related ALLCAPSes until after I 've checked there .

Even without github it 's trivial to make and manage your patches ( maintain your fork , really ) until you figure out where to send them and get them accepted " upstream " .

I started writing opensource code in 1999 , and I wrote a lot of it .
I was also a very heavy contributor to various lugs in my area and on irc .
Then in 2004 I joined Yahoo ! and the bulk of my contributions stopped .
Over the following months I almost completely disappeared from the mailing lists I used to frequent .
The biggest reason for this though , was that my primary opensource projects competed with a Yahoo !
product , so I could n't ethically keep working on it .
My participation dropped to commenting on coding style and giving people commit access .
Secondly , Yahoo ! has an awesome internal developer community from which I could get my daily " fix " of technical discussions , rants and flame wars .
I no longer felt the need to drop in to an external mailing list and the only times I did were to say hello to all the people I 'd met over the years .
Contributing was never a problem .
If something did n't work , I 'd search for the source website , download the latest tarball and submit a patch on the mailing list .
If they did n't want it , I did n't care , I 'd just put it up on my web page and let others download it from there .
As long as it solved my own problem , I was happy .
In one instance though , my patch was n't just accepted , but I was instantly made " lead volunteer " of the module I 'd just patched since no one else was doing it .

I have n't found figuring out * how * to contribute to be terribly difficult , especially given that most of the projects I 've been interested in are on GitHub .
The complaint I have is that many times patch submissions ( or " pull requests " in GitHub parlance ) go into a black hole , with no response from the maintainers of the project .
Frustrating .

And so ...
When are you going to solve the other problem ?
The bigger one is of large companies swallowing open source contributors and them no longer giving back to the community that made them so employable .
I know it 's asking a lot , and google is probably the least of the problematic communities , but it seems like you solved the wrong problem here ;-)

Re : And so ...
Precisely -- it 's the mindset of large companies to be instantly against open source .
Why , after all , would we want to share our trade secrets with the rest of the web ?
They do not see what 's in it for them .

I think that 's what you get if you use the originally - documented identifier - select ( or " directed identity " ) flow .
Presumably Google OpenID is stuck with those URLs now because if you change them then folks wo n't be able to access their existing accounts ...
If you choose to " Sign in with Google " on TypePad we assume the identifier http://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id and get the same sort of result .

Submitting patches ?
In my experience , that 's the easy part .
" The ... code review tools , ... submit queues , continuous builds , test bots , documentation , and all associated machinery and processes " , on the other hand are practically non-existent .
Shoot , I 'd be thrilled if most of the projects I end up patching had outdated documentation and half a test suite because that would be an improvement .
( Common Lispers are particularly bad in this regard , which is n't really helping my lackluster documentation and testing habits . :/ )

is n't this what google and a project homepage is for ?
I 'm curious about why you 'd like for developers to place project essential information on contributing .
appspot rather than the project homepage itself ?
Most developers interested in a project will just google the project , find the homepage and look for all of this information here .
Searching for memcached , for example , lists the project page in the first 10 results , but nothing about contributing .
appspot.com .
Should n't the essential contribution information live closer to the other project documentation or code itself ?

Imagine that you ’ve never seen an iPad , but I ’ve just handed one to you and told you that you can read books on it .
Before you turn on the iPad , before you use it , you have a model in your head of what reading a book on the iPad will be like .
You have assumptions about what the book will look like on the screen , what things you will be able to do , and how you will do them — things like turning a page , or using a bookmark .
You have a “ mental model ” of reading a book on the iPad , even if you ’ve never done it before .
What that mental model in your head looks and acts like depends on a lot of things
If you ’ve used an iPad before , your mental model of reading a book on an iPad will be different than that of someone who has never used one , or does n’t even know what iPads are .
If you ’ve been using a Kindle for the past year , then your mental model will be different from someone who has never read a book electronically .
And once you get the iPad and read a couple of books on it , whichever mental model you had in your head before will start to change and adjust to reflect your experience .
Mental models have been around for a long time
I ’ve been talking about mental models ( and their counterparts , conceptual models , which we ’ll get to shortly ) since the 1980s .
I ’ve been designing interfaces for software , websites , medical devices , and even microwave ovens for ( way too many ) years .
I always enjoy the challenge of matching what is going on in the users ’ brains with the constraints and opportunities of the technology of the day ( or year , or decade ) .
Interface environments come and go ( e.g. , the “ green screen ” of character based systems , or the blue screen of early graphical user interfaces ) , but people change more slowly .
I find that some of the age - old user interface design concepts are still extremely relevant and important .
Mental models and conceptual models are some of my favorite interface design concepts that I believe have passed the test of time .
Just how long ?
The first person to talk about mental models was K.J.W.
Craik in his 1943 book , The Nature of Explanation .
Shortly thereafter , Craik died in a bicycle accident and the concept was dormant for many years , until the 1980s when the term reappeared .
In the ' 80s , there were two books published with the title Mental Models :
So what is a mental model , then ?
There are many definitions for mental models that have been around for at least the last 25 years or so .
One of my favorites is from Susan Carey ’s 1986 journal article , Cognitive science and science education , which says :
A mental model represents a person ’s thought process for how something works ( i.e. , a person ’s understanding of the surrounding world ) .
Mental models are based on incomplete facts , past experiences , and even intuitive perceptions .
They help shape actions and behavior , influence what people pay attention to in complicated situations , and define how people approach and solve problems .
What is a mental model in interface design ?
In the field of user interface design , a mental model refers to the representation of something — the real world , a device , software , etc. — that the user has in mind .
It is a representation of an external reality .
Users create mental models very quickly , often before they even use the software or device .
Users ’ mental models come from their prior experience with similar software or devices , assumptions they have , things they ’ve heard others say , and also from their direct experience with the product or device .
Mental models are subject to change .
Users refer to mental models to predict what the system , software , or product is going to do , or what they should do with it .
The best history and definition I ’ve found about mental models as they relate to software and usability is a 1999 article by Davidson , Dove , and Weltz titled Mental Models and Usability .
What is a conceptual model ?
In order to understand why mental models are so important to designing user interfaces , you have to also understand what a conceptual model is .
A conceptual model is the actual model that is given to the user through the interface of the product .
Going back to the iPad ebook example , you have a mental model about what reading a book will be like in the iPad , how it will work , what you can do with it .
But when you sit down with the iPad , the “ system ” ( the iPad ) will display what the conceptual model of the book app actually is .
There will be screens , and buttons , and things that happen .
The actual interface is representing the conceptual model .
Someone designed a user interface and that interface is communicating to you the conceptual model of the product .
Okay , so what ?
At this point you might be asking , “ So ?
Why do I care about this mental model / conceptual model idea ? ”
Here ’s why you should care : Everything we do in the field of user experience is , ultimately , about the match , or mismatch , between the users ’ mental models and the product ’s conceptual model .
Here are some examples :
If the product ’s conceptual model does n’t match the user ’s mental model , then the user will find the product hard to learn and use .
If the designers of the conceptual model did n’t take the user ’s mental model into account then it is highly likely that the product will be hard to learn and use .
If there are multiple user groups ( people who have used a Kindle before , people who have never read books electronically , etc. ) and the conceptual model is designed to match just one mental model , then the other users will find the device hard to learn and use .
If the conceptual model was not really designed , but is just a reflection of the underlying hardware or software or database , then the conceptual model will not match the user ’s mental model very well , and the users will find the device hard to learn and use .
Sometimes you know that the mental model of one or more user groups will not fit the conceptual model , and you want to change the user ’s mental model so that it matches the conceptual model you have designed .
For example , you know that people who have only read real , physical books will not have an accurate mental model of reading books on the iPad .
You can use a short training video to change their mental model before the iPad even arrives at their door .
In fact , the main purpose of training should be to adjust a user ’s mental model to fit the conceptual model of the product .
Terminology is important
Usability specialists and interface designers do n’t always agree on what to call something .
So I have to warn you that the way I ’m using the term mental model does not fit with at least one of the new definitions I ’ve been reading and hearing about lately .
Indi Young has written a book recently called Mental Models , and she ’s using the term in a different way .
She diagrams the behavior of a particular audience doing a series of tasks , including their goals and motivations .
Then underneath that she describes what the “ system ” or product will do , or be like , in order to match the task .
This entire structure she calls a “ mental model . ”
I think her technique is an interesting one , but I do wish she had used a different term to describe her diagrammatic representations .
Her methodology and its output look useful , but it does n’t match the definition of mental models that ’s been around for a long time .
It ’s all about the mental and conceptual models
I hope you are starting to see that mental models and conceptual models are very powerful for the work that an interface designer does .
I have sometimes gone so far as to say that almost everything we do during a user - centered design process has to do with either :
understanding what the users ’ mental models are ( with task analysis , observations , interviews , etc ) , or designing a conceptual model to fit the users ’ mental model ( interface design , iterations , validation testing , etc ) .
This is why I say that the secret to designing an intuitive user experience is making sure that the conceptual model of your product matches , as much as possible , the mental models of your users .
If you get that right you will have created a positive and useful user experience .
I ’ve had learning the computer language Haskell on my to - do list for some time .
I ’m actually stepping up to learn it now , thanks to a temporary lull in my other activities and a vicious cold that has left me disinclined to strenuous work .
I may associate Haskell with the taste of zinc gluconate for the rest of my days ; both have an astringent and medicinal quality and produce fervent claims of effectiveness about which I am moderately optimistic but which I have not yet personally verified .
Haskell is very obviously a language built by mathematical logicians for mathematical logicians .
Category theory lurks behind it in the same way that the lambda calculus lurks behind LISP .
The following is an effort to make Haskell ’s way of carving up the world intelligible , written partly to clarify my own thoughts .
Haskell is built around a handful of powerful primitive concepts and a pons asinorum .
The most pervasive of these , purely functional programming without side effects or variables , is generally described in introductions to Haskell as the most difficult barrier for most programmers arriving from conventional imperative or OO languages like C , C++ , and Python .
And yes , if your mental model of programming is all about for - loops and static variables — or , for that matter , objects ! — learning to think in Haskell is going to be quite a wrench .
There are reasons to make the effort .
Haskellers ( Haskellites ?
Haskellians ?
Haskellators ?
Haskelletons ? ) maintain that imperative programming relies heavily on side effects that push proving the correctness of programs to somewhere between impractically difficult and impossible .
They also like to point out that side effects make programs difficult to automatically parallelize across multiple processors , an increasingly important consideration as multicores become the rule rather than the exception .
Both are solid arguments .
It ’s less a wrench for me to give up imperative thinking than for most because I ’m a Knight of the Lambda Calculus from way back — and , while LISP is not a purely functional language , anyone who programs seriously in it will develop a feel for the functional style .
Accordingly , while hanging out on the #haskell IRC channel I recommended to someone newbier than me that he might consider learning some LISP first and then coming back to Haskell .
None of the hard - core Haskellians on the channel demurred , and I think this is probably good advice in general .
Now I will admit that the preceding paragraphs contained two fibs .
First : Haskell does have variables , sort - of kind - of .
But such a “ variable ” can only assigned once and the value of the variable is a promise to re-evaluate the expression on the right side of the assignment whenever the variable is evaluated ; it behaves more like a safe macro or an Algol - 60 call - by - name than like what people used to modern imperative languages call variables .
Second : it is possible to define operations that have side effects , and things that have the behavior of real variables , using a construct called a monad .
I ’ll get back to monads , but before I do I should introduce two other fundamentals of Haskell : static typing and lazy evaluation .
Static typing should n’t be a strange concept to anybody who ’s ever written in a compiled language like C or Java , but Haskell pushes the concept to some sort of logical limit .
Variables need not have explicit types ( they ’re implicitly typed by the expression they ’re shorthand for ) , but there ’s a syntax that allows you to attach type signatures to any function , and the compiler does type inference from those .
This has two consequences : it makes efficient compilation of the language possible ( which is unusual for a language at Haskell ’s level of abstraction ) , and ( more importantly in the Haskell view of things ) the type annotations assert invariants that can be used to prove the correctness of the program .
User - defined types are ( more or less ) the values of type - valued expressions ( it ’s actually more complicated than that , but thinking about it this way is a useful point of entry ) .
The single most delightfully weird detail of Haskell I ’ve run into so far is this : you can have type - valued variables , and write type - valued expressions that are recursive !
For some types , such as trees , this is the natural way to do things .
Lazy evaluation is easier to understand .
All it means is that the value of an expression is not computed until it ’s actually needed by the caller ; evaluation runs outside - in rather than inside - out .
If you ’re familiar with the idea of a closure from Scheme ( or another language , such as Ruby , that has borrowed Scheme closures ) it helps to think of Haskell expressions as returning closures .
When the program runs , the outermost ( main ) closure is forced ( evaluated ) ; this may trigger the forcing of other closures ( expressions and function calls ) directly inside it , and so on through their sub - expressions which are also closures .
Local color so you can sound like you know what you ’re talking about : in Haskell - land , a closure is called a “ thunk ” .
Various optimizations make lazy evaluation efficient ; notably , because expressions are ( usually ) pure , the closure can often be replaced by a pointer to its value and never need to be evaluated more than once .
A benefit of lazy evaluation is that you can write code like an Icon or Python generator that spins forever , returning a value on each cycle , and it will only be called for the exact number of returns that the enclosing program actually needs even if the caller is itself a generator .
This is one of the capabilities that replaces for - loops in imperative languages .
Even if most of your Haskell code is pure ( no state , no side effects ) it ’s going to need to interface with a stateful world .
I/O , in particular , is not pure ; getting a line from your input source gives a result which will vary depending on the state of the world outside the program .
Normal Haskell practice is to write your programs with as much pure code as possible and a minimum number of calls to functions with side effects ( such as getting a line of input from standard input or putting a line of input to standard output ) .
Only , because evaluation is outside in , what I / O function calls actually do is create closures that will have I /O side effects when they ’re forced .
So , the question : let ’s say we have multiple calls to functions generating closures with with output side effects .
How do we write the code so the closures get forced in the order we want ?
There are multiple ways this could be done ; the most obvious would require some kind of special construction that is an exception to “ everything is function calls ” .
What Haskell uses for such sequencing is a monad .
Ah , monads .
These are Haskell ’s pons asinorum .
Haskellers are in love with the fact that they actually behave like a recondite concept called “ strong monads ” from category theory ; at this point in many expositions of the language the author would start waving this fact around .
I ’ve been a mathematician myself , I retain some grasp of category theory , and I say invoking it here is confusing and unnecessary .
A simpler way to think about monads is as a hack to turn function composition into a way of forcing the sequencing of function calls , or the functional - programming equivalent of a shell pipeline .
And having said that provocative thing , I ’m not going to go into the gory technical details required to make that actually happen .
I normally consider the syntax of a language , no matter how odd , to be a mere detail compared to more important things like its type ontology and how it does evaluation .
But one central thing about Haskell ’s syntax deserves attention : the way it uses productions .
A Haskell function can be written in a sort of AWK - ish style as a series of pattern - action pairs ; they ’re tried , in sequence , and the first pattern to match the input fires .
Falling off the end of the list yields a runtime error , but a wildcarded “ everything else ” production is easy to write .
Summing up : I do n’t know what I ’m going to use Haskell for , or indeed if I ’ll ever use it at all .
But the time I ’ve spent wrestling with it has not been wasted ; it has challenged my preconceptions , shown me some possibilities I had n’t seen before , forced me to develop a practical grasp of some concepts like lazy evaluation that were previously only theory to me , and in general shook up my thinking .
That ’s valuable in itself .
In How To Become A Hacker , I wrote “ LISP is worth learning for [..] the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it .
That experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days , even if you never actually use LISP itself a lot . ”
I think the same can be said of Haskell , and for very similar reasons .
You would think that Hello Kitty fanatics would have learned that there are just certain Hello Kitty combinations that should never be put together , but then that would be giving the Hello Kitty fanatics the benefit of actually possessing common sense .
Those that follow the evil feline show time and again that they are willing to ink virtually anything on themselves with the obvious horrifying results .
The latest addition to this terrifying display is the Hello Kitty Joker tattoo :
Truth be told , I know exactly where the image for this tattoo came from .
I have seen this image before on far more occasions than I wish to remember .
It was taken directly from the deepest , most horrifying nightmares I have — for that is exactly what Hello Kitty looks like in them as she mocks me for having to live in Hello Kitty Hell …
Left by @valeriafla on Twitter who has already given herself so much more punishment that I could ever imagine wishing upon her for letting me know abut it by the mere fact that this is permanently inked somewhere on her body …
Now that Heath Care legislation has passed , the obvious question for opponents is this :
Now what ?
My answer is best summed up with just one word :
Marijuana .
No , I do n’t mean that you should go out and smoke away your anger and frustration .
Instead , you should feel empowered .
The best way to explain this is by telling the story of a disabled mother from Northern California .
Angel ’s Story
Angel Raich has been permanently disabled since 1995 .
She has an inoperable brain tumor , a seizure disorder and other serious medical conditions .
In 1997 , her doctor felt that marijuana would be an effective medication .
Angel used homegrown marijuana , and she and her physician claim that it ’s helped significantly .
You may not agree with Angel ’s choice , but it ’s one made in accordance with California state law , which allows for such use .
The federal government , however , has not shown much respect for state laws in recent decades , and chose to take action .
After DEA agents seized and destroyed all six of her marijuana plants , she sued to stop them from doing so again .
The suit went all the way to the Supreme Court , and in Gonzales v Raich , Angel lost .
The 2005 ruling made clear that the federal government did not recognize state laws authorizing the use of marijuana – in any situation .
The Commerce Clause
The court ruled that control over a plant grown and consumed on one ’s own property was authorized under the “ Interstate Commerce Clause ” of the Constitution .
Article I , Section 8 , Clause 3 of the Constitution empowers Congress to “ regulate … commerce among the several states . ”
It has never been amended .
Like any legal document , if the words of the Constitution mean today what they meant at the moment it was signed , we must understand just what those words meant at the time of its ratification .
There ’s been a lot of scholarly research on this clause , especially the word “ commerce ” itself .
Without getting into the long details of it all , it means this : Congress is authorized to make uniform national rules on the trade and exchange of goods ( and related activities like their transportation ) that cross state borders .
On top of it , the word “ regulate ” meant to “ make regular ” – that is , to specify how these transactions may be conducted .
Regulate did not mean ban , prohibit , or mandate .
These words have different meanings .
With this in mind , the Supreme Court , which is not a set of nine infallible gods , ruled incorrectly .
But rule , they did .
Thus , all three federal branches agreed that State - level laws allowing marijuana were a no - go .
In his dissent , Justice Clarence Thomas gave a stark warning :
If the Federal Government can regulate growing a half - dozen cannabis plants for personal consumption … then Congress ’ Article I powers … have no meaningful limits .
Whether Congress aims at the possession of drugs , guns , or any number of other items , it may continue to appropria[te ] state police powers under the guise of regulating commerce .
Resist DC
Even though she lost the case , Angel indicated she ’d continue to use marijuana .
At the time of the ruling , there were 10 states that had such laws .
Not one of them has been repealed .
Since then , another 4 states have passed similar laws , and many others are considering them , including South Dakota , Kansas , and New Hampshire .
Today , over half a million people are registered users of medical marijuana , and estimates say that millions more use the plant without registration .
What ’s been the result ?
The federal government will occasionally arrest some high - profile users , but taken in the perspective of the multitudes consuming the plant , the threat is quite low .
And , in mid-2009 , recognizing a need for “ efficient and rational use of its limited investigative and prosecutorial resources , ” the Justice Department announced that it would back off the prosecution of medical marijuana patients even further .
Huh ?
You might be asking , “ How does this apply to healthcare mandates ? ”
Well , the answer is pretty simple .
When enough states pass laws defying federal laws , and enough people actively defy them too , D.C. simply does n’t have the manpower to arrest and prosecute all of us .
This kind of activism – while it clearly carries personal risk – should be a real blueprint for people that have been consistently unable to find constitutional relief in Congress , the Executive , or the Courts .
Marijuana users : Love ‘em or hate ‘em , but show some respect for them , as many have suffered greatly for doing what they believe is right .
People who believe strongly about other issues , like healthcare mandates , would do well to learn from them .
What should be done about federal control over health care ?
The same thing that should be done for every unconstitutional federal law , regulation , or mandate – Nullify Now .

When we try to do two things at once , each half of the brain focuses on a separate task , French scientists say .
This division of labour could explain why we find it so difficult to multi-task , they report in the journal Science .
It might also explain why people are prone to make irrational decisions when choosing from a long list of items .
Lead author Dr Etienne Koechlin told the BBC : " You can cook and at the same time talk on the phone but you cannot really do a third task such as trying to read a newspaper .
Our result is likely to provide an explanation for why people are good in binary choice but not multiple choice
Dr Etienne Koechlin
" If you have three or more tasks you lose track of one task . "
The French team used an imaging technique to monitor brain activity in 32 volunteers asked to perform a letter - matching test .
The scans looked at the frontal cortex , the part of the human brain associated with impulse control .
When the volunteers completed one task at a time , one side of a certain area of the frontal lobes lit up .
But , when they completed two tasks at the same time , the lobes divided the tasks between them .
' Irrational decisions '
Activity on the left frontal lobe matched the primary task ( action A ) and activity on the right corresponded to the secondary task ( action B ) .
The brain splits into two when dealing with dual tasks
The brain was able to control switching between the two hemispheres when carrying out dual functions but accuracy suffered when a third was added .
Dr Koechlin , of Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris , France , said this behaviour could explain why people make " some irrational decisions " when faced with more than two choices .
" My view is that it 's critically related to this division of labour between the two hemispheres to keep track of two tasks or two options but not more , " he explained .
" Our result is likely to provide an explanation for why people are good in binary choice but not multiple choice . "

last update : 26 December 1997
Three days before Apple revolutio ... wait , that did n't happen .
I kid , I kid .
On Monday AMD updated just about all of its processor families with new chips in response to Clarkdale .
We got the Athlon II X2 255 , Athlon II X3 440 , Phenom II X2 555 BE , Phenom II X4 635 and Phenom II X4 910e .
All of the chips are in Bench , so if you want to know how they compare have a look - or check out our review .
There are two things I left out of that review that I felt needed following up on .
First , let 's take the Phenom II X2 555 BE .
If you read my take on the 555 you 'll know that I do n't really believe it 's worth the price .
Most users will be better off with a Core i3 530 .
There is just one exception I failed to mention : some Phenom II X2s can be turned into a Phenom II X4 .
The technique is nothing new .
Using any AMD chipset motherboard with a SB710 or SB750 South Bridge and proper BIOS support you 'll have a feature called Advanced Clock Calibration ( ACC ) .
AMD introduced this feature back in 2008 as a way to improve overclocking on Phenom processors by sacrificing some sort of corner case stability for real world frequency headroom .
The Phenom II X2 is nothing more than a Phenom II X4 with two cores disabled .
Originally these cores were disabled because of low yields , but over time yields on quad - core Phenom IIs should be high enough to negate the need for a Phenom II X2 .
This is most likely why AMD removed the Phenom II X2 from its official price list .
It 's also why the stranger Phenom II derivatives are also absent from AMD 's price list .
All that 's left are Phenom II X4s pretty much .
A Phenom II X4 900 series die : 258 mm2 , 4 - cores and a 6MB L3 cache .
Also the basis for the Phenom II X2 .
And herein lies the problem for companies that rely on die harvesting for their product line .
Initially , the Phenom II X2 is a great way of using defective Phenom II X4 die .
Once yields improve however , you 've now created a market for these Phenom II X2s and have to basically sell a full - blown Phenom II X4 at a cheaper price to meet that demand .
You could create a new die that 's a dual - core Phenom II , but that 's expensive and pulls engineers away from more exciting projects like Bulldozer .
Often times it 's easier to just disable two cores and sell the chip for cheaper than you 'd like .
At the same time you can do your best to discourage your customers from ordering too many .
Remove it off the official price list , charge a little more for it , and direct people at a cheaper native alternative - like the Athlon II X2 .
The Athlon II X2 die .
Two cores are all you get .
AMD 's sticky situation is your gain however .
While I can't guarantee that all Phenom II X2s can be converted into quad - core chips , I 'd say that your chances are probably pretty good at this point if you get a new enough chip .
As with any sort of out - of - spec operation , proceed at your own risk .
You may risk ending up with nothing more than a dual - core processor or an unstable quad - core .
In my case however , my Phenom II X2 555 BE 's extra two cores were easily unlocked .
My Socket - AM3 testbed uses Gigabyte 's GA - MA790FXT - UD5P motherboard .
In its BIOS there 's an option for Advanced Clock Calibration .
All you need to do is set EC Firmware Selection to Hybrid , and ACC to Auto :
Patiently waiting and a self - initiated reboot later and my CPU was identified as a Phenom II X4 B55 BE .
Four cores running at 3.2GHz , just like a Phenom II X4 955 but for $ 99 .
The chip also performs just like a 3.2GHz quad - core Phenom II , because it is one at this point :
Processor x264 HD 1st Pass x25 HD 2nd Pass AMD Phenom II X4 965 72.1 fps 22.2 fps AMD Phenom II X4 B55 70.6 fps 21.1 fps AMD Phenom II X2 555 45.2 fps 10.9 fps
Overclocking is affected .
With only two cores active my Phenom II X2 555 BE could run at 3.8GHz without any additional voltage .
With four cores active , that number drops down to 3.6GHz .
My Phenom II X2 555 BE , with all four cores unlocked , and running at 3.6GHz .
If you 're ok with the possibility of this not working at all , a Phenom II X2 555 BE with all four cores active is the absolute best value you can get for $ 99 .
AMD would like to charge you $ 160 for the opportunity , but you can put the savings towards a better video card or a shiny new SSD .
The Science of Playoffs
By Sky Andrecheck
What is the point of having playoffs ?
I mean this not as a snarky rhetorical , but as a real question .
Playoffs are a given in every major sport today , but it was n't always that way .
Before 1969 , there were no playoffs in baseball , just one seven - game series between the winners of two completely separate leagues .
Other sports were more quick to adopt playoffs .
The NFL adopted playoffs in 1933 - a one game championship between the winners of the East and West divisions .
The NBA had extensive playoffs almost from its inception , allowing 12 of its 17 teams to make the playoffs in 1950 .
The NHL was also an early adopter .
The NBA scaled back its playoffs .
Meanwhile , MLB has expanded its playoffs .
With all of these different approaches to playoffs , who is right ?
To answer that , the point of the playoffs must be determined .
One way to look at it is that playoffs should n't be necessary at all unless there 's a tie for first place .
If the goal is to choose the best team and crown them as champion , then that would be the ideal approach .
For instance , in 2009 , the Yankees had a record that was six games better than any other AL team .
Is there anything that could have happened in the playoffs to overturn the evidence that the Yankees were the best AL team in 2009 ?
Not really .
If we assume that teams remain static over the course of a season , the best way to evaluate a team 's skill is to look at its overall record including the playoffs ( schedule adjusted ) .
Even had the Yankees been swept out of the first round , the evidence would point to the conclusion that New York had the best ballclub .
So if it 's a certainty that the Yankees were the best AL team , then what 's the point of having any playoffs ?
Why not just send them straight to the World Series ?
That 's one view , and a view baseball had until 1969 .
But here 's another view .
The statement above is actually incorrect .
It is not a certainty that the Yankees are the best team .
It is a certainty that no matter what happens in the playoffs , that the Yankees are most likely the best team .
But , because of variability we can't ever be certain who 's the best , and sometimes we may not be very close to certain at all .
Consider a scenario in which , based on their records , one team has a 70 % chance of being the " true " best team .
Meanwhile , there 's a 30 % probability that a second team is the " true " best team .
What do we do ?
One approach is to simply give the first team the championship .
They are most likely the best team , and so they should be given the title .
But the second team might be mad .
" Hey , we deserve 30 % of that championship ! "
Well , they do n't give out parts of championships .
But you could , in essence , give them 30 % of a championship by giving them a 30 % chance to win one whole championship .
This could take place by having the commissioner pick a ball out of a lottery at the end of the season .
The lottery machine would be filled with 70 % of Team A's balls and 30 % of Team B 's balls .
If your team 's ball comes up , it is awarded the championship .
They could do that .
But it would a pretty awful way to end a season .
Championships should be decided on the field , not by ping pong balls .
The solution to the uncertainty ?
Playoffs .
Instead of drawing a lottery , you can simply set - up playoffs .
And , if you structure the playoffs so that Team A has a 70 % chance to win and Team B has a 30 % chance to win , then you will have achieved the same effect .
Except now the championship is decided on the field .
These playoffs give each team a chance to win in proportion to the probability that it was the best team in the regular season .
If your team , based on the regular season , has a 10 % chance of being the " true " best team , then you will have a 10 % chance of winning the playoffs and claiming the championship .
Seems fair to me .
Of course , that 's only if you set - up the playoffs just right .
If you were to make the National League playoffs a 16 - team NCAA - style single elimination knockout tournament , those two probabilities would not even be close to matching one another .
The chance that a bad team could win would the tournament would be much higher than the probability that they were the best team during the regular season .
An Example
Let 's take a simple example with just two teams .
In 2008 , the Cubs won 97 games , with a .602 WPCT .
The Phillies won 92 games , with a .568 WPCT .
If we regress these to the mean , which I wo n't go into here , you get the Cubs with a predicted " true " WPCT of .569 and the Phillies with a predicted " true " WPCT of .548 .
Each of these has a standard error of about .032 .
Hence , the probability that the Cubs are " truly " better than the Phillies is about 68 % .
So , in order to be " fair " , a playoff series should be structured so that the Cubs have a 68 % chance of winning .
However , in a seven - game series with home field advantage to the Cubs , Chicago has only a 56 % to win ( this includes the fact that Cubs are likely better than the Phillies ) .
But 56 % is too low .
Their five game lead is substantial , and should not be able to be so easily erased by a simple best of seven series .
So how about we change things up ?
We still play a seven game series , but we spot the Cubs a 1 - 0 lead .
Running the numbers again , now the Cubs have a 69 % chance of winning the series .
That 's almost perfect !
It gives the Cubs an advantage , but the Phillies still have a chance to win .
And they can do it by winning just four out of six games .
The above set - up is the fairest one to determine the championship between the Phillies and Cubs .
Of course , purists will say that the Cubs should be awarded the championship regardless .
After all , if the Phillies win 4 out of 6 games , the Cubs will still have a better record than Philadelphia .
Hence , the Cubs still are the team that 's most likely the best " true " team in the league .
Even though the above system is " fair " , it still quite easily allows for the championship to be awarded to a team which is probably inferior .
And that 's part of the point .
Likely inferior teams can win , but only if they do something extraordinary in the playoffs .
2009 AL Playoffs
Now let 's take a larger example .
In the 2009 AL , any baseball fan could tell you that there were three dominant teams : the Yankees , the Angels , and the Red Sox , with the Yankees likely being the best of the bunch .
The probabilities I calculated of being the true best team back that up .
The Yankees , with six more victories than any other team , have a probability over 50 % , while the Red Sox and Angels are significantly lower .
The probabilities for other teams are close to 0 % .
So did the AL playoffs match those probabilities well ?
Take a look at the chart below :
The Yankees were not amply rewarded for their regular season dominance , and their playoff probabilities were much too low .
Additionally , the Twins and Tigers ' probabilities were much too high .
And as a final issue , the Red Sox also had too high of a probability .
So how could the 2009 AL playoffs have been made fairer ?
First , by limiting the teams to just New York , Boston , and Los Angeles , you can set the Tigers and Twins probabilities down to zero .
Then , since New York is far ahead and LA and Boston close together , it makes sense to have Boston and LA play each other in a five game series , with the winner playing the Yankees .
What happens if we test that scenario , with LA and New York having the home field advantage ?
We get the following : probabilities :
Yankees : 58 %
Angels : 23 %
Red Sox : 19 %
The Red Sox probability is a little higher than we'd like , but overall it's a pretty spot on match to the probabilities that each is the true best team in the league .
Additionally , in their guts , I think most fans would agree that this would have been a fair playoff setup given the results of the regular season .
2009 NL Playoffs
Now I 'll move to the NL and get a little wild .
The NL was more evenly spread .
The Dodgers had the best record , but several other teams were close behind .
Additionally , there were several lagging contenders who , because of the overall parity , could potentially be the best true team in the league .
The chart below shows the probabilities for the 2009 NL :
Overall , the probabilities are not way off like they were for the 2009 AL , however , there are still some inequities .
The actual playoff probabilities are too high for each of the playoff team and they are too low for the teams that did not make the playoffs .
Playing around with the numbers - here 's the closest I could come to evening this out :
As you can see , the lowly Cubs do make the playoffs .
But it will take a three - game sweep of the mighty Dodgers to advance .
Additionally , teams such as Atlanta and Florida also have a shot , but will need to win two straight games against their superior foes to advance .
The probabilities in this scenario match well with the probabilities of each team being the best true NL team .
The results are below :
Dodgers : 28 %
Phillies : 21 %
Rockies : 19 %
Cardinals : 13 %
Giants : 9 %
Marlins : 4 %
Braves : 4 %
Cubs : 1 %
Conclusion
In this way , this playoff set - up is actually both more fair and often allows more teams to actually make the playoffs .
Obviously , the drawback is that the playoffs are n't set in advance , with the additional drawback being that it's hard to match the probabilities exactly .
So at least one team will end up getting the short end of the stick , and then they 'll be mad .
Additionally , really complicated playoff systems do n't exactly have the best track record in major sports ( see the BCS ) .
Still I think a scenario like this is something that is inherently fairer in that it rewards teams in proportion to their accomplishments during the regular season - something that the current system famously does not do .
Ideally a system like this would work pretty well for a non -major sport that was a little more flexible on its scheduling and a little less rigid in its traditions .
But , to be honest , it 's likely impractical at any level .
Still this method can be used to evaluate playoff structures and see where the holes are .
In baseball , it 's clearly that inferior teams have too large an edge in the playoffs .
In other sports , depending on the structure , length of season , true talent distribution , the size of the home field advantage , etc , things may be different .
MUSKEGON — Beneath mounds of plaster dust , crushed glass , crumbled ceiling tiles and slashed couch cushions , it ’s plain to see the home of Griffetta and Vernard Jones was once a well - kept , elaborately decorated home .
HOW YOU CAN HELP
Anyone with information about the vandalism at 43 W. Forest in Muskegon is asked to call Silent Observer at ( 231 ) 72-CRIME or Muskegon Police at ( 231 ) 724-6750 .
But the unfathomable mess the Muskegon couple came home to Sunday morning after a Valentine weekend away is a homeowner ’s worst nightmare .
“ It ’s pretty horrific , ” said a stoic 36 - year - old Griffetta , standing in a room only slightly resembling the former living room she recently redecorated .
“ I ’m so numb I ca n’t cry anymore .
I ’m totally in shock .
It was my dream home .
I loved it .
I just do n’t understand . ”
The vandalism authorities discovered around 3:45 a.m.
Sunday inside the blue , two - story home at 43 W. Forest was so severe that the Joneses can’t even stay there .
And Griffetta ’s blue , 2002 Jaguar parked in the attached garage was destroyed as well , according to a police report .
Adding insult to injury , Griffetta said , is the racial slur discovered etched in the Jaguar ’s paint : “ Hate N-----. ”
The Joneses are African - American .
“ The racial slur was extremely harsh .
I ’m very upset about my house , but to see that — that really hurt , ” Griffetta said .
No other signs of racial slurs were immediately evident .
The couple , who arrived to the damaged home around 6:30 a.m. Sunday , are being assisted by Red Cross officials and staying in a local hotel while authorities try to sort out the incident .
It is n’t clear what , if anything , was taken from the home .
“ We walked in the house and we just fell .
I could n’t believe it .
I was crying hysterically , ” said Griffetta .
No suspects had been identified as of Monday .
Griffetta said the home and vehicle were insured .
Meanwhile , an intense investigation was under way , said Muskegon Detective Sgt. Monica Shirey , noting that the amount of damage done to the interior of the Forest Avenue home makes it the worst case of vandalism she has ever seen .
“ The entire residence was demolished , ” she said , adding that both the interior and exterior of the home had been damaged with red paint .
The Joneses say they ca n’t imagine a motive for such a crime .
“ I go to work and I come home and that ’s it .
And my husband is the friendliest person you ’d ever meet , ” said Griffetta , a machine operator at a local plant .
“ I have no idea why us .
We do n’t bother anybody .
We have been sitting in our hotel thinking , ‘ What did we do to someone to deserve this ? ’ ”
Vernard , who is on disability , said he has no idea why they were targeted .
“ We have opened our home to anyone who needs it , ” he said .
Shirey said authorities were led to the Joneses ’ home after a nearby resident reported finding red paint thrown on the side of his home and vehicle .
The neighbors ’ home and vehicle suffered far less damage than the Joneses ’ , she said .
“ While investigating that incident , officers checked the area for suspects and noticed that 43 W. Forest had a garage entry door covered in red paint , ” she said .
Upon entering the home , authorities discovered an indescribable scene : walls full of holes apparently made with a sledgehammer ; sinks and toilets smashed to pieces ; cut up furniture cushions ; broken windows and picture frames ; televisions , stereos and appliances turned over ; and personal belongings strewn all over the 2,600 - square - foot home .
Even the couple ’s basement furnace was smashed in .
“ This is unreal , ” said 45 - year - old Vernard .
“ When I came into the house and saw it , I fell to my knees .
It ’s worse than a house fire .
They got it all . ”

If the Westmere Xeon EP were a car engine , it would 've been made by Porsche .
With " only " six cores , each core in the new Xeon offers almost twice the performance of the competition .
A 32nm CPU that only occupies 248 mm2 the Westmere Xeon EP embodies pure refinement and intelligent performance , both Porsche traits .
It 's just made in Portland , not Zuffenhausen .
AMD 's offering today is very different .
Magny - cours is the CPU version of the American muscle car .
It 's a brutally large 12 - core CPU : two dies , each measuring 346 m m2 connected by a massive 24 link Hyper Transport pipe .
AMD's Magny - cours Opteron has almost two billion transistors and 19.6 MB of cache on - die .
12 cores , 692 mm2 die , 19.6 MB of cache on - die
It 's not all raw horsepower though .
At 2.2GHz this 12 - core monster is supposed to be content with only 80 precious watts , and 115W at most .
HT assist also makes an appearance to keep CPU - CPU accesses to a necessary minimum , a problem that could get out of hand with 12 cores otherwise .
AMD originally added HT assist with its first 6 - core Opterons .
So Magny - Cours is a like hybrid V12 Dodge Viper with traction control .
Will this cocktail of raw core muscle and energy savings be enough to beat the competitor from Portland ?
For once we could not resist the temptations of car analogies .
As interesting as we found the Xeon Westmere EP , something was missing : a challenger , a competitor to make things more exiting .
In the last review , we just knew that the Xeon X5670 would crush the competition .
This time is going to be close .
AMD still wo n’t have a chance if your application does not scale well with extra cores .
In that case you are better off with the higher clocked and better per-core performance of the Intel CPUs .
But it is unclear if Intel will prevail in truly multi- threaded software now that a grim and determined AMD is willing to offer two CPUs for the price of one just to win the race .
WASHINGTON —
On the first really warm day here in Washington D.C. , March 21 , after a winter of record - breaking cold and snow , the National Mall saw the largest immigrant rights demonstration since the mega marches of 2006 .
The March for America , organized by the broadly based Reform Immigration for America coalition , reached and exceeded the organizers ’ goal of gathering 100,000 demonstrators on the mall .
Organizers placed the vast multiracial throng , which stretched from 7th street to 14th street with overflow in all directions , at 500,000 .
Though most demonstrators were Latinos , there were many African Americans , Asians and others .
Most people , organized by local community and ethnic organizations and churches , joined other marchers with t- shirts and signs for labor groups , including SEIU , UNITE - HERE , United Food and Commercial Workers , Laborers International Union and the Labor Council on Latin American Advancement .
Many people waved U.S. flags , but flags from Mexico , El Salvador , Guatemala , the Dominican Republic and other countries could be seen also .
Participants could be heard chatting in English and Spanish , Mandarin , Arabic and other tongues .
There was a whole contingent of speakers of Quiche Maya , a language of Guatemala .
Marchers came from as far away as California and New England , with at least 2,000 from Chicago alone .
The march was organized to put pressure on both the Obama administration and Congress to get moving on immigration reform .
Many people in the immigrant rights movements have expressed worry and frustration that the administration has seemed to relegate immigration reform to a low level of priority .
There were more deportations in the first year of the Obama administration than in the last year of the Bush administration , and the government , while modifying some of the harshest Bush policies , has continued other repressive mechanisms such as deputizing local police to do immigration enforcement work and promoting the “ E Verify ” system which checks up on workers ’ immigration status electronically .
There is already a bill in Congress on comprehensive immigration reform , HR 4321 , which was designed by U.S. Representative Luis Gutierrez , D - Ill . , and sponsored by Representative .
Solomon Ortiz , D - Texas .
Last week , Senators Charles Schuman , D - N.Y. , and Lindsey Graham , R - S.C. , announced the outlines of a “ bipartisan ” bill , which is well to the right of the Ortiz - Gutierrez bill .
President Obama , making a surprise appearance at Sunday ’s rally via a video link up , promised to continue to back comprehensive reform but hinted that he prefers the Schumer - Graham approach .
In spite of all doubts , when his face appeared on the gigantic screens , a tremendous cheer went up .
Gutierrez , who spoke at the rally , warned that today ’s mobilization is only the beginning , but reminded the crowd of what the fight is for : “ I want the light [ of justice ] to shine on every immigrant :
On the woman on her hands and knees all day , digging onions in Salinas .
On the man washing dishes , thousands of dishes , in El Paso until he can barely feel his hands anymore .
On the woman in a sweatship - in the basement , with no union , no rights in New York City - for a few dollars to support her kids ” .
Labor was represented among the speakers by AFL - CIO Executive Vice President Arlene Holt Baker among others .
Her federation has been supporting legalization and the approach taken in Mr. Gutierrez ’ bill , but has voiced opposition to the inclusion of a guest worker - bill in the Schumer - Graham outline .
Top African - American leadership was represented by Rev. Jesse Jackson , National Urban League President Marc Morial , and NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Jealous .
Cardinal Roger Mahoney of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles was accompanied by Protestant , Evangelical , Jewish and Muslim leaders .
There was even a contingent of immigrants who were arrested in a raid against restaurant workers in Maryland days before the rally :
They appeared with their ankle bracelets in place and switched on , and according to a report in the Washington Post they had to leave early because the batteries needed to be recharged .
They have to report shortly for their deportation hearings .
An important feature of the rally was that the organizers walked the participants through the techniques of using social media , such as Twitter , to organize the arduous lobbying campaign that will now follow .

EXCLUSIVE : EPIX and Media Rights Capital have made a team for iCON , a comedy series pilot that will be developed by Larry Charles , the Emmy - winning TV writer / producer , and the director of the Sacha Baron Cohen features Borat and Bruno .
Charles will oversee development of the script and will direct the half - hour pilot of a series written by Dan Lyons .
A technology consultant for Newsweek , Lyons created the Fake Steve Jobs blog and wrote the novel Options : The Secret Life of Steve Jobs — A Parody .
The show ’s lead character , Tom Rhodes , is a composite of Jobs and other Silicon Valley titans , and the comedy is described as a savage satire , a study of ego , power and greed .
The deal marks the latest move by EPIX president Mark Greenberg to create original programming that will be compatible to the slates of movies that will be provided by EPIX partners Paramount , MGM and Lionsgate .
iCON becomes the second original pilot for the EPIX pay channel .
Sam Shepard stars in the first one , Tough Trade , and more deals are coming .
MRC will serve as the studio and financier .
The company said it had several bidders for the property , but chose EPIX because Charles could be as edgy as he wanted to be .
The feeling is that the show could put EPIX on the map the way series like Mad Men did for AMC , Weeds for Showtime , and Burn Notice for USA .
Charles worked with MRC on the Baron Cohen films , and he ’s TV royalty , with series credits that include Seinfeld , Entourage and Curb Your Enthusiasm .
While Entourage might have originally been informed by the relationship between exec producer Mark Wahlberg , his agent Ari Emanuel and manager Steve Levinson , the Doug Ellin - created show became a broader statement on Hollywood .
Jobs and other titans will certainly inspire iCON at its inception , but the show will lampoon the larger hi-tech world .
Charles will be swinging for the fences .
“ We are attempting to do nothing less than a modern Citizen Kane , ” Charles said .
“ A scabrous satire of Silicon Valley and its most famous citizen .
We needed a bold environment to nurture such a vision .
One that was free of pre-conceived ideas .
And EPIX made it clear they were that place .
They asked us to make their home our home .
And we have . ”
- Hello Edward , the first question is about that clip that is so popular lately .
How was that song created ?
Were any words there ?
- I came from a musical festival in Sopot where I became a prize - winner .
In Soviet times for a young singer to appear on TV screen one had to be a prize - winner or to be honored by the State .
One of the songs I sang there was written by a composer Ostrovsky and he liked my performance .
After I returned from Sopot he said : “ I know you like classical music , especially Cavatina Figaro , I will write a song for you .
A song with a following plot : John on a mustang is riding across a prairie to his love Mary who is waiting for him and knitting him a woolen sock .
- But 40 year ago a text like these would not be allowed on a Soviet TV .
- Well , you have said it yourself .
We came to a studio and they told us : “ Are you crazy ?
Which John ?
Which Mary ?
You have to leave all these words . ”
So we got rid of John and Mary but the song is still very American .
In the end we got a jazz song that we arranged for three octaves .
And it became a song just about a good mood .
It is called “ I am glad because I am returning home ” .
A man is merry he walks and sings for himself .
He is glad and everyone around him is glad .
First the song was recorded in Moscow and was accompanied by the orchestra directed by Yuri Silantjev .
The arrangement of music was so difficult that we made a number of variants .
After the TV premier the song became so popular that I performed it on all my concerts .
If ever I forgot to perform it the public will always remind me .
Once in Siberia a very famous Russian singer Valery Obodzinskii invited me to his concert and asked my permission to sing this song .
He sang it in his own manner in one octave – it was very light and nice .
But it became a very different song with a contrabass and a bass guitar .
- How did you know that the song became popular in America ?
- My grandson Edward II as we call him came from school humming this song .
I asked him what that was about .
He answered that I am not keeping up to date and that in the internet all America is singing it while I am sleeping at home …
Yes , the popularity is really great .
More than 2 million people have seen it in the internet .
It is already being re-singed and even some parodies appeared .
The actor known by the film “ Inglorious Basterds ” Christopher Waltz made a new version of your song .
Yes , he did his own variant .
A bit with an erotic touch and a guitar on a intimate place .
But as a composer who has written this song would have said : “ Chris is singing different notes ” .
- Do you know that the lovers of your song are collecting money to organize you a tour round the USA .
Have you been there before ?
- Yes , I ’ve been in the USA .
Once my good friend Vadim Mulerman asked me : “ Would you like to see the USA ? ”
And he did indeed show me the country from west to east and from south to north .
It was not a business tour .
We just gave concerts to the Russian immigrants .
The public was interesting .
Once during a tour an old Russian woman ( babushka ) said to me : “ Imagine , Edward , I live in New York for 5 years now .
But a policeman round the corner still does n’t know a single Russian word ! ”
They know all Russian songs – once you start singing they sing along .
It is very pleasing .
Of course I was singing in Russian then .
In 70s I was touring Holland and a conference of a concert announced to the public : “ Now you will hear a singer from St. Petersburg who will perform a song in Dutch ” .
I sang the first part “ tru - la - la ” , the public waited .
On the second “ tru - la - la ” part they started laughing .
By the end of the song they were all laughing because they understood that I played a trick on them .
By the way the clip that is now circling in the internet was made in Sweden .
I know it for sure because I am in a Swedish suite there which I got in exchange for souvenirs from Soviet Union – matreshka doll and a souvenir samovar .
I have a suggestion to everyone who uses an internet – let everyone in every country write a line to this song in their own language .
And let the Americans write a line about John and Mary who is knitting him a sock .
And we shall have an international song .
And I like a second clip where people of different nationalities are singing along me .
You know , it is not important here who you are : Russian , Austrian , American , Japanese … it is important that all faces are smiling and a melody of “ tru - la - la ” is spreading happiness and love .
Lets “ tru - la - la ” all together .
Facebook 's bid to rule the web as it goes social
By Maggie Shiels
Technology reporter , BBC News , Silicon Valley
Mark Zuckerberg wants to help users connect to " higher quality content " Facebook set out its stall to unseat Google and be at the heart of the web experience as it becomes more social .
The world 's largest social network unveiled a series of products at its developer conference F8 aimed at helping the company achieve that goal .
These tools will make it easier for users to take their friends with them as they browse the web .
" We are building toward a web where the default is social , " said Mark Zuckerberg , Facebook 's founder .
" If you look back a few years ago and even as recently as today , in most cases the web is n't designed to use your friends .
They do n't assume you have a real identity but we are seeing that seep in more and more .
" We want to be one of the things that empowers that and right now most users are using Facebook and we hope we can be a good force in driving that forward , " Mr Zuckerberg told the BBC during a news conference .
FACEBOOK FACTS
More than 400 million active users Average user has 130 friends 70 % of users outside the US

He added that the " web was at a turning point " and that the way forward was to have friends , or what Mr Zuckerberg called " your social graph " , to guide you online .
" One of the points Mr Zuckerberg was making was that the web has become a lot less anonymous and Facebook is definitely positioning itself as wanting to be the owner of that information , " said Maya Baratz of the Huffington Post .
Personalisation
At the F8 conference in San Francisco , Mr Zuckerberg unveiled a number of products aimed at putting users and their friends at the " centre of the web " .
The most significant was an open graph protocol to let publishers tag their content by type along with a " Like " button that partner sites put on their webpage .
This allows users to indicate what they like on a website , be it from photographs to news items and from clothes to music .
Facebook says it will serve 1 billion " Likes " on the web in 24 hours
That information will then be stored by Facebook the way it already stores connections between people .
At the same time any website will be able to take those individual preferences and use them to tailor a more " personalised online experience " for the user and their friends .
Facebook said this means its members will see a web that caters to their individual tastes .
Crucially all this can only happen when users are logged into Facebook and " makes it easy to make any page ( on the internet ) a Facebook page , " said Bret Taylor , Facebook 's director of platform .
Business opportunity Mr Zuckerberg described the features he presented at the conference as " the most transformative thing we 've ever done for the web " .
Justin Smith , founder of InsideFacebook.com said there are a lot of business upsides to this product .
Facebook has overtaken Google as the most visited US website " When someone " likes " your page , that is a valuable action because it means you will be able to publish updates directly to them in the future which could be used for a variety of purposes like promoting traffic to your website or advertising anything you want . "
Some of the early adoptees of the " Like " button include CNN , the movie site IMDb.com , ESPN and Levi's .
Levi's will integrate the " Like " function on its e-commerce site as well as build a " friend " store where consumers logged into Facebook will be able to see a list of their friend 's favourite products and shop online with them .
" We 're creating a new shopping experience that will change the way people shop online , " said Jodi Bricker , vice president of digital at Levi's .
' Audacious and a bit scary '
So what does this mean for Google , the world 's most powerful internet company with billions of users who access the web using hyperlinks ?
" People are discovering information not just through links to web pages but also from the people and the things they care about , " Mr Zuckerberg told a conference hall of around 1,500 developers .
Facebook has more than 400 million users who share 25 billion things a month Om Malik , founder and editor of the technology blog GigaOM.com told BBC news " even a blind man can see this is a Facebook versus Google battle and in many ways if the web is going to be more social then that plays to Facebook 's strengths . "
Damon Cortesi , founder of social media company UntitledStartup , agreed .
" Facebook has won the internet , " he told technology blog ZDnet.com " Facebook has always been social , but in terms of dominating the web over Google they have made strides today . "
But Mr Malik sounded a note of caution .
" The whole idea to socialise the whole web is fairly impressive , audacious and a bit scary .
I am very scared about the privacy issues around this initiative .
They have n't really been very clear as to how consumers will have more control over the things they do on the web . "
The issue of privacy has been something of a thorn in Facebook 's side .
It has suffered backlashes in the past over moves to change users privacy settings .
" Nothing we have released changes any of the privacy protections we have , " said Elliot Schrage , the company 's vice president of public policy and communications .
" We 're providing new opportunities for people to have a social experience if they want it . "

It sends out a powerful acoustic signal audible to almost all young people under the age of 20 years but barely noticeable to anyone over the age of 25 .
MEPs will discuss further the proposal in June .
PORT -AU - PRINCE , Haiti 
The police in El Salvador have begun an investigation into whether a man suspected of leading a trafficking ring involving Central American and Caribbean women and girls is also a legal adviser to the Americans charged with trying to take 33 children out of Haiti without permission .
When the judge presiding over the Haitian case learned on Thursday of the investigation in El Salvador , he said he would begin his own inquiry of the adviser , a Dominican man who was in the judge ’s chambers days before .
The inquiries are the latest twist in a politically charged case that is unfolding in the middle of an earthquake disaster zone .
A lawyer for the group has already been dismissed after being accused of trying to offer bribes to get the 10 Americans out of jail .
The adviser , Jorge Puello , said in a telephone interview on Thursday that he had not engaged in any illegal activity in El Salvador and that he had never been in the country .
He called it a case of mistaken identity .
“ I do n’t have anything to do with El Salvador , ” he said , suggesting that his name was as common in Latin America as John Smith is in the United States .
Ahmad Sani Yerima oversaw the introduction of Sharia in Zamfara State A Nigerian senator accused of marrying a 13 - year - old Egyptian girl says he has done nothing wrong .
Ahmad Sani Yerima , 49 , told the BBC that his fourth wife was not 13 , but would not say how old she was .
He denied breaking the law but said he would not respect any law that contradicted his religious beliefs .
The Nigerian senate ordered an investigation after complaints from women 's groups but the senator said he did not care what the groups thought .
A spokesman for the Egyptian embassy in Nigeria has said the girl is still at school in Egypt .
As a Muslim , as I always say , I consider God 's law and that of his prophet above any other law
Senator Ahmed Sani Yerima
" Nobody has complained to the embassy in respect of the girl , " Mohammed Saber told the AFP news agency .
He said however that the embassy " will follow the issue " because it is illegal in Egypt to marry an underage girl .
Mr Sani was the governor of Zamfara state , where he oversaw the introduction of Sharia law - for the first time in a northern state - in 1999 .
' Detractors '
He said he felt this was behind the uproar over his marriage .
" I consider all those complaining about this issue as detractors , because since 1999 ... many people have been waging different kind of wars against me , " he told the BBC's Hausa Service by telephone from Egypt .
The senator said he had followed " standard rules for marriage in Islam " .
This very evil act should not be seen to be perpetrated by one of our distinguished legislators
Mma Wokocha
Women 's Medical Association head " I do n't care about the issue of age since I have not violated any rule as far as Islam is concerned , " he said .
" History tells us that Prophet Muhammad did marry a young girl as well .
Therefore I have not contravened any law .
Even if she is 13 , as it is being falsely peddled around .
" If I state the age , they will still use it to smear Islam , " he said .
The BBC's Caroline Duffield in Lagos says newspaper reports of the marriage have created a storm among human rights groups .
Female senators - lawyers and doctors - who are protesting say that they fear for the child 's health .
" What we are concerned with is that our minors , the girl child , should be allowed to mature , before going into marriage , " Mma Wokocha , president of the Women 's Medical Association and one of those behind a petition , told the BBC .
" This very evil act should not be seen to be perpetrated by one of our distinguished legislators ... that is what we are saying . ''
The senator is reported to have paid a dowry of $ 100,000 ( £ 66,000 ) to the child 's parents - and to have brought the girl into Nigeria from Egypt .
The women 's groups want Mr Sani to be taken to court , to face a fine and a jail sentence .
They say he has contravened the Child Rights
Act of 2003 which , although not ratified by all Nigeria 's 36 states , is law in the capital , Abuja , where he lives and where his marriage is believed to have taken place .
" As a Muslim , as I always say , I consider God 's law and that of his prophet above any other law , " Mr Sani said .
" I will not respect any law that contradicts that and whoever wants to sanction me for that is free to do that . "
Newspaper reports have also accused the senator of having previously married a 15 - year - old girl in 2006 .

Wall Street was supposed to become the capital of a global carbon trading market worth a trillion dollars a year but now many who thought green trading desks would be the next big thing are fearing the pink slip .
US banks had looked forward to a huge " cap - and - trade market " a system where companies would buy and sell the right to emit gases blamed for warming the planet .
Many hired carbon traders , picked up assets , and trained members of energy desks to deal in emissions markets .
But prospects for a broad US carbon market have dimmed .
US Senator Lindsey Graham , a Republican working on a compromise climate bill , declared economy - wide cap - and - trade " dead " this month .
At least one bank with carbon trade assets has already been hit .
EcoSecurities , a clean energy project developer and carbon trader , bought by JP Morgan Chase last year has closed its New York - based US office leading to a loss of up to 20 jobs .
JP Morgan has said a senior carbon trader , who had recently moved to Washington , is leaving the bank this month .
Banks that that did not expand in advance of a cap - and - trade bill may not have to cut much staff , but long - anticipated expansions will not happen either .
( CNN ) -- Justin Gawel says there 's nothing too incriminating on his Facebook page .
" There are a lot of pictures of drinking [ but ] nothing naked or anything -- at least I do n't think so , " he said jokingly .
Even so , the Michigan State University junior recently changed his Facebook display name to " Dustin Jawel " to keep his personal life from potential employers while applying for summer internships .
Although Gawel ditched his rhyming alias after two weeks when he realized Facebook users also can be searched by e-mail address , school and network , he is not alone in his efforts to scrub his online résumé .
Many students and recent graduates say they are changing their names on Facebook or tightening privacy settings to hide photos and wall posts from potential employers .
And with good reason .
A recent survey commissioned by Microsoft found that 70 percent of recruiters and hiring managers in the United States have rejected an applicant based on information they found online .
What kind of information ?
" Inappropriate " comments by the candidate ; " unsuitable " photos and videos ; criticisms of previous employers , co-workers , or clients ; and even inappropriate comments by friends and relatives , according to the survey report , titled " Online Reputation in a Connected World . "
Such prying into his online life makes Gawel uncomfortable .
" I understand that when [ employers look ] at someone 's Facebook page , they 're just trying to paint a bigger picture of the people they 're hiring -- so they 're not just a name on a résumé , " he said .
" But that does n't demonstrate whether they can do the job .
It should n't matter what someone does when they 're not in the office . "
Gawel said he's not sure that employers would object to the information on his Facebook page .
For him , it 's more about personal privacy .
" Too many people take pictures of you .
I did n't want to go through and ' untag ' all of them , " he said .
" There 's nothing illegal or too ridiculous in the photos ... but people do n't take pictures of people studying or doing school work .
They take pictures of people at parties and doing silly things . "
For better or worse , online screenings may be a permanent part of the 21st - century hiring process .
The Microsoft survey found that 79 percent of U.S. hiring managers have used the Internet to better assess applicants .
Dan Eggers of Partners Marketing Group in Marietta , Georgia , is among that 79 percent .
" We review and certainly do research on anyone we 're looking at hiring or using as a contract employee , " Eggers said .
" We would Google their name , look at Linked In , Facebook and Twitter . "
He said his firm usually only consults an applicant 's online reputation to make sure he or she has n't misrepresented their work experience .
" We try not to pay a lot of attention to wall posts from others .
It would take quite a bit for us to be reacting to that , " Eggers said .
But racist or homophobic comments will land your résumé and cover letter in the garbage , he said .
" People have a false sense of security about their personal information out there on the Web ... they think only their friends will see it , " said Jack Rayman , senior director of career services at Pennsylvania State University .
Elana Borchers , an Indiana University senior , said she exchanged her last name for her middle name on Facebook in November when she started applying for jobs .
Borchers even decided to keep her alias after landing a full - time position a month later .
" Not everything is certain , " she said .
" If my employers saw something on my profile now that they did n't like , they could take my job away . "
Not that she 's worried about the content on her Facebook page .
" There 's nothing bad [ on my profile ] .
I 'd rather they learn about me in person , " Borchers said .
" Big Ten schools have the reputation of excessive partying .
That 's something that 's here with me in college , I do n't plan to take that partying with me in the future and I did n't want someone to see that and judge me . "
Borchers said she thought about removing pictures of her partying , but " they 're my memories and I want to keep them for now . "
Many of Borchers ' friends are playing the Facebook name game , too -- dropping their last names or using a nickname to hide from potential employers and grad- school admissions officers .
" A lot of my guy friends changed [ their user names ] to a nickname that their friends call them , so everyone still knows who it is , " she said .
Facebook spokesperson Kathleen Loughlin said she could not comment on the number of users who change their name on Facebook , but students who spoke to CNN said that among their peers , the trend is rampant .
Another Indiana University senior , Jeffrey Lefcort , changed his Facebook user name to Jeffrey David -- his middle name -- when he began applying for jobs , even though he does n't think his page has anything inappropriate .
" I just did n't want to be found by someone who was looking for me that I 'm not friends with , " Lefcort said .
" My Facebook profile is not intended for employers .
I did n't want them looking at my personal life . "
Like Gawel , Lefcort eventually ditched his pseudonym and opted instead to tighten his Facebook privacy settings -- something Facebook 's Loughlin said is encouraged .
With the Internet playing such a large role in business today , few recruiters do n't assess applicants ' online reputations in some capacity before hiring , said George Matlock , director of operations at Matlock Advertising and Public Relations in Atlanta , Georgia .
And while Matlock said he almost always Googles a person 's name before hiring them , he steers clear of Facebook .
" I have n't looked at [ an applicant 's ]
Facebook page , " he said .
" I try to stay away from it , myself .
I think it 's too personal ... maybe I 'm just scared to see what 's out there .
Facebook tends to be something pretty private . "
Emily Mitnick , a Michigan State University senior who also changed her name on Facebook , said she has nothing to hide but wants to keep a low profile and avoid being searched by potential employers .
Mitnick uses LinkedIn to communicate with the " professional world . "
She describes Facebook as a place " where I can be social with my friends and I do n't have to be professional .
" I do n't have any of my [ tagged pictures ] available to the public -- just for precautionary measures , not because they 're inappropriate , " she added .
" I would just like to remain somewhat private . "
Rayman , the Penn State career counselor , said he recommends that students with potentially incriminating photos or posts change their name on social networking sites .
But it 's not always that easy to escape your online reputation , he said .
" Web sites are almost impossible to eliminate , " Rayman said .
" They get cached somewhere and they 'll keep coming up .
It used to be if you had a poor reputation in one school , you 'd move to another and your record did n't necessarily follow you .
It 's getting harder and harder to do that as everyone is on the Internet and everyone knows everyone 's business . "

At four years old , Gul - e - Mehtab already knows what she wants to do when she grows up .
This little girl , whose name means " moonlight flower " , wants to be a doctor in order to heal her own mother , Manzoor Attiqa .
" She says : ' Mama when I grow up , I will become a doctor .
I will treat you , and then you will be perfect ' , " Manzoor says , with a proud smile .
Twenty - two - year - old Manzoor is a patient in surgical ward 10 in Benazir Bhutto hospital in the Pakistani city of Rawalpindi .
Manzoor says the attack followed a row over doing the dishes
The ward is a cluster of women in brightly coloured shawls , who share the same scars and the same trauma .
All have been attacked with acid .
There are no reliable national statistics , but campaigners estimate that there may be as many as 150 victims every year .
It is an intimate crime - often carried out in the family home , by husbands or in - laws .
Manzoor 's attack followed a row over doing the dishes .
" It was seven o'clock in the morning , and I had just finished making breakfast , " she says .
" My daughter was crying so I picked her up , but her grandmother said : ' Leave her and wash the dishes . '
I told her that I would wash them , and that we had the whole day ahead of us .
After this , they started beating me .
I was unconscious for four or five days .
I woke up in hospital in Lahore . "
While she lay unconscious , Manzoor was drenched in acid .
It devoured her lower lip , neck and shoulders and left her chin fused to her chest .
But when she speaks of the in - laws she blames for the attack , there is no bitterness .
In spite of her injuries , and her suffering , she says that she has forgiven them .
" They are like my own mother and sisters , " she says .
" I just pray God shows them the right path , so they can't do this kind of thing to anybody else .
I forgave them , so that they could realise they did wrong . "
Get the sellers
When we meet Manzoor , she is about to have her sixth surgery - performed free by a group of Pakistani experts , and British volunteers , led by plastic surgeon Charles Viva .
The retired NHS doctor , with a snow - white walrus moustache , has spent decades treating the poor around the globe , including many victims of acid burns .
Retired plastic surgeon Charles Viva has treated many acid burns victims " I feel very passionately angry about this because God has made us whole , and for somebody to do this causes a lot of distress for the patients and their families , " he says .
" We do what we can to give the women back their dignity . "
In Manzoor 's case , this means grafting skin from her leg on to her neck , so that she can lift her head fully .
Mr Viva wants action against those who sell the acid , not just those who throw it .
" I think we need some very strong deterrents to prevent this happening , " he said .
" I think it 's essential that the government and the authorities should target the people who perpetrate the crime , and those who supply the acid .
They are just as guilty for giving the acid . "
Two hours later , Manzoor is back in ward 10 .
Her surgery was a success , but it wo n't be her last .
' It did n't end my life '
Opposite her , in bed nine , Saira Liaqat is recovering from her latest operation - her 18th .
Her face is still bandaged , but already she is sitting up , supported by her mother , Gulshan .
A medical file rests at the end of the bed , with photos of a striking girl in a gold headdress .
That was Saira seven years ago , before she was attacked .
Saira Liaqat was attacked several years ago , but has plans for the future Acid has erased any resemblance to the pretty girl of the past , but it has not crushed her spirit .
Since the attack , she has trained as a beautician .
" I want to own my own beauty parlour , " she says .
" I want people to say ' that 's the girl who suffered and did n't lose hope ' .
I want to support my parents as well as a son can .
I want to show that person that even though he threw acid in my face , it did n't end my life . "
Saira 's husband is still on trial for her attack .
If convicted , he could get between five and 14 years .
Gulshan wants an eye for an eye .
" He should either get the death penalty , or have acid thrown in his face , so he knows how it feels , " she says .
" The law is weak in Pakistan .
If criminals like him are given a tough punishment immediately , then nobody will do this kind of thing . "
Campaigners are calling for the introduction of life sentences .
They say that while Pakistan is finally waking up to this issue , there is still a long way to go .
" At the highest level , people like the chief justice are taking acid violence very seriously , " says Valerie Khan of the Acid Survivors Foundation ( ASF ) , which helps many of the victims .
" In the past six months , we are seeing higher sentences being handed down .
But the vast majority of women are unable to even register a case .
And police are still turning a blind eye , due to corruption and social pressure . "
While she slept
One of many still waiting for justice is 23 - year - old Naseera Bibi .
She is friendly and talkative , in spite of her debilitating injuries .
The acid thrown in her face , while she slept , ate through her nose and both of her eyes .
She believes her husband was the culprit .
I 've learnt how to knit sweaters and my children are back with me .
I can't just sit around and lose hope
Naseera Bibi
She says she heard his voice next to her , as the acid melted her skin , telling her to say it was someone else .
" I started screaming .
Then I heard my husband telling me whoever asks you who did it , just say it was Javed .
I told him that I have n't seen anybody .
He kept insisting whoever asks you , just say Javed did it . "
Naseera 's main concern now is how to provide for her children , without her sight .
" I 've been taken to about 10 doctors , but there does n't seem to be a chance of restoring my eyesight , " she says .
" I 've been very upset about this , because I have become a burden .
But the ASF sent me to a school to study .
I 've learnt how to knit sweaters , and my children are back with me .
I can't just sit around and lose hope . "
Like other acid attack survivors in ward 10 , Nazeera has been robbed of her looks , but not of her courage .
She has two dreams for the future - to send her children to school , and for her attacker to be punished .

The Republican senator who has been blocking an extension of unemployment benefits surprised supporters and critics alike with a defense of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and criticism of Fox News at a recent town hall event .
Sen . Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) told a crowd in Norman , Oklahoma , that Pelosi , the highest - ranking Democrat in the House , is a “ nice lady ” and the public should keep itself from “ being biased by Fox News . ”

Coburn also took the unusual step of correcting a mistaken belief about the Democrats ’ recently passed health care overhaul .
When a member of the audience asserted that the government would have the power to jail people for not buying health insurance , Coburn said , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ The intention is not to put any one in jail .
That makes for good TV news on Fox but that is nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t the intention . ”
Coburn took another shot at Fox News later in the discussion , when he said : Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ What we have to have is make sure we have a debate in this country so that you can see what Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s going on and make a determination yourself .
So do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t catch yourself being biased by Fox News that somebody is no good .
The people in Washington are good .
They just do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t know what they donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t know . ”
But it was Coburn ’s assertion that Pelosi is a “ nice lady ” that seemed to anger the crowd the most .
“ I ’m 180 degrees in opposition to the speaker , ” Coburn said .
“ She ’s a nice lady — wait , come on now , ” he interjected as the audience groaned .

Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Come on now .
She is nice Ã¢â‚¬â€œ how many of you all have met her ?
SheÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a nice person , ” Coburn said .
“ Let me give you a little lesson here .
I hope you will listen to me .
Just because somebody disagrees with you does nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t mean theyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re not a good person . ”
Democrats are blaming Coburn for some 212,000 Americans temporarily losing their unemployment benefits this week after Coburn blocked a one - month extension of federal jobless aid ahead of the Senate ’s spring break .
Coburn has earned the nickname “ Dr. No ” for his record of blocking Democratic initiatives on Capitol Hill .

Last month , Coburn proposed an amendment to the health care overhaul that would ban sex offenders from receiving Viagra through the insurance markets created by the plan .
That amendment failed .
This audio was recorded by KGOU in Norman , Oklahoma , and was uploaded to the Web by Capitol News Connection , April 5 , 2010 .
Since that book was published , the effects global climate change have become too evident for Lomborg ’s calmness to seem reasonable any more .
Today , only a handful of serious scientists doubt that unless we do something decisive to limit our pollution of the natural world – by curbing population growth , reducing carbon emissions or building homes , cars and appliances that are more energy efficient – we will soon pass a “ point of no return ” after which environmental safeguards will be useless because we will have lost our ability to affect the climate .
Al Gore has made this point repeatedly , but even if he had n’t there is an overwhelming body of research to support his wariness .
Despite embarrassments like the “ Climategate ” emails – which suggest that climate researchers at the University of East Anglia tinkered with their data – there are thousands of studies which establish , beyond reasonable doubt , how much we have fouled the atmosphere .
One striking measure is the amount of carbon dioxide in the air .
Before the Industrial Revolution , the level was about 280 parts per million , but today that figure has risen to 390 – the highest level in 15 million years .
But while most researchers can agree that we face a genuine dilemma , there seems to be little consensus on what should happen next .
As the failures of Copenhagen showed , many bureaucrats and politicians believe that halting progress on the environment is the best we can reasonably hope for , especially in light of the developmental challenges which so many parts of the world currently face .
There are , however , other reasons why the green movement has failed to deliver on its promises at the highest levels and these have nothing to do with development or scientific evidence .
In the current issue of The Nation , a distinguished left - leaning US periodical , British journalist Johann Hari takes a hard look at green activism in the UnitedStates and finds hypocrisy almost everywhere .
Several prominent groups have even struck up partnerships with the polluters they were meant to monitor .
Two years ago , for example , the Sierra Club , after a mild acknowledgement of the obvious conflict of interest , agreed to endorse a new line of “ green ” Clorox bleach , in return for a percentage of the sales .
The board promised the Club ’s members it would analyse the bleach , and establish the truth of the advertising claims , but this was never done .
Christine MacDonald , a former activist at Conservation International and author of Green Inc , a damning account of the movement ’s loss of idealism , told Hari that “ Not only do the largest [ US ] conservation groups take money from companies deeply implicated in environmental crimes ; they have become something like satellite PR offices for the corporations that support them . ”
Consequently , last year when the Center for Biological Diversity ( CBD ) urged the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) to ensure the Clean Air Act be used to impose carbon dioxide levels of 350 ppm ( a figure supported by many climate change experts ) the Sierra Club vociferously opposed the initiative and even threatened to intervene in the EPA ’s defence if the CBD took legal action to force the agency to comply .
Hari also complains that the US Senate ’s attitude to environmental legislation is deeply compromised by generous campaign donations from the Oil and Coal lobby .
This manipulation of the system is arguably more consequential since “ The US climate bills are long - term plans : they lock us into a woefully inadequate schedule of carbon cuts all the way to 2050 .
So when green groups cheer them on , they are giving their approval to a path to destruction – and calling it progress . ”
Hari ’s scepticism also extends to schemes like the much - touted Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation ( REDD ) programme which has received so much attention in this region .
Thirteen years ago in Bolivia a coalition between The Nature Conservancy and what Hari calls “ three big - time corporate polluters – BP , Pacificorp and American Electric Power ( AEP ) ” created a protected area of the forest called the Noel Kempff Climate Action Project .
This initiative set aside 3.9 million acres of tropical forest , promised to end logging in the area and provide guarantees that the forest would remain standing .
Early estimates said the would keep “ 55 million tons of CO2 locked out of the air – which would , in time , justify their pumping an extra 55 million tons into the air from their coal and oil operations . ”
But far from achieving these targets , a subsequent investigation by Greenpeace found that “ logging companies [ in the protected area ] had simply picked up their machinery and moved to the next rainforest over …
In fact , one major logging organization took the money it was paid by the project to quit and used it to cut down another part of the forest . ”
Shamefacedly , the project “ had to admit it had saved 5.8 million tons or less – a tenth of the amount it had originally claimed .
Greenpeace says even this is a huge overestimate . ”
Obviously the hypocrisy of some environmental groups , however shameful , should not be allowed to tarnish the importance of their cause , nor obscure the success of inspired initiatives like 350.org – a worldwide coalition which calls for far more extensive protections than those proposed at Copenhagen .
In fact , even at this late stage of the deepening environmental crisis , there is still room for optimism .
In his recent bestseller , Hot , Flat and Crowded , New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman has shown how quickly government - backed research and development , tax incentives , new subsidies and energy markets could spur huge advances in energy efficiency and the production of cheap , clean , renewable energy .
On the other hand , if the green movement fails to pursue its mission effectively , and succumbs to corporate and political compromises , measures to slow further global change are likely to fail .
Political will is likely to be the key to these different outcomes , and that will only occur when an engaged public learns a measured scepticism towards the political half - measures , and compromised activism that are meant to be tackling this crucial challenge on our behalf .

Veteran actor Sir Michael Caine has backed David Cameron 's plans for voluntary " national citizen service " for all 16 - year - olds .
Under the proposal , all teenagers of that age would be able to join a two - month summer residential scheme , with outdoor activities and community work .
The Conservative leader said it would be " in the same spirit " as the old military National Service .
Labour and the Lib Dems both questioned how the scheme would be funded .
' Forgotten youngsters ' Joined by Sir Michael at a press conference in central London , Mr Cameron said the proposal would bring together young people from widely different backgrounds , something he said did not take place at present .
Mr Cameron added that the aim was to give young people more shape and purpose in their lives .
" Show me a gang taking drugs and I 'll show you a group of people who have nothing to look forward to , " he said .
" The problem is their lives lack shape . "
Sir Michael said it would help youngsters " forgotten in this country " .
The image of David Cameron alongside one of this country 's best - known and best - loved actors is something I 'm sure David Cameron is delighted about
BBC chief political correspondent Laura Kuenssberg
" There is a very , very hardcore of [ young ] people we have really got to save , " he added .
The actor , who voted for Labour in 1997 , later said he would be backing the Conservatives in this election - saying he thought Mr Cameron would " be great " as PM - before saying he did not believe any party should serve more than two consecutive terms in office .
Labour , meanwhile , is highlighting its Youth Community Action scheme , launched last month in five pilot areas , which aims to encourage more 14 to 16 - year - olds to do local voluntary work .
The Liberal Democrats are focusing on plans to make it easier for parents to get flexible working hours , and £ 2.5 bn of extra funding to target the one million poorest and most educationally disadvantaged children .
The Tory leader says he has been working on the national citizen service scheme since August 2005 , during which time pilot programmes have been run in London , Wales and north - west England .
The Conservatives say they have the backing of the Prince 's Trust and the Duke of Edinburgh 's Award , and if elected , would seek for the scheme to be operated across the UK by independent charities , social enterprises and businesses .
Mr Cameron added that he wanted to give young people " more to aspire to " and help do more to end " the national scandal of all this wasted promise " .
' Big Society '
He admitted that his initial proposal for the citizen service scheme was for it to be compulsory , " but youth leaders told me that would have been the kiss of death " .
So instead , while the scheme will be available to every 16 - year - old in the UK , it will be voluntary .
The Conservatives say the idea forms part of its " Big Society " plans - reducing the size of government to give individuals , charities and other private bodies a larger role in society .
BBC chief political correspondent Laura Kuenssberg said getting the famous actor to share a platform with Mr Cameron was a coup for the party .
The Conservatives are living in cloud cuckoo land if they think they can provide a National Citizen Service on the cheap
Danny Alexander , Lib Dems
" The image of David Cameron alongside one of this country 's best - known and best - loved actors is something I 'm sure David Cameron is delighted about , " she said .
Schools Secretary Ed Balls said : " Another glitzy David Cameron launch can't hide the fact that this is yet another spending commitment from the Tories with the flakiest of funding solutions . "
He said the Tories had a " plan to deny opportunities to thousands of young people " , adding : " They refuse to match Labour 's school leavers guarantee of a sixth form , college , training or apprenticeship place for 16 and 17 - year - olds .
" The Tories wo n't protect this area from the immediate cuts they need to find this year . "
Lib Dem chief of staff Danny Alexander said : " The Conservatives are living in cloud cuckoo land if they think they can provide a National Citizen Service on the cheap .
" Once again the Tories have made an enormous spending commitment without the foggiest idea of how they 're going to pay for it . "

Too late have I realized this series should be called “ Lovelace and Babbage Vs Organized Crime ” .
Dang it !
For the sountrack to the first part of this comic , press play :
Music is the silence between the notes , they say , just as the comic is the bunch of drawings between these NOTES :
— Obviously the most historically problematic part of the comic is the inclusion of Brunhilde among The Sopranos .
This ultimate iconic role was n’t performed until 1876 - ALTHOUGH , it was created in the 1850s , so it ’s not as silly as it may have initially seemed .
— the Lair of the Organist is located in St Louis , Missouri .
— The Assorted Musical Miscreants , otherwise known as the Clockwork Quartet , feed me exquisite chocolates and and are here to raise the fashion tone around this comic .
— The Organist bears a suspicious , and yet Entirely Coincidental resemblance to Mr Bruce of The Correspondents , because every time I see that guy I think , ‘ that guy NEEDS to be a Super - villain ’ .
Um , I hope that ’s okay .
Street Organists do in fact seem to have been a bit of a mafia .
Babbage was not the only one to claim the organ grinders were a protection racket ( “ nice quiet street you got here .
Shame if someone started playing a really loud organ . ” ) .
Mostly the organs were owned by a central depot and rented out to hacks , somewhat like taxicabs .
According to the Museum of Self - Playing Instruments in Kew , an automatic street - piano would cost 2/6d to rent per day in the 1890s from the Tomasso and Sons company - here ’s one from that very same nefarious organisation , enjoy !
Business idea : create virus that will autoplay barrel - organ music , with handy pop -up explaining music will stop with a donation to an untraceable account .
Include cute monkey icon !
— Charles Wheatstone !
So , I knew I wanted him in the comic for various reasons but I have to say he ’s given me a hard time .
It turns out I ’ve been spoiled rotten on the fantastic wealth of entertaining primary documents around Babbage and Lovelace , because would you believe it all I keep getting for this guy is a bunch of interesting scientific papers !
What the heck is up with that ?
The one spark I ’m trying to fan into a flame is that , while an inexhaustible talker in private , he was so terrified of public speaking that Michael Faraday used to have to give his lectures for him at the Royal Society .
Also , I ’m not sure if Babbage ever forgave Wheatstone for inventing the concertina .
With historical basis however is that he was given to Cunning Plans , one of which it involved our very own Lady Lovelace .
From a late 1844 letter from Lovelace to her husband :
“ I have had Wheatstone with me the last 5 hours .. he has given me much important information , & still more important advice .
He is anxious I should take such a position as may enable me to influence Prince Albert , who is , he knows , a very clever young man . ”
The gist of the Plan was that Lovelace should get close to the Prince Consort and replace him with an evil automaton replica serve him as “ a sensible adviser and suggester , to indicate to him the channels for his exercising a scientific influence . ”
A large component of this long - range plan involved slowly building Lovelace ’s reputation by having her write translations and compendia of scientific papers from the Continent .
It was in fact Wheatstone and not Babbage who had first suggested , nearly two years before this meeting , that she publish something on the Analytical Engine .
To me it looks like Wheatstone was one of several who was looking to Lovelace as the successor to Mary Somerville , who had been writing similar translations and elucidations a decade or so earlier but had permanently moved to Italy in 1838 .
Victorian Science being run on the Smurfette principle of gender balance , there was a gap in the market .
Wheatstone ’s plans were to be cut short by Lovelace ’s untimely death , but slowed down by other more ambiguous problems , which brings us to :
The Demon Poetry
— That ’s Elizabeth Barrett Browning slamming The Soul ’s Expression there –
Here she is rocking a hella goth look .
Poetry slams can be very dangerous things , I ’m here to tell you .
I met my husband at one so let that be a terrible warning to you all .
— Here is a very important historical document about dangerous poets .
– A fear of Lovelace developing a ‘ poetic ’ temperament was expressed even by Byron - “ I hope the Gods have made her anything save poetical — it is enough to have one such fool in the family . ”
I ’m reasonably sure this was a euphemism , and the concern was centred more around the alarming history of what we ’d now call mental illness in the Byron line , which was to become something of an obsession for Ada ’s mother .
It ’s hard to write anything of medium - blog length about Lovelace , as I ’m either forced to handwave or go on for pages ..
I wish I could recommend a biography but although there are several , they range from the adequate to the not - adequate , which is n’t exactly a ringing endorsement .
Oh well !
Diagnosing long - dead people is a harmless and futile hobby ( for the five people reading this to whom this means anything , the bipolar thing is pretty much the only thing I agree with in the Stein biography ) .
So , to use technically neutral language , there is a widening streak of weird that starts showing up periodically in Lovelace ’s letters in her mid-twenties .
I have to say if you ’ve ever had a friend with a bipolar disorder these set off the same “ Oh , geeeez .. ” alarm bells as an extremely lengthy and odd email from an otherwise charming friend .
I could quote you some stuff but that seems like kind of a jerky thing to do , so , I wo n’t .
In late ’ 43 , shortly after she finished the Notes on Babbage ’s engine , Lovelace ’s doctor began to attempt to treat an ‘ illness ’ of what Lovelace termed ‘ whims and manias ’ with a mixture of opium , morphine , and gin .
Did it work ?
Amazingly , no .
Noooo , it did n’t .
Lovelace ’s history enters an extremely murky period at this point .
A powerful faith in Self - Improvement was pretty much the only Victorian thing about Ada Lovelace– as she wrote : “ There has been no end to the manias and whims I have been subject to , & which nothing but the most resolute determination on my part could have mastered . ”
It sure seems like a few years later the weird patches in the letters vanished as mysteriously as they came , not to return at least in the few years she had left to her .
She attributes this to the elimination of ‘ 1. extravagant stimulating 2. extravagant dosing ’ and ‘ the judicious management of a very susceptible temperament ’ .
Pocket - universe Lovelace continues the struggle against her ‘ hydra - headed monster ’ .
Anyways , better wind this down !
One last note :
– ‘ that ’s Tuesdays , man ’ —
Lovelace ’s attitude to her father fluctuated a fair bit during her life , but we ’ll go into that in a later comic !
( Incidentally if anyone wants to spend five hours outlining a plan whereby I would gradually ascend to Total Comics Domination I would be delighted to listen , but bring sandwiches .
Five hours ! )

" When the last tree is cut , the last river poisoned , and the last fish dead , we will discover that we can't eat money ... " — Chief Seattle
Since 1971 , Greenpeace has been fighting environmental degradation , condemning environmental criminals and challenging governments and corporations that fail to safeguard our environment and ultimately our future .
The Mediterranean is key to the survival of the Atlantic northern bluefin tuna , and the waters surrounding the Balearic Islands are a vital spawning ground .
Every year , the fish come to reproduce in the warm Mediterranean waters .
And every year , a fleet of fishing vessels races to catch them , encircling whole schools with nets known as “ purse - seines . ”
The Rainbow Warrior , one of the Greenpeace 's most popular ships , spent two weeks in the bluefin tuna fishing grounds , monitoring that the fishing season 's designated closing date was enforced .
In the photographer 's words :
My grandfather and my father were the local photographers in a small village in southern Italy , where I grew up .
They would take simple , black and white portraits on their trusty old wooden camera .
When I was a baby , my father would keep me in his darkroom — in that soft , dim light and surrounded by all his chemicals — so I could sleep while he worked .
That was my introduction to the world of photography .
As I got older , he would take me to weddings almost every weekend where he would talk me though his techniques and teach me the basics of photography .
He is a man of very few words but he would come alive when showing me how his super Ikonta worked and how I should handle it .
For me , the only way I can share what I see is through my images .
I am not very good with words — written or spoken — and in that respect I guess I am a lot like my father .
Like him , taking pictures is the only way I know how to communicate .
I try to capture fleeting moments of history — fleeting for us but moments that will affect others for the rest of their lives .
As a photographer , I want to share these stories with people around the world and — I would like to hope — with generations to come .
I will spend days with a person to gain their trust , to gain access to their world in order to find the image .
The camera gives you that sacred access .
And then I will just become invisible , and disappear in their world .
About the photographer :
Giulio di Sturco is a 29 - year - old Italian photographer who divides his time between Milan and New Delhi .
He studied photography at the European Institute of Design and Visual Arts in Rome , and has covered North - American issues for many Italian magazines such as D ( La Repubblica delle Donne ) , Internazionale , Vanity Fair , Marie Claire , Anna , Amica , Geo , lEspresso and others from his base in Canada and New York .
In November 2007 , he won the first edition of the Reporters Without Borders contest " A Better World " and , in February 2009 , he won a World Press Photo award ( 1st Prize , singles ) in the Arts and Entertainment category .

One thing you learn about politics is that the closer you get to the local level , the harder it is to just talk and not get the job done .
Former Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill codified this in his timeless aphorism , " all politics is local , " and nothing makes it more obvious than when 40 inches of snow gets dumped on your doorstep .
People who talk about how " the government that governs best governs least " suddenly start singing a different tune ( usually complaining ) when the snow starts coming down hard and fast .
" Why were n't the plows out earlier ? "
" Why did n't they start salting the roads last night ? "
" Why is n't my street plowed ? "
These also tend to be the same people who complain about taxes as well -- but when snow comes down in record amounts , the amount of taxes they pay are n't the issue any more , it 's , " Why are n't you plowing MY street ? "
Ronald Reagan got many Americans into this mindset 30 years ago , and they 've been playing the same tune ever since :
You can have it all , and someone else can pay for it .
And woe be to any mayor or governor who does n't pay attention to the problems of the locals , no matter what the trouble .
Poor Stephanie Rawlings - Blake did n't have time to take a deep breath before Baltimore got slammed with the largest amount of snow on record .
Despite the city getting leveled with more snow than Syracuse , N.Y. , all you hear is " the city 's doing a crappy job of plowing the streets . "
Let 's note that Baltimore budgets for Baltimore winters , not upstate New York ones .
If Smooth Bobby Ehrlich comes out of hiding this summer and decides to run against Martin O'Malley , he will likely make some sort of noise about how the state is in a massive budget shortfall and is likely to remain so until the nation 's economy turns around .
As usual , per the Reagan Republican playbook , he will accuse O'Malley of being a spendthrift who never saw a program that did n't need money thrown at it , despite O'Malley needing to find more and more painful cuts each year as the state struggles to survive the post - Bush downturn .
But Ehrlich would be counting on people not recalling the budget he submitted in his last year as governor , in which he proposed the biggest spending increase in 25 years , including a 14.5 percent increase to higher education after two straight years of cuts .
Facts like these tend to get kicked aside when it comes election time , and if you 're not in power , this means that you 've got the freedom to complain , complain , complain .
Call it the politics of " wah . "
It 's somewhat fortunate that politicians at the state and local level can't posture like the complainers at the national level , else we'd all really be in a bind .
MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow pointed out how under President Bush , despite originating or voting for a deficit commission , pay - go rules , the bank bailout , trying terrorism suspects in the United States , and cap - and - trade , Republicans in lockstep voted against them all once President Obama signed on .
Not one Republican - - not one !-- voted for the stimulus package , yet all around the country , smiling GOP congressmen and senators sent out press releases and stood posing for pictures with giant lottery - style checks touting how helpful that money was to their districts .
You know , the money they voted against .
Obama actually had to call out GOP members to their faces here in Baltimore during that televised meeting they held last month .
But it does n't matter , because the GOP is resolute in that 1 ) they 're not going to help do anything that might give Obama a victory , and 2 ) they 'll complain about anything , whether or not they supported it in the past .
" It 's the Democrats ' fault , " they complain , " since they 're the party with a majority in both the House and the Senate . "
This cynical ploy comes while they exploit every rule and technicality to bring any piece of legislation to a halt , starting with the need for a supermajority to do any business in the Senate .
Short of calling the roll , if one senator decides to go against " unanimous consent " for even the simplest of procedures , the Senate comes to a halt .
Last fortnight , Sen. Richard Shelby ( R - Ala . ) put a hold on every single nominee Obama had put before the Senate for confirmation .
Not only do the Republicans not care if a single bill passes , they do n't care if the government has the personnel required to operate .
And then , they 'll complain that it 's not their fault , because they 're not in charge .
All of this is cynical and calculated , of course .
It 's a bet , hinging on whether or not you pay attention to how the machine works , rather than just noticing the fact that it 's not working .
And they 've upped the stakes : Whereas 15 years ago under Newt Gingrich , Republicans shut the government down wholesale and delayed Bill Clinton 's judicial nominees for up to two years , now they refuse to participate in the process at all while trying to bring it to a halt .
All the while saying , " wah . "

A handful of lawmakers are accusing General Motors of misleading the public by continuing to claim as part of its advertising blitz that the auto giant has repaid its government loans " in full . "
General Motors has been running ads on all the major networks claiming the company repaid its $ 6.7 billion U.S. government loan " with interest five years ahead of the original schedule . "
General Motors Company CEO
Ed Whitacre can be seen in the ad walking through an auto plant as he touts the company 's progress .
But lawmakers , and even the inspector general for the bailout fund GM borrowed from , point out that General Motors only repaid the bailout money by dipping into a separate pot of bailout money .
They say the company did not actually use its own earnings to make the early payment and are questioning why executives are making such a big deal out of it .
" The hype is not the reality , " Sen .
Charles Grassley , R - Iowa , wrote in a column on FoxNews.com over the weekend .
" It is far from clear how GM and the Obama administration could honestly say , much less trumpet in prime time television ads , that GM repaid its TARP ( Troubled Asset Relief Program ) loans in any meaningful way . "
Grassley wrote a letter last week to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner expressing his concerns and asking for more information about why the company was allowed to use bailout money to repay bailout money .
The $ 6.7 billion is also just a fraction of the $ 52 billion General Motors received in government aid .
Grassley said lawmakers are being told government losses on GM are expected to exceed $ 30 billion .
The TARP inspector general , Neil Barofsky , bluntly told the Senate Finance Committee during a hearing last week that the repayment " is just other TARP money " and lawmakers should not " exaggerate " the feat .
" It sounds like they 're kind of like taking money out of one pocket and putting it in the other to do that , " Sen .
Tom Carper , D - Del. , said at the hearing .
Sen . Richard Shelby , R - Ala. , expressed similar concerns Sunday on NBC's " Meet the Press , " saying it's " misleading " for the administration to claim the company has paid back its loans .
The GM ad could potentially land the company in trouble with the Federal Trade Commission over its truth - in - advertising laws , which prohibit ads that are " likely to mislead consumers . "
The FTC would not comment on the specific GM ad .
General Motors admits that the company is repaying the loan with other government money , but says a year ago " nobody thought we'd be able to pay this back . "

" I 'm feeling healthy , I 've lost 2st . "
He added : " Ninety percent of the challenge was mental and I think the fact that I genuinely enjoyed it , apart from a handful of days , I think that sort of positive approach meant that it was never really a chore or a trial to actually get through each day . "
Marie Curie nurse Sarah Richardson was one of the scores of people who congratulated him at the finish line .
She said : " It means that we [ the charity ] can provide more Marie Curie nurses like myself to get out there and help people , who deserve it and need it , who have cancer or other terminal illnesses , in the comfort of their own home . "

Credit where credit is due - this is a solid liberal appointment and a noted constitutional scholar -- things that paint a target on his back to the anti-intellectual right wing .
Liu is n't a " safe " choice , so I have to assume Obama 's prepared to go to the mat for him , since the usual suspects are already smearing him :
WASHINGTON ( AP ) --
Thirteen months into his presidency , Barack Obama finally gave liberal supporters the kind of judicial nominee they had sought and conservatives feared .
Goodwin Liu , 39 , is an unabashed liberal legal scholar who , if confirmed , could become a force on the federal appeals court for decades .
There 's talk that in time , the Rhodes Scholar , former high court clerk and current assistant dean and law professor at the University of California , Berkeley , could be the first person of Asian descent chosen for the Supreme Court .
" I can easily imagine him " as a high court nominee , said Erwin Chemerinsky , a Liu supporter and dean of the law school at the University of California , Irvine .
Obama 's choice of Liu for the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco drew quick and vociferous criticism from conservatives .
Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama , the senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , described Liu as " far outside the mainstream of American jurisprudence . "
For the first time , Obama seemed to be taking a page from the playbook of recent Republican presidents who nominated conservatives in their 30s and 40s with the expectation they would have enduring influence in setting policy on the federal bench .
BRONX , NY – The community room at the Amalgamated Houses , a cooperative housing project in the Bronx , was the scene of an important gathering of workers and neighbors Monday night .
A highlight was the remarks of Alba Vasques , a “ member political organizer ” of SEIU 32 BJ .
Vasquez raised her children as a single mother , and described the huge change in her life when she finally got a union job , after year of working 18 hours days and still struggling to make ends meet .
“ We had health care and sick days , something I ’d never had before .
And I had vacation time .
I could get to know my children . ”
The “ town hall meeting ” was called by 32 BJ , which represents 70,000 building service workers in New York City , to promote a newly introduced City Council bill ( Intro 18-2010 ) that would “ guarantee good wages , health care and other benefits to building service workers at new , city - subsidized developments and newly leased city work sites . ”
The bill reflects a growing movement in New York City that rejects the idea that people have to accept whatever crumbs are left on the table , and is fueled by anger at Wall Street and the pro-developer Bloomberg administration .
Union Vice President Kyle Bragg said , “ we should n’t be subsidizing developments that leave working families in the cold . ”
Just a few weeks ago a Bronx coalition of churches , community groups and unions defeated a Bloomberg - endorsed development plan , saying the plan would not have created the kinds of jobs and services the neighborhood needs .
On the stage last night with the union leaders were City Council members Oliver Koppell , Fernando Cabrera , and Maria del Carmen Arroyo , who each forcefully declared their support for the bill , which was introduced by East Harlem Councilwoman Melissa Mark - Viverito and has the support of Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz , Jr. and South Bronx Councilwoman Anabel Palma .
“ We must take concrete steps to eliminate the government ’s role in promoting poverty , ” said Cabrera .
Councilman Koppell , in whose district the meeting took place , mentioned that the Amalgamated Houses was a project of the labor movement , based on the same ideas as the bill — that workers and their families deserve decent wages and living conditions .
Councilwoman Arroyo praised the union for its activism , including its leadership on promoting bilingualism in political life , and said that the bill is “ a no -brainer .
It is common sense . ”

Herst wants to create a " green " community in West Berkeley .
But despite being in a city that takes its environmental commitment seriously , the developer faces opposition from some of the very people that he says his plan intends to benefit : artists and small business owners .
Mr. Herst 's vision is to incorporate green technologies ...
Researchers said English voters felt ignored by the devolution process Support for an English Parliament has grown from 18 % to 29 % in the past 10 years , according to a survey .
The poll shows the trend is matched by a rise in the number of people in England who feel Scotland receives more than its fair share of UK public money .
Out of 980 people questioned by think tank the IPPR , 40 % now feel the system is unfair , compared with 22 % in 2003 .
The IPPR said English people were " increasingly frustrated " with " the impact of the devolution settlement " .
The research was carried out by the left - leaning Institute for Public Policy Research and NatCen , a social research institute .
Just under half of those polled said England 's laws should continue to be made at Westminster .
Barnett formula Prof John Curtice , who wrote the report , said that if the trends continued , politicians " may no longer be able safely to assume that England can be ignored in the devolution debate " .
Politicians from all sides have ducked the issue of how England should be governed
Guy Lodge , IPPR
" It is too strong to speak as yet of a widespread English backlash , but the research does suggest there has been a marked growth in resentment about the level of funding that Scotland enjoys , " he said .
Associate director of the IPPR Guy Lodge said whoever won the next general election they would need to address the growing concerns of English voters .
" Politicians from all sides have ducked the issue of how England should be governed for too long and it seems that English public opinion is becoming increasingly frustrated , " he added .
The amount of Westminster money allocated to Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland is calculated by the Barnett formula .
It is based on population not need , and critics say it subsidises devolved administrations at the expense of English taxpayers .
In May last year , MPs on the Commons ' Justice Committee called for a review of the formula , saying it " lacks any basis in equity or logic " .
The call was reinforced two months later by a Lords committee , which called it " arbitrary and unfair " .
The Scottish Government has argued for full fiscal autonomy , and said the flow of resources was from Scotland to the London Treasury rather than the other way round .
The English Democrat party , which campaigns for an English Parliament , polled just over 250,000 votes at the European Parliament elections in June 2009 , coming seventh across England as a whole .

VAKIFLI KOYU , Turkey —
From the window of 97 - year - old Avadis Demirci ’s living room , the view stretches out onto a solitary cobbled road and the long view of history .
Unlike surrounding villages bustling with activity , here only the sound of birds and the occasional labored footsteps of another elderly resident interrupt the quiet .
Demirci ’s walls are covered in the framed paintings of his artist son and portraits of his grandchildren .
But his son no longer lives here .
Like most others under the age of 50 he has left .
Perched on top of Musa Dagh , or Mount Moses , Vakifli is Turkey ’s last surviving Armenian village — a relic of eastern Turkey 's once large , prosperous Armenian community , which was decimated by the deportations and massacres of 1915 to 1918 .
And Demirci might well be the last Armenian survivor of this brutal history left on Turkish soil .
On April 24 , groups will gather in town squares and city parks around the world to commemorate this first genocide of the 20th century , when more than a million Armenians were killed as the Ottoman Turk government purged the population .
But in lonely Vakifli , the day will pass without ceremony .
No candles will be lit , no speeches read .
And Demirci will sit where he always does and quietly ponder all the memories that stretch out across the landscape .
Ninety - five years ago , when Demirci was only 2 years old , Turkish police units marched up to the village .
The people from the seven villages around Musa Dagh took refuge on the mountain , armed with hunting rifles and pistols .
There they stayed for almost two months , until rescued by an allied French warship which happened to be cruising the Mediterranean coastline when it spotted two large banners the Armenians had hoisted .
After swimmers went out to meet the ship , the French called for back - up , transporting the entire population to an allied refugee camp in Egypt .
Musa
Dagh was one of only four places where Armenians managed to organize an armed defense against forced deportations and slaughter by the Ottomans .
" I grew up hearing this story , " said Demirci .
Light from the window sharpens the delicate web of lines around his eyes , unexpectedly piercing when compared to the shrunken frailness of his body .
" I was there , even if I was too young to remember . "
For those of Demirci ’s generation , stories of the brave ascent to Musa Dagh were legends passed down from their parents .
The novel " The Forty Days of Musa Dagh " — written by the Austrian Franz Werfel 18 years after the villager ’s armed resistance — kept the story alive for later generations .
Armenians worldwide observe the 24th as Genocide Memorial Day , and the killings are recognized as genocide today by more than a dozen countries .
But while the rest of the world begins to acknowledge the memories that Demerci carries with him daily , Turkey still vigorously rejects the claim .
Read about how the efforts of a small but effective Armenian lobby helped bring the U.S. and Turkey to diplomatic blows .
The politically delicate position of this isolated community has left them guarded when it comes to the mention of their ethnic origins .
While proud of their identity , most would prefer not to make it a public issue .
Turkey has long been engaged in an aggressive campaign of forgetting , keeping any mention of the events of 1915 out of schools and official narratives and attacking those who choose to speak out .
Roger Smith , co-founder of the International Association of Genocide Scholars , believes that Turkey ’s denial of the genocide is , for many Turks , more emotion than a question of facts .
“ They can't acknowledge that the country of their forebears did such awful things ...
That their polity has as its basis the crime of all crimes : genocide . ”
The vote by a U.S. congressional committee on March 4 to recognize the killings of 1915 as genocide has once again placed the Armenian issue squarely in the center of U.S. - Turkish relations , and prompted a furious mix of debate and dissent across Turkey .
It can be difficult to understand the degree to which denial of the genocide is ingrained in Turkish identity , where the killings are officially considered accidents of war .
“ Every Turk is offended by being accused of the worst kind of crime imaginable , ” said Kemal Cicek , head of the Armenian Research Group at the Turkish Historical Society .
“ They are also offended because the Turkish people are not racist , and genocide is a crime that only racists can commit . ”
A similar line of reasoning was used recently by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to defend Sudanese President Omar al - Bashir against charges of genocide in Darfur .
Erdogan heralded Bashir ’s innocence , pronouncing : " A Muslim cannot commit genocide . "
Here in Turkey , it is the absence of any reminders of what was once a thriving Armenian community that is most striking .
Successive governments have worked to destroy any evidence of Armenian existence — from the obliteration of their churches , libraries and institutes to the crude altering of official Turkish maps and schoolbooks .
UNESCO , in a 1974 study , found that out of 913 Armenian historical monuments found after 1923 in Eastern Turkey , 464 had vanished completely , 252 were in ruins and 197 were in need of repair .
Where memorials should exist there are instead open fields .
A trip to the " Hall of Armenian Issue with Documents " at the military museum in Istanbul reveals walls of photographs showing the mutilated bodies of Ottoman Turks , yet none of dead Armenians .
Images of the long lines of Armenians being herded out of the country , or killed along the way , have no place in this museum .
“ There are nasty stories in war times , just as you hear from Iraqis and Afghan people now .
However we cannot write history only by relying on personal experiences , ” said Cicek .
“ We should remember all casualties of the war , not only the Armenians . ”
When denial is the official policy , speaking against the preferred version of history can come at a price .
The shocking assassination of Hrant Dink , beloved newspaper editor and voice for Turkey ’s Armenians , by a 17 - year - old Turkish nationalist in 2007 had many in Turkey pondering a choice between living in silence and living in fear .
Why , almost a century after the fact , is Turkey so persistent in its refusal to acknowledge a genocide ?
“ I think that the reason is a mixture of fear of the past , a reluctance to acknowledge guilt on behalf of your fathers and a general concern about the historical effect of such acknowledgment onto the legitimacy of the state , ” said Guenael Mettraux , the author of “ The Law of Command Responsibility ” and representative of defendants before international criminal tribunals .
“ The very foundation of the state , its legitimacy , is at stake . ”
There is , perhaps , an easier explanation : after 95 years of denial it will take real political capital to come forward about both the truth and the cover -up .
“ It is a web of the government 's own spinning , and they may well feel caught in it , ” said Smith .
But while Armenians can hardly be expected to set aside their bitter memories , many in the international community are beginning to question the tactic of congressional campaigns .
The long - dormant debate over the crimes of Turkey ’s past is pushing its way to the surface more strongly than it has at any time since the modern republic was founded in 1923 .
Last December , a group of Turkish intellectuals circulated a petition that apologized for the denial of the massacres .
" My conscience does not accept the insensitivity showed to , and the denial of , the Great Catastrophe that the Armenians were subjected to in 1915 , " the brief statement said .
" I reject this injustice and for my share , I empathize with the feelings and pain of my Armenian brothers and sisters .
I apologize to them . "
Just last week , Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met with Turkey 's Washington - based diplomats to relay orders for the envoys to start “ opening dialogue ” with certain Armenian Diaspora groups in the United States and Canada .
With Turkey ’s budding civil society beginning to question the state ’s version of the events , some worry that pressure from Congress could make the truth more elusive by stiffening the resolve of nationalists .
“ The attempt to write history with the law is a false illusion that might , if pursued , undermine the quality of justice , ” Mettraux said .
Mettraux argues that international criminal law provides for ways to criminalize the conduct of individuals who have taken part in mass atrocities , not for passing judgment on history .
Still , Demirci remembers .
Turning towards the window filled with bright sunshine , his movements seem suddenly tired .
“ I will be here , like always , ” he said simply .
Kendra on the last thread suggested a discussion of our various backgrounds and how we came to be interested in climate science .
It ’s not my normal around here but neither is arguing for the true warming effects of CO2 to be recognized by skeptics .
I think it would be interesting to hear from some of you on your backgrounds and what got you into the science .
— –
My background education is Aeronautical Engineering BS and a partial Masters , after running out of money trying to pay my way through school I left college .
So I ’m sitting at a party a couple of years ago and someone tells me something about AGW .
I told him I thought the whole thing was a political scam .
That was the end of the conversation as he agreed with me , but at the time I ’d only looked into the basics .
I thought if I ’m going to shoot off my mouth about it , I had better learn some more .
I searched the internet and started reading .
The first person I asked questions to was at RC , gavin – who I had no idea who the guy was other than he seemed to think he knew what he was talking about – answered a few questions on ground temp data .
I kept looking and reading and decided after a while to blog on it .
Blogging is like teaching , which I ’ve done a little of , in that you are forced to learn the subject better than you otherwise would before you can write a thing .
Half the people here are equally or more educated as myself in different aspects of AGW .
It was really unfortunate that one of the first things I ran into was Mann ’s 08 work .
I mean that guy stinks to high heaven and for that work to go through peer review , is absolutely unconscionable .
So instantly I ’m seeing fraud rather than stepping into uncertainty first .
I really see his work that way but there is always the possibility he ’s just incompetent .
I have a great deal of difficulty accepting that he does n’t know what he is doing .
There are too many papers of his which use bad math to create unprecedented warming .
I ’ve learned one proxy type after another for temp thanks to CA and there is n’t one single proxy which does n’t completely suck .
Despite my rocky introductions to climate science , I ’ve continued reading and have had enough background in science to know that you have to force yourself to accept results as they are .
Climate science has obviously lost that aspect of reality to politicization .
Today , my interests in climate science revolve around the math being used and the meaning of the data collected .
It ’s like I ’ve learned enough to know all I really wanted and am messing around in the corners for entertainment .
My opinion is that we do n’t have a single thing to worry about with respect to climate change .
It ’s not dangerous or controllable in any way , our technology will change whether the government gets involved or not .
The sea ice , wo n’t melt , Antarctica land ice is in no danger of melting whatsoever , we could n’t flood the Maldives from CO2 if we tried , acidification data is bogus , sheep are n’t shrinking , fish are n’t shrinking , hurricanes are n’t increasing , droughts are n’t happening , not one single disaster paper I ’ve read is true in any way whatsoever and whole sections of the IPCC report are therefore bogus – including economic impact sections .
If we created enough warming to change the climate , we might produce some flooding ( from rain ) or drought but nothing else of consequence and I ’ve seen no evidence that we are producing any measurable warming whatsoever outside of models , which are nothing but reasoned guesses by people with a bias .
The bias is created in the ( potentially correct ) assumptions of aerosols and water vapor feedback .
Most likely any warming we would experience would be entirely beneficial , opening up farm land and resources for easier usage .
Unfortunately , even if I ’m wrong , we cannot and will not stop producing CO2 in the near term and reductions with respect to the populations energy consumption ( potentially not total reductions ) will happen naturally in the next 100 years as technology improves with or without government involvement .
It is absolutely no coincidence that the single solution to global warming presented is reduction of economic output and strengthened governments .
My preferred solution to climate change is to remove any regulations on CO2 and stay the course until we need to change .
My guess is that by the time anything needs to change , it already will have done so .
So this is a bit of an open thread , I ’m curious how you all got interested in climate science and what you ’ve learned since starting the adventure .
The Big Insurance Scam
I recently received a scathing email from a banker regarding my views on insurance .
The banker said that I must be living in another world than the rest of humanity because I think that the insurance industry is one of the biggest scams to face the modern world .
Well I do live in another world at times … but I do n’t think his disgust with me on this issue is well founded .
First , I feel it is important to divide the logic behind insurance from society ’s current implementation of insurance .
It ’s important to separate them because I want to make it clear that the reasons behind insurance are wise … and I do not dispute the value of creating a safety net in the form of insurance .
The problem lies in the way insurance companies do their business .
The basic concept of any insurance is this .
You know that this world is precarious .
You know that there are no guarantees for safety in health , finances or any other commodity .
You know that many of the factors involved in the continuation of your safety are beyond your control , and even those factors within your control are fallible simply because no one is perfect .
So , wherever possible and reasonable , you should fortify yourself in the event of calamity .
In ancient times insurance was carried out in the form of storing grain for winter months .
In fact , we still do that … but our minds have long forgotten how precarious harvests are .
The logic behind preparing for unknown disasters is not in dispute .
What ’s to be disputed is that marketing strategies mixed with political tinkering have not only covered basic truths of reality from many people ’s minds , it has also created a system that encourages increases in the cost of several industries .
Some of those industries , such as the auto industry , are areas where the average American is forced to pay insurance companies for services they often never use .
The blanket over many eyes is the false security insurance provides .
Being prepared for disaster is important … but there is a line beyond which a levelheaded strategist wo n’t go because the frequency of disasters is so low that paying to defeat a phantom risk is too costly .
There are an infinite number of disasters that could happen at any moment … but most never happen because of intelligence and order .
If you want to prepare for them all you will end up spending one hundred percent of your time planning to defeat the infinite list of tragedies that could come your way .
And then after all that you can have a heart attack and die .
Again , I ’m not arguing that being prepared and having a plan to deal with tragedies is wrong .
But the insurance companies want you and me to believe that they will protect you from tragedy — when in reality there is absolutely nothing insurance companies can do to protect you from tragedy because they have no bearing on the actions you take in your life .
They know that they ca n’t do anything about it … but they market their services as a form of protection .
Consider auto insurance .
A drunk driver slams into you .
Insurance had nothing to do with the other motorist getting drunk … or with you being on the road that night .
And if you die … there is nothing that the insurance company can do about it .
The logic is then turned to say that you and I need to carry auto insurance to protect other drivers from us .
Again … there is no protection .
Carrying the insurance does not do anything other than help defray the cost or repairing the damages after the fact of tragedy .
Of course this is how it works … but marketing schemes continue to make the insurance seem like a protection from disasters .
Health insurance companies are scams too because they put it into everyone ’s mind that we are entitled to living past one hundred years old ; they also increase the cost of health care because of the plans that pass covered patients ’ bills onto insurance companies … allowing hospitals to charge extortionately higher for medications that would otherwise cost much less .
One manual on reducing hospital costs stated " Hospital costs for medications are notoriously high . ”
One of the recommendations offered ( buying these medications with insurance plans ) displays the mental block that Americans have with this issue — they assume that they are getting the medications cheaper because of insurance when in reality the practice allows pharmaceutical companies and hospitals to raise the cost of medications and treatments … a cost that is passed back to the insurance companies and then right back into the consumer ’s lap .
Some types of insurance companies are even forcing doctors to close shop — as in the case of obstetricians that can’t keep up with the rising premiums in malpractice insurance .
Insurance companies are businesses .
They exist to make a profit .
There ’s nothing wrong with that .
But they play a major role in raising the cost of living and in sustaining the increase in cost .
Those industries that have snuck through the back door of the legislative process ( like auto insurers ) have created a monster in the system that is a giant parasite on the American economy — private companies are essentially taxing the American public .
Furthermore , the floor seems to fall out when you consider another fact .
In times of major disaster , when a company , family or individual needs the help most — when they really expect all the expense into insurance companies to pay off — insurance companies find ways to fall short on their promises .
One shady tactic of insurance companies is in the fine print of many insurance plans .
Oftentimes the consumer was never educated by the insurance companies about lasering , a strategy insurance companies use to limit financial loss by limiting their financial responsibility in costly claims .
Lasering allows insurance companies to limit their payments on partially self - funded companies when , for example , the insurance company knows an employee has an expensive illness .
The recent barrage of hurricanes in Florida is another case in point .
Insurance companies struggled to pay for all the damages .
Who came in to clean up the mess ?
The U.S. Government has already spent more than $ 1.8 billion in aide on Florida .
Of course … insurance companies paid their part …
Economy in News reported that the hurricanes that hit Florida could cost the insurance industry $ 50 billion all told .
One company , it said , " might even have to dip into its reserves to cover the costs . ”
That means a rise in premiums .
That means the cost of living goes up .
It will go up for the big picture , not just for the home owners of Florida ; the cost of the disasters cannot be paid for from the funds pulled from Florida alone — it ’s the homeowners living in areas with extremely low chances of disaster that pay a large portion of this bill .
In other words … people who do n’t need insurance are paying for the tragedies of those who do need insurance .
Entrepreneur.com reported that " small and midsize companies see health - care premiums outpace the cost of their employees ’ claims ” .
The cost is going up … but the services are not .
Tragedy is not something to flirt with .
Being prepared to handle it is wise .
Requiring financial responsibility among people partaking in hi-risk activities that can harm others is prudent .
I do n’t recommend banning insurance companies .
But I do recommend boycotting most of them and pressuring lawmakers the open their eyes to the cutthroat scams being pulled on the American people by the current insurance industry .
To end , I want to quote from the banker who felt offended by me .
He wrote , " Insurance companies never know who the next driver is that may cause a 10 car pile up and cost them $ 1,000,000 .
It could be you . ” I suppose that ’s true .
They also do n’t know who the next person to steal my wallet will be ; when a meteorite will hit the USA again ; when a drunken tanker captain will smash into shore again ; when a swarm of killer bees will attack a bus full of children ; when a rogue politician will start a war .
There are many things that insurance companies do n’t know .
But there are a few things they know well … like getting your money .
See , insurance companies are good at eating the pie and having it too .
Actually , they are good at taking your money and keeping it too .
The odds are that you ’ll never see a return on the " investment ” you ’ve put into the security of insurance companies .
Cyborgs – human beings merged with machines — are a staple of science fiction .
Star Wars ’s Darth Vader , Star Trek ’s Borg , and the Cybermen of Dr. Who are variations on this theme – and it ’s no coincidence they ’re all “ bad guys . ”
Cyborgs symbolize one of our greatest fears : that over time , we will become so enmeshed in our technology that we lose our humanity .
The real - life application of cyborg science is far from horrifying .
Medical technology has developed implantable heart pacemakers , insulin pumps , hearing aids , and even computer chips for the brain to treat depression and Parkinson ’s disease .
In that sense , we are already on the path to becoming cyborgs .
Transhumanists believe that the development of such technology will lead one day to “ Human version 2.0 ” – an upgrade of the human body that not only eliminates many of the problems that plague us , but improves upon the basic human design .
For instance , some transhumanists envision a day when the human brain will be re-wired with computer chips , allowing us to think , learn and communicate with unprecedented speed and accuracy .
There ’s an ethical leap between using technology to help people overcome disabilities , and using it to “ improve ” healthy humans .
The 1972 science fiction novel , Cyborg by Martin Caidin , which was turned into the popular TV show The Six - Million - Dollar Man , bridges the gap by creating a cyborg superman as a life - saving measure .
The title character was a NASA test pilot who suffered traumatic injuries when his plane crashed .
His legs , left arm , and an eye were replaced with bionic parts , giving him superior speed , strength and vision .
Martin Caidin ’s novel may have been inspired by discussions taking place within the space community around that time .
NASA had considered the possibility of engineering humans , not to create super heroes , but to help us travel to the other planets and the stars beyond .
Building a Better Astronaut
Without a spacesuit , a person could only survive for about 90 seconds in the vacuum of space .
Not only does space lack breathable oxygen , but the vacuum pressure would cause the blood in your veins to bubble and expand .
Space is so cold – minus 270 C ( minus 454 F ) – you would be frozen solid in short order .
Radiation is another mode of destruction – space contains high energy gamma and X - rays , as well as the lower energy but still harmful UV .
In 1960 , Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline published an essay in Astronautics titled “ Cyborgs in Space . ”
Comparing man in space to a fish out of water , they noted that even if you could bring everything you need on your space explorations , “ the bubble all too easily bursts . ”
However , if the human body were altered to adapt to the conditions of space , astronauts would be free to explore the universe without limitation .
“ Solving the many technical problems involved in manned space flight by adapting man to his environment , rather than vice versa , will not only mark a significant step forward in man ’s scientific progress , but may well provide a new and larger dimension for man ’s spirit as well , ” the authors write .
The Clynes & Kline paper coined the term “ cyborg , ” and NASA followed up on their suggestions , commissioning a study on the topic .
“ The Cyborg Study : Engineering Man for Space ” was released in 1963 , and it reviewed the possibility of organ replacement , as well as how drugs and hibernation could be used to make space travel less stressful .
The report concluded that replacing the heart , lungs and kidneys – the organs most stressed by space travel – was not feasible with the technology available at the time .
In considering how hibernation and drugs could be used to deal with physical and psychological stress , the study ’s scope included master control over an astronaut ’s brain and body .
The current academic discussion of cyborg studies embraces an even broader view of “ cyborg ” to mean the general impact of technology on our lives .
“ You could say that cyborgization started with furs and fire , and certainly with glasses and dentures , ” says James Hughes , medical ethicist at Trinity College in Hartford , Connecticut .
Hughes is the author of the book , Citizen Cyborg : Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future .
Hughes says we should acknowledge that we are already living in the Age of the Cyborg .
This process has been gradual but steady , and as medical technology advances , more people will opt for the advantages of the latest innovations — so long as they ’re convinced the benefits outweigh the risks .
Hughes points to LASIK eye surgery as one example .
“ I continue to wear glasses , and one of the reasons is that I want to see more evidence that LASIK really works in ways it ’s supposed to , ” says Hughes .
“ I have n’t been convinced yet .
I think many people will have that reaction to sticking hardware in their brain .
Your laptop is obsolescent almost the day you buy it , so why would you want to stick something in your brain when you ’d need surgery in order to replace it ? ”
Today a surgical brain implant such as the one to treat Parkinson ’s disease is a remedy of last resort .
But if the technology was more benign , with an easier way for people to download the latest upgrade , such implants might become more common .
“ You might imagine that you could swallow a nanotech pill , and nanobots would unfold in your gut and migrate their way past the blood - brain barrier and find where they ’re supposed to go , ” says Hughes .
“ You could theoretically give them instructions , and say , ‘ It ’s time for you guys to flush out because I want the next upgrade . ’
They all die and go out in your urine , and then you take another pill . ”
Kevin Warwick , of the Cybernetic Intelligence Research Group at the University of Reading in England , is n’t waiting for the invention of medical nanobots .
He had a computer device surgically implanted in his arm in two separate experiments .
As recounted in his book , I , Cyborg , the first experiment involved a radio frequency identification ( RFID ) chip enclosed in a glass tube .
The tube was inserted under the skin in his arm , and the RFID chip communicated with a computer .
In the second , more invasive experiment , spikes on a silicon microarray were pounded directly into the median nerve in his left arm .
This 100 electrode array allowed his nervous system to receive signals from a computer .
Warwick and his colleagues performed various experiments , including operating a wheelchair , sending signals over the Internet , and human - to - human communication ( via a wire implanted in his wife ’s arm ) .
Warwick ’s nerve implant was removed after several months , after the planned experiments were completed .
Warwick says that other than tingly feelings in his fingers due to nerve fiber regeneration , he did n’t experience any unusual physical effects from the implant .
Before the experiment , he had wondered if his brain would even respond to the electrical signals .
If it did accept the signals , would it be able to translate them ?
Or would the unusual new data overwhelm his brain ?
Luckily his brain was able to make sense of the input , but when he talks about his experiment with neurosurgeons or other doctors , they often express concern .
“ Various surgeons have said I could ’ve had serious problems with putting electrical current into my nervous system that was going up to my brain , ” says Warwick .
“ Some of the signals were quite strong , because we were trying to force the brain to not ignore them .
My brain could have decided to go on holiday , or I could have gone crazy .
It ’s probably just as well I did n’t know completely the things that could ’ve gone wrong . ”
Despite such risks , Warwick sees huge potential in developing implantable computer chips .
He ’s currently trying to improve the Parkinson ’s brain implant to better predict the onset of tremors .
He also thinks computer chips could be used to bridge broken nerve fibers , bringing movement back to paralyzed body parts , but this concept remains purely speculative .
“ For a serious break or lesion , how much you can bring that into play is a big question , ” says Warwick .
“ We ca n’t see why people have n’t tried [ to use computer chips to stimulate damaged nerves ] yet , because it seems an obvious thing to try . ”
A lot of cyborg technology remains either speculative or a long way from practical implementation .
The development of artificial organs is not too far advanced from what was available when NASA commissioned its cyborg study .
Although artificial hearts and lungs are now more compact and better at the jobs they were designed for , they are used mainly as temporary replacements to help patients survive until appropriate donor organs become available .
Artificial kidneys – dialysis machines – have posed the greatest challenge , partly due to the need to filter large amounts of fluid .
In the 60s , artificial kidneys were the size of a refrigerator .
Today , the smallest devices are still not implantable , but a recent prototype can be worn as an extremely bulky utility belt .
Artificial bones , blood , skin , eyes , and even noses are now all being developed , and each could conceivably help man cope with the conditions of space .
So long as the resulting entity still had a human brain , it could be considered a cyborg rather than an android ( a robot that looks like a human ) .
However , NASA is n’t devoting any thought these days on how to build a better astronaut .
Their Human Research Program instead focuses on ways that drugs , exercise , better spacesuits and radiation shielding can mitigate the effects of the space environment on human health .
There is more discussion in the space community on how to alter entire planets to suit humans – a process called “ terraforming ” – than there is on changing man to suit space .
One reason NASA has little interest in cyborgs may be due to their focus on bringing astronauts back home safely .
Humans altered for life in space might not fare too well on Earth .
Permanent adaptation is an issue for future Mars colonists as well , since over time the weaker gravity could result in thinner bones .
While some have advocated “ one - way trips , ” with people living out the remainder of their lives on Mars , current NASA plans envision stays lasting only 500 days .
Warwick is disappointed by NASA ’s lack of research into the possibilities of a cyber - astronaut corps .
“ They ’re taking the easier option as far as public opinion is concerned , ” says Warwick .
“ It ’s certainly not the most exciting one as far as research is concerned , and hence [ not the field ] with the biggest potential .
So it ’s a shame . ”
But Hughes says that astronauts , along with all the other people on Earth , will inevitably end up with cyborg upgrades .
“ I think that we ’re all going to be engineering ourselves for various things in this century , ” says Hughes .
“ Certainly the rigors of space travel are going to require extensive bioengineering , unless we come up with some incredible material science .
So I assume that , just like the kinds of things we ’ll all be doing on Earth , astronauts will avail themselves of those things . ”
To Infinity and Beyond
Robots have been making great strides in the final frontier .
From the MER rovers , now in their seventh year of exploring the surface of Mars , to the Huygens probe on Saturn ’s moon Titan , to the Voyager spacecraft traveling to the farthest reaches of our solar system and , perhaps one day , the nearest stars , it seems that machines have us beat when it comes to exploring space .
Robots can get their energy from nuclear batteries or solar panels rather than food .
They do n’t need sleep or water or oxygen , and the long - term effect of radiation is not as destructive as it is for humans .
Setting aside the example of HAL 9000 in Arthur C. Clarke ’s story 2001 : A Space Odyssey , computers are more psychologically suited than humans to spend eternity alone in the cosmos .
NASA has several projects underway to develop better “ human - machine interfaces . ”
The goal of this research is to improve communication between people and computers , making the machines our “ avatars ” for space exploration .
Hughes thinks there will come a day when this kind of research will allow us to manipulate robots and other machines as easily and naturally as we move our own body .
“ I imagine that as soon as we have this kind of direct control over our various kinds of machines , our way of perceiving ourselves will change , just like we currently see our cell phones and cars as extensions of ourselves , ” says Hughes .
Perhaps a brain implant linking us to our robots would be the next step in space exploration , greatly reducing communication time across the vast expanse of space .
For instance , depending on where Mars is in its orbit , it takes between 3 to 30 minutes for a radio message sent from Earth to reach Mars , and then an equally long time for us to get the response .
For more distant destinations , the message relay would take even longer .
But if the theory of quantum entanglement somehow could be utilized , thought communication could be virtually instantaneous .
Warwick says that implanting computer chips in the brain to improve communication is a fairly straight - forward development , much as the telephone was the next step from the telegraph .
“ The concept of a talking telegraph was considered crazy , ” says Warwick .
“ I think there ’s an element of that [ when people consider communicating via brain implants ] , instead of seeing the scientific potential . ”
One debate in the space community is whether humans or robots should be sent to explore .
While there are compelling arguments for both sides , we must find a way to make extended human space travel feasible if we hope to survive when our Sun becomes a Red Giant star in about 5 billion years .
When this happens , our planet and all life on it will be consumed .
But perhaps by this point in the future , we may have become so merged with our machines that the “ human versus robots ” debate is moot .
In fact , that ’s the conclusion reached by scientists involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ( SETI ) .
Paul Davies , a SETI scientist at Arizona State University , says in his book The Eerie Silence that any aliens exploring the universe will be machine hybrids .
Not only are machines better able to endure extended exposure to the conditions of space , but they have the potential to develop intelligence far beyond the capacity of the human brain .
“ I think it very likely – in fact inevitable – that biological intelligence is only a transitory phenomenon , a fleeting phase in the evolution of the universe , ” Davies writes .
“ If we ever encounter extraterrestrial intelligence , I believe it is overwhelmingly likely to be post - biological in nature . ”
Hughes completely agrees that space travelers will likely be mechanical rather than organic .
“ If you ’re looking out 200 years into the future of the colonization of space , humans are probably not going to be a factor , ” he says .
The Human Element
Those who do not wish to become cyborgs ( and who do not embrace our cyborg overlords ) may become depressed by such conclusions .
One of the biggest concerns about our future as cyborgs comes out of our experience with computers .
If all our brains are connected , what happens if a computer virus is introduced ?
How will we be able to maintain our privacy if a hacker can plug into our brain ?
Will there even be such a thing as an individual identity , or will we become like ants in a colony or bees in a hive ?
Human - cyborg insect colonies may seem like science fiction , but cyborg insects are now being developed by the U.S. military ’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) .
Their “ HI - MEMS ” project inserts a computer chip into an insect pupae , and the chip becomes connected to the body as the insect develops .
“ Since a majority of the tissue development in insects occurs in the later stages of metamorphosis , the renewed tissue growth around the MEMS will tend to heal , and form a reliable and stable tissue - machine interface , ” says the HI - MEMS website .
Electrical signals could directly stimulate muscles , cells or neurons , while ultrasonic pulses , pheromones , and optical cues also could be used to control the insect ’s flight .
In this way , DARPA hopes to create unobtrusive and cheaply - made cyborg spies .
According to the HI - MEMS website , “ The intimate control of insects with embedded microsystems will enable insect cyborgs , which could carry one or more sensors , such as a microphone or a gas sensor , to relay back information gathered from the target destination . ”
While the program has created cyborg beetles and moths so far , it ’s not yet ready to release swarms of insect spies .
DARPA also has funded research to develop cyborg sharks , where smells and electrical signals are used to steer the sharks in desired directions .
Other experiments by various researchers to merge animals and machines have used pigeons , cats , and rats .
Such experiments are staples of science fiction , from the cyborg dolphin in William Gibson ’s Johnny Mnemonic to the housefly monitors in Philip K. Dick ’s Lies , Inc .
For every dystopian tale of the potential evils of science , there are just as many hopes of how science could free us from a long list of medical maladies .
The future of cyborg science likely will be a complicated mix of both good and bad outcomes .
Warwick says that scientists , who are driven to investigate for the sheer joy of discovery , do n’t spend too much time worrying about the practical results of their research .
“ I think it ’s important to be aware and to try to discuss the positive and negative sides , ” says Warwick .
“ But to be honest , you never know .
With the RFID implant that I had , which was a relatively trivial thing , I found out that a nightclub in Barcelona uses it as a fashion item to attract people to come to the nightclub .
You do n’t have to pay for your drinks ; it ’s all charged to your implant .
So there ’s always going to be something around the corner that you ’d just never imagined . ”
I want to touch on a few misconceptions that are floating around .
Since we know that progress relies on knowledge , and knowledge relies on clarity , I think it'd be beneficial to strip away some of the false notions that have attached themselves to ideas we trade in religious debate .
By scrubbing these ideas under warm soapy water we can clear away the muck that has been allowed to gather on them , and by doing so we help move the conversation along since we 'll all be armed with a higher grade of ideas .
So here we go !
“ It takes more faith to be an Atheist . ”
“ Atheism ca n't tell me how we got here , so I 'm sticking with God . ”
“ Well , Hitler and Stalin were Atheists , so belief is better than unbelief ! ”
This idea is both wrong and strange , I 'll start with showing why it 's wrong .
Atheism is not a faith position .
At all .
Not even kinda .
It 's simply the disbelief in one or more deities , or the supernatural .
And since we do n't have any evidence for believing in any of the near 10,000
Gods that humans have put forward over the years , the act of not believing in any one of them does n't require any faith at all .
Gods have never met their burden of proof and so they can be safely dismissed as a non-truth .
( as one man puts it : that which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence . )
If I told you that there was a square - circle on your head right now , and you did n't believe me , would you say that it requires faith to disbelieve ?
Of course not , since you know that a square - circle can't exist , it requires no faith at all to dismiss my assertion .
Now
If I would 've said something rational , like : “ broseph , you have some hair on your head ” – that would 've been a different story since you know hair can exist on heads .
This is like your boss telling you that since you can't breath acidic fluids , he 's going to replace you with a square - circle that claims it can .
The first problem with your boss 's thinking is pretty obvious : humans are n't meant to breathe acidic fluids , so to criticize them for not being able to is really illogical .
Atheism is n't a scientific discipline , it is n't an answer factory – it's a reply to claims of the supernatural .
If you do n't require Atheism to bake you a delicious cake , then why would you expect it to do any other task it 's not meant to do ?
Should we not believe in Judaism simply because it can't explain what 's occupying the galactic center ?
The second problem with this scenario is the choice of “ replacement ” .
Again , a square - circle cannot exist ; so when a person comes to any conclusion that requires the existence of one , we know the conclusion will fail since it relies on an impossibility .
Think of it like this : if you submit a mathematical proof that starts off by stating “ this proof assumes that 1+1 = Bacon ” , we do n't have to continue past the start since we know the proof will fail .
Saying that God explains how we got here is not much different than saying 1+1 = Bacon – they 're both wrong .
As a side - note , at least Bacon can deliver eternal life and unending bliss , can your God do that ?
Wow , really ?
First I 'd point out that Atheism was not the cause for what those two did .
Stop the internal dialogue , that was n't the reason .
Hitler and Stalin are great examples of authoritarian style of rule , and what it produces .
Secondly , to say Hitler was an Atheist is to be pretty dishonest , he never once denounced his catholicism , as a matter of fact he said he was doing “ the lord 's work ” in his book .
He rallied against secular schools demanding religion be taught , and the first deal he cut as the new leader was with the catholic church , a church that liked him enough to celebrate his birthday every year !
He talked about not only God , but about Jesus , in his speeches and in private ; and he went so far as to have “ God with us ” put on the belts of his soldiers .
I think the religious right is trying to pull a fast one on us , trying to pin the mess of their creation on other people like Atheists and socialists .
Lastly , this argument really fails and here 's why : if we grant the dishonest tweaking of causation to make Atheism the cause of what those two did , the religious really screw themselves – their body count can then be measured not in millions , or tens of millions , not even in hundreds of millions – but we soar all the way up to the one billion mark ( some say more ) .
So it seems that after some really ... creative ... tactics the arguer only manages to present a rod for his own back .
If I had the evils of religion weighing heavily on my shoulders I 'd be very humble with any talk about force and violence ; but in the highly compartmentalized mind of the average monotheist no such need exists , since their religion is only the one in their head , and things outside of their construct , like reason and evidence , often fail to penetrate .
From The Times - Picayune :
Gov. Bobby Jindal ’s chief campaign fund - raiser is recovering from injuries she suffered in a Friday night altercation with a group of people in the French Quarter , the governor ’s office said Monday .
Allee Bautsch suffered a broken leg and her boyfriend suffered a concussion and a fractured nose and jaw in the incident , which happened after a fundraising event at Brennan ’s Restaurant on behalf of the Louisiana Republican Party on Friday evening .
Jindal was at the fund - raising event at the restaurant , but was not present when the incident occurred .
Kyle Plotkin , a Jindal spokesman , said Bautsch had surgery during the weekend and is facing a recovery time of two to three months .
“ NOPD is investigating the incident and we are refraining from further comment to allow them to fully investigate and ensure justice is done , ” Plotkin said .
“ Our prayers are with Allee .
She is a strong person and we are sure she will make a speedy recovery . ”
Televangelist Kenneth Copeland faced a congressional inquiry after flying his ministry Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s tax - exempt jet to Maui and the Fiji Islands .
South Dakota Gov.
Mike Rounds has been questioned about his use of state planes for political and personal trips .
And after getting a $ 180 billion federal bailout , the insurance giant AIG caught flak for its fleet of corporate jets .

To prevent the public from seeing where they fly , all have over the years turned to a little - known program that lets private plane owners block their flights from view in the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s system for tracking air traffic .
The owners do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t have to meet any test to keep their flights secret .
They merely submit a request to the National Business Aviation Association , a trade group that lobbied to set up the program on the grounds that secrecy is justified to protect business deals and the security of executives .
But in at least some cases , the program has also served as a refuge for plane owners whoÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ve faced bad publicity , according to a review by ProPublica of 1,100 blocked planes in the program .
The list was obtained after a 15 - month public records battle in which the business aviation group sued the FAA to keep it confidential .
After a federal judge ruled that the records are public , the FAA provided the list this week .
ADVERTISEMENT
It includes aircraft registered to Fortune 500 companies such as 3 M and Tyson Foods , private real estate developers , government agencies and evangelical churches .
There are 62 Gulfstream IVs and Vs , which cost tens of millions of dollars each , 36 Learjets and two Boeing 737s .
Registered owners include :
College booster clubs and athletic programs for the University of Alabama and the University of Mississippi , who blocked flights to hide coaching searches and recruiting trips .
The CEO of Hooters , who along with other business partners , has a blocked jet to conduct surprise checks on restaurants , according to the company .
Owners of newspapers that have fought for access to public records , including Journal Enterprises , owner of the Albuquerque Journal , and Sam Zell , chairman of the Tribune Co. , which owns the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune .
How the list came to be
Use of the national airspace is generally considered public information because pilots Ã¢â‚¬â€œ whether airline captains or recreational fliers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ rely on a system of air traffic controllers , radars , runways and taxiways , lighting systems and towers that are all paid for or subsidized by taxpayers .
ADVERTISEMENT
As a result , flight data collected by the FAA in its air traffic control system Ã¢â‚¬â€œ except for military and sensitive government flights Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is public information .
Web sites such as FlightAware post the data online , allowing anyone to observe the system and follow most planes virtually in real time .
Chuck Collins , who has studied the costs of private jet travel for the progressive Institute for Policy Studies , said the public has a right to monitor such flights because taxpayers and commercial passengers heavily support business aviation .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s the use of the public commons , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ It belongs to all of us .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not a private preserve .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not a country club .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Dan Hubbard , spokesman for the business aviation association , which helps to administer the program , called the Block Aircraft Registration Request program , or BARR , said privacy is important because businesses worry that competitors could watch them , potentially disclosing deals that could move stock prices .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Our members tell NBAA that there are certain circumstances where there is a security concern , and that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s why they want to avail themselves of the BARR program , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Â  he said .
The program drew attention in November 2008 after the Big Three auto executives were criticized for taking corporate jets to ask Congress for financial help , prompting General Motors to block its flights .
ADVERTISEMENT
The business aviation group administers BARR in cooperation with the FAA , and plane owners have two options for keeping flights secret .
In one , the NBAA sends a Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ blockÃ¢â‚
¬
Â list directly to private flight - tracking sites , which are bound by agreement with FAA to hide those planes .
In the other , the NBAA sends a block list to the FAA , which hides the planes from data released to flight - tracking sites .
ProPublica obtained the latter list .
The former remains undisclosed .
FAA blocks planes at no charge and without requiring owners to prove why their movements should be kept secret .
The agency keeps only the current monthÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s block list and deletes historical records , which prevents the public from knowing who has used the program in the past .
ADVERTISEMENT
The origins of the block program trace to 1995 , when flight - tracking Web sites began to proliferate .
Several private plane groups petitioned the FAA to limit release of the data to a need - to - know basis .
The groups lobbied Congress , and in 2000 , a measure was attached to an FAA reauthorization bill requiring Web sites that use the data to hide any aircraft upon FAA request .
Laura Brown , a spokeswoman for the FAA , said the agency does nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t have the resources to evaluate the block requests and , because the business aviation association is receiving the requests , allows it to gather the information for the FAA .
Planes that drew scrutiny
In some cases , records and news accounts show that aircraft owners flew into some public relations turbulence .

In 2007 , Sen . Charles Grassley , the top Republican on the finance committee , opened an inquiry into several tax - exempt ministries , questioning whether charitable donations had paid for mansions , Rolls Royces and private jets .
Televangelist Copeland and his Eagle Mountain International Church in Newark , Texas , were questioned about layovers of church aircraft in Maui , Fiji and Honolulu .
The church told Grassley the Fiji trip was for preaching and the others so the pilots could rest .
The ministry Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Web site says the planes are used for humanitarian missions and to spread the word of God around the world .
The church has five planes on the blocked list , including a $ 17 million Cessna Citation X . Also blocked is a 1953 North American T - 28B Trojan , a vintage warplane registered to Copeland .
The ministry and Copeland declined to respond to ProPublicaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s questions .
In September 2005 , the use of state planes by South Dakota governor , Rounds , was the subject of a three - part series in the Sioux Falls Argus Leader , which found that he had flown to Republican Party functions and his sonsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ high school basketball games .
Two state planes are on the block list .
ADVERTISEMENT
Rounds , a pilot who sometimes flies himself , has advocated using state planes to save drive time and money .
Col. Dan Mosteller , superintendent of South DakotaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Highway Patrol , said he decided to block the flights to protect the governor after a routine security review .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ All the other things that go on with the governorÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s office , that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s irrelevant to me , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ My only goal is for security reasons .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
He said the blocking request was made on March 30 , 2006 .
That was the same day Rounds announced his re-election campaign .
South Dakota is nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t the only government entity on the block list .
The New Mexico Department of Public Safety , which handles flights for Gov. Bill Richardson , and the Alabama Department of Transportation also have blocked their planes .

Taxpayers subsidize system
The use of corporate jets stoked the anger of the public and even President Obama in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and government bailout as banks continued to buy planes and fly executives to resorts and vacation homes .
Firms such as AIG decided to sell aircraft and cancel purchases of new ones .
AIG spokesman Mark Herr said in an e-mail that AIG blocked its aircraft years before the meltdown .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s been AIGÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s historical practice going back years to not disclose its aircraft identifiers to the general public , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â 
Herr said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ In light of the surge in numbers and intensity of the threats directed at the physical safety of our employees , itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s only common sense to continue this practice .
Ã¢â‚¬Â

The private jet has always been an emblem in a long - running dispute about whether general aviation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the class that includes corporate jets , recreational fliers , helicopters and charters Ã¢â‚¬â€œ pays its fair share in support of the nationÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s air traffic system .
According to an FAA study released in 2007 , general aviation uses 16 percent of the air traffic system , yet pays only 3 percent of the taxes that support it .
The rest is covered largely by commercial travel .
The system , including salaries for traffic controllers , costs about $ 9 billion a year .
The business aviation association disputes the FAA study .
The associationÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s president , Ed Bolen , said the groupÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s members are rigorous in evaluating the costs of corporate jet travel versus driving or taking commercial airlines .
But often , the need to fly to multiple cities in one day , the lack of airline service to some areas or the proprietary nature of business discussions necessitates the use of company planes .

Confrontation on a landing strip
Several plane owners defended the blocked aircraft program to ProPublica .
One pilot who asked not to be identified for personal security reasons said he blocked his plane after he and a female companion were stalked by a man who had been tracking their flights .
According to the account , which ProPublica verified with the local sheriff , the stalker showed up at the pilotÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s private airstrip and confronted them as soon as they landed from a trip out of town .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The only possible way he could have followed us there was to use that tracking software , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â the pilot said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I run around with folks all the time who fly corporate jets and they have very , very good reasonsÃ¢â‚ ¬Â for privacy Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ because there are some screwballs in the world .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Gannett Co. , the media company that owns USA Today , which published a version of this article in collaboration with ProPublica , has blocked its corporate jet .
Company spokeswoman Robin Pence said Gannett shields its flights mostly for competitive reasons , such as when it looks at possible acquisitions and investments .
Security in a post - 9/11 environment also is a concern , she said .
A spokeswoman for Zell , the Tribune Co. chairman , declined to comment .
Thompson Lang , publisher of the Albuquerque Journal , said the companyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s jet has been used to ferry reporters to news events like Hurricane Katrina .
But Lang said he plans to take it off the block list .
The reason : Lang does nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t want the governor or others to be able to hide their flights , so why should he ?
RoboSapienServer
In late 2009 I bought an Arduino from the Maker Shed Store and began playing with it .
Early on I was very intrigued by two separate projects : Karl Castleton 's RoboSapienIR and the basic WebServer that came with the Ethernet library .
I decided to combine the two in order to make a web enabled robot .
RoboSpaienServer is the result .
Here 's a quick video tour ( apologies on the focus - see the screenshot below for a better view ) ...
Basic Hardware & Tools
On the arduino side , you will need :
An arduino ( obviously ) .
Personally , I have an Arduino Mega , but you can use whatever configuration you prefer .
A compatible Ethernet shield .
Since the Mega will not take the default shield without wiring modifications , I instead bought an Ethernet shield from NKC Electronics .
A prototyping board and two resistors : one at 1 Kohm and another at 1.5K .
For the robot , I purchased a RoboSapien v1 toy robot on eBay .
To modify it for this project I used :
An old extension cord for a phone cable that had both male and female ends to it ( an RJ14 to be exact ) .
However , any connector ( USB , etc ) would have done , as long as it has four wires and you have male and female ends .
To enable use of the robot when not connected to the arduino , I also cannibalized an extra male connector that I could short out .
This will be used to make a " stub plug . "
Two header pin pairs , each 1 x 2 pins .
While you can use straight wire instead , these hook up more easily into the protype board ( above ) .
Some sort of insulation for the cut wires .
While electrical tape or shrink wrap could be used , I recommend " liquid insulation , " a rubber paint you can find in the electrical section of most hardware stores .
The tools required for this project are solder , a soldering iron , and lots of patience .
RoboSapien Wiring & Modifications
The basic principle of RoboSapienIR is that you replace the existing RoboSapien infrared remote with the Arduino , sending electical impulses in lieu of the IR impulses from the remote .
This is done by tapping into the connector between the motherboard and the robot's head where the IR sensor resides .
There 's a detailed schematic below , but this section will take you step by step through the process .
I began by taking my RJ14 cable and cutting it , making sure I had at least six inches on each end .
I then removed the robot's back shell and used a soldering iron to melt a hole in the left side , symetrical with the power switch on the right .
You can then thread the cable with the female connector through the hole in the plastic casing .
The two photos below demonstrate what these modifications look like when the project is done ( the gray wire taped to the cable on the right photo is the " stub plug " to allow operation without the arduino ) .
You can zoom in on the above images by clicking on them .
There are three wires of interest in the connector from the head to the motherboard : a 3.3V power ( red ) , a ground ( black ) , and the infrared signal ( white ) .
With the cable threaded through the hole in the backshell ( you ca n't insert it afterwards ! ) , I connected the red and black wires to the same colored wires in my cable by burning away the insulation with a soldering iron and then soldering my cable 's wires directly to the undamaged wires .
However , I have since discovered at this site that you could instead pull out the motherboard , flip it over , and solder directly to solder pads .
If you have an opportunity to do this , I 'd recommend it as the wires on the connectors are relatively fragile and easy to break .
To connect to the IR signal , cut the white wire and strip some insulation from either end .
I then soldered my new cable 's green wire to the end running to the robot's head and the yellow wire to the end heading towards the motherboard .
After that , I insulated all the exposed connections with rubber " liquid insulation " paint ( the white stuff near the connector in the righthand photo above ) .
For the male end of the cable , I soldered the red and black pins to a 1 x 2 pin header and the yellow and green wires to another 1 x 2 header .
For the " stub plug , " I took the spare male connector and soldered together the green and yellow wires .
To test your wiring , put the " stub plug " into the female connector off the back of the robot and power up the robot .
This should restore the wiring to its original state and allow you to use the remote to command the robot .
If this works , insulate all exposed wires and button up the robot by replacing the backplate .
Note that the red power wire and the green wire back to the robot 's IR sensor are unused in this project .
I brought them out anyways for future projects .
Arduino Wiring
When I first tried the RoboSapienIR hack , I had a lot of difficulties .
I discovered here that while the arduino uses 5V for signals , the robosapien uses 3.3V .
The subtlety is that if your ground wiring is poor the hack will occasionally work !
To make it work properly , you will need to construct a voltage divider to convert the 5V signal to 3.3V .
Below is a schematic showing all the connections ( click to enlarge ) on both ends of the cable .
In addition to the above , I also cut a piece of plexiglass to fit the bottom of my Mega , drilled holes to match those in the Mega , and secured the two together with zip ties .
This insulates the arduino and allows me to secure it in turn to the protoype board with more zip ties .
You can see in the lefthand photo above that this makes a much more compact arrangement than having the whole thing lying around .
Arduino Software
You can now use the default RoboSapienIR sketch if you 'd like .
However , to make the web server work , download the sketch source code file RoboSapienServer.cpp and cut and paste it into a new sketch .
Be sure to modify the ip [ ] array ( line 21 ) to reflect an IP address that will work on your local LAN .
Operation
Power up the robot .
When you upload the sketch to your arduino , you should hear the robot " burp " when the code runs .
This is the signal from the software indicating that it is now in control of the robot .
This will also occur every time you reset the board .
You should then be able to connect your Ethernet shield to the local LAN and log into the webserver .
You may have to reset the board after you cable it up .
Once you log in , you should see something like the screenshot below in your browser .
You can now press buttons to move the robot's arms , make him roar or high 5 , etc .
If the robot is inactive for a period of time , it will yawn and " go to sleep " to enter a power saving mode .
Press the " Wake Up " button to get it going .
Modifications
The web server works by appending a question mark and a hexidecimal number to the back of the URL to send a command code to the robot ( i.e. " ? B1 " to wake up ) .
You can easily add more buttons or change the codes passed to the SubmitButton ( ) call in lines 280 to 302 ( I intentionally left out any movement commands because I did n't want the robot walking off the demo table I had set up for it ) .
You can modify the background color or make any modifications you might put on a normal webpage by playing with the HTML sent over the socket connection .
Just make it reflect your own sense of aesthetics .
Also , I learned from my demo at the Discovery Science Center that the buttons should be bigger if you want passersby to use the web page .
You should also change the name of the webpage to remove the " Kevin 's Webpage " titles at line 274 and 177 .
After all , it 's your webserver now !
Additional mods to the actual robosapien operation are also available .
You could modify the RSLoop ( ) ( lines 151 - 164 ) to read the IR sensor via the RSReadCommand ( ) routine so that either the web server or the remote can be used to control the robot .
You cold also program a long series of commands ( e.g. move ten steps forward , then ten back ) or add programming commands .
Also , if you do n't like the " burp " to signal the arduino has taken control , change it ( line 144 ) .
Finally , replacing the Ethernet shield with a WiFi module or leaving the server up and connected to the Internet so anyone can manipulate it ( say , with a webcam trained on your robot ) would be interesting directions to take this .
Final Thoughts
This was a pretty fun project for me and did not take all that much time to get running .
In fact , it has taken me longer to document the whole thing in this writeup than it did to do in the first place .

Despite a visibly challenging year , Electronic Arts has broken into the top companies as listed by Fortune Magazine 's 500 list , with a rank of 494
The company is currently valued at $ 6.2 billion .
After several quarters of missed estimates and high - profile restructuring -- including the closure of Pandemic Studios -- during a difficult transition to the digital space , analysts have generally agreed that the company 's efforts to realign will bear fruit this year .
This year , analysts say , EA 's fiscal year guidance may even be a little conservative .
" We see evidence that the company is not doing the samethings over and over again : lower headcount , fewer facilities , fewer games , and a growing digital business , " opined Wedbush 's Michael Pachter recently .

Mine disaster exposes the brutal reality of American capitalism
14 April 2010
In the nine days since a massive explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine in Montcoal , West Virginia claimed the lives of 29 miners , evidence has continued to accumulate demonstrating the criminality of the mine ’s operator , Massey Energy , and the complicity of the federal and state agencies that allowed the mine to continue operating despite ample warnings of an impending disaster .
Four years ago , the deaths of 12 West Virginia miners at the Sago Mine and 2 others at Massey ’s Aracoma mine prompted congressional hearings and pledges to overhaul safety procedures and demand greater accountability from coal operators .
The needless deaths of 29 miners in the April 5 explosion — the deadliest mine disaster in four decades — show that the transition to a Democratic - controlled White House and Congress has changed nothing .
Miners ’ lives continue to be wantonly sacrificed to profit .
Last Friday , President Obama announced that the Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) — headed by former United Mine Workers safety director Joe Main — would provide him with a preliminary report “ on what went wrong and why it went wrong so badly , so that we can take the steps necessary to prevent such accidents in the future . ”
Such an investigation — conducted by officials who routinely collaborate with and run interference for the coal companies — will be nothing but a whitewash .
Those responsible for the miners ’ deaths — Massey CEO Don Blankenship and other top executives — will not be held accountable , and they will be allowed to continue their deadly policies .
In his remarks , Obama quoted from a letter written by one of the miners killed in the blast , 25 - year - old Josh Napper .
The miner left the letter for his girlfriend before he left for work Monday morning , April 5 .
Obama cited the sentence : “ If anything happens to me , I ’ll be looking down from heaven to you all . ”
Obama did not comment on what this letter shows about the deadly conditions under which the Upper Big Branch miners were forced to work .
If Napper felt the need to write such a letter to his loved ones , he — like the other miners — was well aware that he was walking into a tinderbox .
Far from citing Napper ’s letter to expose the responsibility of Massey for the young man ’s death , Obama used it to promulgate the cynical propaganda of the government and the media about long - suffering miners who accept death and injury as an unavoidable aspect of life in the coalfields .
Mining , the president said , is “ a profession that ’s not without risks and danger , and the workers and their families know that . ”
The explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine , however , was not some inexplicable and unforeseen “ act of God . ”
It was the result of deliberate decisions and actions by Massey executives and government regulators who were more concerned with production and profit than the lives of miners .
In an effort to conceal this fact , Obama claimed , “ Their government and their employers know that they owe it to these families to do everything possible to ensure their safety when they go to work each day . ”
The facts show that the exact opposite is the case .
Both the government and Massey permitted operations at the Upper Big Branch Mine to continue despite repeated indications that explosive methane gas and coal dust were accumulating to unlawful and dangerous levels .
Just three days before the disaster , Josh Napper called his mother to report that the entire work crew had been sent home early because of bad ventilation .
“ I just knew that Josh in his heart knew that something was going to happen , ” said the mother , who lost a son , a brother and a nephew in the blast .
Since 2009 , MSHA officials have ordered the mine or parts of the mine to temporarily cease operations 61 times , including 7 times this year .
Last month alone , the mine received at least 50 safety violation citations , including at least 3 for failing to properly ventilate methane gas .
Safety officials found that airflow in the mine was half what was needed to prevent the buildup of methane and coal dust .
The blatant disregard for safety coincided with the tripling of production at the mine last year and a cost - cutting drive by Massey at all of its pits , which included the layoff of 700 miners , wage and benefit cuts , and regular 12 - hour shifts .
Despite the imminent dangers , MSHA took no action to close the mine .
Instead , federal regulators went through the motions of inspecting the mine and issuing safety violation citations and fines , knowing full well that the company would appeal them .
The news media and several coal state politicians have attempted to portray Massey as a bad apple in an otherwise safe and conscientious industry .
Democratic Senator John D. Rockefeller , for example , characterized Massey Energy as a “ rogue ” operator .
Massey and its CEO Don Blankenship are not aberrations .
They are true representatives — perhaps more open than others — of the business model of American capitalism .
The relations that prevail in the mines are a concentrated expression of class relations under the profit system — relations of ruthless exploitation of the majority by a small and fabulously wealthy minority , who are backed by all of the institutions of the state and official society .
While funneling trillions to Wall Street , the Obama administration has embarked on an offensive against the working class even more sweeping than that conducted by Reagan in the 1980s .
That decade saw a violent union - busting campaign against the coal miners , aimed at breaking the back of the most militant and class - conscious section of the American working class .
It was spearheaded by what was then called AT Massey Coal and by Blankenship , with the backing of the Reagan administration and state and local politicians of both parties .
The key to the defeat of the Massey miners was the treachery of the United Mine Workers ( UMW ) leadership , headed by President Richard Trumka ( now head of the AFL - CIO ) , who refused to mobilize the miners nationally and left the Massey strikers isolated , until the UMW finally called off the strike .
Today , conditions in the Appalachian coalfields resemble those of a century ago .
Miners have no organization to defend themselves against brutal exploitation and a government that is in the pockets of the corporations and Wall Street .
Under these conditions , coal companies are free to knowingly carry out , with impunity , policies that mean death and injury to workers .
All those responsible for the deaths at the Upper Big Branch mine , beginning with Blankenship , should face criminal prosecution .
This is a necessary step in a fundamental restructuring of the mining industry to guarantee the health and safety of miners , provide jobs at good wages and benefits for all who wish to work in the coalfields , and organize the industry to meet social needs , not private profit .
None of this will be carried out by appealing to the powers - that - be .
Miners and the working class as a whole can defend their interests only inasmuch as they are organized as a class to fight the corporations and their bought - and - paid - for representatives in both big business parties .
This must take a conscious political and revolutionary form , on the basis of a socialist program .
The carnage in the mines can be ended only if workers take the industry out of private hands and put it under the democratic and collective control of the working people themselves .

Astronomers keep turning up new exoplanets , and as the count rises , they keep edging closer to finding worlds like our own pale blue dot .
Astronomer Jay Farihi thinks Earth - like worlds might be even more common in the universe than previously expected , based on evidence from rocky planets few astronomers are studying :
The ones that do n't exist anymore .
Farihi's research subjects are white dwarfs .
In our galaxy , about 90 percent of stars will end their lives in this incredibly dense state once the star sheds its outer material and only the core remains .
This is the fate of our sun .
White dwarfs usually have atmospheres composed of the light elements helium and hydrogen , as the heavy elements have settled to the core .
But about 20 percent of white dwarfs are different , showing heavy elements — what astronomers call " metals " — in their atmospheres .
For decades , astronomers attributed this metallic pollution to the interstellar medium , the thin gas that permeates the space between stars .
The idea was that white dwarfs were old stars that had been on several orbits around the Milky Way and had picked up bits of the interstellar medium as they went around [ Space.com ]
.
But Farihi thinks those elements are evidence of something else .
His hypothesis : the heavy elements came not from the interstellar medium , but rather from the remains of rocky planets that once orbited the stars back in their younger days .
For a study he presented at the Royal Astronomical Society meeting in Scotland this week , he looked at 146 white dwarfs that showed calcium pollution in their atmosphere , and which have n't hung around near the interstellar medium anytime in the recent past .
If the heavy elements in these stars had come from the medium , he argues , it would 've sunk to the core long ago — it would n't be dancing around with the light elements in the upper atmosphere .
Ruling out the interstellar medium ,
Farihi says there are two possibilities : the debris could come from an asteroid belt similar to our own , which essential represents a planet that did n't form , or the pieces of a shattered planet [ Space.com ]
.
If he 's right it could be further evidence that rocky planets are rather common around stars like our sun .
The proportion could be even greater than 20 per cent , as some planetary systems might be entirely destroyed and leave no trace rather than leaving behind a debris ring to pollute their parent star [ New Scientist ]
. Farihi also argues that white dwarfs could hold secrets about long - gone watery planets , too .
He saw a lot of stars with atmospheres of nearly pure helium .
But atmospheres that showed hydrogen traces also tended to contain the heavier elements .
If the two are connected , he surmises , then the hydrogen would have come on board the same rocks as the metals , and that means the rocks could have carried water as well .

Hitler ’s Third Reich produced no great films .
Leni Riefenstahl was a brilliant innovator and superb editor , with an extraordinary gift for visual effects , but I would hesitate to call Triumph of the Will , or even Olympia great films , unless greatness can be confined to technical prowess .
Nazi Germany did not have the equivalent of an Eisenstein or Pudovkin , who still managed to create masterpieces out of political propaganda .
Perhaps this reflects a difference between National Socialism and Communism , even though Stalin was no less murderous than Hitler .
Great work can still emerge from the utopian ideal of the workers ’ paradise .
It is harder to imagine artistic excellence arising from violent racism .
D.W. Griffith ’s white supremacist movie
The Birth of a Nation is a possible exception to this rule , but this film , too , is more remarkable for its technical innovation than anything else .
The most infamous Nazi propaganda film is Veit Harlan ’s Jew Süss , made in 1940 .
It ’s a vicious reworking of Lion Feuchtwanger ’s novel about an 18th century Jewish financier , named Joseph Süss Oppenheimer , whose daughter is raped and killed by his boss , the Duke of Württemberg .
In the film , it is the sinister Jew who cheats the innocent Duke , infiltrates and corrupts the Gentile community , and rapes a pure Christian woman , who drowns herself as a consequence .
To the cries of “ Kill the jew ! ” from the baying mob , Süss is hanged in the climactic scene .
Harlan :
In the Shadow of Jew Süss a brilliant new documentary on Harlan and his legacy directed by Felix Moeller , does not dwell on Harlan ’s motivation .
Instead , it shows how the director ’s family was affected by his notorious career .
It is a brilliant exposé of the way history resonates through the generations , of the ripples that continue to emanate from one man ’s nefarious actions .
Jew Süss was a huge success in Germany .
Heinrich Himmler ordered all SS men to see it .
Veit Harlan became Goebbels ’s star director , displaying in several films his technical mastery of crowd scenes and lurid dream sequences , as well as an appalling taste for sentimental excess ( rather like Riefenstahl ’s feature films ) .
And his wife , the Swedish actress Kristina Söderbaum , had a glittering career in wartime movies as a romantic blonde heroine who almost invariably dies beautifully , usually of drowning , earning her the sobriquet Reichswasserleiche , the Reich ’s water corpse .
It is impossible to know for sure why Harlan , who had many Jewish friends and whose first wife was in fact Jewish , agreed to direct this vile piece of work .
Opportunism , perhaps ; careerism ; an attraction to power ; or perhaps he shared enough of the Nazi ideals to join the brown ranks .
Maybe it was all these things .
After the war , Harlan was tried twice for complicity in crimes against humanity .
He maintained that he had been forced to make the movie .
And twice he was let off as a mere mitlaüfer , a fellow traveler .
There is always a temptation to ascribe all oddities and misfortunes in a family to some dramatic factor in the past , but the fact that two of Harlan ’s three daughters , and one niece , married Jews is unlikely to be a total coincidence .
One of the marriages ended badly .
Maria Körber , whose acting career began in one of her father ’s films , now says that she only married a Jew because she felt sorry for what he had suffered .
The second daughter , Susanne Körber , committed suicide after her husband died .
Her daughter , Jessica Jacoby , considers herself Jewish , and writes for a German - Jewish paper .
Harlan ’s niece , Christiane , married Stanley Kubrick , who had wanted to make a film about Harlan , but never managed to get the script right .
The most intriguing member of the immediate family is Harlan ’s eldest son , Thomas , who was a keen Hitler Youth during the war , and worked with his father after the war .
But he changed his mind about everything when his father was declared innocent for the second time by a judge , who , like many German jurists at the time , had wartime blood on his own hands .
“ That did it , ” he says in the film .
“ I wanted nothing more to do with those kind of people . ”
As often happened in such cases , he became an obsessive seeker of justice , a Nazi hunter in Poland , a Communist revolutionary in Portugal and Chile , and a lifelong critic of his father .
He was the son , who took on the burden of guilt from an unrepentant father .
Old and sick himself now , Thomas declares that this burden should never be lifted .
Responsibility , he says , should be born by my children , and the children of my children , and their children , and so on and so on .
It is a frightful burden , and one can understand ( even if one cannot quite sympathize with ) the feeling of his half brother , Kristian , an architect living in Zürich , who refuses to publicly acknowledge his father ’s guilt , and is furious at what he sees as Thomas ’s betrayal .
Hearing some of his siblings talk , it is as though Thomas , and not Veit Harlan , is the main villain for exposing to the public the family ’s raw nerves .
Even Jessica Jacoby , who is anything but soft on the past , finds an excuse for her grandfather , whose propaganda played a part , however indirectly , in the murder of her Jewish grandfather .
It was Harlan ’s bitterness about being left by his first ( Jewish ) wife , Dora Gershon , that explains his collaboration with the Nazis , she believes .
But the saddest statement in the film comes from one of Harlan ’s granddaughters , Alice , who is French , lives in Paris , and does n’t even speak German ( although she looks like a propaganda picture of blonde , blue - eyed , Aryan womanhood ) .
Alice is Thomas ’s daughter .
When her grandfather ’s film was discussed in school , Alice denied that she was related , despite her surname .
She now works as a physical therapist .
Some of her patients are Jewish survivors .
She knows that she is blameless for her grandfather ’s sins .
Yet she talks about her “ tainted blood . ”
Jew Süss , and the horrors it represented , she says , has left a “ genetic trace , ” a guilt that was passed on from father to child .
Alice Harlan is utterly innocent , of course .
But the very notion of tainted blood , alas , is uncomfortably close to what stirred up all the violence in the first place .
Harlan :
In the Shadow of Jew Süss , written and directed by Felix Moeller and distributed by Zeitgeist films , will be playing at Film Forum in New York City March 3 – March 16 .
Russell Okung says playing for Redskins ' would be an honor '
With Donovan McNabb now Washington 's starting quarterback , the Redskins should attempt to finally improve an offensive line that has been among the league 's least effective in pass protection since the middle of the 2008 season .
Washington holds the fourth overall pick and has a huge hole at left tackle with the retirement of Chris Samuels .
The premier position along the line would seem to be a good place to start .
Many talent evaluators consider Oklahoma State 's Russell Okung to be the draft 's top left tackle prospect .
Okung recently visited the Redskins and we caught up with him Monday for a quick question - and - answer session .
Q : Are you familiar with the Redskins ' offensive line tradition ?
A : Yes .
They have a great tradition for O line .
And with Coach [ Mike ] Shanahan added to the mix the tradition should continue .
It would be an honor playing for the Redskins and Coach Shanahan .
Q : How was the whole visit process ?
Was it fun , tiring or both ?
A : It was an honor to be invited to so many teams , including the
Redskins .
Q : What 's the most difficult part of playing left tackle ?
A : There is a challenge each week to face the opposition 's best players but something that motivates me to be the best I can be .
Q : What 's the best part of playing left tackle ?
A : Playing the best players on the opposing teams every week .
Q : Are you familiar with NFL zone blocking and power blocking schemes ?
A : I am familiar and a fan and feel that my skill sets can benefit any type of blocking scheme in the NFL .
At the end of the day , I have to block the man in front of me .
Q : Is there a current or former player you 've studied closely ?
A : Joe Thomas of the Browns .
The fact that he plays hard every week , every game and every play .
In the Zone
In the Redskins Tailgate Zone today , Matt " I prefer Bobby " McFarland is leading a discussion of just where Jason Campbell should be playing in the fall .
In testimony before the US House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , Dr. Dean Wyatt testified as to how the agency supports unhealthy practices at the national slaughterhouses and endangers the nation 's meat food supply .
Dr. Wyatt , a public health supervisory veterinarian with the USDA 's Food and Safety Inspection Services ( " FSIS " ; www.fsis.usda.gov/), testified to numerous instances where FSIS executives overruled his and other inspectors ' citations of slaughterhouses ' abuses endangering the safety of the nation 's meat supply .
For example , Dr. Wyatt recounted such abuses and acts of cruelty as :
cows being shot multiple times in the head regardless of regulations requiring immediate unconsciousness with a single bullet ;
calves being dragged and thrown , while others were deprived of food and water resulting in death from dehydration and starvation ;
conscious pigs shackled and stabbed on the slaughter line despite rules that they be stunned and unconscious before butchering ;
pigs being trampled by one another while being unloaded from a truck by a worker with a paddle ;
and a frustrated employee hitting a pig in the face 8 - 12 times .
Dr. Wyatt also testified that he was directed by his superiors to " drastically cut back " the time spent on ensuring that animals destined for food were treated humanely .
In fact , according to Dr. Wyatt , he and other inspectors were chastised , reprimanded , and demoted for reporting violations .
Dr. Wyatt was also threatened with termination .
Prior to his testimony , Dr. Wyatt had issued orders to shut down of Vermont 's Bushway Packing on three different occasions .
Each time , Dr. Wyatt 's superiors overruled his orders and allowed the plant to reopen without it addressing the underlying health and humane issues .
Subsequently , in October 2009 , the Humane Society of the United States video - recorded the same instances of inhumane abuse at Bushway triggering a flood of calls for reform of the industry ( www.humanesociety.org/news/news/2009/10/calf_investigation_103009.html).
Dr. Wyatt 's testimony coincided with a report from the Government Accountability Office reprimanding FSIS for its lax enforcement of the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act ( " HMSA " ; uscode.house.gov/download/pls/07C48.txt ) .
FSIS was also reprimanded for lacking a comprehensive hiring strategy , as well as a lack of clarity in guiding and training inspectors .

FACEBOOK COMMENTS :
Word from New Zealand Zimbabwe is that a religious sect there -- which believes in prayer over vaccinations -- may be responsible for the deaths of over one hundred children from measles .
I believe people have the right to practice their religious beliefs ... up until they start to hurt others .
It has been proven over and again that prayer does nothing to heal disease over the placebo effect , while vaccinations have saved hundreds of millions of people .
That 's math I can do pretty easily .
If this story is true , I certainly hope that the people involved are introduced to the inside of a jail cell for a long , long time .
They can happily pray there all they want , and on the outside those children can get the vaccinations that will save their lives .
Margaret , please tell Howard that I love him because he loves you .
But that is about all the reaching across the aisle that I can handle .
A few years back , millions of people across this nation and across the globe marched for peace .
George Bush ignored us and we had to endure his lazy ass being in the White House for eight years .
So now a black man named Barack Obama , elected by the will of the people , has decided to fight for the poor , and work for world peace … and a bunch of white guys who think Fox really is News just ca n’t stand it .
Well , they can kiss my ass because I am tired of their belly aching .
This is exactly how our political system works .
Sometimes your party is in and sometimes it is out .
Your party is currently out .
So shut the hell up and deal with it .
Now do n’t get me wrong .
I ’m all for a group of disgruntled citizens banding together to form a third political party because they do n’t feel represented by the other two .
But let ’s be honest – this bunch of idiots does n’t like that a black man is the most powerful man on the globe .
I wonder if they know that , while 78 % of the world is not white , only 13 % of the United States is black .
So they can relax .
Barack and Michelle most likely will not be buying the house next door .
Tea Party members should listen up .
As long as Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann are your torchbearers , you do n’t have much credibility with me .
One echoes between the ears and the other is 12 shy of a dozen .
You honestly want me to think that your biggest issue is the cost of healthcare reform ?
You sat idly by while Bush squandered billions on a failed war , but all children having health insurance is too much to handle ?
That ’s your beef ?
You realize , of course , that some of those children are white , do n’t you ?
Please .
You might not be wearing hoods , but your misspelled signs are one step shy of a burning cross .
You should be ashamed of yourselves .
Trust me .
It ’s going to be eight long years for you Tea Party members .
But we survived Bush and you ’ll survive Obama .
I mean it .
Really .
RICHMOND , Va. ( AP ) — Virginia ’s attorney general has advised the state ’s public colleges that they do n’t have the authority to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation , saying only the General Assembly has that power .
The letter sent by Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli to state college presidents and other officials Thursday drew swift criticism from Democrats and gay rights activists .
Cuccinelli said the legislature has repeatedly refused to exercise its authority .
As recently as Tuesday , a subcommittee killed legislation that would have banned job discrimination against gay state employees .
“ It is my advice that the law and public policy of the Commonwealth of Virginia prohibit a college or university from including ‘ sexual orientation , ’ ‘ gender identity , ’ ‘ gender expression , ’ or like classification , as a protected class within its nondiscrimination policy , absent specific authorization from the General Assembly , ” Cuccinelli wrote .
The Republican advised college governing boards to “ take appropriate actions to bring their policies in conformance with the law . ”
Jon Blair , chief executive officer of the gay rights group Equality Virginia , said Cuccinelli ’s “ radical actions are putting Virginia at risk of losing both top students and faculty , and discouraging prospective ones from coming here . ”
C. Richard Cranwell , state Democratic Party chairman , said Virginia ’s colleges and universities were more than capable of setting policies that work for them “ without meddling from Ken Cuccinelli . ”
The attorney general said his letter merely stated Virginia law , which prohibits discrimination because of “ race , color , religion , national origin , sex , pregnancy , childbirth or related medical conditions , age , marital status , or disability , ” but makes no mention of sexual orientation .
Cuccinelli said the criticism was coming from people who have been frustrated in their attempts to change the law .
“ None of them suggest our reading of the law is wrong .
It ’s people who do n’t like the policy speaking up because it ’s their opportunity to go on the attack , ” he said .
The American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia legal director Rebecca Glenberg said colleges are bound by U.S. Supreme Court decisions not to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation .
A spokesman for the Family Foundation of Virginia , which has opposed expanding state anti-discrimination policies to protect gays , said the criticism of Cuccinelli ’s action is unwarranted .
“ My understanding is all he ’s done is essentially ask the universities to follow the law , ” spokesman Chris Freund said .
“ It ’s a little perplexing to see people respond the way they have . ”
Virginia ’s last two Democratic governors , Mark Warner and Tim Kaine , signed executive orders barring state agencies from discriminating in hiring , promotions or firing based on sexual orientation .
Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell , who took office in January , removed protections based on sexual orientation from his anti-discrimination order .
As attorney general in 2006 , McDonnell said Kaine exceeded his constitutional authority by extending protections to gays .

I liked Heavy Rain !
Really liked it , actually .
Funny thing is , I enjoyed the three short cartoons found within the game a lot more .

I 've been meaning to poke around for these for a couple of months now , and watch them as their creators had originally intended ( instead of on a small screen within a video game ) , and on a rainy Saturday morning here have finally found the time to do so .
So here we go !
There are a few scenes in Heavy Rain where you 'll find TV sets .
When you encounter them , you 'll find that each can be turned off or on .
When on , they 're playing not some drab news report , or a noire crime thriller , but ... colourful , light - hearted cartoons .

They not only make for a pleasant break from the dreary , serious tone of the game , but are amazing works of art in their own right , each the product of a team of students from France 's Gobelins school of art .
So let 's take a closer at them !

The most memorable of the three is probably Pyrats , the cartoon playing during a pivotal scene at Ethan 's home early in the game .
Produced for the 2006 Annecy international animation festival , it 's the work of Yves Bigerel , Bruno Dequier , Ben Fiquet , Nicolas Gueroux , Julien Le Rolland and Gerard Labady .

Amazing , no ?
It 's quite a unique occurrence to find stuff like this sprinkled throughout a game , especially when it's not some kind of marketing or cross-promotion stunt , so hopefully the next time Heavy Rain creator David Cage and his team at Quantic Dream sit down to make a game , they can do it all over again .

Links to pornographic websites have been posted on the website of Family First Senator Steve Fielding .
The links , in Russian , were posted on a public forum section of the senator 's website in February , but were not detected until a northern Tasmanian man alerted the ABC .
Senator Fielding wants the Australian Federal Police to investigate the links .
He says he is disturbed by the breach as some of the links are connected to Russian websites that involve children .
" From what I 've been told - I have n't seen the sites that have been referred through to - they are sites that I do n't think anyone should be really viewing or actually seeing , " he said .
" We 're gong to be referring it through to the Australian Federal Police . "
Senator Fielding says the breach strengthens his case for the tighter regulation of internet content .
" Look I do n't know what drives people to do this sort of thing , " he said .
" It is disturbing .
But I suppose this is the reason why we do need to have some sort of classification , some sort of filtering , and I do know that is controversial . "

Flash is going through a pretty tough time right now .
Apple 's Steve Jobs , reportedly , hates it .
Consumers seem to think it 's bloated and unsafeat least that 's the commonly held wisdom .
For me , though , Flash is one of the Web 's more sublime technologies , one I 've known and used for more than 15 years .
It was 1994 or 1995 and I was attending Internet World in San Jose , CA .
Back then it was a tiny show , with embarrassingly small booths .
In one row ( and there very well may have been only one row ) , there was a little company called Future Wave .
It was showing off something called Future Splash , which allowed you to create surprisingly sophisticated , for its day , Web animations based on Bezier artwork .
Up until then , essentially , Web cartoons were GIF animations .
As an amateur artist , I was immediately smitten .
The company was so tiny , but I knew it could be a game changer .
It came out with a few updates .
Then Macromedia bought them and changed the name of the product to Flash .
Over the years , Flash 's impressive animation capabilities became almost secondary to its programmability and its ability to deliver online video .
During this time , Macromedia was swallowed up by Adobe , which worked hard to make Flash an even richer platform .
Most recently , Adobe introduced Air , which allows Flash applications to run offline and outside the browser .
Over all , it 's quite the success story .
Yet , these days , Adobe spends as much time defending Flash as it does promoting and developing it .
Adobe 's Flash is under fire from Apple and even the people who use it every day .
Pillorying Flash is actually nothing new .
Reports of its sluggishness , negative impact on system performance , and security issues have been around for years .
The difference now is that people are offering up HTML 5 has a catch - all replacement for Flash , even though this is something of a false choice .
Flash is a platform for building online and offline applications .
HTML 5 is the next phase in Web site building development .
This version will add , most notably , tags for audio and video , but it 's not for building anything outside of a Web browser .
The introduction of a video element ( along with audio ) to HTML , however , is seen as significant .
For the first time , HTML would support video playback on its own , without the use of plug-ins ( Flash is still a plug - in that does not always ship with PCs and must be updated regularly ) .
So , people have fixated on the idea of HTML supplanting Flash , and they seem to be using this to fuel their growing displeasure with the once - beloved platform .
I asked Adobe 's Group Manager for Flash , Adrian Ludwig , about this antipathy .
Ludwig indicated that consumers forget that their favorite online services are built almost entirely on Flash .
" What do they say when you say Picnik ?
What do they say when you say Mint.com ? " said Ludwig .
As for HTML 5 overtaking Flash , " The Idea of one winning and one losing is not how the Web works . "
He 's right of course , which is why Apple 's insistence on leaving Flash out of the iPhone , iPod touch , and , now , the iPad makes so little sense .
HTML 5 will rise ( as HTML 4 did before it ) .
In fact , it 's very possible that HTML 5's native video playback abilities may become more prevalent .
On the other hand , HTML 5 still needs to use video compression / decompression algorithms to play video .
It can use free open source ( Ogg , which Flash does not support ) , but most people are not encoding video in that format .
It also supports the far more popular H.264 ( as does Flash ) , but it 's not free and someone ( read : you ) may end up having to pay .
Not that any of that really matters .
At this stage , it would make the most sense for Apple and everyone else to support Flash and HTML 5 , since it 's likely that no one will stop using the Flash format any time soon .
So what 's Apple 's game ?
The reports of Steve Jobs appearing here , there , and everywhere ; bad - mouthing Adobe Flash have become like Yeti sightings no one knows if they 're 100 percent real .
Apple neither confirms nor denies , but the consistency , persistence , and frequency of these reports is enough to spawn endless discussion .
Clearly , Apple is trying to nudge Flash asideat least in its mobile products in favor of virtually any other Web multimedia platform .
The odd thing is that Steve Jobs and Apple act as if the world has already changed the company can deliver products without Flash support and it's no problem for anybody .
Meanwhile , iPhone and iPod touch owners surf to Web sites where the lack of Flash support is frustratingly apparent .
What would Apple gain if there is no Flash ?
Does QuickTime rise up and take the online video lead ?
Unlikely .
Maybe Jobs thinks
Flash is simply unnecessary .
Apple can deliver virtually any kind of mobile experience thanks to the hundreds of thousands of available apps , but folks want to access a Flash - driven Web site , they 're out of luck .
Can HTMLs 5 take Flash 's place ?
No .
And , what 's worse is that it seems like Steve Jobs does n't really understand why people are using Flash .
Someone needs to tell him that ignoring Flash wo n't make it go away .
And why should it ?
I contend that Flash is a good platform .
It drives countless Web sites and online and offline apps , including one of my favorites TweetDeck ( Essentially , I live inside this Twitter utility . ) .
Others may complain of system or security issues , but I 've never experienced them .
Flash has come a long way since its animation - only days as Future Splash , and I really hope it does n't go anywhere except forward .
FLAGSTAFF , AZ— Despite receiving a much - anticipated good night 's rest , local man Arthur Baldwin awoke from eight uninterrupted hours of sleep Monday to the realization that he was still out of shape , lonely , and generally dissatisfied with his life .
" Huh , " said Baldwin , who at 7 a.m. found himself slightly more alert than usual but remained $ 55,000 in debt and trapped in a toxic , dead - end relationship .
" I still hate my job and I still feel like shit .
What time is it ?
Fuck . "
At press time , Baldwin had decided to return to the only thing that ever did bring him pleasure in life , Afghani brown tar heroin .
A New Silent Corporation is a six - piece post - rock band from Thiene , Vicenza , Italy .
The band refers as their influences bands like Mogwai Nine Inch Nails and Callisto .
Their debut album " " Everything Is Exactly as It Seems " released in 2009 .

I SOMETIMES slip and call my ex-husband “ my husband . ”
It ’s a bad habit , and a little embarrassing , this lack of clarity .
Especially because our breakup was brutally clear : one night nearly six years ago , Chris looked at me from his usual spot on the sofa and said , with a wave of his hand , “ I ’m done with this . ”
There were no months of trying to save our decade - long marriage .
No tortured fights about staying together for the sake of our 10 - month - old son .
He simply waited an appropriate grace period from his first pronouncement — waiting for me to be done trying , as he put it — then packed his things and moved out .
And yet , he never really left .
Two or three nights a week when I come home from work or an evening out , Chris is sitting at my dining room table , eating dinner or working at the computer , having entered with his own key and having made himself at home in the apartment that my son and I moved into after the divorce .
If he orders food , he ’ll sometimes get me my favorite nachos .
He set up my computer system so that I have wireless access throughout the apartment ( which works for him as well , of course ) .
He installed my stereo and advises me on all electronic purchases .
And when I go away on business trips , he moves back in , for four or five days at a time , to take care of our son .
His toothbrush sits in my toothbrush cup .
Next to my boyfriend ’s toothbrush .
You can see how things sometimes get confusing .
Four wheels at the front
The Tyrrell P34 was the first of what would become a minor craze for six - wheeled F1 cars .
The P ( for Project ) 34 had four wheels at the front that were about the size of casters and were supposed to cut back on drag .
The P34 achieved solid results during the 1976 season and picked up first and second at that year 's Swedish GP .
In 1978 , however , the Tyrrell was hampered by Goodyear 's failure to design decent tiny tyres and the project was scrapped .
The FIA subsequently banned four - wheel steering systems and later , possibly fearing some automotive equivalent of the millipede , stipulated that cars must have four wheels .
Four wheels at the back
The March 2 - 4 - 0 is possibly the only formula one car ever named for the benefit of train - spotters .
Designed by Robin Herd , the vehicle was built in 1976 and tested early in 1977 .
The 2 - 4 - 0 had four 10in wheels at the rear that increased traction and gave it better aerodynamics than the Tyrrell P34 .
Financial problems led March to scrap the idea but Scalextric liked it so much that it issued a slot - racing model , allowing fans to see the car race in 1/32nd scale at least .
In 1982 Williams tested their own 2 - 4 - 0 car , the FW08B .
Unfortunately for them the FIA had by then banned four - wheel drive systems and it was never allowed to race .
Big old fan
The Brabham BT46 had what its designers claimed was a revolutionary air - cooling system in the form of a massive , whirling fan mounted at the rear of the engine .
The fact that the fan also created a massive downforce that practically stuck the car to the track was a bonus .
Nikki Lauda won the 1978 Swedish GP in a BT46 but the FIA banned it before it could race again .
Giant rear - view mirror
Ever the innovators , March brought out the Eifelland Type 21 in 1972 .
That year the team were co-funded by a German caravan - maker and the giant rear - view mirror that stuck up on a three - foot stalk above the driver 's head certainly looked like the kind of thing you might see on a vehicle creating a 20 - mile tailback on a Devon road on bank holiday Monday .
The mirror was unceremoniously buried , possibly in an unmarked grave , after a single race .
Hammerhead front spoiler
Completing the hat - trick of mad March hare - brained schemes , though it preceded the others , is the 1971 ovoid , oversize front spoiler , above , that appeared on the 711 .
The aerodynamic device was designed by Frank Costin and was officially named the Spitfire , though many adopted " the tea tray " .
Ronnie Peterson , despite driving with this ungainly thing stuck in front of his car managed to finish second in the drivers ' championship but it had gone by the following season , possibly commandeered by March 's laundry section as an ironing board .
Twin radiators
Proof that even the marque of the prancing horse has been stuck on some unsightly monsters in its time , this 1973 quirk from an increasingly desperate Ferrari design team featured twin radiators .
The arched shape gave the front of the car the look of a skull on a heavy metal album sleeve .
Officially the car was named the 312b3 but it has gone down in history as the Spazzaneve , Italian for snowplough .
If there had been a North Pole GP , it would have coasted it .
As there was n't , the design was junked .
Huge air - intake
In 1976 the French car maker Ligier produced the JS5 , the most noticeable feature of which was a massive air - intake that towered over the driver like a gigantic vacuum cleaner and threatened to suck his helmet off .
Fortunately for aesthetes the JS5's vast protuberance was banned after three races .
Ligier continued in F1 until 1998 but nowadays concentrate on micro-cars powered by moped engines .
Grass box
That 's what it looked like anyway .
Once again those blue - sky thinkers at March were responsible , fitting a gigantic box - like rear wing to Vittorio Brambilla 's car at the British GP in 1975 .
Strangely it never caught on , possibly because hover - mowers were all the rage in those days .
Twin brake pedals
The idea of having more than one brake pedal was first trialled in the JPS Lotus 9 back in 1974 .
It did not get any race usage , though , until 1997 .
That year McLaren sneakily installed a second , left - foot brake pedal that applied the brake to one tyre only giving a distinct advantage when cornering .
The second pedal was spotted by eagle - eyed reporters and instantly dubbed the " fiddle brake " .
Technically it was not illegal but after much whining from other teams the FIA banned it at the Brazilian GP in 1998 .
Barge boards
The Arrow came fitted with barge boards , two lumps of carbon fibre that stuck out behind the front axle .
Sadly these were designed to add stability like the movable keels on Dutch sailing barges and were not used to barge rival vehicles off the track in the manner of Steve McQueen in 1968 's Bullitt .
Despite their complete dullness barge - boards made a re-appearance in the 1990s .
Ten things to make Formula One better
1 Large piles of cardboard boxes to be left at random points on the circuit like in Starsky and Hutch
2 Two men carrying a large sheet of glass or a piano to cross the track at regular intervals during the race
3 Races to start with the drivers leaping into their cars from an outside fire escape
4 All circuits to feature a level crossing and a thundering Amtrak - style goods train
5 Vampires .
Hugely fashionable these days , F1 would clearly benefit from the odd pale - faced bloodsucker ( What d'you mean , ' Like Bernie Ecclestone ' ? )
6 All circuits to feature at least one busy intersection which the drivers must cross while the light is on red
7 All circuits to feature at least one unfinished fly - over and / or bridge
8 Direction of race to be altered at least twice at random intervals leading to handbrake turns , dead stops , collisions with pursuing police vehicles
9 Zombies – well known to improve any game
10 F1 cars to be followed by a gradually increasing number of police vehicles and a helicopter from which a Texan state trooper in mirrored shades shouts through a megaphone
Introduction
This paper describes the design of a digital macro in a mixed - signal ASIC .
The macro was designed using MyHDL , an open - source package that makes it possible to use Python as a hardware description language ( HDL ) .
The ASIC itself implements a multi-channel sensor interface .
This is a high volume application in which reliability and cost are of prime importance .
An image of the ASIC is shown below .
The digital macro is the standard cell block located at the top left area of the die .
Using MyHDL for digital design is an innovative and unconventional approach , quite unlike today 's mainstream design flows that are based on Verilog or VHDL .
Nevertheless , several successful MyHDL - based FPGA projects have been reported recently .
However , the author believes that the present paper represents the first report of the use of MyHDL for the design of a fully processed ASIC product .
The paper begins with an overview of the project organization , the digital macro functionality , and the MyHDL - based design flow .
Then the advantages of MyHDL are discussed based on the experience from the present project .
Project organization
The term mixed - signal design means that both analog and digital blocks are combined on a single silicon die .
Therefore , analog and digital design share a number of goals such as minimizing area and power consumption .
However , the implementation techniques and the associated complexity of the two disciplines are fundamentally different .
Analog design deals with the interactions between electronic devices such as transistors and capacitors , and with physical effects in silicon .
Digital design , in contrast , is mostly concerned with logical behavior .
Successful mixed - signal design requires analog and digital design teams that are strong in their own discipline , but equally strong in understanding the needs of the other team and capable of efficiently interfacing with it .
In this project , this challenge was met through a partnership between an analog design company , ICSense , and a digital design company , Easics .
This partnership has delivered a number of successful mixed - signal design projects in the past and will be strengthened further in the future .
The architectural definition , RTL design , and RTL verification of the digital macro was carried out by the present author .
He is a founder and director of Easics , and currently works as a consultant .
Digital macro functionality
The digital macro controls the operation of the chip , and performs a number of data processing functions .
To give an idea of its complexity , an overview of its functional blocks is presented :
Block Functionality SPI interface & registers External controller based on an SPI interface , with corresponding registers .
OTP controller Interface to an on-chip One Time Programmable ( OTP ) memory .
Translates a number of high - level commands into the low - level serial memory interface .
Decimation filter Digital decimation filter , applied to the data from the analog to digital convertor ( ADC . )
Master controller Controller of the overall schedule of the chip operations , depending on the operation mode .
Data transfer Bit-serial transmitter of CRC - protected measurement data for all channels .
Has a mode to send out OTP memory bits .
Supports 4 data rates .
Analog control Block with control signals for the on-chip analog circuitry .
In addition , the macro contains a significant number of muxes and addional registers to enhance controllability and observability for testing purposes .
Digital design flow
The standard digital design was modified on a number of points to accomodate the use of MyHDL .
The following is an overview of the design phases :
Phase Description Tools Deliverable Architecture definition Design partitioning ; clock , reset and test strategy Word processor , calculator Architecture definition document RTL design RTL coding for all modules Editor MyHDL RTL code RTL verification Test bench coding and simulation Editor , MyHDL simulator Test suite in MyHDL Conversion Conversion to mainstream HDLs MyHDL convertor , Verilog & VHDL simulators VHDL RTL code , Test suite in Verilog & VHDL Synthesis RTL synthesis and test insertion VHDL synthesis tool Verilog gate level net list Gate - level verification Run test suite on gate level Verilog gate level simulation Sign - off to layout
The text items in italics mark the differences when compared with a conventional design flow .
In particular , the deliverable of the RTL design phase is MyHDL RTL code , which is is verified using the MyHDL simulator .
The main difference is an additional Conversion phase .
In this phase , MyHDL code is automatically converted to both Verilog and VHDL .
In this way , a MyHDL - based approach can be transparently integrated in a traditional design flow .
In particular , a designer willing to experiment can test the waters by using MyHDL to design a single module , convert it , and proceed within his familiar and trusted design flow .
As can be expected , the conversion process is subject to a number of limitations .
However , the convertible subset of MyHDL is much larger than the RTL synthesizable subset of Verilog and VHDL .
In particular , it is also possible to convert relatively complex test benches .
This was done in this project to convert the entire test suite to Verilog and VHDL .
MyHDL advantages
Introduction
Many designers are happy with Verilog and VHDL .
Therefore , it makes little sense to propose a new approach like MyHDL unless it offers some clear and significant advantages .
This section presents a discussion the advantages that were experienced in the present project .
In addition to the fact that MyHDL is an open source product , available at no cost , it offers a number of technical advantages .
These will be described in the following subsections .
MyHDL concepts
Conceptually , MyHDL is not a new language .
Rather , it is a way to use Python as a hardware description language .
In its basic conception , MyHDL consists of a Python package and a Python usage model .
The package contains a number of objects that are suited for hardware design purposes , such as a VHDL - like signal class , and a class for bit - oriented operations .
Also included are a class used to simulate a design , and functions to convert a design to Verilog and VHDL .
The usage model proposes the application of Python generators to model blocks of concurrent hardware behavior .
Generators used in this way are similar to Verilog always blocks and VHDL processes .
The Python foundation of MyHDL is a fundamental design decision .
It implies that the MyHDL designer directly benefits from all progress made on the Python language itself .
Most importantly , the designer can directly reuse all resources available in the vast standard library and in third party libraries .
Designing hardware with a dynamic language
Verilog and VHDL are statically typed languages .
The software equivalents are languages like C++ , Ada and Java .
However , in the software development world another family of languages is very popular : dynamically typed languages .
Well known examples include Perl , Python , Ruby and Tcl .
Many engineers like to use these types of languages because of their flexibility and power .
Actually , these languages also play an important support role in many hardware design flows .
Use of dynamic languages is ideal during the creative phase at the front end of the design process , when expressive power and ease of experimentation are more important than raw runtime performance .
The MyHDL value proposition is to make these features available in a hardware description language itself .
The MyHDL type system
In traditional HDLs , the most popular types for describing integer arithmetic are signed and unsigned types , modeled after similar types in mainstream programming languages .
According to the present author , this situation is far from ideal .
These types force HDL designers to deal explictitly with bit representation issues .
The result is code with a lot of explicit type casts , sign extensions and resizings , even for simple integer operations .
MyHDL has a better solution , as it improves upon a concept borrowed from VHDL : the integer subtype , which is an integer constrained by a lower and upper bound .
Unlike VHDL , MyHDL does not specify any artificial limits on the bounds .
As a result , the MyHDL designer can describe integer arithmetic very naturally , regardless of the underlying bit widths .
All low level representational issues are handled automatically by the convertor to Verilog and VHDL .
Conversion to both Verilog and VHDL
The reality of contemporary HDL design is that Verilog and VHDL are almost equally popular .
As a result , many design flows need provisions for dealing with both languages in a single project .
In a number of cases , MyHDL provides an innovative and elegant solution , because it can convert designs and test benches to equivalent Verilog and VHDL , subject to reasonable restrictions .
The MyHDL dual conversion capability proved very useful in the present project .
For example , the sign - off language for RTL synthesis was VHDL , but the sign - off language for layout was Verilog .
Thus , having an equivalent VHDL and Verilog test suite for RTL and gate level simulation was very handy .
Moreover , a third - party memory model was more mature in Verilog than in VHDL .
Therefore , the Verilog test suite provided an additional level of confidence .
Furthermore , the analog design partner had a mixed - signal simulation capability based on Verilog .
This could be tested out early on with an RTL module converted to Verilog .
Test - driven hardware development
It is often claimed that the bottleneck in today 's HDL design flows is not so much the design implementation itself , but the verification task .
As a result , a number of innovative verification solutions have been developed , such as assertion - based verification and constrained random simulation .
However , remarkably , the verification - related innovations that are happening in the software development world are seemingly being ignored by the hardware design community .
The author considers this to be unjustifiable , because he believes that HDL - based design can be regarded as a special kind of software development .
A very powerful modern software verification technique is test - driven development ( TDD ) .
( In this context , the word " test " refers to functional verification , not manufacturing test . )
One aspect of this technique is a unit test framework , which is a software platform that facilitates the development of tests for small pieces of behavior .
The MyHDL designer has a choice of several of the unit test frameworks available for Python .
However , the most important aspect of TDD is as a methodology .
The idea is to develop the test before the implementation .
In fact , the implementation is said to be driven by a set of existing tests .
TDD was successfully used in the present project , as illustrated by the following example .
The project contained a decimation filter whose expected behavior could be easily specified and coded at a high level in Python .
This specification was used to develop a number of unit tests , for special and corner cases and for a large number of random data sets .
This test suite was then used to drive the RTL development for the module .
At the start , all tests failed , but as the RTL design progressed , incrementally more of the tests began to work .
When all of the tests worked , the design work was finished .
It is interesting to highlight the advantages of TDD over a traditional work flow , when tests are written only after the implementation :
It is very motivating for a designer to see increasingly more tests work as his implementation progresses .
The completeness of an implementation is signalled automatically .
Writing the test first guarantees that the designer 's mind is not yet cluttered with implementation details .
This makes it easier to develop complete tests covering all features including corner cases .
All tests fail initially .
This guarantees that the tests can differentiate between a good and a bad design , ensuring a high test suite quality .
The test suite stays in place as a regression test .
Subsequent incremental design changes can thus be made with confidence .
This list of advantages makes it all the more remarkable that TDD is receiving virtually no attention in the hardware design community .
The most important , albeit indirect , MyHDL innovation may therefore be that it puts TDD into the hands of hardware designers .
The methodology could be called test - driven hardware development ( TDHD ) .
This author believes that this novel idea has a very promising future .
Conclusion
The design of a digital macro with MyHDL is described .
This project validates the suitability of MyHDL for industrial projects , for which reliability and efficiency are of prime importance .
Moreover , a MyHDL - based design flow is shown to offer a number of significant advantages over traditional approaches .

A Muslim Frenchman at the center of a firestorm over polygamy says keeping mistresses is the French way of life .
The man 's case came to light after his wife was fined for driving with a veil covering her face , and his comments are an ironic riposte to those in French President Nicolas Sarkozy 's government who want to push immigrants to better integrate into French society .
The 31 - year - old Frenchwoman drew nationwide attention last week to a driving fine she received for apparel that hinders her vision .
But it soon emerged that her husband may have four wives  although it was doubtful the marriages were made official under French law .
The situation appeared to be a boon to Sarkozy , who is trying to rush through controversial legislation forbidding burqa- style Islamic veils that cover the face , on the grounds that they do n't respect French values or women 's dignity .
But it has stoked debate and may backfire on legal grounds .
The president of the French parliament 's lower chamber , Bernard Accoyer , said Monday the text of the bill to ban full Muslim veils would be presented at a Cabinet meeting on May 19 .
Many Muslims fear a law banning face - covering veils because they say targeting the tiny minority of women who cover their faces stigmatizes France 's entire Muslim community - at an estimated 5 million people , the largest in western Europe .
The head of the main Muslim grouping , Mohamed Moussaoui , reiterated that message Monday after a meeting with Prime Minister Francois Fillon .
He noted that shots fired over the weekend at a mosque in southern France failed to garner the attention given to the veil affair .
Those who want a full ban on such veils contend the garment conceals more than the face , notably helping to perpetuate practices like polygamy , approved in some Muslim countries , and is a signpost of a radical interpretation of Islam .

For a device with as much superphone street cred as the Milestone , you 'd think a basic task like listening to music through the headphone jack would be a cakewalk .
No problems , right ?
So straightforward , really , that it 's not even worth testing thoroughly -- and therein lies the problem , it seems .
Milestone owners on both sides of the pond are reporting en masse that music playback occasionally skips over the jack -- though stereo Bluetooth , ironically a more CPU - taxing operation , seems to be fine .
For many owners , particularly those who do n't carry a separate PMP , that can totally be a deal - breaker .
It 's said you can work around the issue by putting the phone into airplane mode , which effectively makes it a dedicated PMP anyhow -- not an optimal solution , right ?
Yeah , Moto , this seriously is n't shaping up to be your week , so let 's just make sure you earn some brownie points with awesome customer service through this rough patch .

When I got the opportunity to re-release my first two books , which had gone out of print , my publisher and I decided that they should be combined into one brand - new volume , Ready for Dessert , with new photos and more than a dozen new recipes added .
So I made a master list of all the recipes , then chose my absolute favorites : the ones I ’d found myself making over and over again during the years invariably rose to the top .
I had to choose le top du top , as they say in France .
Then I sent the list to my editor , who worked for many years at a food magazine known for their exactitude and trying a recipe over and over and over again with every variation ( a bit crazy , like me ) , and we went back and forth for a while , until we agreed on the ones for the final book .
I originally imagined I would sit down and cut and paste recipes , putting them in order , and maybe adding a few notes here and there .
But as I scrolled through the recipes , many of which I had n’t made in over a decade , I started reading through them more carefully .
And soon I realized that I was not just making mental notes , but I was jumping up from my desk chair and heading to the kitchen , taking butter out of the refrigerator to soften , and running to the market to buy eggs by the flat .
Then , of course , there were those inevitable slips of paper that I make notes on , that became scattered around my apartment , finding their way into various files or transcribed hastily onto my computer with doughy fingers .
( I am still scraping chocolate off my keyboard , by the way . )
As I mentioned in the introduction to the book , recipes are n’t set in stone — which is a good thing , because otherwise using cookbooks would be a herculean task , sometimes when you look at something with a fresh perspective , you have those “ Eureka ! ” moments .
This Chocolate Bread was in my second book , Ripe for Dessert , and when I was picking and choosing which recipes would make the cut , I had an overload of chocolate cakes and other treats in the book , including cream - filled Chocolate Cupcakes dipped in chocolate ganache .
So this one did n’t make it .
Another reason was that I did n’t want people to make this and expect it to be like a decadent chocolate torte or rich chocolate pound cake .
It ’s bread , and the resulting loaf will be firmer and less - buttery than a traditional cake .
What you should expect , though , is the most amazing chocolate aroma wafting from your oven during the excruciating time it takes to bake and cool down .
And it does make a wonderful afternoon snack , with a strong cup of coffee .
So I thought it ’d be fun to give it a makeover here on the site .
When giving it another look , I tried it a few times .
Okay , who am I kidding ?
I re-did it about eight or nine times , exhausting every possibility I could think of .
What did I try ?
Well , since you asked …
1. Egg Yolks vs Whole Eggs :
Yolks are almost pure fat , so they make things moister .
And I thought maybe an extra yolk would make a substantial difference .
Verdict ?
Not enough difference to merit having 2 egg whites leftover .
2. All - Purpose flour vs Bread Flour : Because bread flour is n’t something everyone has on hand , I wanted to see if it was vital for the bread .
Verdict ?
I hate to make you go to the store , but bread flour has more gluten and you ’ll get a better rise if you use it .
3. Dutch - Process Cocoa Powder vs Natural Cocoa Powder : I dipped into my stash of American cocoa powder , trying it with both Hershey ’s and an artisan brand .
Then I tried it using Dutch - process cocoa and the difference in flavor was pretty profound .
Verdict ?
Dutch - process .
( The bread made with natural cocoa did n’t rise as well , which makes me think the acid in the cocoa somehow interfered with the yeast action . )
4. Nuts vs No Nuts : Originally I made the recipe with nuts because , well , I like nuts and chocolate together .
But I was on the fence about them in the end .
So while they were nice and crunchy in there , you do n’t have to use them .
Verdict ?
You choose .
5. Instant vs Active Dry Yeast : Instant yeast is n’t widely available in France yet , so I did n’t try it .
Fresh yeast , however , is .
( You can ask your local boulanger for some . )
Call me a stickler , but I used active dry yeast .
Verdict ?
If you want to swap one out for another , check the links at the end of the recipe for substitutions .
6. Butter vs Oil : Because butter is part water , about 20 % , I thought using a neutral - tasting vegetable oil might make the chocolate bread moister .
And thought that maybe the flavor of the butter might not be that important with all that chocolate anyways .
But the loaf came out with an odd , slightly greasy taste , and I went back to butter .
Verdict ?
Oil works , but does n’t taste very good so I ’m sticking with butter .
Perhaps a nut oil might be something to try , but am guessing the flavor might be rather strong for most tastes .
7. Milk vs Water : Originally I used water , but decided to give milk a try , since bread doughs made with milk have a softer crust and are a bit more tender .
Verdict ?
Whole milk works best , but low - fat milk or water is okay , too .
8. Chocolate Chips vs Chopped Chocolate : Chocolate chips are designed not to melt , and while that ’s sometimes an advantage , I do n’t mind softer bits of chocolate embedded in the bread .
So I chopped mine up myself .
And besides , I only have one bag of chocolate chips left that I brought back from the states , and I did n’t want to use them up quite yet .
Verdict ?
I prefer chocolate chunks , but chocolate chips are fine to use .
I also made the dough a bit softer , and even considered trying a no - knead variation , although I decided that I actually like kneading bread .
And also my friends ( and neighbors … and vendors at the market … and delivery men… ) were beginning to request something other than loaves of chocolate bread with a few slices taken out .
So I decided it was time to stop .
You also might try slicing up a loaf and using it in your favorite bread pudding recipe ( or the Orange - Almond Bread Pudding in Ready for Dessert ) .
Or using it for a batch of French toast , if you ’re one of those people that need to get their chocolate fix first thing in the morning — as I must confess , I often do .
Chocolate Bread Print Recipe
One 9 - inch ( 23 cm ) loaf
After much experimenting , I opted for a dough that much softer than the one I ’m kneading up in the photos .
And I eventually I settled on one that was soft enough to be scraped into the baking pan , just as is .
Use very good cocoa powder ; here I used Valrhona , since I think the darker color and strong taste are important in the loaf .
But another brand of Dutch - process cocoa should work fine , too .
If you do n’t have the coffee powder , you can leave it out .
I like it since it add a subtle boost to the chocolate flavor .
This recipe works best with bread flour , but if you ca n’t get it , all - purpose flour works well , too .
I ’ve made a few notes at the end of the recipe about yeast and flour substitutions .
3/4 cup whole or low - fat milk heated until just tepid 1 envelope active dry yeast ( 1/4 ounce or 2 1/4 teaspoons ) — see Note 6 tablespoons ( 75g ) sugar 4 tablespoons ( 55g ) butter salted or unsalted 3 ounces ( 85g ) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate coarsely chopped 1 1/ 2 teaspoons instant coffee or espresso powder , optional 1 large egg 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 3 / 4 teaspoon kosher or sea salt 2 cups bread flour 280 g 1/4 cup unsweetened Dutch - process cocoa powder 3/4 cup ( 3 1/2 ounces 90 g ) chocolate chips or coarsely chopped bittersweet or semisweet chocolate 1/2 cup ( 70g ) toasted pecans walnuts , almonds , or hazelnuts , coarsely chopped ( optional ) 1 .
In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl , sprinkle the yeast over the milk .
Add one tablespoon ( 11g ) sugar , then set aside in a warm place for 10 to 15 minutes , until bubbles form on the surface .
2 . While the yeast is activating , in a small saucepan , melt the butter and 3 ounces ( 85g ) chocolate over a pan of barely simmering water .
Stir occasionally , until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth .
Remove from heat .
3 . Once the yeast mixture is frothy , mix in the remaining sugar , the instant coffee ( if using ) , the egg , vanilla , and sea salt .
4 . Stir in half the flour and cocoa powder , then the melted butter and chocolate , then the remaining flour mixture , stirring until well - incorporated .
If using a stand mixer , attach the dough hook and beat for five minutes , until smooth .
If making by hand , mix vigorously with a flexible spatula for the same amount of time .
The dough will seem quite moist , resembling sticky brownie batter when ready .
5 . Cover the bowl and let rise in a warm place for 2 hours .
6 . Butter a 9 - inch ( 23 cm ) loaf pan .
7 . Stir in the chopped chocolate and nuts , if using .
Then use a spatula to fold the dough over on itself in the bowl for about thirty seconds , then transfer it to the buttered pan , pressing a bit to spread it to the corners .
Let rise in a warm place for one hour .
8 . Ten minutes before you ’re ready to bake the bread , preheat the oven to 350 ºF ( 175ºC . )
9 . Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes , until it feels done and sounds hollow when you tap it .
You can stick an instant - read thermometer in the bottom if you ’re unsure ; the bread is done when the temperature reads 180 ºF ( 82C º ) .
Notes :
The equivalent amount of fresh yeast to one packet of dry yeast is .6 ounces .
I ’ve not used instant or quick - rising yeast ( also called rapid - rise , or levure boulangère instantanée in France ) , but if you do try it , please let me know how it works out .
According to various websites from yeast suppliers ( see below ) , you can use it in place of regular yeast .
If you have questions about yeast , active dry or instant , I ’ve included a few links below to the websites of various yeast companies , which you should find helpful .
In France , there really is n’t any equivalent of bread flour .
Due to the proliferation of bread machines , one can find farine pour pain or farine boulangère , but it usually has leavener already added .
There ’s a ‘ hack ’ for making bread flour , in the links below .

Some believe that having a big - time college football team is the key to boosting enrollment .
George Mason University has found that offering a degree in video game design does the trick , too .
Advertisement
GMU , located in Fairfax , Va. and the Washington D.C. metropolitan area , says the Fall 2010 anticipated enrollment in its newly created Computer Game Design program is five times what it expected .
" We 've been overwhelmed , " said Scott M. Martin , assistant dean for Technology , Research and Advancement .
The program had hoped to enroll 110 students by 2012 ; they 're already over 200 .
Naturally , game design is an extremely popular offering , considering the desire many have to work in the games industry and the small ratio of dedicated game design programs to more traditional computer science and graphic arts sequences at American universities .
Mason also benefits from its location , close to heavy hitters such as Bethesda Softworks and BioWare Mythic .

" This course bodes well for the future of gaming in this region , " Eugene Evans , the BioWare Mythic general manager , told the Fairfax Times .
" The team at GMU is putting a strong emphasis on a broad set of disciplines and instilling an entrepreneurial spirit - which could mean many new start - ups within a few years . "
Though it is the largest university by enrollment in Virginia , to most before now , George Mason may have been more commonly known in the U.S. for its basketball team 's run to the 2006 Final Four .
Maybe games design can raise its profile even further , on a longer - term basis .

The time - bomb that is public - pension obligations keeps ticking louder and louder .
Eventually someone will have to notice .
This month , Stanford 's Institute for Economic Policy Research released a study suggesting a more than $ 500 billion unfunded liability for California 's three biggest pension funds — Calpers , Calstrs and the University of California Retirement System .
The shortfall is about six times the size of this year 's California state budget and seven times more than the outstanding voter - approved general obligations ...
Those who have studied history know that nothing invigorates and empowers an authoritarian regime more than a spectacular act of violence , some sudden and senseless loss of life that allows the autocrat to stand on the smoking rubble and identify himself as the hero .
It is at moments like this that the public — still in shock from the horror of the tragedy that has just unfolded before them — can be led into the most ruthless despotism : despotism that now bears the mantle of " security . "
Acts of terror and violence never benefit the average man or woman .
They only ever benefit those in positions of power .
This is why Nero fiddled while Rome burned : it gave him a chance to throw the Christians to the lions and rebuild the capital of the Roman Empire in his own image .
This is why Hearst and the warmongers of the emerging American Empire were delighted by the destruction of the U.S.S.
Maine in Havana Harbor : it gave them the excuse they needed in order to rouse the public into supporting the Spanish - American War .
This is why Israel attacked the U.S.S. Liberty in 1967 during the Six Day War , strafing and torpedoing it relentlessly for hours in a vain attempt to send it to the bottom : the Israelis believed that the loss of the Liberty could be blamed on Egypt and draw the Americans into war .
This is why there are hundreds of documented examples of governments staging attacks in order to blame them on their political enemies .
In every civilization , in every culture , in every historical period , authoritarians have known that spectacular acts of violence help to further consolidate their own power and control .
And sadly , throughout history there have been all too many willing to allow attacks to occur , to pretend that attacks have occurred or even to attack their own population in order to further their political agenda .
To think that such staged provocations and false flag attacks no longer occur would be as unrealistic as believing that human nature itself has changed , that powerful people no longer seek to increase their power , that influence is never used for deceit or manipulation , that lies are no longer told to satisfy greed or slake the thirst for control .
It is to believe that our society is immuned from those things that we have seen in every other society in every other era .
In short , it is a dangerous delusion .
The people are once again learning the power of this delusion .
They are learning the extent to which they have been lied to .
They are once again studying their history .
The Russians are learning how the FSB was caught planting bombs in Moscow in the 1990s during a terror scare that swept Putin into power and stirred the public into supporting the Second Chechen War .
They are learning how their autocratic ex-President came to power campaigning on the graves of those his old FSB cronies had killed .
The Israelis are learning how Mossad has been caught time and again posing as the very Muslim terrorists they claim to be opposing .
They are learning how Israel uses the specter of terror to further extend their blank cheque drawn on American funds to expand their police state at home and maintain their hardline stance , the world 's sixth - largest nuclear superpower supposedly threatened by the possibility that one of their neighbours may one day obtain a single nuclear weapon .
The British are learning how their SAS officers were caught dressing up as Arabs in Iraq , driving around with trucks full of munitions , shooting at police to stir up ethnic tensions and insure that permanent bases could be built in the region .
They are learning how Haroon Aswat , the supposed mastermind behind the 7/7 bombings , was working for British Intelligence ..
They are learning how British military intelligence took part in IRA bombings .
The Indians are learning how the Mumbai attack was helped by an U.S.
Agent who is cooperating with investigators so that he wo n't face questioning by foreign authorities .
The Canadians are learning how their own provincial police dressed up as protestors in 2007 and threatened violence against other police in order to force a crackdown on peaceful protests .
ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW
And the Americans are learning that there were multiple bombs found , dismantled and taken out of the Alfred P. Murrah building on April 19 , 1995 .
They are learning that Timothy McVeigh had written a letter to his sister in which he claimed to be in the Special Forces for the U.S. Army .
They are learning the bombing was being directed by FBI informants , just as the 1993 World Trade Center bombing was .
They are learning about 9/11 and the Gulf of Tonkin and Operation Northwoods and their own Army Counterinsurgency Manuals that teach officers how to commit false flag attacks to blame on their enemies .
In short , the people are learning the truth .
And now we see the same build - up to a false flag event taking place that we saw in 1995 .
At that time the U.S. had a corporate media desperate to fling mud at anyone concerned by the actions of their government , and it had a government that was desperately unpopular in the face of growing dissatisfaction .
Today we see the exact same factors at play .
If anything , the situation today is worse than it was in the run-up to the Oklahoma City Bombing , with media consolidation meaning that groups of concerned citizens like the Oath Keepers are being attacked by the controlled minions on both the left and the right .
And now it is not just the militia that is being demonized by the establishment : it is veterans and gun owners , third party supporters and libertarians , anti-war protestors and human rights campaigners , people who are upset with the government giving trillions to the banks that have engineered our current financial crisis in the first place .
In short , everyone is now a potential terrorist , according to the governmental and media agencies that deign to limit our range of acceptable opinion and control dissent .
Even the word ' terrorist ' means something more than it did back in 1995 , after the false flag anthrax attack allowed the passage of the Patriot Act , after the boogey of Al - CIAda gave the NSA the opportunity to announce that they were collecting everyone 's emails and everyone 's telephone calls , after the former Homeland Security Secretary came out and admitted that the Bush administration had made up terror threats in order to scare the people into supporting the government , now we know what the real definition of terrorism is .
It is governments scaring their own populations into line .
But there is something else that 's different now from what it was in 1995 .
The people are learning something else about terrorism : they are not terrorists for speaking out against their government .
They are not terrorists for wanting the government to stop selling their children into servitude to pay bankers their bonuses .
They are not terrorists for pointing out that the FBI and the CIA and Mossad and MI6 are behind every major terrorist event .
The people are not terrorists because they do not want to see more death .
They do not want more destruction , the spilling of the blood of their fellow citizens is not in their interests .
Death and destruction only ever serves the governmental and financial and industrial interests who always grow in power and wealth in the wake of every tragedy .
Time and again , the people pay with their lives , and the governments and the banks and the war machine only grows and prospers .
The people do not want terrorism because it does not benefit them .
It only benefits the existing power structure .
And this time , if there is another staged event to blame on the government 's enemy of the day , the people will know who to blame .

Iran ’s announcements that it is going to produce 20 percent Highly Enriched Uranium is bad news — not least because the Iranians said they would do so without respect to the presumably doomed TRR fuel swap .
( Though this thing has risen from the dead so many times , maybe I should start calling it the Zombie Fuel Swap . )
I made some comments to Le Figaro , but they are in French .
( Well , they ’ve been translated .
I can barely say Châteauneuf - du - Pape . )
Glenn Kessler has a news analysis on the implications of the deal , in which David Albright explains why Iran could go from 20 percent HEU to a bomb in relatively short order :
Meanwhile , enriching uranium under the guise of medical needs will get Tehran much closer to possessing weapons - grade material .
Iran insists it has no interest in nuclear weapons .
But Albright said 70 percent of the work toward reaching weapons - grade uranium took place when Iran enriched uranium gas to 3.5 percent .
Enriching it further to the 19.75 percent needed for the reactor is an additional “ 15 to 20 percent of the way there . ”
Once the uranium is enriched above 20 percent , it is considered highly enriched uranium .
The uranium would need to be enriched further , to 60 percent and then to 90 percent , before it could be used for a weapon .
“ The last two steps are not that big a deal , ” Albright said .
They could be accomplished , he said , at a relatively small facility within months .
It must seem odd for casual readers to see 20 percent and 90 percent U235 lumped together as highly enriched uranium or to be be told that Iran will find it much easier to go from 20 to 90 , than from 5 to 20 .
That ’s not how everyday math works , where 5 and 20 are closer to “ ten ” and 90 rounds to “ one hundred . ”
For many readers ( especially of this blog ) the answer is obvious .
But for those to whom it is not obvious , Francesco Calogero found a nice way to illustrate the same point to students at a previous ISODARCO meeting .
The essential concept is understand enrichment as a process of removing undesirable isotopes ( or more specifically , isolating the desirable ones ) .
So , imagine 1000 atoms of uranium .
Seven of them will be the fissile isotope Uranium 235 .
The rest are useless Uranium 238 .
( If you are the sort of person who just said , “ Hey !
What about Uranium 234 ? ” or other nitpicks this post is not aimed at you . )
To make typical reactor fuel , Iran or any other country would removes 860 of the non-U235 isotopes , leaving a U235 : U238 ratio of 7:140 ( ~5 percent ) .
To make fuel for the TRR , Iran removes another 105 non-U235 atoms from the 140 , leaving a ratio of 7:35 ( 20 percent ) .
To make a bomb , Iran needs only to remove 27 of the remaining 35 atoms , leading a ratio of 7:8 ( ~90 percent ) .
This is simplified illustration , of course , since some of the U235 ends up in the depleted stream as “ tails ” — but you get the idea .
You can see why separative work is measured as mass — the interesting question is the amount of material separated — and why the lower levels of enrichment actually require more work .
As a result , as Kessler notes , Iran ’s announcement “ marks a new and potentially dangerous turn ” in the situation .
If Iran enriches a significant amount of U235 to 20 percent — and that ’s a stated goal right now , not yet an actual achievement — then Iran would be able to “ top off ” the enrichment a small , clandestine facility like the one revealed near Qom .
I did a few calculations , but I do n’t need to wade into the middle the FAS–ISIS steel cage death match that Josh has so ably chronicled .
I will just encourage people to do their own back - of - the - envelop calculations .
I think the answer is pretty obvious .
Seattle 's new city attorney has better things to do than prosecute pot smokers , he said January 14 .
City Attorney Pete Holmes announced he was dismissing all marijuana possession cases , starting with those filed by his predecessor , Tom Carr , whom Holmes defeated in November .
He said he dismissed two cases his first day on the job , and several others are about to be dismissed .
Pete Holmes
" We 're not going to prosecute marijuana possession cases anymore , " said Holmes .
" I meant it when I said it " during the campaign .
Holmes ' criminal division chief , Craig Sims , added that he is reviewing an additional 50 cases .
Barring " out of the ordinary " circumstances , Sims said , the prosecutor 's office does not intend to file charges for marijuana possession .
Although voters in pot-friendly Seattle approved a 2003 initiative making marijuana the lowest law enforcement priority , former City Attorney Carr was still prosecuting pot busts .
In the last half of 2008 , his office handled 81 marijuana - related cases , with Carr dismissing 21 and filing charges in 60 others , including 20 where pot possession was the only charge .
In the first half of 2009 , Carr declined only eight of 62 marijuana - related cases , including 21 where possession was the only charge .
Holmes ' change of policy comes amidst a climate increasingly favorable to marijuana law reform in Washington state .
A state assembly committee held hearings on a pair of decriminalization and legalization bills last week -- they were defeated in committee this week -- and a group of Seattle - based activists also announced last week that they were beginning a drive to get a legalization initiative on the ballot in November .
Courtesy of John Mauldin's mid-week Outside The Box newsletter , Eric Sprott touches on one of the lesser - discussed aspect of the Greece crisis , namely its effects on the country 's banks .
What 's interesting is that in the standard formulation -- the one that 's gained currency thanks to Ken Rogoff -- it 's sovereign debt crises that follow banking crisis ( which is what we 're experiencing right now ) .
Sprott brings it full circle .
Here 's part of it :
One aspect of the Greek situation that has been obscured by all the recent political wrangling is the crisis ' impact on the Greek banks .
Although the banks were supposed to be rock solid after all the government - injected capital they received ( not to mention zero - percent interest rates and generous lending terms from the European Central Bank ) , data shows that Greek bank deposits have fallen 8.4 billion euros , or 3.6 percent , in two months since December 2009 .
With no restraints on capital flows within the European Union , Greek savers are free to transfer their assets elsewhere .
Given that bank deposit guarantees in Greece are the responsibility of the national government rather than the European Central Bank , we suspect Greek citizens are pulling money out of their banks because they question their government 's ability to honour its domestic deposit guarantees .
We envision Greek depositors asking themselves how a government that can't raise enough money to stay solvent can then turn around and guarantee their bank deposits ?
It 's a fair question to ask .
The Greek bank stocks have been thoroughly punished throughout the crisis .
Chart A plots an index consisting of the four largest Greek bank stocks and shows an average decline of 47 % since November 2009 .
The deposit withdrawals from these banks have been so damaging to their respective balance sheets ( remember bank leverage ? ) that the Greek banks have asked to borrow 17 billion euros left over from a 28 billion euro support program launched in 2008.3
You see the connection here ?
Greece experienced a financial crisis , followed by a sovereign crisis , followed by another financial crisis .
There is no doubt that the Greek crisis has helped drive the gold spot price to its recent all time high in euros .
Gold is a prudent asset to own in times of crisis , and it's possible that a portion of the Greek deposit withdrawals were reinvested into the precious metal .
The fact remains , however , that if the Greek government cannot stem the outflows of deposits soon , the EU will have no other choice but to undertake a real sovereign bailout with all its bells , whistles and arduous protocols .
Once again , the question is : Is Greece Europe 's Bear Stearns :
It 's a vicious spiral from financial crisis to sovereign debt crisis to banking crisis , and there is no reason it can't spread to other European countries suffering from similar fiscal imbalances .
With Spain and Portugal next in line with their own sovereign debt issues , we can expect depositors in these countries to make similar runs to the bank for their cash .
" Guaranteed by Government " is truly beginning to lose its potency in this environment .
The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) seems to be preparing for such a scenario with its recent announcement of a tenfold increase in its emergency lending facility .
The IMF 's New Arrangements to Borrow ( NAB ) facility is designed to prevent the " impairment of the international monetary system or to deal with an exceptional situation that poses a threat to the stability of that system . "
The NAB facility has grown from US $ 50 billion to US $ 550 billion with the mere stroke of a pen .
Does the IMF know something that the market does n't ?
You ’re looking at Nokia ’s just - announced flagship handset for 2010 — the N8 .
For more info see the live Q&A ( or transcript thereof after the fact ) below .
Ricky Cadden — aka The Symbian Guru — has posted a great rundown of its features .
Some highlights :
It operates on WCDMA 850 , 900 , 1700,1900 and 2100MHz – making this ( I think ) the world ’s first five - band 3G handset .
WiFi on 802.11 B , G and N bands – another first for mobiles ?
A wide - angle 28 mm F2.8 Carl Zeiss lens for 12 - megapixel stills and HD video at 720p / 25 fps ( also features HDMI - out ) .
So what does 720p / 25 fps HD video shot on a camera phone look like ?
Here ’s your answer :
Not too shabby , huh ?
Here ’s what else I ’m digging about the new N8 :
It ’s a big , sturdy slab – I ’m hot and cold on touch - screens but I do like my mobiles to have as few moving parts as possible .
Despite the absence of a physical qwerty keyboard the N8 reminds me a lot of my sorely - missed Fido hiptop – and that ’s not a bad thing …
The available colour options – especially orange , but maybe that ’s just me . 😎
And what I do n’t :
This is apparently the first Nokia with a non-removable battery .
Not cool .
Earlier today there was a virtual Q&A with Fone Arena and other blogs — here ’s what Nokia had to say about it :
About the battery , we wanted to create a robust , one - piece device that feels good in the hand , therefore the integrated battery that can not be replaced by the user .
Sorry , I do n’t buy it .
Nokia ’s current designs are plenty robust .
I think they ’re testing the waters with this cost - saving “ feature ” and deserve to be roundly criticized for it .
As was recently the case with another forthcoming mobile device sporting a non-removable battery , a prototype of the N8 found its way into the hands of the infamous Eldar Murtazin , who deemed it an embarrassment to Nokia .
I ’m not sure if I ’d agree , but I do have some questions about the latest version of Nokia ’s recently open - sourced mobile OS .
No , not Maemo — that other one .
I ’ll be participating in a second live Q&A , scheduled to start at 6 pm GMT and embedded below .
If there ’s anything you ’d like me to ask on your behalf send me a message via Identi.ca or Twitter , or leave a comment below .
Every Sunday , The Simple Dollar reviews a personal finance book or other book of interest .
You can check out my reviews of hundreds of personal finance books ( and other related books of interest ) all on one page .
Bargain Junkie is an unabashed frugality book , focusing mostly on maximizing your “ bang for the buck ” when spending money .
The book itself is broken down into a large number of very short sections covering specific frugality issues , often written in a humorous and often self - deprecating tone that ’s pretty appealing .
Obviously , when you read a lot of frugality books , you begin to recognize that some of the central points in each book appear in all the books – which is fine , since there ’s a very good chance that this is the first book on frugality that the person has picked up and many of the repeated ideas are the very good ideas that a person should use .
Bargain Junkie follows this pattern and spends a significant number of its pages on what I would call Frugality 101 , which makes it an equally good “ starter ” book as many other frugality titles out there .
What sets it apart , though ?
Instead of doing a section - by - section review of the multitude of short pieces in the book , I picked out ten short sections that really stood out to me .
Television Is A Model For How Not To Live
Instead of looking at how people live on television as something to strive for , use it as a guide for something to avoid .
After all , do you want a unique and wonderful life or do you want to just be a pale imitation of that guy in the television commercial ?
Do you want to live by your own rules , or merely imitate the crass consumerism of The Real Housewives of East Overshoe ?
Extended Households
Living quarters are one of the biggest expenses in our lives .
Yet , quite often , large portions of our living quarters go completely unused as we often get into the routine of using just a room or two in our home for most of our activities .
So why not share that extra space ?
Consider a more communal living arrangement , where you actually live with friends and family and split the housing cost appropriately .
It works surprisingly well and it can save a truckload of money .
Collecting
Collecting can be a worthwhile venture for frugal people provided two things are true .
First , you ’re quite willing to sell off what you ’ve collected .
Second , you ’re willing to keep up with the hobby and stay abreast of prices and information about it .
If you do both of these , you can often find a very lucrative hobby from hitting thrift stores and the like .
I actually have a friend who buys and sells vintage video games who claims to have bought games at many thrift stores for fifty cents and resold them for hundreds ( think Chase the Chuck Wagon ) .
I ’ve even done it myself with trading cards of various types .
Try It Yourself Before Paying an Expert
Home repairs ?
Try it yourself by reading documentation online and giving it a shot .
Exercise ?
Try home exercise before buying a gym membership and paying a trainer .
Virtually everything you do that you hire someone else for can be done yourself .
So why not try it and make sure you actually need to shell out the money for someone else to do it ?
Exercise at home first and make sure you ’re willing to keep up some routine before hiring a trainer , for example , and you might find you do n’t even need one .
Go Monastic
Why do you have to live the same life everyone else does ?
If you live cheap and build up a bankroll , there ’s no reason you ca n’t sell everything and live out of your kayak for a couple of years .
The only thing keeping you from doing something completely different in your life is your own fears .
Most of the big dreams people have are usually really cheap when you get right down to it , so it ’s rarely the cost that keeps us from doing something like driving around the country in a solar car talking at public libraries .
Buy Your Own Presents
Quite often , gift - giving occasions come down to giving other people stuff they do n’t want and you receiving stuff you do n’t want .
Why ?
Sit down and have a heart - to - heart with the person and , instead of just exchanging gifts , pledge to do something fun and unique together that you both want to do .
You ’ll probably save money and almost always wind up doing something much more memorable , enjoyable , and long lasting .
Craigslist / Freecycle First
Whenever you need anything , it ’s usually worth your time to check the local Craigslist or Freecycle before going out and buying it .
You can often find great stuff for pennies or for free .
Heck , I ’m learning how to play the keyboard on a free Craigslist item .
Similarly , if you have something you ’re getting rid of , put it up on that list with a low price tag .
Quite often , it ’ll be off your hands without breaking a sweat .
Large City Travel
If you ’re traveling to a large city , study the public transportation information for that city online before you go .
In many large cities , you can have a wonderful trip there without renting a car or paying for a taxi by simply knowing and using their public transportation system .
My wife and I spent a week in London several years ago without renting a car or taking a taxi , even from the airport .
The Biggest Element of Dressing Well
The biggest element in dressing well is n’t buying clothes from the expensive stores .
It ’s self - confidence .
You have to be proud of yourself no matter what you ’re wearing .
If your confidence is the same no matter what you ’re wearing , then it really does n’t matter much at all what you ’re wearing .
A person ’s confidence and personality always comes through .
I used to be fairly nervous wearing things bought at thrift stores .
“ Wo n’t people look down at these secondhand clothes ? ” I would think .
I ’d be more self - conscious and then I ’d find that people did think less of me than I would have liked .
But it was n’t because of the clothes – it was because I was so self - conscious , nervous , and shy .
The clothes do n’t make the person .
Hit Ethnic Restaurants – Hard
This is something I did myself in college and still do on occasion .
In terms of the quantity and quality of food you get for the dollar , few places beat ethnic restaurants .
Go there , order something intriguing , and you ’ll find yourself leaving with a doggy bag containing enough food for two more meals or so .
I ca n’t tell you the number of times I ’ve eaten leftover sauteed vegetables over rice where the price of each meal I actually got from the restaurant dish was cut down to the $ 2 level .
I know some professors at my old college who almost exclusively eat ( even to the exclusion of home food prep ) at local ethnic restaurants .
Is Bargain Junkie Worth Reading ?
Bargain Junkie feels very much to me like a collection of posts from a frugality blog with a very good writer and entertaining voice .
The sections in the book are quick reads that usually each convey a central point or two or provide a checklist of highly specific tips and are packed with anecdotes that either make you laugh or breed familiarity with the reader .
Annie should start a blog , period .
I would happily link to some of those entries and she ’d probably end up earning more revenue from it than she would from this book over the long run .
If you enjoy reading well - written , occasionally humorous blog post length articles about frugality and maximizing your buying dollar , you will enjoy this book .
My biggest problem with the book , actually , is in the design .
To me , the design of the cover is poor to the point that I would have not picked up this book had I not had a vested interest in reviewing it .
There are thousands of great books out there to read – I would probably walk on by this book on a bookshelf simply because there are so many other great books that I could be reading that did n’t give me a “ go away , this book is n’t for you ” vibe right from the cover .
Yes , I know the cover was shooting for a certain demographic , but you can reach those people without giving a “ go away ” vibe to others outside that demographic .
Still , once I got past the cover , the book inside was quite worthwhile – an entertaining survey of frugal ideas .

Early in the morning on a typical weekday , men can be seen resolutely streaming down lower Broadway , braced against a pulverizing wind .
They are preparing to enter their office buildings , put on their headsets , flick on their Bloombergs , and go to war .
And if they look miserable — or weary , frustrated , angry , or petrified — it ’s because they have one of the most emotionally taxing jobs in the world .
Playing the market is a constant ricochet between panic and euphoria .
There ’s a reason the burnout rate is high .
But the formula for succeeding in a high - stress financial environment is simpler than you might think .
If you ask a trader , or someone who studies them , what the single most important factor is in determining whether a person will be good at trading , they will say that it ’s the ability to control one ’s emotions .
The trouble for all those men pouring into the trading desks is that recent studies suggest purely rational behavior may not come as naturally to them as gender stereotypes would suggest .
A couple of weeks ago , for instance , the investment - management company Vanguard released data showing that men were more likely than women to sell stocks at the bottom of the market .
Could it be that the fairer sex is better able to ride the ups and downs of Wall Street without letting their emotions get in the way ?
“ There were always very few women on the floor of the exchanges , ” says a hedge - fund manager named Henry Lee , who spent years on the floor of the American Stock Exchange .
“ But the women who were successful at it were unbelievable . ”
Lee is sitting at a trading desk with his friend Harley Evans , a derivatives trader at a firm called Mako Financial Markets , talking about gender differences in their line of work .
“ They never got ruffled , never got upset , ” Lee continues .
“ Losing their temper ?
Never . ”
“ I think women can be very emotional , too , ” Evans says , not entirely convinced .
“ Women respond to stress differently , ” Lee says .
Rather than throwing the phone across the room , “ women cry . ”
“ Well , I ’ve cried , too , ” Evans says .
“ Not that I ’ve seen .
You cried alone in your closet , ” says Lee .
“ I cried in my beer . ”
“ The notion of taking chances is definitely more male , ” Lee says .
“ Look , men are much more willing to take a shot on something with incomplete knowledge . ”
So , I ask , how would Wall Street be different if there were more women making decisions ?
Lee offers an analogy based on the fact that he ’s going through a divorce : “ I would say that when you ’re married , your life is much more level , ” he says .
“ And when you ’re single , you tend to experience many more swings .
For example , you might not go skydiving if you ’re married , or go out drinking all night with your buddies , or you may not pursue that Ironman . ”
Having women around , in other words , “ prevents extreme behavior — or irrational exuberance . ”
Despite what we ’ve been led to believe , the market is n’t rational or efficient at all — it ’s all about feelings .
The major plot points of the crisis largely turned on emotion : Dick Fuld was too egotistical to sell Lehman Brothers when he had the chance , so his pride drove it into the ground ; Bear Stearns hedge - fund managers lost huge sums of money on subprime mortgages despite the fact that they suspected the worst ( “ I ’m fearful of these markets , ” Ralph Cioffi e-mailed a colleague back in 2007 ) ; Merrill Lynch was the “ fat kid , ” as the investor Steve Eisman has put it , so desperate to be like Goldman Sachs that it barreled into every dumb investment imaginable and had to be bailed out by Bank of America .
Almost every single bank chief doubled down on mortgage junk at exactly the wrong moment .
Emotions led otherwise intelligent men — because , let ’s face it , all of them were men — to make terrible decisions .
According to a new breed of researchers from the field of behavioral finance , Wall Street ’s volatility is really driven by our body chemistry .
It ’s the chemicals pulsing through traders ’ veins that propel them to place insane bets and enable bank executives to make risky decisions — and those same chemicals tend to have the same effect on everyone , turning them into a herd of overheated animals .
And because the vast majority of these traders and finance executives are men , the most important chemical in question is testosterone .
Here are a few things we know about testosterone :
Both men and women produce it , but men make fifteen times as much of it as women , on average .
It causes all sorts of physical differences — in body hair , muscle mass , jawlines , and so on .
Behaviorally , it does all the things that one would expect :
It is linked to increased aggression and dominance , confidence , hostility , violence , sensation - seeking , and the searching out of mates ( “ I felt like I had to have sex once a day or I would die , ” Drew — formerly Susan — Seidman told The Village Voice , after having testosterone injections as part of his transformation from a woman to a man ) .
One of the most fascinating things about testosterone is the way it can be influenced by the environment .
A man who stays home with his kids , for example , is likely to see his testosterone level drop over time .
Testosterone varies throughout the day , peaking in the morning and gradually ebbing through the afternoon .
Perhaps not surprisingly , single men have higher levels than married men .
If you eat more meat , it tends to be higher .
As it does when a man is in the presence of an attractive woman , or looking at the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue .
Or in a highly competitive environment with other guys , like a rugby game — or the Bear Stearns trading floor .

Anna Dreber , an economics researcher at Harvard ’s Kennedy School , started studying testosterone as a possible explanation for why there tend to be few women in certain fields — math , say , or kickboxing , Dreber ’s sport of choice .
Through studies conducted at the Harvard biological - anthropology department , Dreber found that appetite for risk in simulated investment games correlated with high testosterone levels and with facial characteristics such as sharp cheekbones and strong jaws that are normally associated with the hormone .
“ There is a clear sign that something biological explains risk taking , ” she says .
Testosterone is not the only chemical that affects it — the stress hormone cortisol has a role , as well as the neurotransmitter dopamine , among others — but it ’s by far the most powerful .
Dreber has been thinking about the issue a lot recently , especially after reading the reports about AIG ’s London office , a hothouse where a small group of men almost brought down the world economy .
“ When you have this place with all these male traders taking enormous risk , ” she says , “ I can imagine that being in a very competitive environment with lots of other competitive males makes the testosterone go up , which leads to even more risk . ”
Another study Dreber has in the works will look at the effects of the hormones in the birth - control pill on women , because women having their periods have been shown to act more like men in terms of risk - taking behavior .
“ When I present that in seminars , I say men are like women menstruating , ” she says , laughing .
Dreber is not the only one to see human behavior on Wall Street in such starkly biological terms .
To Terry Burnham , economist and author of Mean Markets and Lizard Brains : How to Profit From the New Science of Irrationality , modern finance is a jungle where apes are strutting around , puffing out their chests and stealing each other ’s women and bananas .
Burnham ’s metatheory is that human beings have n’t evolved nearly as rapidly as their environment has since the Stone Age .
One could argue that technology — the ability to make enormous trades in the blink of an eye with supersonic computers — only exaggerates the primal , emotional element , allowing people to respond in a flash to their biochemical urges .
The better the machines the more our animal instincts take over .
“ The caricature view would be , the caveman wins the battle , has more babies , crushes his enemies , then puts on a suit 10,000 years later and goes into a boardroom and still wants to crush his enemies , ” Burnham says .
Burnham wanted to understand self - defeating behaviors in the business world , such as why good companies pay billions of dollars to buy crappy companies ( Time Warner - AOL ) , or why a male friend of mine who shall remain nameless doubled down on Citigroup shares at $ 50 .
In a study conducted at Harvard , Burnham found that higher - testosterone men were more likely to reject money that was offered to them if someone else was getting a larger share .
A similar study at the University of British Columbia looked at the question through the lens of mergers and acquisitions , the primal psychodrama of corporate America .
The authors found that the younger a CEO was , and therefore the higher his testosterone level ( and the lesser his experience ) , the more likely he was to walk away from merger negotiations , even when the deal was in the company ’s best interest .
“ Having too many men involved in business might cause them to take more risks , and having more women would probably be good in lots of settings , ” Burnham says .
“ Women are the brake pedal . ”
Last year at Davos , a spontaneous ( and slightly goofy ) discussion broke out about whether Lehman Brothers would have failed if the company had been called Lehman Sisters .
( They might have forgotten that there was at least one sister , Erin Callan , but she had only just become CFO when things fell apart . )
The conclusion was that Lehman would probably still be in business , although it also would have made less money during the boom years .
That ’s the thing about Wall Street :
Until the crash , no one wanted to hire traders of either gender who did n’t have a large appetite for risk .
In that model , the lows might have been very , very low , but the highs were astronomical : For every Brian Hunter , the rogue trader from the hedge fund Amaranth Advisors , which lost $ 6.6 billion largely because of his bets on the natural - gas market , you have an Andrew Hall , the Phibro trader who was owed a $ 100 million bonus after his unit made $ 2 billion for Citigroup over the last five years .
Terri Duhon , now a consultant in London , worked as an interest - rate swaps trader at JPMorgan before joining the group that invented credit derivatives .
Duhon says that she is considered quite aggressive — for a woman — but when she started trading on the swaps desk in the nineties , she discovered she was not comfortable with the type of risk - taking involved .
She recalled a day when she made a very risky trade and was worried about it , and realized there were other traders who took a more cavalier attitude toward the possibility of losing big .
After all , many traders who blow up manage to resurrect themselves .
“ Someone said to me , ‘ If he can lose a lot of money , it means he can take the risk to make a lot of money .
He has the balls to do it , ’ ” Duhon says .
She had never heard anyone articulate the “ testicles ” explanation quite so explicitly before .
“ It ’s what some banks do .
They put these young guys in there who are prepared to take the risk . ”
For better or worse , the women traders I spoke with tended to classify themselves as more conservative than their male counterparts .
A self - described math nerd , Nancy Davis was head of Goldman Sachs ’ proprietary derivatives - trading desk for five years .
“ I think generally , women are more likely to admit that they ’re wrong , faster .
I think there ’s less ego for whatever reason with women traders , the ones I know at least , ” she says .
She made a habit of keeping her boss in the loop on every trade — something she calls having “ buy - in . ”
“ If there ’s a position going sour on me , I ’m not going to sit and say , ‘ I know what ’s best . ’
It would make me want to raise my hand and get advice from other people .
It ’s like asking for directions when driving . ”
A former boss of mine — a hedge - fund manager named Nancy — once barked out one of the most useful pieces of stock - buying advice I ’ve ever heard .
One of her consultants had amassed in his personal account a huge position in a tech company , Rambus , having ridden it from something like $ 10 a share to well above $ 100 .
It was the height of the Internet boom , and the normally self - effacing geek was strutting around the office , dizzy with future plans for his nest egg .
Nancy would peer at him over her monitors , egg - salad sandwich in hand , and say , “ Sell half . ”
It was the sort of conservative strategy she tended to practice herself — and of course it is an investment strategy that many men practice as well .
But sadly her tech consultant was n’t one of them .
He was certain that the thing would keep going higher , and the thought of missing out on it made him crazy .
Months later , when Rambus tanked , he rode it all the way back down .
John Coates , a senior research fellow in neuroscience and finance at the University of Cambridge , studies just this sort of magical thinking .
During the IPO heyday of the late nineties , before he became a full - time scientist , Coates was running a trading desk at Deutsche Bank .
“ Male traders were acting odd during the bubble , ” he recalls .
“ They were displaying what we call clinical symptoms of mania .
They were delusional , euphoric , overconfident , had racing thoughts , a diminished need for sleep . ”
One of his colleagues — a “ kid ” with a general - arts degree and $ 500,000 - a- year salary — quit his job to start a nebulous Internet company .
“ I asked him what the Internet company would do , and he said he did n’t know yet , ” Coates says .
Meanwhile , the few women on the desk seemed mostly unaffected by the frenzy .
“ The guys had their eyes rolling back in their heads , desperate to get involved in what some genius was up to , and the women just did n’t buy into it . ”
“ The banking crisis was caused by doing what nosociety ever allows : permitting young males to behave in an unregulated way .
Anyone who studied neurobiology would have predicted disaster . ”
Positioning himself as a sort of endocrine whisperer of the financial system , Coates argues that if women made up 50 percent of the financial world , “ I do n’t think you ’d see the volatile swings that we ’re seeing . ”
Bubbles , he believes , may be “ a male phenomenon . ”
His colleague , neuroscientist Joe Herbert , agrees .
“ The banking crisis was caused by doing what no society ever allows , permitting young males to behave in an unregulated way , ” he says .
“ Anyone who studied neurobiology would have predicted disaster . ”
At Cambridge , Coates and Herbert launched a study of the way testosterone and cortisol — which is released by the body in response to stress — rose and fell in a group of traders in London as they worked the markets .
Testosterone surged in traders who were experiencing winning streaks , leading to a greater sense of confidence and a higher propensity for taking risks .
This improved the trader ’s chances of winning again , in a kind of positive - feedback loop .
At some point , though , the effect of the testosterone became toxic , and traders made decisions that were self - defeating , almost stupid .
Cortisol , the stress hormone , behaved differently , shooting up with the volatility of the market .
When the market started to crash , cortisol spiked as well , possibly exaggerating the sell - off .
When Coates first suggested that men on trading floors might be at the mercy of a swirling cocktail of hormones , he expected traders to be offended .
“ But every trader knows , when you ’re on a winning streak you act like a dickhead , and then you end up giving back all the money you made on the way up , ” he says .
“ I actually got a lot of e-mails from traders saying it was good to know where this odd behavior comes from . ”
Dug Hirschhorn , a well - built fellow with a shiny bald head and feline features , bills himself as a “ peak performance coach ” to Wall Street traders .
He tries to teach men to make better decisions and to avoid destructive habits , such as becoming too emotional about their positions or not knowing when to cut their losses and sell .
“ I literally have to deconstruct a lot of their testosterone , ” Hirschhorn says .
“ A lot of behaviors that are counterproductive to success in trading are typical male traits , such as being too aggressive , too stubborn , or being ego driven . ”
Today , Hirschhorn is working with a portfolio manager who is responsible for trading about $ 100 million , a fellow whom we ’ll call “ Ken ” because he ’s embarrassed to use his real name .
Ken is blond and trim , and wears snug - fitting jeans and a watch that looks like it weighs about eight pounds .
His forearms are muscled and tan .
He sees himself as akin to a professional athlete , a money - producing machine in need of constant tweaking to operate at its optimal level .
Hirschhorn is the guy who gives him a rub and a squirt of water when he takes a break from being pounded in the ring .
“ Look , I ’m good , but I ’m inefficient about how I spend my time , ” Ken says .
“ I ’m here to try to get better . ”
He proceeds to vent about various things : the slightly co-dependent , old - married - couple - sounding relationship he has with the trader who works for him , and a fraught investment they made in a finance company that ’s in trouble and may be rescued by the government .
“ It ’s so fucking small , it ’s almost aggravating to me , ” Ken says about the position .
“ I know we ’re going to end up losing money on it . ”
“ By having you journal every day , are you noticing that you ’re more intentional with how you spend your time ? ” Hirschhorn asks .
( I keep expecting one of them to break out laughing , but it does n’t happen — they are dead serious . )
Ken says he does n’t want to admit to people that he ’s writing everything he does down in a notebook , but Hirschhorn thinks it ’s an important step in becoming more conscious of his actions , and less likely to get swept up in his emotions .
Earlier in his career , Ken says he was consumed by competitiveness , his decisions driven by a desire to beat the guy beside him .
“ I wanted to not only get money , but I wanted to get style points , ” he says .
Now , he continues , “ who gives a fuck ?
It might make me right , but it does n’t make me a good portfolio manager . ”
“ This guy is very self - aware , ” Hirschhorn tells me later .
“ Usually , it ’s a guy who played football at Notre Dame , who drinks beers and plays sports . ”
If journaling seems like a long way to go for a trader to get in touch with his feminine side , it ’s not the most extreme example .
In a bizarre piece of finance history that has entered the realm of lore , a junior trader at the Greenwich - based hedge fund SAC Capital filed a sexual - harassment suit in 2007 against his boss , alleging that he ordered him to take female hormone pills to soften his demeanor and improve his trading .
The story is wacky , to be sure , but it was n’t entirely shocking to Hirschhorn .
“ I do n’t think greed is gender specific , ” he says .
“ But if you ask me whether Long - Term Capital Management would have blown up if there were more women involved in the decision - making process ?
A woman might have said , ‘ Let ’s not assume we ’ll never be wrong . ’ ”
While he was working on his Ph.D. in sports psychology , Hirschhorn got an offer to join what was then one of the largest proprietary trading firms in the country — with 1,200 traders , many of them former sports players — and help them improve their trading .
“ What was most interesting to me , was that out of the twenty women who were there , five of them were tremendously successful , so the ratio of success for the women was 25 percent , whereas it was maybe 2 percent for the men , ” he says .
He found that it was easier to teach women when to be more aggressive than it was to lessen the overaggression of the males .
“ I ’ve always kept it in the back of my mind , ” he continues .
“ I always thought it was the overlooked aspect of Wall Street — there are very few women in high positions . ”
Hirschhorn is peddling his ideas about gender and risk to a number of investment banks .
“ They could hire twenty elite women and mentor and develop them to become super - traders , ” he says .
So far , he ’s had few takers .
“ Their philosophy is hire 1,000 men , and if three become rock stars , that pays for the whole model . ”
It ’s perhaps not surprising that one of the first experiments in all - estrogen asset management is happening in a place with nothing left to lose .
From her perch as director of Iceland ’s Chamber of Commerce , Halla Tómasdóttir watched with concern as the global debt bubble grew and grew .
In 2007 , she decided to start her own investment company with another woman .
“ We wanted to put more feminine values into finance , ” says Tómasdóttir , now the chairman of Audur Capital .
“ The financial sector was created by men , 99 percent of the employees are men .
It was like herd behavior :
They all think the same , they ’re all from the same school , with the same friends , the same jargon , the same books .
You get very unbalanced as a consequence . ”
While the Icelandic economy was decimated after a multiyear binge of borrowing and investing in real estate and other assets that plummeted in value , Audur Capital has turned a modest profit since it launched .
The company philosophy :
Only invest in things its managers can explain and understand .
“ It does n’t make much sense to us to invest in something and try to make 30 percent in one year , only to lose 60 percent the next year , ” Tómasdóttir says .
Of course , to some , turning a modest profit is nothing to get excited about .
“ If you are a cowboy investor , ” she admits , “ we are probably not your place of choice . ”
Tómasdóttir has conducted some academic research of her own .
In 2004 , she embarked on a doctorate , which she never finished .
The working name for her thesis was “ The Great Big Penis Competition : The Story of Mergers and Acquisitions in Iceland . ”
She explains : “ The reason I called it that was — and I do n’t want to be vulgar — but the kind of behaviors you have seen , have to be best described as a territorial pissing contest .
It ’s always been about who ’s the biggest , who owns more , who ’s the first on the richest - people list . ”
Of course , not even the author of “ The Great Big Penis Competition ” would argue that all men are aggressive , egotistical , and stubborn — or that all women are conservative , rational , and levelheaded .
And being reductionist about hormones and gender is a sure way to misjudge a complicated individual .
When I was talking to Sheila Bair , the chairman of the FDIC , about the testosterone research and its implications for the financial markets , the two men sitting in on our interview — Andrew Gray , her press director , and Jesse Villarreal , her chief of staff — burst out with horrified laughter , as if it were the most absurd thing they ’ve ever heard .
Bair responded more carefully .
“ With some of those academic studies , I can see what they ’re saying , and I think there may be some truth to that , with the caveat that you should never categorize people , ” she said .
“ Perhaps from a risk - management standpoint , having diversity and different perspectives and attitudes is helpful . ”
While Bair is regarded in some circles as a prudent , risk - averse regulator who helped save the banking system , she ’s made quite a few enemies along the way .
She ’s publicly feuded with Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit , even pushing for a shake - up in Citi ’s management .
Meanwhile , Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has reportedly fought to push Bair out of her job .
Sitting in her carpeted Washington , D.C. , offices , I ask Bair if she thinks she ’s outspoken .
“ Am I outspoken ? ” she asks , laughing nervously .
“ I would say I ’m direct . ”
But do n’t let her feminine nervous laughter fool you .
“ She was very aggressive , both in public and in private , ” says a former Treasury official under Paulson .
“ And , you know , it had nothing to do with her gender . ”
Watt family terrorised estate Troubled life of murder victim ' Slave ' called abusers family
Three people have been found guilty of the murder of a man whose dismembered body was found in a Bedfordshire lake .
The headless body of 26 - year - old Michael Gilbert was found in the Blue Lagoon in Arlesey last May .
He had been tortured for his benefit money and kept as a " slave " by his attackers , Luton Crown Court heard .
James Watt , 27 , his girlfriend Natasha Oldfield , 29 , and his brother 's girlfriend , Nichola Roberts , 21 , were convicted of his murder .
James 's brother Robert Watt , 20 , and his mother Jennifer Smith - Dennis , both of Chertsey Close , Luton , were found guilty of familial homicide .
Natasha Oldfield , also of Chertsey Close , was also found guilty of assisting an offender .
A third brother , Richard Watt , 25 , had previously admitted familial homicide .
All were also found guilty of perverting the course of justice and will be sentenced at Luton Crown Court on Monday .
' Years of violence ' Antonio Watt , the brothers ' 70 - year - old father , was acquitted of familial homicide last month and was found not guilty of perverting the course of justice .
Mr Gilbert , described in court as " vulnerable " , met James
Watt when they were both 15 and living at a children 's home , the court heard .
He was later introduced to the Watt family and went to live with them .
Natasha Oldfield , James Watt and Nichola Roberts were guilty of murder
The prosecution said Mr Gilbert had been hit with bats , shot and stabbed , with the beatings often filmed on mobile phones .
Mr Gilbert , who was forced to do chores , escaped several times from the Watts ' Luton house , but was forced to return .
When Mr Gilbert escaped , James
Watt would pose as him and , using his National Insurance number , discover where he was collecting benefits .
He would then use that information to find him and bring him back .
Detectives believe he died overnight between 21 and 22 January 2009 .
Mr Gilbert 's body was wrapped in layers of black bags and cling - film and placed in a builder 's bag , stowed in the boot of Robert Watt 's car and driven to the lagoon where a fishing trolley , and later a wheelbarrow , was used to transport the corpse on the mile - long walk to the lagoon .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Gilbert 's headless corpse was spotted by two anglers fishing at the lagoon last May .
His knee joints , forearm and elbow were missing , as well as the head , although the torso and some other body parts were present .
Mr Gilbert 's severed head was not discovered until February this year , along with the other missing body parts .
Richard
Watt was temporarily taken out of prison to help police find it , after pleading guilty to familial homicide and perverting the course of justice .
The court heard after the verdicts that James Watt has 14 previous convictions for 22 different offences , including affray and an airgun shooting .
If Michael could have just fought back just once and defended himself years ago when it started , the violence would have ended
Mr Gilbert 's mother Rosalie White Robert Watt has two previous convictions , including battery and theft , while their mother was of good character , the court was told .
Mr Gilbert 's family said they believed he kept quiet about the abuse to protect them .
His mother , Rosalie White , 49 , said if her own children had been doing what the Watt brothers were doing , she would have " shopped " them .
She said : " That mother [ Jennifer Smith - Dennis ] could have done something to help Michael and never did .
" If Michael could have just fought back just once and defended himself years ago when it started , the violence would have ended .
Instead he would stand there and take it . "
Det Ch Insp Jon Humphries , from the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit , said of Mr Gilbert : " For years he was seriously assaulted and threatened in order to keep him there and the jury heard how his abuse became their entertainment .
" The callousness shown by all those involved in this trial is beyond anything that I have witnessed in over 26 years service . "
The Luton Safeguarding Of Vulnerable Adults Board ( SOVA ) has announced a Serious Case Review into how social services dealt with Mr Gilbert .
It aims to establish if anything could have been done differently by the local professionals and agencies who work to safeguard vulnerable adults .

CAMBRIDGE , Mass. , March 2 , 2010 - Fictional candy maker Willy Wonka called his whimsical device to sort good chocolate eggs from bad , an eggucator .
Likewise , by determining what enzymes and compounds to keep and which to discard , scientists are aiming to find their own golden eggs : more potent drugs and cleaner sources of energy .
Toward that end , Harvard researchers and a team of international collaborators demonstrated a new microfluidic sorting device that rapidly analyzes millions of biological reactions .
Smaller than an iPod Nano , the device analyzes reactions a 1,000 - times faster and uses 10 million - fold less volumes of reagent than conventional state - of - the - art robotic methods .
The scientists anticipate that the invention could reduce screening costs by 1 million - fold and make directed evolution , a means of engineering tailored biological compounds , more commonplace in the lab .
" Our finding is not so much a scientific discovery , but the first demonstration of a new technology , " says project leader Jeremy Agresti , a former research associate in the lab of co-author David Weitz , Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics and of Applied Physics in the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences ( SEAS ) and Department of Physics .
" What limits new areas of research in biology and biotechnology is the ability to assay or to do experiments on many different variables in parallel at once . "
The team 's technology , first reported in the February 8th online Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , bypasses conventional limitations through the use of drop - based microfluidics , squeezing tiny capsules of liquid through a series of intricate tubes , each narrower than a single human hair .
" Each microscopic drop can trap an individual cell and thus it becomes like a miniature test tube , " explains Amy Rowat , a postdoctoral fellow at SEAS .
" The drops are coated with a surfactant , or stabilization molecule , that prevents the drops from coalescing with each other and also prevents the contents from sticking to the wall of the drops . "
To sort , the system removes inactive and unwanted compounds , dumping the drops into a " bad egg " bin , and guides the others into a " keep " container .
Specifically , as the drops flow through the channels they eventually encounter a junction ( a two - channel fork ) .
Left alone , the drops will naturally flow towards the path of least fluidic resistance , or the waste channel .
The device identifies the desired drops by using a laser focused on the channel before the fork to read a drop 's fluorescence level .
The drops with greater intensity of fluorescence ( those exhibiting the highest levels of activity ) are pulled towards the keep channel by the application of an electrical force , a process known as dielectrophoresis .
" Our concept was to build a miniature laboratory for performing biological experiments quickly and efficiently , " explains collaborator Adam Abate , a postdoctoral fellow in applied physics at SEAS .
" To do this we needed to construct microfluidic versions of common bench - top tasks , such as isolating cells in a compartment , adding reagents , and sorting the good from the bad .
The challenge was to do this with microscopic drops flowing past at thousands per second . "
" The sorting process is remarkably efficient and fast .
By shrinking down the reaction size to 10 picoliters of volumes , we increased the sorting speed by the same amount , " adds Agresti .
" In our demonstration with horseradish peroxidase , we evolved and improved an already efficient enzyme by sorting through 100 million variants and choosing the best among them . "
In particular , the researchers were struck by the ability to increase the efficiency of an already efficient enzyme to near its theoretical maximum , the diffusion limit , where the enzyme can produce products as quickly as a new substrate can bump into it .
Using conventional means , the sorting process would have taken several years .
Such a dramatic reduction of time could be a boon for the burgeoning field of synthetic biology .
For example , a biofuels developer could use the device to screen populations of millions of organisms or metabolic pathways to find the most efficient producer of a chemical or fuel .
Likewise , scientists could speed up the pace of drug development , determining the best chemical candidate compounds and then evolving them based upon desired properties .
" The high speed of our technique allows us to go through multiple cycles of mutation and screening in a very short time , " says Agresti .
" This is the way evolution works best .
The more generations you can get through , the faster you can make progress . "

Movie buffs and fans all over the world have different ways to show their love of movies .
Some collect memorabilia ( that ’s me ) , stacking mound upon mound of figures and collectibles all over their walls , and others show their support in more subtle ways .
However , there are those fans out there who like to demonstrate their love in a more permanent way : tattoos .
If you ’re similarly inclined you might want to take a gander at some of these tattoos , which are some of the best examples of artwork I ’ve ever seen put on a person ’s body .
The arms do n’t look nearly as good as this dude ’s chest does , but more than anything it ’s the creative idea behind this tattoo that stands above the rest .
Sure we ’ve seen Spider - Man tattoos before , but a mere symbol just does n’t look as cool as a suit bursting out of you .
About the only complaint I have with this one is the placement .
When it comes to tattoos location is key .
The artwork is great and it ’s an interesting design , but it loses some luster when the faces appear warped because they wrap around the arm .
I was actually very surprised to find a Clock Work Orange tattoo , let alone one that looks so good .
Taking from the poster ’s design this blends in seamlessly and at first I thought it was the poster , until I looked a little closer .
I guess The Nightmare Before Christmas is trendy in the ink world , because I found a ridiculous amount of these .
The problem is just about all of them suck .
This one stood out mostly for the detail and artwork .
Seriously google those kinds of tattoos and you ’ll see what I mean .
Okay , I kind of cheated on this one , it ’s a Lord of the Rings tattoo but it ’s more associated with the books , as it ’s elvish writing in a circular pattern .
Still , it ’s hard to ignore that this is one awesome looking design .
Nice artwork , great reference to pull from .
All around I would call this a win .
The only problem is this hot blue alien chick is on a dude .
Total buzz kill .
You did n’t think I ’d do an article like this and not bring up Star Wars tattoos ?
They did a whole book about them ( “ The Force in the Flesh ” ) so I wo n’t elaborate too much here , but I ’ll will show you a few of the more creative ones .
There are so many great tattoos out there it ’s getting hard to top them , but by no means does that stop people from trying .
If you ’ve got a movie tattoo ( or a great tattoo you think should have been on this list ) we ’d love for you to share it with us .
Post them in the comments or drop us a line at [ email protected ] and we ’ll highlight those in the next couple weeks .

My automatic rule - based time tracker ( arbtt ) , which is written in Haskell , collects every minute a data sample consisting mainly of the list of currently open windows ( window title and program name ) .
Naturally , this log grows rather large .
Since October of last year , I collected 70,000 samples .
I already went from a text - based file format to a binary format using Data .
Binary , which gave a big performance boost .
But by now , I was afraid that this is not enough .
My log file is now 30 MB large .
Looking at the memory graph of gnome - panel , it is taking up more than half of my memory .
When running arbtt- stats , the Haskell run time system reports 569 MB total memory in use and the command finishes after 28.5 seconds .
Naturally , the log file is highly redundant : Compressing it with bzip2 shrinks it to 1.6MB .
But as I would like to preserve the ability to just append samples at the end , without having to read the file , I chose not just to add bzip2 or gzip compression .
Rather , I am now exploiting a very obvious redundancy :
Two adjacent samples usually list exactly the same windows , and a focus change only changes a flag .
So now , when storing a string that is part of a sample , it will check if this string was already present in the previous sample and , in this case , just store the number of that string ( one byte ) .
Only if the string was not present it will write a zero byte and then the string .
When reading the sample , the process is reversed .
This greatly reduces the file size :
It is down to 6.2MB .
It also improves the memory consumption , due to Haskell ’s abilities with regard to sharing :
When a reference to a string in a previous sample is read , then only one instance of this string is in memory , even if it occurs several times in the log .
This brings the memory consumption down to 264 MB and the runtime to 17 seconds .
I released the changes as version 0.4.5.1 to Hackage , Debian and as a Windows installer .
The log file is not automatically converted , but new samples will be written in the compressed format .
If you want to convert your whole file , you have to stop arbtt - capture , run arbtt - recover , and then move the hopefully noticeable smaller ~/.arbtt/capture.log.recovered to ~/.arbtt/capture.log .
The required code changes were not too big .
I somewhat isolated the relevant code in the Data .
Binary .
StringRef module .
Unfortunately , I have to use OverlappingInstances to be able to provide the special instance for String – is there a cleaner way ( besides the trick used for the Show class ) ?

ARCHIVES | SEARCH Allaple Virus Author Sentenced Posted by Mikko @ 11:20 GMT
An Estonian virus writer has been sentenced to jail in Harju , Estonia .
The author of the Allaple virus family , 44 - year old Mr. Artur Boiko pleaded not guilty .
Nevertheless , he was found guilty and sentenced to 2 years and 7 months in prison .
Allaple is a complex worm using polymorphic encryption .
It spreads over network shares and by modifying local HTML files .
When such HTML files are uploaded to public websites , they spread the infection further .
Apparently Mr. Boiko had been in a car accident and had ended up in dispute over his insurance claim with If Insurance .
As a result , his worm launches DDoS attacks against these sites :
www.if.ee ( website of the insurance company )
www.online.if.ee ( customer online interface of the insurance company )
www.starman.ee ( website of a local ISP )
The DDoS attacks were quite serious — see this post from ISC Diary in 2007 .
We detected several variants of Allaple during 2006 - 2007 .
The problem is that this is not a botnet — these worms have no command and control channel .
The infected machines will attack their targets until they are cleaned .
There are still thousands of active , infected computers today around the world , and they are still attacking .
And the worm is still spreading further .
Snapshot from F - Secure interface showing new samples on 11th of March 2010
Boiko was sentenced to prison , where he has already been awaiting his trial for 19 months .
He was also sentenced to pay the following sums to cover losses :
To If Insurance : 5.1 Million Estonian Kroons ( about 330000 Euros or 450000 USD )
To Starman ISP : 1.4 Million Estonian Kroons ( about 91000 Euros or 130000 USD )

What He Should Be Known For :
Aside from wanting to have a place in our hearts forever , Winchell was also interested in medicine and inventing shit .
Among his patents were a flameless cigarette lighter , battery - heated gloves and an invisible garter .
Pictured : Genius .

The most famous design he had , however , was n't for recreational purposes but for being alive purposes :
The man designed the first artificial heart .
With the help of Dr. Henry Heimlich - - of " thank you for giving men a reason to grope women while masking it as a life - saving technique " fame -- the two invented the device , and were the very first to acquire a patent for it .
A Dr. Jarvik came out with a heart shortly thereafter but , of course , Winchell already had the patent .
Jarvik denies that his design was influenced in any way by the voice actor 's patent , but Dr. Heimlich maintains that both hearts are exactly the same , thus making Jarvik 's claim utterly " ridicarus , " as Tigger might say , or " bullshit , " as Winchell might .
" Artificial - heart - patenting is what Winchell 's do best . "

The Jefferson County Attorney ’s office has dismissed all criminal charges against the owner of a botanical plant distribution warehouse that was at the center of the K2 controversy .
Lawrence resident Jonathan Sloan , owner of Bouncing Bear Botanicals in Oskaloosa , was arrested in February and charged with eight felony drug offenses , including the unlawful manufacture and distribution of controlled substances .
The arrest came after federal , state and local authorities raided Sacred Journey , 1103 Mass . in downtown Lawrence , seizing the marijuana - like substance K2 .
Sloan ’s warehouse , which supplied Sacred Journey with K2 and a number of other herbal products , was also raided .
Investigators seized more than $ 700,000 in cash from the business and bank accounts and took several items from the warehouse , including thousands of cactus plants and 20 toads .
Sloan was scheduled to appear in Jefferson County court for a preliminary hearing in the case on Tuesday .
Sloan did not return calls seeking comment .
Jefferson County Attorney Caleb Stegall said while the charges are dismissed , the investigation is on - going .
“ My office expects to refile charges if they are warranted once the investigation is complete , ” Stegall said .
Bouncing Bear Botanicals is back in operation , according to the business ’s Web site .
The warehouse , located on Hwy. 59 north of Lawrence , is one of the largest suppliers of ethnobotanicals in the country .

Want a great deal on a Facebook account ?
A Russian hacker who calls himself " kirllos " claims he can sell you 1,000 unsuspecting users ' login credentials for just $ 25 , or $ 45 if the accounts have more than 10 friends each .
The hacker is believed to have stolen the IDs of 1.5 million Facebook users .
If accurate , that means one out of every 300 Facebook users may have been victimized .
Kirllos is selling the information on an underground hacker website , according to VeriSign 's iDefense Labs .
The cybersecurity company estimates that kirllos has sold around 700,000 accounts so far , but VeriSign was unable to verify if any of the accounts are legitimate accounts belonging to real Facebook users .
Kirllos ' prices are incredibly cheap compared to other scams for sale .
E-mail usernames and passwords usually fetch between $ 1 to $ 20 each , according to Symantec 's latest Internet Security Threat Report .
In contrast , Kirllos is claiming he will sell accounts for as little as 25 cents each .
According to Mashable , hacking Facebook " is n't a new hobby for this person . "
The site has a screenshot of another offer kirllos allegedly made last year when he claimed to be selling 100,000 compromised accounts .
Users whose Facebook ID 's and passwords have been stolen could be vulnerable to identity theft or even " more insidious scams , " Mashable says .
Facebook is investigating the specific accounts kirllos has put up for sale , and will block access to those that have been hacked until they can be restored to their original users , according to Facebook 's Simon Axten .
" We invest heavily in helping people keep their accounts secure and have a team of security professionals who investigate specific attacks on our users and work with law enforcement to pursue those responsible , " Axten said .
Users can find more details the process Facebook uses to spot hacked accounts and go to Facebook 's security page to learn more about protecting themselves online .
Here is more information on what to do if your account has been compromised and how to report a hacked account .

Shell halts gasoline sales to Iran
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Royal Dutch
Shell has stopped selling gasoline to Iran , the company confirmed Wednesday , adding to a list of oil giants that have stopped sales after a threat of future U.S. sanctions .
Royal Dutch Shell ( RDS ) said it had no official announcement beyond the confirmation , but according to someone with knowledge of the situation the company ceased gas sales to Iran sometime in 2009 .
" Shell is currently not selling gasoline to Iran , " a Shell spokesman said , but he would not comment on whether the decision was related to talk of possible U.S. sanctions on Iranian gasoline imports .
Concerns have grown over Iran 's nuclear program , and last month the Senate passed a bill that would allow President Obama to expand sanctions against Iran to pressure the republic into dropping its plans .
Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes , but some fear the country wants to develop nuclear weapons .
Under the Senate bill , Obama could impose new sanctions that would ban most direct imports and exports between Iran and the United States .
" If there was new legislation or sanctions , obviously we would comply with them as we would for any country , " the Shell spokesman said .
The House passed its own sanctions bill last year , and in order to become law the two bills would have to be merged and approved by both bodies before going to Obama for his signature .
According to Reuters , Shell shipped about 1.65 million barrels of gasoline into Iran from April through October 2009 .
In a State Department briefing , spokesman P.J. Crowley said the agency would continue " to move forward with prospective sanctions , and I expect you 'll see this advance over the next several weeks . "
Crowley added : " We are looking for countries and companies to be supportive as we try to find the right formula to put economic and political pressure on Iran to change its course . "

Hundreds of people have been evacuated from near a restless volcano in Iceland amid signs of a second eruption .
Seismic activity suggested movement from under the Eyjafjallajokull glacier , authorities said .
The volcano under the glacier last erupted March 20 after almost 200 years of silence .
Flash floods are feared with a second eruption .
Tory party officials refused to meet the Electoral Commission in the course of the election watchdog 's 14 - month investigation into £ 5 m it received from a company owned by Lord Ashcroft .
The commission ruled that the donations did not breach election laws , but it noted that Tory officials declined invitations to explain the details of arrangements in person .
The revelations pose new questions for the Conservatives over their acceptance of the money , which has been ploughed into marginal seats ahead of the election .
Senior figures will be called to give an account of their decision to accept the cash .
In its report , the commission says it cannot conclude whether the Tories complied with their duty to be certain about the identity of the donor because it was unable to question party officers directly .
It notes internal party emails – and sections of Ashcroft 's book Dirty Politics , Dirty Times , which suggest the donations were from him rather than his company but it could not make a decision without direct evidence .
The commission also expressed strong frustrations at its inability to compel either the Tories or Ashcroft to give evidence in person and the fact that it could not order Bearwood to release any private documents .
The commission dismissed two charges : that Bearwood was not functioning as a proper company in the UK and that it was in fact a proxy for Ashcroft to make donations .
The decision will be a huge relief to the party , which faced paying back £ 5.1 m if the donations were ruled impermissible .
Jenny Watson , chair of the commission , announcing that Bearwood had been cleared , said : " We had concerns , based on some of the evidence , about the degree of certainty within the Conservative party about the identity of the donor , but based on the evidence before us , the commission considered that there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that the party was uncertain about the identity of the donor when they accepted the donations .
" We have asked to meet party officials to ensure that they are clear about their responsibilities for complying with this aspect of the law . "
The commission 's report describes its powers as " limited " , saying it could not require the donor to release documents .
" The commission currently has no power to require potential witnesses to attend for interview .
Within the limits of its current powers , the commission conducted a thorough investigation . "
John Mann , the Labour MP who made the complaint , said : " The report opens up more questions than it answers .
There 's no surprise that without the powers they needed they could n't establish the facts . "
A Conservative party spokesman said : " Following an 18 - month investigation , the Electoral Commission has definitively concluded that donations made by Bearwood , the company in which Lord Ashcroft has an interest , were legal , permissible and correctly reported .
It has now been put beyond doubt that donations from Bearwood were entirely legitimate .
" Separately , we also know that Lord Ashcroft is non-domiciled , putting him in exactly the same position as Labour and Lib Dem donors such as Lord Paul .
" This means the Conservative party 's clean bill of health with the Electoral Commission remains fully intact . "
The spokesman went on to say that continued attacks on Lord Ashcroft were politically motivated .
The decision and the commission 's apparent frustration will prompt concerns that the investigators could not unravel Ashcroft 's complex financial affairs .
Mann 's initial complaint claimed that Bearwood was in breach of electoral law because it was not trading in Britain when it gave money .
Donations from overseas companies are prohibited by law .
The ultimate source of the Ashcroft millions that have helped bankroll the Tories in the past appears to be Belize , the Caribbean tax haven that the billionaire has claimed in the past to be his home .
But the route that the money follows on its 5,200 - mile journey from the impoverished country to Conservative HQ – and then out to Britain 's marginal constituencies – is highly complex .
In recent years , the tycoon 's donations to the party have been made by Bearwood Corporate Services ( BCS ) , a company registered in the UK and with a registered office at the offices of its auditors , BDO Stoy Hayward , in Southampton .
During the year ending March 2006 , BCS received £ 4.79 m in cash for shares that were bought by its holding company , Bearwood Corporate Holdings .
Bearwood Holdings had received that money by selling shares in itself to another company , Astraporta UK , for £ 5.54 m .
Astraporta , in turn , appears to have received its funds , around £ 6 m , by selling shares to a company registered in Belize called Stargate Holdings .
Where Stargate receives its funds is unclear .
It is registered offshore – at a registry controlled by an Ashcroft company .
When the Guardian visited the registry 's offices in Belize City to inquire about Stargate , a registry official said : " You will never know who owns Stargate . "
Astraporta and Bearwood Holdings were put into liquidation last year and were formally dissolved on Monday , just as Ashcroft was making his announcement that he was a " non-dom " .
This morning it was also announced that Ashcroft will be invited to appear before MPs to explain his version of how he came to be awarded his peerage in 2000 on the basis of a promise to become a permanent resident in the UK and how he subsequently renegotiated that deal to avoid paying taxes on his international earnings .
The Commons public administration committee is to conduct an inquiry before the election , starting with a hearing on 18 March at which senior civil servants will also be quizzed on their role in the affair .
SAN FRANCISCO –
On the eve of President Obama ’s first State of the Union address , people in over 130 communities around the country rallied at Congressional offices Jan. 26 , pressing the president and Congress to step up to the plate and pass a “ strong health care reform bill ” quickly .
The gatherings were organized by MoveOn.org , Health Care for America Now and other groups , in response to pessimistic predictions that after last week ’s Republican victory in the Massachusetts Senate election , chances for strong health care legislation had dwindled .
As commuters streamed home from work , over 200 people gathered on Market St. , near Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein ’s downtown San Francisco office , calling on Congressional Democrats to “ grow a spine , ” and “ show some skill , pass the bill ! ”
Asked what a health care reform bill should contain to be meaningful , Oakland resident Harriet Johnson replied , “ Some kind of health care for all , for everyone .
Like single payer , ” she added .
“ Other countries have it . ”
Johnson said a more equitable tax structure , with corporations shouldering more of the burden , is key to funding health care and other social needs .
An AT&T worker , Johnson has health coverage , but said she would also be willing to pay more in taxes so everyone could be covered .
“ Maybe we all need to pay something , ” she said , “ but everyone should be covered . ”
Physical therapist Karen
Ande works with frail elders in a program largely funded through Medical , the state ’s Medicaid program .
Last spring , she said , Medical eliminated services including adult dental care and podiatry , as part of draconian cuts – mostly to human services – to meet a massive state budget gap .
Ande said she has worked with the Adult Day Health program for half a dozen years , but “ it was n’t until this fall that we had three clients with dental abscesses , big swellings in their mouths . ”
One woman , who had been living at home with her family , ended up with an infection in her bone and spent four months in a nursing home , receiving intravenous antibiotics .
The experience deepened the woman ’s confusion , and she was unable to return home .
“ So for want of $ 75 worth of preventive care , this woman is now permanently in a nursing home , funded by Medical , ” which also paid for her antibiotic therapy , Ande said .
Demonstrators in other cities heard similar stories .
At Senator Kristen Gillibrand ’s office in New York City , former CNN journalist Veronica De La Cruz told protesters that her brother , Eric , died in July from a heart condition , after he was denied coverage by a number of major insurers because of his pre-existing heart problems .
“ I promised my brother that I will make sure nobody will suffer needlessly like he did , ” De La Cruz said .
“ I think the public does n’t know what health care reform is .
What they do hear is a lot of the misinformation that is floating around out there . ”
MoveOn spokesperson David Greenson told the rally that many Massachusetts voters who supported Republican candidate Scott Brown felt health care legislation was n’t strong enough .
In Jeffersonville , Ind. – on the Ohio River across from Louisville , Ky. – psychologist Mary Ellen Peacock said many people with serious mental illness can’t afford needed medications because they lack health coverage .
Laid - off auto worker Phil Karshner said that after 31 years in the industry , “ It was a cold wakeup call ” to realize he could lose his coverage as he gets older .
The federal subsidy that has enabled him to stay covered will end in May , Karshner said , and he and his wife ca n’t afford the $ 1,800 / month it would cost to stay in the health plan .
In his State of the Union speech , President Obama promised he “ would not walk away ” from the millions of Americans who have lost , or will lose , their health coverage .
After nearly a century of trying , he said , “ we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many Americans . ”
He urged Congress , “ Let ’s find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people . ”
Earlier in the day , House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , said the House could pass the Senate health bill and use the “ budget reconciliation ” process to improve it as many legislators insist .
Budget reconciliation requires a simple majority in the Senate , letting Democrats avoid a Republican filibuster .

Two years ago , the Supreme Court struck down parts of the District of Columbia ’s gun-control law .
On Tuesday , the court will consider whether that decision should apply everywhere in the country , not just in the federal territory of the nation ’s capital .
We disagreed strongly with the 2008 decision , which took an expansive and aggressive view of the right to bear arms .
But there is an even broader issue at stake in the new case :
The Supreme Court ’s muddled history in applying the Constitution to states and cities .
It should make clear that all of the protections of the Bill of Rights apply everywhere .
McDonald v. Chicago is a challenge to a law that makes it extremely difficult to own a handgun within Chicago ’s city limits .
The challengers rely on the court ’s 5 - to - 4 ruling in 2008 , which recognized an individual right under the Second Amendment to carry guns for self - defense .
But that decision left open an important question .
The Bill of Rights once was largely thought to be a set of limitations on the federal government .
Does the right to bear arms apply against city and state governments as well ?
Since states and localities do far more gun regulation than the federal government , the court ’s answer will have a powerful impact .
The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit , in Chicago , relying on 19th - century precedents , ruled that the Second Amendment does not apply to states and cities .

The demonstrators , close to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in exile and supported by the opposition United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship ( UDD ) , are calling for the reopening of the satellite TV station and are willing to face the soldiers .
" People ’s Channel " was taken off air shortly after the government ’s declaration of a state of emergency .
Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva yesterday defended the decision , explaining that the station broadcast " misleading " information threatening national security .
There are 6 thousand soldiers and officers inside the building , while another 600 patrol the entrances to defend the complex that houses the TV .
Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd , spokesman for the Centre for Public Administration in Emergency Situations ( CPAES ) says that - according to the state of emergency - police and soldiers will take concrete steps to protect the TV station .
He does not exclude the use of shields , water cannons , tear gas and sound waves to repel the attackers .
However , until now the army has declined to use force to repel the demonstrators preferring the channel of dialogue , open to negotiations with leaders of the revolt .
When Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli is n’t speculating about whether or not President Obama was not born in the United States , he apparently worries about the federal government tracking his family .
In an overlooked recording from the campaign trail , candidate Cuccinelli told a crowd that he was considering not registering his son for a Social Security number because “ it is being used to track you . ”
He also claimed that many others are not registering for Social Security numbers for the same reason .
Watch :
We ’re gonna have our 7th child on Monday , if he ’s not born before .
And , for the very concerns you state , we ’re actually considering – as I ’m sure many of you here did n’t get a Social Security number when you were born , they do it now – we ’re considering not doing that .
And a lot of people are considering that now , because it is being used to track you .
If the newly unearthed “ birther ” comments did n’t establish Cuccinelli as a bona fide member of the paranoid , anti-government Tea Party movement , this video should do the trick .
Whether you ’re a novice or a seasoned professional , sometimes we all need our memory jogged .
It ’s never a bad idea to have some convenient references handy just in case .

Robert Wright on culture , politics and world affairs .
I would n’t have believed you if you ’d told me 20 years ago that America would someday be routinely firing missiles into countries it ’s not at war with .
For that matter , I would n’t have believed you if you ’d told me a few months ago that America would soon be plotting the assassination of an American citizen who lives abroad .
Shows you how much I know .
President Obama , who during his first year in office oversaw more drone strikes in Pakistan than occurred during the entire Bush presidency , last week surpassed his predecessor in a second respect : he authorized the assassination of an American —
Anwar al - Awlaki , the radical Imam who after 9/11 moved from Virginia to Yemen , a base from which he inspires such people as the Fort Hood shooter and the would - be underwear bomber .
Students of the law might raise a couple of questions : 1 ) Does n’t it violate international law to fire missiles into Pakistan ( especially on a roughly weekly basis ) when the Pakistani government has given no formal authorization ?
2 ) Would n’t firing a missile at al - Awlaki in Yemen compound the international - law question with a constitutional question — namely whether giving the death penalty to an American without judicially establishing his guilt deprives him of due process ?
I ’m not qualified to answer these questions , and , besides , it does n’t really matter what the correct answers are .
The Obama administration has its lawyers scurrying to convince us that the answers are no and no , somewhat as the Bush administration dispatched John Yoo to justify its torture policy .
And these answers , regardless of their legal merit , will be accepted so long as Americans are convinced that being safe in the post - 9/11 world requires accepting them .
One good way to stoke a sense of injustice is to fire missiles into cars , homes and offices in hopes of killing terrorists , while in fact killing no few innocent civilians .
So maybe the question to ask is whether Americans should be convinced of that — whether assassinating terrorists really helps keep us safe .
There ’s no way of answering this question with complete confidence , but it turns out there are some relevant and little - known data .
They were compiled by Jenna Jordan of the University of Chicago , who published her findings last year in the journal Security Studies .
She studied 298 attempts , from 1945 through 2004 , to weaken or eliminate terrorist groups through “ leadership decapitation ” — eliminating people in senior positions .
Her work suggests that decapitation does n’t lower the life expectancy of the decapitated groups — and , if anything , may have the opposite effect .
Particularly ominous are Jordan ’s findings about groups that , like Al Qaeda and the Taliban , are religious .
The chances that a religious terrorist group will collapse in the wake of a decapitation strategy are 17 percent .
Of course , that ’s better than zero , but it turns out that the chances of such a group fading away when there ’s no decapitation are 33 percent .
In other words , killing leaders of a religious terrorist group seems to increase the group ’s chances of survival from 67 percent to 83 percent .
Of course the usual caveat applies :
It ’s hard to disentangle cause and effect .
Maybe it ’s the more formidable terrorist groups that invite decapitation in the first place — and , needless to say , formidable groups are good at survival .
Still , the other interpretation of Jordan ’s findings — that decapitation just does n’t work , and in some cases is counterproductive — does make sense when you think about it .
For starters , reflect on your personal workplace experience .
When an executive leaves a company — whether through retirement , relocation or death — what happens ?
Exactly : He or she gets replaced .
And about half the time ( in my experience , at least ) the successor is more capable than the predecessor .
There ’s no reason to think things would work differently in a terrorist organization .
Maybe that ’s why newspapers keep reporting the death of a “ high ranking Al Qaeda lieutenant ” ; it is n’t that we keep killing the same guy , but rather that there ’s an endless stream of replacements .
You ’re not going to end the terrorism business by putting individual terrorists out of business .
You might as well try to end the personal computer business by killing executives at Apple and Dell .
Capitalism being the stubborn thing it is , new executives would fill the void , so long as there was a demand for computers .
Of course , if you did enough killing , you might make the job of computer executive so unattractive that companies had to pay more and more for ever - less - capable executives .
But that ’s one difference between the computer business and the terrorism business .
Terrorists are n’t in it for the money to begin with .
They have less tangible incentives — and some of these may be strengthened by targeted killings .
One of the main incentives is a kind of local prestige grounded in grievance .
When people feel aggrieved — feel that foreigners have wronged them or exploited them or disrespected them — they may admire and appreciate those who fight on their behalf .
Terrorists are nourished ultimately by a grass - roots sense of injustice .
And one good way to stoke a sense of injustice is to fire missiles into cars , homes and offices in hopes of killing terrorists , while in fact killing no few innocent civilians .
Estimates of the ratio of civilians to militants killed are all over the map — 50 to 1 or 10 to 1 or 1 to 2 or 1 to 10 — but the estimate of the Pakistani people , which is all that matters , tends toward the higher end .
And the notion that these strikes are a kind of national humiliation long ago entered Pakistani culture .
A popular song from a couple of years ago says Americans “ kill people like insects . ”
You can imagine why , as Jordan ’s data suggest , this counterproductive effect of decapitation might be stronger for religious groups than for groups driven by a secular ideology .
To the intensely religious even the harshest adversity can seem like a test administered by a God who will reward faithful perseverance .
And the belief that death in a holy war gets you to heaven ca n’t hurt when you ’re looking for someone to replace an assassinated leader .
Obviously , drone strikes must do some short - term good by disrupting the operations of Al Qaeda or the Taliban .
And there ’s no way of knowing for sure that this short - term good is outweighed by a long - term recruiting boost .
But Jordan ’s data , combined with common - sense analysis , make the merits of our current strategy far from clear .
By itself that would n’t be a damning indictment .
You have to choose some strategy in the face of uncertainty , and if this turns out to be the wrong one — well , that ’s life ; strategic failure happens .
But in this case the price we pay goes far beyond failure .
If Harold Koh — the state department lawyer assigned the job of justifying Obama ’s strategy — carries the day , America will be telling the world that it ’s O.K. to lob missiles into countries that have n’t attacked you , as long as you think a terrorist may live there .
Do we really want to send that message to , for example , Russia and China , both of which have terrorism problems ?
Or India or Pakistan ?
And are we sure we want to say that , actually , due process of law is n’t really guaranteed all American citizens so long as there ’s a war on terrorism — which , remember , is a war that may continue for eternity ?
I ’m not sure I ’d want to pay these prices even for a strategy that helped us in the war against terrorism .
To pay them for a strategy that may be hurting us is even less appetizing .
Note : Read Gary
Hart ’s response to this column .
If you have n't seen this video yet , watch at your own risk .
The disturbing video was taken by a neighbor after months of hearing painful whines coming from the Aguilar 's porch .
The 11 - month old puppy suffers from a hip fracture , a broken leg , three broken teeth and injuries to his ears .
The poor English Bulldog named Spike also will be blind in one eye .
Punishment should be excessively severe for offenders such as Maria Aguilar ( and even for her husband who did nothing about the abuse besides bring the pup to the vet a couple of times ) .
I 'd like to see how she would feel if I hit her in the face with the same shovel she attacked an innocent puppy with .
What ?
was the unconditional affection too much for you - you piece of shit ?
Sadly , this dirt bag will only face up to four years in prison .
I say she should be severely medicated and then thrown in a padded cell the rest of her life because let 's face it , there is a few loose screws up there .
What are your opinions on this ?
Are you as outraged as I am ?
How honest can you be and what is your HONEST FACTOR ?
Somewhere inside this heart is a soft spot for animals .
I am usually unsympathetic towards many things , but innocent puppies are not one of them .
How on earth can someone take a shovel to a little puppy , beat it to near death and put their head on the pillow at night ?
There 's a special place in hell for people like this , and there 's one waiting for Maria Aguilar .
Two teachers are taking legal action against a southern Queensland newspaper for publishing photographs of them taken from the social networking site Facebook .
The Warwick Daily News published an article last month with photos showing the teachers posing in schoolgirl uniforms .
Solicitor Rebecca Jancauskas says the story vilified the teachers .
" The global publication of this story has caused our clients incredible distress and has damaged their personal and professional reputations immeasurably , " she said .
" They 're now a laughing stock in their local community , their students and their peers view them very differently and their professional lives hang in the balance while Education Queensland decide the outcome of their investigation . "
Ms Jancauskas says the case will have wider ramifications for social media sites .
" I think it raises interesting issues that need to be determined , whether it be by a court or by a government , which is do user generated sites such as Facebook have the legal status of a modern day diary or personal correspondence ? " she said .

Today I 'd like to announce the addition of three new components in the next version of the JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit : Area Charts , Bar Charts and Pie Charts .
I hope these components will be widely used among the JIT user community .
All components support a simpler JSON format that I 'll describe later in this post .
These components are easy - to - use , yet very powerful : they support live data updates and multi valued data as we will see next .
The Area Chart is a useful component to track the evolution of a bunch of categories at the same time .
In addition , the aggregation of the values of all these categories is also presented in a meaningful way .
This component supports live updates ( as you 'll see in the first seconds of the video ) , filtering / restoring categories , tooltips and a legend .
As usual this is all JavaScript :
The visualization is instanciated this way : Additionally this visualization allows programmatic category filtering , JSON updating , selecting you own colors , etc. Bar Charts are similar to Area Charts , but they support additional styling and positioning .
You can use vertical or horizontal Bar Charts .
Here 's an example :
This object is created the same way you create an AreaChart : Finally there 's the Pie Chart .
But this is no regular Pie Chart .
It can support simple data as well as more complex data .
You can add multiple categories to this Pie Chart , combining them into something more like a Stacked Rose Diagram .
They also support live updates as you 'll see in the first seconds of the video :
The JSON data format for these visualizations had to depict something like a contingency table , and so I decided to adopt something like this : I hope you find these visualizations useful , and if you can't wait for the next version to come out to use these charts you can always build the project from GitHub .
Here 's a wiki with some instructions on how to make your own build of the library while you 're waiting for an official release .
If you ever find bugs please use the issue tracker at GitHub .
If you need help or have any questions you can always go to the Google Group .
Well , this got long enough .
Hope you enjoyed it !

Many developers and designers want to release their work into the world as open - source projects .
They want others to be able to build on and share their code .
The open - source community is vibrant because of this .
Open - source software is available for virtually any application you could think of .
Most designers use open - source software or code on a regular basis ( WordPress , Drupal and many other CMS ’ are open source ) .
But many developers and designers do n’t have a clear picture of what the different open - source licenses really mean .
What rights are they relinquishing when they choose an open - source license ?
Without knowing exactly what the licenses mean and how they ’re best applied , developers ca n’t make informed decisions about which is best for their work .
Further Reading on SmashingMag :
What Is Licensing ?
A lot of confusion is out there about what exactly licensing means .
When you license your work , you ’re not giving away any of your rights .
You still hold the original copyright ( or patent if you have one ) on that work .
What a license does is grant specific permissions for others to use that work .
Licensing is a great alternative to just releasing your work into the public domain or granting permissions on a case - by - case basis .
By releasing into the public domain , you relinquish any copyright , and no one is obligated to list you as the original author or contributor .
In the latter case , you may end up spending more time dealing with individual permissions than designing or developing .
Open - source licenses make it easy for others to contribute to a project without having to seek special permission .
It also protects you as the original creator , making sure you at least get some credit for your contributions .
It also helps to prevent others from claiming your work as their own .
GNU General Public License
The GNU General Public Licence ( GPL ) is probably one of the most commonly used licenses for open - source projects .
The GPL grants and guarantees a wide range of rights to developers who work on open - source projects .
Basically , it allows users to legally copy , distribute and modify software .
This means you can :
Copy the software . .
Copy it onto your own servers , your client ’s servers , your own computer , pretty much anywhere you want .
There ’s no limit to the number of copies you can make .
.

There ’s no limit to the number of copies you can make .
Distribute the software however you want . .
Provide a download link on your website .
Put the software on a bunch of thumb drives and give them away .
Print out the source code and throw it from the rooftops ( please do n’t , though , because that would waste a lot of paper and make a mess ) .
. Provide a download link on your website .
Put the software on a bunch of thumb drives and give them away .
Print out the source code and throw it from the rooftops ( please do n’t , though , because that would waste a lot of paper and make a mess ) .
Charge a fee to distribute the software . .
If you want to charge someone to provide the software , set it up on their website or do anything else related to it , you can do so .
But , you must give them a copy of the GNU GPL , which basically tells them that they could probably get the software elsewhere for free .
Best to be up front about that , and about why you ’re charging them .

Best to be up front about that , and about why you ’re charging them .
Make whatever modifications to the software you want ..
If you want to add or remove functionality , go ahead .
If you want to use a portion of the code in another project , you can .
The only catch is that the other project must also be released under the GPL .
Please note that it is very important to see source and binaries distribution as two very different things .
Also , there are issues and restrictions with some licenses when used with applications released under “ each other ” .
You can dive into more details in the detailed article Practical Guide to GPL Compliance .
To use the GPL , you have to include certain information in the software ’s code , along with a copy of the license .
GNU Lesser General Public License
You should be aware of another GNU license : the Lesser General Public Licence ( LGPL ) .
It grants fewer rights to a work than the standard GPL .
Generally , the LGPL is appropriate for libraries that want to allow linking from non-GPL and non -open - source software .
Because the GPL requires that other software with parts of licensed code to also be licensed under the GPL , developers cannot use GPL - licensed code for paid and proprietary software .
The LGPL negates this by not requiring other projects with parts of the code to be similarly licensed .
BSD License
BSD licenses represent a family of permissive free software licenses that have fewer restrictions on distribution compared to other free software licenses such as the GNU General Public License .
Among different versions of the license two versons are particularly important : the New BSD License / Modified BSD License , and the Simplified BSD License / FreeBSD License .
Both have been verified as GPL - compatible free software licenses , and have been accepted as open source licenses by the Open Source Initiative .
The New BSD License ( “ 3 - clause license ” ) allows unlimited redistribution for any purpose as long as its copyright notices and the license ’s disclaimers of warranty are maintained .
The license also contains a clause restricting use of the names of contributors for endorsement of a derived work without specific permission .
The primary difference between the New BSD License and the Simplified BSD license is that the latter omits the non-endorsement clause .
MIT License
The MIT License is the shortest and probably broadest of all the popular open - source licenses .
Its terms are very loose and more permissive than most other licenses .
The basic provision of the license ( minus the information that it is provided without warranty , which comprises the final paragraph ) is as follows :
Permission is hereby granted , free of charge , to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files ( the “ Software ” ) , to deal in the Software without restriction , including without limitation the rights to use , copy , modify , merge , publish , distribute , sublicense , and / or sell copies of the Software , and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so , subject to the following conditions :
The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software .
What this means is that :
You can use , copy and modify the software however you want .
No one can prevent you from using it on any project , from copying it however many times you want and in whatever format you like , or from changing it however you want .
You can give the software away for free or sell it .
You have no restrictions on how to distribute it .
The only restriction is that it be accompanied by the license agreement .
The MIT License is the least restrictive license out there .
It basically says that anyone can do whatever they want with the licensed material , as long as it ’s accompanied by the license .
Apache License
The Apache License , Version 2.0 , grants a number of rights to users .
These rights can be applied to both copyrights and patents .
Because some licenses can be applied only to copyrights and not patents , this flexibility would be an obvious factor in a patent developer ’s choice of license ( read this article on How Stuff Works for an explanation of the difference ) .
Here are some more details on what the Apache License allows :
Rights are perpetual . .
Once they ’ve been granted , you can continue to use them forever .
.
Once they ’ve been granted , you can continue to use them forever .
Rights are worldwide . .
If the rights are granted in one country , then they ’re granted in all countries .
For example , if you ’re in the US and the original license was granted in India , you ’re not prevented from using the code under the license .
.
If the rights are granted in one country , then they ’re granted in all countries .
For example , if you ’re in the US and the original license was granted in India , you ’re not prevented from using the code under the license .
Rights are granted for no fee or royalty . .
Not only will you not be charged any kind of up - front usage fee , but you will not be charged fees on a per-usage or any other basis either .
.
Not only will you not be charged any kind of up - front usage fee , but you will not be charged fees on a per-usage or any other basis either .
Rights are non-exclusive . .
You can use the licensed work , and so can anyone else .
.
You can use the licensed work , and so can anyone else .
Rights are irrevocable ..
No one can take these rights away once they ’re granted .
In other words , you do n’t need to worry that down the road , when you ’ve created some awesome derivative of the licensed code , someone will swoop in and say , “ Sorry , you ca n’t use this code anymore . ”
( A clause in the license states that if you sue someone over patent infringement on anything under this license , then your license is terminated , but that only applies to patented work , and as long as you do n’t sue anyone over the work , you wo n’t have to worry about it . )
Redistributing code also has special requirements , mostly pertaining to giving proper credit to those who have worked on the code and to maintaining the same license .
Creative Commons
Creative Commons ( CC ) licenses are n’t quite open - source licenses , but they are commonly used for design projects .
A wide variety of CC licenses is available , each granting certain rights .
A CC license has four basic parts , which can be enacted individually or in combination .
Here ’s an overview of the parts :
Attribution .
The author must be attributed as the creator of the work .
Beyond that , the work can be modified , distributed , copied and otherwise used .

The author must be attributed as the creator of the work .

Share Alike .
The work can be modified , distributed and so forth , but only under the same CC license .

Non-Commercial .
The work can be modified , distributed and so on , but not for commercial purposes .
The language about what constitutes “ commercial ” is a bit vague ( no express definition is provided ) , so you may want to clarify this in your own projects .
For example , some might interpret “ non-commercial ” as simply meaning that you ca n’t sell the work .
Others might take it to mean that you ca n’t even put the work on a website that has advertising .
Still others might consider something is “ commercial ” only if it makes a profit .

No Derivative Works .
This means you can copy and distribute the licensed work , but you ca n’t modify it in any way or create work based on the original .
As mentioned , these parts of the CC license terms can be combined .
The most restrictive license would be the “ Attribution , Non-Commercial , No Derivatives ” license , which means that you can freely share the work , but not change it or charge for it , and you must attribute it to the creator .
This is a good license to get your work out there but still maintain more or less complete control over how it is used .
The least restrictive would be the “ Attribution ” license , which means that as long as people credit you , they can do whatever they like with the work .
CC licenses are used more for design work than development , but nothing bars you from using it for the latter .
Just be aware of exactly what is and is not covered under each part .

The World From Berlin ' Public and Politicians Are Losing Patience with Afghanistan Mission '
The Dutch government is the first to collapse in a dispute over NATO 's involvement in Afghanistan .
German media commentators say other NATO member states could share the same fate if they continue to ignore growing public opposition to the mission .
The home front , it seems , is starting to crumble .
AT&T's wireless unit has been hit by numerous federal lawsuits over the last month , each arguing that the mobile telephony giant is illegally collecting nonexistent " taxes " on phone data access plans .
The cases have been filed in states as varied as Georgia , Indiana , and Alabama , but all make the same charges against AT&T — and all use the same idiosyncratic spelling of " I - Phone . "
That 's because the same lawyers are involved in each one .
Taxes and " taxes "
The charges in these cases stem from AT&T 's sales tax collection practices .
The federal Internet Tax Freedom
Act bans most taxes on Internet access until 2014 .
Despite the law , AT&T has allegedly collected sales taxes on its data plans , which the complaint says clearly amount to " Internet access " under the law .
In each state , the lawyers have found an individual to bring the complaint , each version of which is largely identical to the others .
The goal is for a judge to certify the case as a class action lawsuit , opening the door up to the " thousands of individuals " impacted by AT&T 's collection of the " purported sales ' taxes ' . "
In some states , the claim is merely that the " taxes " are not actually " taxes " at all , just ways to collect more revenue .
But in some states , like Alabama , the suit points out that companies which collect sales tax are allowed to hold back tiny percentages from the state in order to cover the cost of compliance ( in Alabama , it 's 0.25 percent of the tax ) .
While the law sounds simple , implementation can be complicated , in part because many states disagree on what the law actually covers .
According to a 2006 report ( PDF ) from the Government Accountability Office , Internet access sold to consumers and businesses is tax - exempt , but Internet services sold to ISPs themselves is not ( states differ on their acceptance of this distinction ) .
Furthermore , the GAO argues that things like telephone service , video services , and even VoIP should be taxed , since they are " telecommunications " service and not " Internet access . "
The GAO report does suggest that basic Internet connections , including those provided by DSL , cable , and wireless technologies , cannot be taxed ; the lawsuits argue that such taxes are in fact being levied by AT&T .
The company has n't been commenting on the suits , and AT&T has not yet filed a response in any of the cases we examined .
It 's quite possible that the company will claim its data plans are not pure " Internet access " under the law , despite being broken out separately on the bill , but we 'll have to see .
How much money is at stake here is hard to say .
The lawsuits do say that they expect the issue to exceed the $ 5 million threshold for class action cases .
The cases appear to be spearheaded by lawyers from Bartimus , Frickleton , Robertson , & Gorny , personal injury lawyers from Missouri .
( Partner Jim Bartimus was the Personal Injury Litigator of the Year in Kansas City for 2009 . )
BFRG is no stranger to this sort of litigation , and has previously secured a $ 450 million settlement from mobile phone companies after claiming that the firms hid rate increases as " tax increases . "
And AT&T is no stranger to being sued .
In the last year alone , the company 's wireless unit has faced big lawsuits from songwriters over its ringtones , lawsuits for slow 3G speeds , and even attempted class action suits over the iPhone 's lack of MMS .
Our bodies produce a small but steady amount of natural morphine , a new study suggests .
Traces of the chemical are often found in mouse and human urine , leading scientists to wonder whether the drug is being made naturally or being delivered by something the subjects consumed .
The new research shows that mice produce the " incredible painkiller " — and that humans and other mammals possess the same chemical road map for making it , said study co-author Meinhart Zenk , who studies plant - based pharmaceuticals at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis , Missouri .
In the study , researchers injected mice with an extra dose of a natural brain chemical called tetrahydropapaveroline ( THP ) , which humans and mice are known to produce .
Using a tool called a mass spectrometer to analyze the mouse urine , the team was able to tell that THP underwent chemical changes in the body that created morphine , according to the study , published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
What 's more , the study found that mouse morphine is produced in nearly the same way as the morphine in poppies — the only morphine - making plants known to science .
Morphine a Defense Mechanism ?
But " the big question is , What is it for ? "
Zenk said of the mammal - made morphine .
THP must undergo a complicated , 17 - step process in the body to create morphine .
Even so , the chemical has evolved twice — in poppies and in mammals — suggesting it 's somehow valuable for survival .
In the well - studied poppy plant , scientists suspect morphine acts as a defense against predators .
For instance , a rabbit eating — and thus killing — a morphine - laced poppy may become sluggish , making itself easy prey for a passing hawk .
Likewise , Zenk noted , if an animal attacks a person , even background levels of morphine may block out enough pain to allow the person to escape .
( Explore the human body . )
For now , however , this is " absolute speculation , " Zenk said .
Next he plans to test the urine of people who have endured horrible pain — such as traffic - accident victims — to see if their bodies spiked morphine levels .
It 's also difficult to say whether the discovery will yield any new treatments , Zenk added .

Red Bull Racing team boss Christian Horner says the FIA 's clarification that any system altering the suspension set - up of a car during parc ferme conditions is illegal " has no impact " on its RB6 .
The team has been suspected by its rivals of being able to change the ride height of its car between qualifying and the race , but the FIA has declared the RB6 perfectly legal and on Sunday faxed all the F1 teams to confirm that anyone who implements such a system will be contravening the regulations .
Horner is adamant that it does not affect Red Bull .
When asked by AUTOSPORT whether any changes would have to be made to the RB6 , he replied : " No .
The car that we will take to China will be exactly the same mechanically as it was in the first three races .
It has absolutely no impact on the specification of our car . "
And when asked whether he expected rivals to have to make changes , he said : " I do n't know what they have on their cars , so all I know is that it has no impact on Red Bull , despite suggestions to the contrary . "
He added that the accusations levelled at Red Bull are nothing more than a reflection on the team 's early season pace .
" Fundamentally , we 've got a fast car .
The guys have done a good job and it 's inevitably one of those things that people perhaps make accusations when you are running competitively , " he said .
" But I take it as a compliment .
I 'm sure if we were running 14th , similar accusations would n't be made . "
Still , Horner welcomed the clarification from the FIA , which said : " Any system device or procedure , the purpose and / or effect of which is to change the set - up of the suspension , while the car is under parc ferme conditions will be deemed to contravene art 34.5 * of the sporting regulations . "
" Obviously the FIA has felt the necessity to clarify , and I think they 've done exactly the right and the responsible thing , as it avoids a development rush in this area that inevitably would n't be cheap , " Horner told AUTOSPORT .
" It 's a sensible ruling .
It inevitably saves teams spending a huge amount of money on R&D to create such systems and obviously if anybody does run one , it would be in clear breach of the technical regulations .
We 're more than happy with the FIA 's verdict , which we fully support .
" With these things , sometimes the wording and the spirit of the regulations leaves different interpretations and it's great to see that on this occasion it has been clarified and that any form of active ride is therefore illegal . "
A future full of helpful robots , quietly going about their business and assisting humans in thousands of small ways , is one of technology 's most long - deferred promises .
Only recently have robots started to achieve the kind of sophistication and ubiquity that computing 's pioneers originally envisioned .
The military has hundreds of UAVs blanketing the skies above Iraq and Afghanistan , and Roombas are vacuuming living rooms across the country .
At the bleeding edge , there 's the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005 .
This grueling , 140 - mile , no - humans - allowed race through the desert showcased full - sized , completely autonomous robot cars that could navigate across rugged desert terrain , avoiding rocks and cliffs and cacti in a race for a $ 2 million cash prize .
The follow - on 2007 Urban Challenge went even further , with the robotic competitors required to drive alongside humans on crowded roads , recognizing and avoiding other cars and following the rules of the road .
Suddenly , the robotic future does n't look so far off .
In some ways , the remarkable thing is that it took so long to get here .
In the 1960's , researchers in artificial intelligence were boldly declaring that we'd have thinking machines fully equivalent to humans in 10 years .
Instead , for most of the past half - century , the only robots we saw outside of movies and labs were arms confined to factory floors and were remotely operated by humans .
Building machines that behaved intelligently in the real world was harder than anyone imagined .
Robot cars lined up at the starting line for the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge race .
The biggest challenge for robots then and now lies in making sense of the world .
With perfect information , many of the hardest problems in robotics would be nearly trivial .
We 've gotten very good at building and actuating robots , but in order for them to use their abilities to the fullest they need to make sense of their surroundings .
A robot car has to know where the road is and where other cars and people are .
A robot servant needs to be able to recognize household items .
Today 's robots are starting to be able to make these difficult determinations .
The question we 're here to answer is : how ?
What allowed robots to go from blind , dumb , immobile automatons to fully autonomous entities able to operate in unstructured environments like the streets of a city ?
The most obvious answer is Moore 's Law , and it has certainly been a huge factor .
But raw processing power is useless without the right algorithms .
A revolution has taken place in the robotics world .
By embracing uncertainty and using the tools of probability , robots are able to make sense of their surroundings like never before .
In this article , we 'll explore how robots use their sensors to make sense of the world .
This discussion applies mostly to robots that carry an internal representation of the world and act according to that representation .
There are lots of successful robots that do n't do such " thinking " : the military 's UAVs are mostly remotely piloted , linked by an electronic tether to human eyes and brains on the ground .
The Roomba does its job without building a map of your house ; it just has a series of simple behaviors that are triggered by timing or bumping into things .
These robots are very good at what they do , but to autonomously carry out more complicated tasks like driving , a robot needs to have some understanding of the world around it .
The robot needs to know where it is , where it can and can't go , and decide what to do and where to go .
We 'll be discussing how modern robots answer these questions .
Sensing and Probability
As it turns out , the big challenge in many robotics applications is the same : it 's easy to do the right thing , but only if you know what the right thing is .
We 've known how to steer a car automatically for a long time .
What 's hard is knowing where the road is and whether that shape by the road is a fire hydrant you can ignore or a child about to run across the street .
To operate in an unstructured environment , a robot needs to use sensing to understand the state of the world relative to itself .
Sensing is the key to successful robots , and probability is the key to successful sensing .
Sensing is difficult because the world is a complicated , unpredictable place .
Remember that the robot does n't get to " see " reality directly .
It can only take measurements through its sensors , which do n't perfectly reflect the true state of the world .
Just because your sensor tells you something does n't mean it 's true .
For example , GPS position measurements can jump by several meters , even when the receiver is stationary .
Some things are n't even possible to measure directly ; if you 're trying to distinguish between a person and a cactus , there 's no sensor that directly measures " humanness . "
You have to look at different measurable properties like shape and size and so on to infer if you 're seeing a person .
A robot does n't directly " see " the true state of reality .
Instead it must infer the state from noisy sensor measurements .
Robotic sensing is like Plato 's allegory of " the cave " : there are people moving outside , but our robot is the prisoner chained to the wall , only able to see the shadows those people cast .
The movements of the people outside are the true state , and the shadows are our robot 's sensor measurements : we have to infer what 's actually happening by observing the shadows .
This process of inferring the true state of the world , the process of updating what we believe is true based on what our sensors tell us , is called state estimation .

Earlier than expected the final Last Airbender trailer has hit the net !
All I can say is wow !
Lot ’s of great new content , some awesome new bending , new sightings of Appa , and Roku ’s Dragon I think .
Anyway , check it out in full 1080P below :
Anyway quite an epic trailer , I did n’t catch sight of Momo at all , guess we ’ll have to wait until the movie for that one .
Let us know your thoughts on the latest ( and final ) Last Airbender Trailer .
Earlier today the JQuery UI team announced the final release of JQuery UI 1.8 .
In case you 're not familiar with JQuery UI , it is an extension of the JQuery library that provides " abstractions for low - level interaction and animation , advanced effects and high - level , themeable widgets , built on top of the jQuery JavaScript Library , that you can use to build highly interactive web applications . "
The new version of JQuery UI brings about some exciting new additions :
Position Elements with Ease
You can now position any element relative to another element , the browser window or even mouse / cursor using simple syntax .
For designers , this is especially useful in getting rid of complex CSS code to place elements relative to the browser window , such as horizontally and vertically centering a dialog window or correctly positioning a tooltip .
Beautiful Buttons and Form Elements
This is incredibly useful and a God send for many designers - you can now create beautiful buttons , stylish radios , checkboxes and select menus without breaking a sweat .
The minimalistic code makes it simple to implement as well .
The following code : $ ( " button " ) .button ( ) ;
When paired with the usual button HTML elements , produces :
It 's one thing to see a picture and something else to actually interact with it - try it out on the button demo page .
Smaller File Size
Another great relief to designers is sure to be the smaller file size that JQuery UI core now utilizes - according to the team , it is 71 % smaller !
When I downloaded both the 1.8 and 1.7.2 cores ( both minified ) , I found the difference to be closer to 60 % , but that is still a huge improvement .
While I 've used JQuery UI on several projects , one of my biggest qualms with it was it 's large file size .
That is a much smaller concern now , especially with the significant speed advantages the library provides in terms of development .
Additional Goodies
The JQuery UI team is also releasing an autocomplete widget that is both simple to use and powerful ( supporting local calls or ajax ) , and a new widget factory .
When the International Monetary Fund or World Bank offer to lend money to a struggling third - world country ( or " emerging market " ) , they demand " austerity measures " .
As Wikipedia describes it :
In economics , austerity is when a national government reduces its spending in order to pay back creditors .
Austerity is usually required when a government 's fiscal deficit spending is felt to be unsustainable .
Development projects , welfare programs and other social spending are common areas of spending for cuts .
In many countries , austerity measures have been associated with short - term standard of living declines until economic conditions improved once fiscal balance was achieved ( such as in the United Kingdom under Margaret Thatcher , Canada under Jean Chrétien , and Spain under González ) .
Private banks , or institutions like the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , may require that a country pursues an ' austerity policy ' if it wants to re-finance loans that are about to come due .
The government may be asked to stop issuing subsidies or to otherwise reduce public spending .
When the IMF requires such a policy , the terms are known as ' IMF conditionalities ' .
ST . AUGUSTINE , Fla . —
The Harvest of Hope , an event to help migrant workers , was held here in St. Augustine , Fla. , over the March 13 weekend .
To those who ask , what are the youth doing today to change the world ?
This event should give us great hope !
My friend and I decided to attend the Saturday night event , because singer / songwriter Billy Bragg was performing .
He is of a certain age that one would think young people would not even know who he is .
But much to my pleasant surprise , I was wrong .
Hundreds of the under - 30 crowd received his songs with great enthusiasm .
He started his set with an antiwar song that resonated among the audience .
He sang about the “ poverty draft ” and coming home in body bags .
Bragg was described by UK’s The Times newspaper as a “ national treasure . ”
“ In the two and a half decades of his career Bragg has certainly made an indelible mark on the conscience of British music , becoming perhaps the most stalwart guardian of the radical dissenting tradition that stretches back over centuries of the country ’s political , cultural and social history , ” the newspaper said .
And he did deliver !
In between songs , he asked the audience to think about the future .
He told them how much he appreciated their political will and implored them not to be discouraged because the Obama administration has not delivered on all the things they want to happen .
He conveyed his own disappointment with Tony Blair and the Labour Party .
He held up two hands in fists and said on the one hand , Blair took his country into an unjust war / occupation , but on the other , there is peace in Northern Ireland .
He made it clear to the audience that if this administration is defeated , it would be a tremendous set back for progress , and for them .
His songs demonstrated his class consciousness .
He talked about and sang Woody Guthrie ’s “ Deportee ” to great applause and cheers !
He finished with “ I Keep Faith . ”
“ And if your head may tell you / To run and hide / Listen to your heart and you ’ll find me / Right by your side . ”
The Harvest of Hope Foundation is a unique non-profit organization that has been providing migrant farmworkers and their families with emergency relief and financial assistance for over 15 years .

Jesus and his disciples would be eating a lot more at the Last Supper if it occurred in modern times , according to a study from Cornell University .
Researchers Brian Wansink , a professor of marketing and applied economics at Cornell , and his brother Craig Wansink , a professor of religious studies at Virginia Wesleyan College , analyzed more than 50 depictions of the Last Supper painted in the past 1,000 years to look at portion sizes .
Using computer aided design technology , the brothers compared the size of the portions , bread and plates with the average size of the heads in 52 paintings .
Entrees increased 69 percent in size during the 1,000 years , plate size 66 percent and bread size 23 percent , the Wansinks reported in a study published in the April edition of The International Journal of Obesity .
The U.S. government reported in 2005 that portion sizes had been increasing steadily since the 1970s .
But the researchers say their findings show the increase in portion sizes has been a thousand - year evolution .
" The last thousand years have witnessed dramatic increases in the production , availability , safety , abundance and affordability of food , " said Brian Wansink .
" We think that as art imitates life , these changes have been reflected in paintings of history 's most famous dinner . "
Two people were early Tuesday morning involved in a shootout with Indian Space Research Organisation ( ISRO ) security personnel around its high - security facility at Byalalu near Bangalore .
The two men , who were roaming around the area , fired at the security personnel on being questioned forcing the security forces to return fire , but the duo escaped .
" Two people were seen moving in a suspicious manner outside our centre , " ISRO spokesman S Satish told reporters .
" The police immediately challenged them , and they opened fire in retaliation .
The shootout continued for some time before the two men fled . "
" The police are investigating .
It is up to them to see whether it was a terror attack , " he added .
The duo fired at them with a small pistol , after which the security guards retaliated .
The incident occurred between 3.30 am and 4.00 am , sources said .
The home ministry sees ISRO buildings as a high priority target for terrorists , and has beefed up security around them after warnings of possible attacks .
A top CISF official said an ISRO security man spotted the two keeping a close watch on the installation and challenged them but the duo fired two rounds at him .
He retaliated and fired two rounds , he said .
" The security man then changed position and fired some more rounds .
Even before reinforcements could arrive , the two fled , " the official said .
The Inspector General of Police ( central range ) and DIG of CISF , which is in charge of security at airports and vital installations , visited the area .
The Indian Deep Space Network , commissioned in 2008 at Byalalu village near Bangalore , is the ground segment for providing deep space support for India 's first Lunar mission , Chandrayaan - 1 .
The technical facilities in IDSN include a 32 - metre Deep Space Antenna , an 18 - metre Antenna Terminal , an 11 - metre Antenna Terminal , Indian Space Science Data Centre ( ISSDC ) and a Technical Services complex .
The IDSN is the first of its kind project in India that provides ISRO the capability to handle deep space missions and also provides cross support to other deep space missions of external space agencies because of its inter-operable features and sophisticated capabilities .
Has there been a significant change in India 's internal security post 26/11 ?
Are Indians too soft to fight terrorism ?
Subhash Katewa ( Kapahi lab , Buck Institute ) talked about the metabolic adaptations that occur in flies whose lifespan is being extended by dietary restriction ( DR ) .
Katewa is studying translational control in DR using a method called translational profiling , which uses the number of ribosomes bound to each mRNA as an index of translational activity ( more ribosomes = more translation ) .
He found that DR increases translation of messages that encode a variety of mitochondrial functions ; this observation led to some interesting findings about the differential turnover of triglycerides in DR vs ad libitum flies .
Adam Freund ( Campisi lab , Buck Institute ) spoke about the sources of age - related inflammation , focusing on the senescence - associated secretory phenotype ( SASP ) .
Freund has elucidated mechanisms of SASP control that intermediate between the most upstream events in senescence ( DNA damage ) and its downstream effects ( secretion of inflammatory factors ) .
I have it on good authority that he has a completed manuscript on the subject , hopefully to be publshed soon , so I wo n’t say more about his story here .
( Mr. Freund happens to be my baymate . )
Dario Valenzano ( Brunet lab , Stanford University ) is studying the genetic architecture of longevity in a short - lived fish Nothobranchius furzeri , the shortest - living vertebrate that can be reared in captivity .
As a graduate student , Valenzano developed a system of biomarkers for tracking the progress of aging in skin , brain and other tissues – not only physical markers like the senescence - associated beta - galactosidase but also behavioral markers that change over the lifespan .
He is now proceeding to map the longevity - associated genes in N. furzeri and testing the sufficiency of the genes he finds .
Early results indicate that short - lived and long - lived fish are dying from different causes , as evidenced by a bimodal distribution of death rate vs. age .
Adolfo Sánchez - Blanco ( Kim lab , Stanford University Medical School ) described the “ molecular odometer ” for aging in the worm C. elegans .
He began with the observation that lifespan is variable , even among clonally identical individuals kept under identical conditions .
With genetics and environment taken out of the picture , what makes some individuals live longer than others ?
In order to address this question , SB had to develop a molecular marker ( e.g. , promoter activity of some gene ) that measures physiological age ( as opposed to chronological age ) , and then determine whether the expression level of that marker in individual worms is predictive of lifespan .
SB has identified several such genes whose expression at middle age strongly predicts remaining lifespan .
He is now actively looking for interventions that abolish the correlation between marker expression and longevity : if the marker gene ’s activity is serving to overcome the life - shortening effect of some stress , then removing that stress will not necessarily abolish the variability in the marker , but will eliminate the correlation between marker levels and lifespan .
( This is a subtle but important logical issue ; I would have thought that one should look for interventions that drove the population distribution of marker levels toward the favorable side of the distribution .
It was clear from questions that a lot of audience members had trouble with this logic , and I ’m still not sure I understand it myself . )

Da ist Sven Felix Kellerhoff , der leitende Redakteur für Zeit - und Kulturgeschichte der „ Welt “ , aber einer ganz großen Sache auf die Spur gekommen .
In dem Film „ Dutschke “ , der heute um 20.15 Uhr läuft , habe das ZDF „ historische Fakten gefälscht “ .
Die Filmemacher Daniel Nocke und Stefan Krohmer seien „ der Manipulation überführt “ .
Mit „ massiven Fälschungen “ erweckten sie bei den Zuschauern den Eindruck , der Hass , der Rudi Dutschke entgegenschlug , sei die Folge „ einer ‚ Hetze ‘ der Blätter des Axel Springer Verlages “ .
Der Film habe in einer rasant geschnittenen Montage Zeitungsseiten manipuliert und Fotos ausgetauscht .
Tatsache :

( Original )

„ Das hat mit seriöser Dokumentation nicht mehr viel zu tun “ , schimpft Kellerhoff .
Dabei ist die Sache noch viel schlimmer .
Das ZDF hat die Fotos nämlich nicht nur geändert , sondern sogar animiert .
Die ausgetauschten Fotos verwandeln sich , während die Kamera auf sie zufährt , wie von Zauberhand zu Filmszenen mit Ton !
Sehen Sie selbst :
Dieser sehr viel größere Skandal ist Kellerhoff entgangen .
Denn das , was da gezeigt wird , ist historisch falsch .
1968 gab es nach gesicherten Kenntnissen von Historikern noch keine „ Bild “ - App und keine elektronische Zeitung , die solche Animationen in Kombination mit den Zeitungsinhalten ermöglicht hätte .
Die Filmemacher haben das in ihrer Springer - Hetze - Hetze einfach erfunden !
Kellerhoff schreibt über die von ihm entdeckte „ Manipulation “ , sie sei , „ zumal in einem Dokudrama , kein Kavaliersdelikt .
Ob ZDF - Redakteurin Caroline von Senden davon weiß ? “
Ich würde das mal ungeschützt bejahen .
Ja , ich würde annehmen , dass die ZDF - Redakteurin erkannt hat , dass die Filmemacher da Fernsehaufnahmen mit Zeitungsschlagzeilen kombiniert haben , indem sie die bewegten Bilder nachträglich an die Stelle der Original - Fotos gesetzt haben .
Ich würde sogar annehmen , dass die meisten Zehnjährigen das erkannt hätten .
Germany – Give Them A Free Pass On Carbon Offsets ?
This is an interesting little graph .
It shows the “ change of temperatures in a year ” , that is the dT /yr , and the cumulative change over the life of all the thermometers , dT .
What surprised me most when I made it was that it was so flat that the two lines were on top of each other .
I had to make the dT / yr line semitransparent to make it readable .
( You ought to be able to click on the graph for a really big version ) .
I was so surprised at the 1850 to date flatness that I extended it back to 1750 just to see if they were still stable in the far past .
Yup. 260 years , flat .
First off , this is interesting because the Germans are generally known for being real sticklers about issues of precision and quality .
Not the sort of folks to cut corners on where or how temperatures are to be measured .
Secondly , because other countries in the same general area do have warming trends in their data .
And then there is poor Turkey , burning up in comparison .
All of which argues for instrument error as much more likely than CO2 .
At least , I ca n’t think of any way for CO2 to “ Give Germany a pass ” .
And yet Germany has a strong “ Green ” movement that is highly vocal about “ Global Warming ” and has policies promoting the various forms of carbon reduction .
One can only guess that the politicians there do n’t look at their own temperatures much .
But this did give me an idea on how to fix “ Global Warming ” .
For any country who ’s change of temperature over time is within a small fraction of flat , give them a complete “ free ride ” on all the Carbon Cap & Trade , CO2 Sequestration , Light Bulb Police , you name it .
Declare them a “ Guilt Free Zone ” .
Somehow I think we would find Global Warming evaporate in a tide of precision and calibration …
In that spirit , I hereby declare Germany a “ Carbon Guilt - Free Zone ” .
Enjoy !

Any self - respecting Coke addict knows that the sugary soft drink once contained trace amounts of cocaine .
Now Bolivia is putting coca leaves in a suspiciously similar - sounding fizzy drink : Coca - Colla .
That ’s not a typo , the drink is named after the Colla people of Bolivia ’s highlands .
A batch of half - liter 12,000 bottles was recently sold for $ 1.50 a pop in La Paz , Santa Cruz , and Cochabamba , according to the UK Guardian .
In the past , Bolivia has tried to banish the coca leaf–a mild stimulant –from production .
But now that coca grower Evo Morales is president , the government has changed its stance .
Morales ’ administration backs the coca leaf for legitimate uses , including teas , liqueurs , toothpaste , and now Coca - Colla .
At the same time , the government has booted drug enforcement officials out of the country .
If all goes well with Coca - Colla and the other coca products proliferating in Bolivia , the government might allow 20,000 hectares of land for coca growing –up from 12,000 hectares currently .
The U.S. is , of course , worried that much of the coca will be used for cocaine .
It very well might be .
But coca has been used for centuries in medicine , religion , and cooking in South America .
Is it really fair to enforce our drug laws on Andean culture ?
Regardless of whether or not it ’s fair to crack down on Bolivian coca use , Coca - Cola probably is n’t too happy about the potential copyright infringement here .

The jury took only an hour to hand a major victory for nurses all over the country who have a duty to report actions of doctors whose behavior endangers patient health .
Mitchell and two other nurses had sent an anonymous letter about alarming behavior of Dr. Rolando Arafiles Jr. to the Texas State Medical Board for doing improper medical procedures and pushing the sale of questionable nutritional supplements from his business to his hospital patients .
When the hospital failed to respond to her complaints she reported him to the Texas Medical Board that licenses physicians .
Her identity as an anonymous whistle blower was protected until the doctor found out he was under investigation and asked his friend and business associate , Winkler County Sheriff Roberts , to find out who the whistleblower was .
According to the New York Times , the sheriff seized the nurses ’ computers and found the letter .
As a whistleblower in good faith her name is supposed to be protected .
This resulted in the hospital firing her and the felony charges against her .
The acquittal verdict was a great victory .
Many nurses around the State of Texas and the country had come to her defense and raised over $ 50,000 for her .
But , most important , had she not been acquitted , it would have silenced whistleblowers to the detriment of the care of patients .
Nurses are a very important line of protection and defense for the proper care of patients and a different verdict would have had a chilling effect on the protection of patients .
The NNU ( National Nurses Union ) is submitting a bill to congress and in it is much stronger protection for nurses who come out and speak about poor medical practices and situations that endanger patients .
Currently , the Texas “ safe harbor laws , ” which are very weak , are a nurse ’s only protection for speaking out .
Many nurses call them the “ unsafe harbor laws ! ”
The medical ( and nursing ) boards rely on other medical professionals to alert them to unsafe practices .
Currently , Anne Mitchell has filed a suit against the hospital , the doctor and Sheriff Roberts along with several elected officials including the County Attorney and District Attorney .
As a lifelong RN , I admire Mitchell ’s courage .
I have known firsthand the problems of giving good care with poor staffing ratios , as well as lack of protection when a nurse complains or finds herself in an unsafe situation where she cannot walk out or be accused of abandonment .
The NNOC ( National Nurses Organizing Committee ) and the National Nurses Union are successfully organizing nurses in California and other states , including Texas , because of these kinds of conditions .
They hope to make improvements as their membership is already in the hundreds of thousands .

Soloing is often described as the most pure and dangerous form of climbing .
For all of us , testing the limit of what 's comfortable , whether that 's scrambling up 5.3 terrain or spending fifty days on a big wall alone , is an unparalleled mental and physical exploration .
We at Alpinist asked the most inspiring solo climbers we know — those defining the edge of what 's humanly possible — to tell us more about their rare connection to the vertical world .
In this week 's feature , Alex Honnold opens the Alpinist.com Solo Series .
The upstart was virtually unknown to the climbing world until one year ago when he free soloed Astroman , among other accomplishments , in Yosemite ( read the October 30 , 2007 NewsWire ) .
Then on April 1 , 2008 he completed one of the most impressive free solos ever achieved : the Zion classic , Moonlight Buttress ( read the April 7 , 2008 NewsWire ) .
How did a 22 - year - old from Sacramento do it ?
Find out below .
1 . Please tell us a bit about yourself .
I 'm from Sacramento , California .
I 'm 22 years old , and I pretty much do n't do anything outside of climbing .
2 . How did you become a pro climber , and when did you start free soloing ?
advertisement
About twelve years ago my parents took me to a climbing gym .
They figured I 'd enjoy it , and I did .
As for going pro , it was just one of those lucky things — I met the right people and they started giving me things .
I 'm not totally sure how I started soloing .
I 'd been reading stories about Croft and Bachar and the Stone Masters since I was a kid .
I guess I always thought it was " cool . "
The reasons I solo now are a lot different than when I started .
I used to be a lot more scared .
I 'd be happy to be climbing but fearful of roofs , or any time I lost good footholds , and other silly things .
But it was always exciting .
That kept me coming back .
3 . It seems like you 've had a fairly steep learning curve .
Can you explain what made you so strong mentally and physically ?
It 's actually not a super steep learning curve .
I 'd been climbing fairly well in the gym for years .
Then I switched to climbing outdoors all the time .
I just got noticed all of the sudden .
I do n't know what made me strong mentally , if I even am .
You should see me around hot ladies .
Terrified .
4 . What does free soloing represent to you ?
It represents total commitment .
Perfection .
Execution .
5 . Why do you free solo ?
Why do you climb ?
Because it 's fun .
I find it rewarding .
Challenging .
Whatever .
I solo for the same reason I climb .
I enjoy it .
6 . Why do you like free soloing multipitch routes ?
I feel like it 's more worth it than soloing a single pitch .
Less contrived .
More committing .
And I love exposure .

7 . Please tell us about your first free solo .
I 'm pretty sure my first solos were at Lover 's Leap : Knapsack Crack ( 5.3 ) and Corrugation Corner ( 5.7 ) .
Knapsack is so low angle and easy that you can pretty much just walk up it .
You can just walk up next to the crack if you prefer 5.6 friction .
Lots of folks learn how to lead on it .
I was getting my confidence up .
Corrugation is more committing .
It 's three pitches and pretty vertical .
I do n't remember very well , but I 'm sure I climbed it totally statically , overgripped the shit out of it .
I probably was climbing terribly and was really scared .
8 . What has shifted since you were scared of free soloing ?
How have you tamed your fears ?
Well a lot of things are different .
The most obvious is that I 'm stronger now than when I started soloing .
I 'm climbing a number harder , so things are just a little easier .
Not getting pumped makes everything feel much more secure .
Also , I used to free solo a lot more just because I had no partners .
I did n't know anyone anywhere , and I was a little afraid to talk to people .
So I 'd climb by myself , which got me onto routes that would otherwise be unappealing .
I was always onsight soloing stuff , looking for new routes just to tick things , do something new .
Now I mostly just solo climbs I really like .
I stick to quality a little more .
I 'm also soloing a lot less now than I used to .
I sport climb more and have partners more .
Soloing is more of a special occasion for me now .
As for taming fear , I 'm not sure if I 'd phrase it like that .
The first time I jugged I was gripped .
It was the West Face of Leaning Tower in the Valley — super exposed , overhanging .
But after doing a few more walls it became routine .
The first time I soloed it was a little scary .
Everyone says , " If your foot pops you die , " or " What if you get stung by a bee ?!
You 'd die . "
One by one I had all those things happen to me .
I 've blown feet , had birds come out of cracks , had bats hiss ( which always scares the shit out of me ) , and nothing ever came of it .
You go up there and climb — sometimes you get off route or sometimes it 's dirtier than you 'd like , but you either push through it or climb down .
Nothing dramatic ; nothing crazy ; certainly never really " do or die " not to say that can't happen , and if it does you 're in a bad way .
9 . What draws you to free soloing ?
When I 'm climbing there 's no difference between being roped up or free soloing .
On Moonlight Buttress there was no difference except that things are done perfectly .
The focus is amazing .
It 's hard to describe the feeling of perfection when you solo ... that you 're doing everything with precision .
When I lead I can often just charge ahead .
Soloing requires more .
10 .
Some say that free soloists have a death wish .
What do you think of this assessment ?
Well I have n't died yet .
I definitely agree with the Dan Osman quote : " You do n't wanna die right ?
So you just do n't fall . "
And I 've often said things to the same effect .
" It 's no big deal because you wo n't fall . "
I would rather not die .
But I know I will eventually , and I might as well live fully until then .
After a long run that began the day after the John F. Kennedy assassination in 1963 , the British science - fiction show Doctor Who went off the air in 1989 .
In the time between , it scared several generations of children , became a British television institution , and gathered a sizable cult following in the United States .
But throughout the ’90s and early ’00s , it seemed like a thing of the past .
A 1996 TV movie went nowhere , and an aging fandom had to content itself with novels , radio plays , and other miscellany .
That changed in 2005 when Queer As Folk creator Russell T. Davies took over the show and Christopher Eccleston became the ninth actor , within the confines of television , to assume the role of the time - traveling adventurer known only as The Doctor .
After one season , Eccleston handed the role over to David Tennant , who enjoyed a long , beloved tenure in the part in an era characterized by Davies ’ ability to balance the elements of classic
Who with sophisticated storytelling ( which rarely forgot it had to entertain children as well as science - fiction fans ) .

Last year saw the end of Davies ’ and Tennant ’s time on the show , but fans began to breathe easier when Steven Moffat was announced as Davies ’ successor .
A TV veteran famous for inventing , in his words , the “ feel - bad sitcom ” with the divorce - themed Joking Apart , Moffat most famously created and wrote the original version of Coupling .
He ’s also a lifelong
Who fan who wrote some of the most acclaimed episodes of the Davies era , including “ Blink , ” a fixture on any shortlist of the show ’s best episodes .
Who would assume the part of the Eleventh Doctor was another matter .
Speculation drifted from David Morrissey to Paterson Joseph ( who would have been the first black Doctor ) to , most improbably , Catherine Zeta - Jones before landing on Matt Smith , a name that left most scratching their heads .
An up - and - coming theater and television actor , Smith is , at 26 , the youngest actor to assume the part , but he slips into it like an old hand in the new era ’s first episode , “ The Eleventh Hour , ” which airs Saturday on BBC America .
On a trip to New York — Smith ’s first — Moffat and Smith spoke to The A.V. Club about the show ’s next phase .

STEVEN MOFFAT
The A.V. Club :
You wrote some of the best - liked episodes in the Russell Davies era .
What was it like to go from swooping in to do an episode or two to having to run the entire show ?
Advertisement
Steven Moffat :
It ’s a completely different job .
Writing individual episodes is still sort of the same job .
In that moment , I ’m a writer , so I ’m doing the same thing .
But I also have to look after the other scripts and help out the other writers when they need it .
I ’ve got to be across every creative decision taken on the show .
That does n’t mean I make every creative decision — sometimes I read articles that make it sound like I make the entire show myself — but I have to be across it all .
It ’s the most hugely demanding job I ’ve ever done or expected to .
AVC : Previously when you ’ve run series , it ’s always been your scripts from first episode to last .
What is it like working with other writers on this one ?
Advertisement
SM : It ’s actually quite joyous .
They ’re all really lovely people .
I knew all of them to some degree — it ’s quite a small industry .
I knew some of them extremely well , which is just fun .
We generally have a good time ; lots of mad meetings and mad spinning of ideas .
So I did enjoy all that .
That was n’t a problem at all .
AVC : When you have a show that varies wildly in tone and even in genre from week to week , how do you decide how you balance a season ?
Advertisement
SM : Above all else , 70 percent of the decision is entirely , “ Is this a good story ? ”
If we ended up with two stories that seemed similar next to each other , in the end , if they ’re both great stories , we ’ll still go with that .
Balancing it is easy .
Getting good stories is the hard part , and that ’s always the priority .
I think the people who actually make the decisions spend more time worrying about the balance and the variety and the audience , actually .
Really , it ’s just about great stories , and that is far and away the hardest , biggest , and most important problem we have to solve .
AVC : What makes a great Doctor Who story ?
SM : The answer is a rather challenging one .
The answer is “ absolutely everything . ”
It ’s a show that attempts to entertain by every means possible .
We try to be across every genre and every style in any given episode .
It ’s like trying to press every button at once .
There ’s a bit of funny and silly and frightening and serious and moving and ridiculous , all at the same time , which is what gives it its extraordinary flavor and its incredible longevity .
It has not only that variety and width across the episodes , but it has them within the episodes , too .
So a great Doctor Who story just has to supply all of that at once .
That sounds like a terrifying answer , but that ’s the truth .
You really are looking for a very high level of invention and energy .
Advertisement
AVC : Who shoulders more of the burden in making sure the show stays true to the Doctor Who that has come before : the people writing the script , or the person playing The Doctor ?
SM : I suppose it ’s me .
But I have to say , that ’s not a problem that ever really comes up .
First of all , it ’s so hardwired into my brain after working on it for so long and having loved the show for so long .
I do n’t have difficulty in knowing what ’s right and proper for Doctor Who .
Also , it ’s a broad show , Doctor Who .
It can take an awful lot of variety .
Advertisement
AVC : What ’s the first episode you saw as a child ?
SM : I ’m informed , but I have no ability to remember , I did actually watch the first one .
I must have been just under the age of 2 , so I would n’t remember it very well .
[ Laughs . ]
The first one I remember watching was the very first one or second one that Patrick Troughton was in , but I know that was n’t the first one I saw , because I was confused about where Doctor Who had gone .
I kept asking my dad , “ Where ’s Doctor Who ? ”
And he said , “ Well , the man with the black hair is Doctor Who , ” and I was very , very confused .
So I must have been a regular viewer up until that point .
But in very early childhood , you do n’t remember that well .
Advertisement
AVC : You saw the show go into decline and go off the air .
Did you ever have in the back of your mind that you ’d get a chance to help revive it ?
SM : It was always a fanciful thing I ’d love to do .
I got started in television in 1987 , ’ 88 , just as the show was going off the air , and I remember actually thinking — I had a big name in children ’s television for a while , and I thought , “ Oh , maybe I ’ll get a shot at doing Doctor Who . ”
And they more or less axed it that day .
It was like I had waited 26 years and missed by an afternoon .
Advertisement
AVC : As someone associated with the Davies era , how do you go about making this era of the show your own ?
SM : Again , that ’s not something I think about .
I do n’t think , “ How am I going to stamp ‘ me ’ all over this show ? ”
Who the hell cares about that ?
People want to tune in and see the most exciting series they ’ve ever seen .
They want to see Doctor Who ; they want to see monsters and fun and adventure .
It happens automatically .
It ’s not something you think about .
I think that the series we ’ve got probably is quite distinct in tone from the previous one , but it ’s not something I ’ve ever given a second thought to .
It ’s automatic .
It just happens .
My priorities are where they should be , which is making really great , really exciting television .
Advertisement
AVC : That said , in every new era , including this one , there ’s sort of a reinvention of every element , from The Doctor to the interior of the TARDIS to the sonic screwdriver .
SM : Yeah , we had to .
As I arrived , the entire regular cast was leaving .
It just made sense to go for a clean slate .
That ’s not , within the history of Doctor Who , such a radical decision .
One of the great things about Doctor Who , as with James Bond , as with Sherlock Holmes , I suppose , is that occasionally they just do a clean slate .
You change everything , and yet you change nothing .
It ’s the same show made of different bits .
Advertisement
AVC : Others have noted that there ’s an autobiographical element to your sitcom work .
Is there anything autobiographical about your work on Doctor Who ?
SM : I certainly hope not !
Not really .
When I was writing — there ’s always bits and pieces of your life leaking .
But Doctor
Who is such a wild fantasy , it would be hard to use many of the details of an ordinary middle - aged writer ’s life to inform that .
But I suppose things creep in .
I have to say , I ’ve noticed that I ’m missing comedy a bit .
I ’m tending to write a lot of very funny e-mails .
I ’ve got this column I write for Doctor Who Magazine , and I always write it very humorously .
I think I ’m just missing that side of writing a bit .
Advertisement
AVC : You ’ve brought in some writers known for comedy , though , to fill out the writing staff this season .
Was that a conscious choice ?
SM : Again , not at all .
Maybe because Mark Gatiss , Richard Curtis , and Simon Nye are all well - known comedy writers .
They ’re not coming in to do comedy episodes .
Those guys are just bloody good writers , and you ’re lucky to get them .
That ’s the truth .
I know this is going to sound very self - serving , and I apologize for it , but if you can write comedy , you can pretty much write anything , because it ’s the hardest .
It ’s the most technically demanding , the most precisely evaluated form of writing .
People know if it works or not .
There ’s a big button marked “ fail , ” and that ’s when nobody laughs .
I think training in comedy , as it were , a history writing comedy , is a powerful tool for anyone .
But no , it ’s entirely accidental .
These are all wildly experienced television writers , which is a must for Doctor Who .
This is not the show for rookies .
You really need to know your stuff .
Advertisement
AVC : Why is that ?
SM : I do n’t think I ’ve ever been involved in anything that is so technically demanding at every level .
You have to be a world - builder ; by that , I mean you have to create a whole world of people , whether it ’s a different planet or even just this planet .
You ’ve only got two regular cast members .
The precinct is the entirety of space and time , so you have to set up this whole world of characters that The Doctor meets .
You ’re not just inheriting a bunch of people and learning how to write for them as you would in a soap .
You ’re creating a whole bunch of characters for a one - and - only outing on television , because the ambition of Doctor Who is massive .
It ’s adventure and action and sci-fi and all those things that demand you have ambition and a sufficient knowledge of the realities of television to know how it can be realistically realized .
You have to know that we do n’t have Avatar ’s budget .
You ’ve got to be smart enough to set it down on the page in a way that a film crew could handle , that a production team could actually make it .
That requires loads of experience .
And there just are n’t , especially in Britain , that many action writers and adventure writers .
We ’ve got drama writers , but people who can actually write proper action - adventure are few and far between .
Advertisement
AVC : It must be overwhelming , also , to know that you make choices in the writing that will start people building special effects that you ca n’t take back .
If you decide on a three - eyed alien , you ’re kind of stuck with that .
SM : Well , you ’re never stuck with anything .
I have had to rewrite aliens to be equally exciting , but not as expensive .
I ’ve played the invisibility card more than once .
[ Laughs . ]
You have to be flexible on everything until the very last second on this show , because we are on a knife - edge with our budget .
I think the equivalent American show would just fall over laughing if they saw how much money we make this show for .
We just have to be creative to the last second .
Advertisement
AVC : “ The Eleventh Hour ” gives the impression that you have a larger budget than the previous series .
Is that incorrect ?
SM : That ’s incorrect .
[ Laughs . ]
We certainly do not have a larger budget , no .
No .
Advertisement
AVC : This is a quote from you about The Doctor ’s companions : “ The Doctor may long , he may notice , but he does n’t do . ”
If that ’s an ironclad rule and viewers know it , how much can you tease them without frustrating them ?
SM : It ’s not an ironclad rule .
Nothing can ever be a rule in drama , because then you ’re saying certain things wo n’t ever happen , and that would be very boring .
It , generally speaking , is true .
The Doctor does n’t seem to go that extra mile with any of the women he falls for — and he does fall for them , and always has — he just does n’t do that .
He seems to draw back from that .
To play the more fatherly , the older - brother figure , or just the almost boyfriend but not quite .
It ’s quite interesting with The Doctor and Rose .
He was quite clearly nuts for her , but just did n’t quite do that .
That ’s something he decided against .
Advertisement
AVC : Do you have , in your head if not in the show ’s canon , a reason why ?
SM : In my head , not within the series : I think it ’s quite important that we never quite know what The Doctor thinks .
He ’s a mysterious guy .
If we start reducing , we lose some of that .
But in my head , he knows he ’s leaving .
He ’s in love with that big blue box .
He wants to run away and explore the universe far more than he wants to settle down with anybody .
So if you ’ve got your bags packed at your feet from the moment you arrive , you know you ’re not in the business of making a commitment .

MATT SMITH
AVC : If I did my math right , you ’re of the generation that did n’t really have Doctor Who growing up .
Is that correct ?
Advertisement
MS : Your math is completely perfect .
I was part of the barren age that did n’t have the show , because they were foolish and they took it off the air , the silly old beans .
Yeah , man , that ’s exactly it .
So I did n’t really watch it as a kid .
I was aware of it , because you are in England .
It ’s really part of your cultural fabric over there .
You ’re born knowing about Doctor Who , and you know what the TARDIS is , and you know what a Dalek is and all that .
But it was n’t on the TV , which is a shame , because now I meet 8 - and 9 - year - olds , and I see how much they love it , and I wish I had that experience a little bit .
But I get to be The Doctor now , so that ’s payoff .
AVC : What was your first encounter with the series , then ?
MS : I was aware of it .
I had seen it on the TV every now and again .
But it was sort of my audition .
I got this script for it , and I was like , “ Wow , this is the best thing I ’ve read in ages , and this guy is the best character I ’ve seen in ages .
He ’s the cleverest man in the universe .
He has that courage , wit , bravery , but he ’s also incredibly fallible , so it ’s incredible .
On getting the job , I went back and watched all of the current revival , from Christopher [ Eccleston ] through David [ Tennant ] , and then went back and watched some Tom Baker and Patrick Troughton .
Advertisement
AVC : The audition process was apparently three weeks long .
What was that like ?
MS : It was relatively simple , to be honest .
There were two auditions , and they happened in hotels , because they want to keep it a secret and stuff .
But it was like any other audition , you know ?
You try and learn the lines ; you try and be as brave and creative as you can .
You go in and you do your bit .
That ’s what I did , and here I am today .
It ’s sort of remarkable , really .
Advertisement
AVC : How much has your interpretation of the character changed from the time of the audition to filming the first appearance ?
MS : Hugely .
Absolutely massively .
Hopefully there were elements of the same man in there , but obviously whatever my instincts were were correct .
But I think the way I articulate them , I ’ve probably just become more assured and more in control of the language as well .
The language in Doctor Who is mad .
And he says a lot of it .
That ’s one of the great practical challenges , just learning the lines , because there are so many in each and every scene .
I think I ’ve probably just become more assured and in control as the series has gone on , which hopefully makes sense narratively for my Doctor , as well .
He sort of starts off a bit like a newborn lamb .
Advertisement
AVC : You ’re destined to be compared to David Tennant .
How conscious are you of avoiding any sort of tics or recognizable influences from Tennant ’s performance ?
MS : Well , it ’s not something I ’ve ever — I would obviously never imitate , but it ’s not something I ’ve consciously tried to avoid or recreate .
I play the truth as I see it .
I guess that ’s for other people to decide , because I just do it my way , and that ’s the only way I will ever do it .
Advertisement
AVC : When did you realize that you understood the character , and that this was a part you could play ?
MS : I ’d probably be lying if I said it was in the first day of the first week .
I was probably just going , “ Wow , what the hell is going on ? ”
But part of the battle of the first month is not understanding quite where you are , and seeing these great cultural icons like Daleks and TARDIS in front of you is part of understanding , here he is .
He ’s battling through that and summoning your courage .
I suppose there ’s not one particular , definitive moment I can give you when I said , “ It was in this scene on this day . ”
Whatever it is , whatever I ’ve put out there , whatever I ’ve done , it all has to be …
From the first day , I have to say I understood it then .
Because I was there .
I was doing it .
And that ’s the only way that it can be .
But I guess two weeks in , I felt more comfortable than I did on the first day .
Four weeks in , I felt more comfortable than I did two weeks in .
From then on , it ’s your home , and you ’re playing with it , and you ’ve got this wonderful part .
But there was n’t one definitive moment .
Advertisement
AVC : Based on “ The Eleventh Hour , ” it seems like if anything is starting to set you apart , it ’s that you use a lot more physical movement to your performance as The Doctor .
Is it tough to be physical in tweed ?
MS : [ Laughs . ]
I do n’t know , man .
I think tweed lends itself to being physical , because it looks just a bit odd .
I do hope he ’s quite a physical Doctor , because I think that ’s quite an interesting way to play the comedy of it , actually .
I ’ve always been interested in physical actors like Peter Sellers .
I ’ve always been interested in the body .
There ’s a French [ performer and acting instructor ] called Jacques Lecoq who ’s always interested me , his theories and stuff .
So I hope I continue to explore his mad physical side , because it ’s this alien inhabiting a human body .
It ’s quite an odd concept .
Advertisement
AVC : You were an athlete before you were an actor , right ?
MS : Yeah , I was a footballer .
AVC : Do you draw on that at all ?
MS : Yeah , definitely .
I think there are definite parallels between sport and art .
There ’s a real sense of sacrifice .
There ’s a real sense of dedication that is needed in sport that I think you can attribute to art .
I think so much of it is about bravery and courage , being an actor .
I think similarly , these things can be applied in artistic roles .
It ’s about having the courage to follow your instincts , and also having the discipline and dedication to sacrifice the things in your life that you need to sacrifice to get the best out of yourself artistically .
So I learned a lot of valuable lessons as a sportsman .
Advertisement
AVC : The series can be any genre from week to week .
Have you found , at this early stage , a preference for a certain type of episode ?
MS : No .
I guess one of the great liberations as an actor is that the show can go anywhere and do anything and be anyone .
It ’s ever - changing , and the worlds are completely ever - changing .
There ’s never any world that you ca n’t inhabit .
I like the fact that it ’s always changing .
Once every 12 days , you ’re in the future , then in the past .
We filmed an episode called “ Vampires In Venice . ”
We filmed it in Croatia , and that was rather wonderful .
But then , of course , we went way into the future , and the sets are just mad .

AVC : Doctor
Who has always been more of a cult sensation here in the U.S. than in Britain .
How would you describe the series to someone here who has never seen it before ?
What would you say it ’s like ?
MS : I ’d say it ’s about a 900 - year - old alien who travels around time and space in a blue police box , which is called the TARDIS , having adventures , saving the world , and defeating evil .
It ’s not bound by space or time or logic or genre , and therefore creatively it can go anywhere and do anything .
You can be in the past with dinosaurs one week and in the future the next week , as the world is about to explode .
I think it ’s full of heart and humor and wit and invention .
I think Doctor Who improves your life .
And I mean that .
It ’s not just , like , my mission statement .
I do , as a man who ’s come to it late on , as well .
It ’s never too late to get into it .
I think we ’ve got a new team and a new show , and I think now is the time to start watching .
Gamasutra have just posted their " The Game Developer 50 " : a list of the most exciting games people to Gama right now : " the most important contributors to the current state of the game industry -- from indies to AAA , from business to art , design , and beyond .
Naturally as it's an American publication , there seems to be a bit of a skew to American people .
But all of them seem to be men .
Not one woman .
Not even one ?
So obviously I have to post something about this .
Lists are a wonderful and terrible thing : magazines do them for precisely this kind of response : ATTENTION .
Discussion .
Shouting , complaining , agreeing , etc .
It 's magazine crack .
But I have to stick my oar in , because having 0 % women on that list is straight up appalling ( and I adore Gamasutra ) .
Off the top of my head , without doing any research , here 's a handful of women working in games who I think Gama could happily have included in that 50 .
And I could actually add a whole bunch more ladies doing amazing things with games ( Jen , Diane , Cat , Sophie , Robin , Heather , Sarah , Claire , Rita , Susan , Merci , Regina and Tracy , for instance and for starters ) .
Meggan Scavio . Runs GDC .
Runs GDC .
Gama are probably being modest or something because Meggan 's an employee of its parent company .
Kim Swift .
Designed Portal .
Portal , no less .
Gone to do a startup : if that 's not fuck - yeah exciting , I do n't know what is .
Paulina Bozek .
Wonderful , incredibly talented , invented Singstar .
Doing some secret , very interesting things right now , but I 'll let her tell you what they are .
Margaret Robertson .
Living legend .
Annual packed event at GDC , an incredible games designer and oracle , and , well , I 've said it all before .
Babsi Lippe ( Chief Designer ) & Claudia Kogler ( CTO ) .
The creative & technical team who produced Papermint , with a titchy team and a titchy budget .
Rhianna Pratchett .
Wrote Mirror 's Edge , and Heavenly Sword , and Overlord .
Like I said , I could go on , and on .
If it were up to me , in creating any list , I would take a number - say 50 , and a field - say games , and then pick out the top 25 men and the top 25 women , highlighting whatever it is they 're doing .
Because that 's called fairness .
The reason women are n't currently making up 50 % of every field is not an intellectual issue , but a cultural issue , and the longer we continue to publish lists containing all - men or nearly - all - men , the longer we propagate the broken image and insulting idea that women are n't as good , or as important , as men .
Many women just have n't had the chance yet : they have n't had the encouragement , the education , the freedom , the support , the role models , the contacts , the friends in high places , the opportunities and the finances that their male counterparts often get by default , by tradition and by homophily .
It 's not right and it needs to change .
Monocultures are evolutionarily a dead end : game people , take note .
50 Ways Not to Waste Food
by Joanne Camas
Whether you 're worried about wasting food for moral or financial reasons , it 's always good to get new tips on stretching food .
Sometimes the most simple ideas are right under our noses , yet we do n't see them .
I stumbled on a classic Planet Green list of suggestions today .
While you may already use a lot of these , perhaps a couple will become part of your kitchen routine .
Many of them are timely , featuring vegetables that are hitting the farmer 's market this month .
Blanching and freezing those extra veggies before they ooze on the counter - top , for example , or saving celery leaves and chopping them into meatloaf or soup .
We also have a guide to 10 Money - Saving Ingredients ( with recipes for each ) and 35 Easy Ways to Stretch Your Food Dollars here at Epicurious , and my fellow Epi-log blogger Regina Schrambling has a feature on how to Eat Like a Chef on $ 25 a Day for a Family of Four .
Who says you need to spend a lot of money to eat well ?!
Have any frugal food tips of your own to share ?
Post them below !

Good suggestions from Planet Green & posters .
I think they 're right about the $ 600 in fruit wasted .
I started recycling it to the squirrel bowl outside my office door .
There 's nothing funnier than Rocky looking in the window to remind me he needs a tasty treat .

I buy pre-peeled garlic cloves ( $ 2 for a 1lb at Asian supermarkets ) to save on time , money , & stinky hands .
I usually can't get thru the whole jar before they spoil , so once I see them start to turn , I toss them in a foil pouch with olive oil and roast in a 400 degree oven for about 30 - 40 minutes .
Once they cool , I transfer to a freezer bag for easy access to add to pasta dishes and smear on bread .
I 'm also a big fan of saving produce and herb scraps to make vegetable stock on a regular basis .
It always comes in handy .

Kitten , nice name the nutty - one has too !
Ewwww
Those are some great ideas !!
I do n't really throw away a lot , except a little expired milk .
I do n't think I want to freeze it so I just buy it in very small increments .
I need 2 more overly ripe bananas for banana bread and I keep all leftover bread , it makes the best bread pudding .
I 've made smoothies with overly ripe fruit ( and almost - expired milk ) .
I also have a dog that will eat anything so she gets leftovers in small amounts .
It is a shame how much goes to waste in this world .
If I have leftover food that needs to be eaten , there are always friends and neighbors willing to take it off my hands !

Senate Republicans have backed away from a plan to offer hundreds of amendments to slow the passage of healthcare reform fixes under budget reconciliation .
This means the Senate will finish work on House - demanded changes to healthcare reform law sooner than expected .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Harry Mason ReidMeeting Trump Supreme
Court pick a bridge too far for some Democrats GOP senators confident Trump pick to be confirmed by November Durbin : Democrats can ' slow ' Supreme Court confirmation ' perhaps a matter of hours , maybe days at most ' MORE ( D - Nev. ) had hoped to finish the process by Friday or Saturday but now Thursday afternoon appears a possible end - point .

Special budget rules known as reconciliation limit floor debate in the Senate to 20 hours and enable the majority party to pass legislation with 51 votes .
But the rules do not limit the number of amendments that can be offered once debate has expired .
Senate Republicans had threatened to offer scores or even hundreds of amendments to keep the healthcare legislation from getting out of the chamber .
But GOP lawmakers have decided not to employ the dilatory tactic and instead call for votes on substantive amendments .
“ We ’ve decided that offering 200 or 300 amendments does n’t make sense , ” said Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) , one of the Senate ’s leading conservatives .
“ The leadership has asked us to focus on substantive amendments . ”
DeMint predicted the voting could wrap up by Thursday afternoon .
Twenty healthcare amendments were pending on the Senate floor as of late Wednesday afternoon .
Republicans plan to call for votes on another tranche of amendments but these are expected to have a solid connection to healthcare reform , instead of unrelated issues such as the legality of gay marriage in Washington , D.C .
“ I had 50 amendments , I still have them in my back pocket , but I ’ll probably only offer two or three , ” said DeMint , who plans to offer an amendment affecting the interstate commerce of insurance plans .
DeMint said Republicans will narrow the scope of amendments but still make Democrats take tough votes on healthcare .
These votes could be used for campaign ads in October and November .
Democrats have already voted to table an amendment offered by Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - N.H. ) that would have halted Medicare spending cuts to fund federal subsidies to the uninsured .
They also tabled a motion sponsored by Sen. Mike Crapo Michael ( Mike ) Dean CrapoSupreme

Republicans had initially offered amendments on a range of issues with little relation to healthcare reform , earning harsh criticism from Democrats .
Sen. Robert Bennett ( R - Utah ) offered an amendment to instruct the District of Columbia to immediately suspend the issuance of marriage licenses to same - sex couples and hold a referendum on the issue .

“ It sounded like it was going to be the usual fare . ”
Durbin said if Republicans were going to be “ more serious ” by calling for votes only on substantive healthcare amendments , “ it ’s a good outcome . ”
Jasmin Wagner zur Anti-" DSDS " - Kampagne " Blümchen macht das schon ganz gut "
Mit ihrem 14 Jahre alten Song " Boomerang " soll Jasmin Wagner alias Blümchen den " DSDS " - Gewinner Mehrzad Marashi vom ersten Platz der Charts fernhalten .
Im Interview mit stern .de verrät die Sängerin , warum sie das gern tut .
Von Alexander Kühn
Frau Wagner , Sie scheinen einen verdammt guten PR - Berater zu haben .
Auf die Idee , mit einem 14 Jahre alten Lied noch mal für Gesprächsstoff zu sorgen , muss man erst mal kommen .
Au weia !
Sie glauben , mein Management habe sich diese Aktion ausgedacht ?
Der Verdacht liegt nahe .
Den
Mut hätten wir nie gehabt .
Wenn es so einfach wäre , einen Platz in den Charts zu ergattern , würden wir ständig alte Lieder von mir auf den Markt werfen .
Ich kann ehrlichen Herzens sagen : Wir wussten davon nichts .
Ich bin überrascht , was da gerade passiert .
Folgendes passiert : Im Internet kursiert ein Aufruf , das Lied " Boomerang " herunterzuladen , Ihre Hit - Single von 1996 , als Sie sich noch Blümchen nannten .
So soll verhindert werden , dass der gerade gekürte Sieger von " Deutschland sucht den Superstar " den ersten Platz der Charts erobert .
Vorbild war offenbar eine Aktion in England .
Dort wurde dazu aufgerufen , ein Lied von Rage Against the Machine zu kaufen , um dem Sieger der Casting - Show " The X Factor " eins auszuwischen .
Die haben es tatsächlich geschafft , ihn vom Thron zu stoßen .
Das alles geschieht pünktlich zu Ihrem 30 .
Geburtstag und zum 15 .
Jahrestag Ihres ersten Auftritts als Blümchen .
Na , wenn das kein geschickter Marketing - Schachzug ist !
Ich weiß wirklich nicht , wer sich diese Kampagne ausgedacht hat .
Die Person hat sich bislang nicht bei mir gemeldet .
Ich würde die ganze Initiative auch unterstützen , wenn es sich nicht um ein Lied von mir handeln würde - ich liebe diese Form von zivilem Ungehorsam .
Unverhofft zur Pressesprecherin der " Boomerang " - Bewegung geworden , ich fühle mich wie im Wahlkampf .
Wäre kultig gewesen , mit einem Lied von Roy Black in den Dowlandkrieg zu ziehen .
Oder Heino .
Oder , hossa , hossa , Rex Gildo .
Warum ausgerechnet Blümchen ?
Manches im Leben entscheidet der Zufallsgenerator .
Offenbar mag er Blümchen .
Man hört ja , dass die 90er Jahre wieder im Kommen sind .
Ich habe jetzt nicht vor , meine eigenen Platten zu remixen , wie manche Künstler von damals das tun , sonst wäre der ganze Charme dieser Aktion dahin .
Allerdings will meine alte Plattenfirma jetzt die " Boomerang " - Single wieder auf den Markt bringen .
Blümchen als Trittbrettfahrerin von " DSDS " ?
Ich hoffe , dass man das anders wahrnimmt .
Es geht ja darum , ein Gegengewicht zu " DSDS " herzustellen .
Viele Stimmen tun sich zusammen und finden plötzlich Gehör .
Wenn ich da als Galionsfigur dienen darf , herzlich gern .
Beim Musikvertrieb iTunes belegen
Sie zurzeit Platz zwei , Mehrzad ist auf eins .
Aber das ist doch phänomenal !
Man muss sich vorstellen , diese Mobilisierung ist innerhalb weniger Wochen entstanden .
Dem gegenüber steht die gesamte Macht von RTL , Deutschlands stärkstem privaten Fernsehsender .
David gegen Goliath !
Blümchen - das war Plastikpop , neonfarben , plüschig , mit dicker Schminke ...
... schuldig im Sinne der Anklage !
In den vergangenen Jahren haben Sie sich bemüht , dieses Image loszuwerden .
Jetzt reden wieder alle von Blümchen anstatt von Jasmin Wagner .
Ich arbeite ja vorwiegend als Schauspielerin .
Das ist eine Tätigkeit fern der Omnipräsenz eines Teeniestars .
Aber wenn ich Theaterpremiere hab , berichten die Zeitungen auch , so ist es ja nicht .
Ob das die " Männerbeschaffungsmaßnahmen " an den Hamburger Kammerspielen sind oder die Kreuzgangspiele in Feuchtwangen , wo ich im vergangenen Sommer als Esmeralda im " Glöckner von Notre Dame " auf der Bühne stand .
Und jetzt , in diesen Tagen , sind Sie wieder Blümchen
Definitiv nicht .
Ich bin eine erwachsene Sängerin und Schauspielerin , die als Teenager den Künstlernamen Blümchen hatte .
Die Popstar - Attitüde habe ich abgelegt .
Heute rufe ich nicht mehr in die Menge : " Seid ihr gut drauf ?
Wo sind eure Hände ? "
Haben Sie das Gefühl , über eine fremde Person zu reden , wenn es um Blümchen geht ?
Ich bin eng mit Blümchen verbunden , es waren prägende Jahre .
Mir ist klar , dass ich nicht auf der Bühne stünde , wenn ich nicht als 15 - Jährige " Herz an Herz " gesungen hätte .
Aber wer mir heute die Hände schüttelt , kommt nicht auf die Idee , mich Blümchen zu nennen .
Da steht eine Frau , die eine ganz andere Ausdrucksform gefunden hat .
Neidisch auf Blümchens Erfolg ?
Sie macht das schon ganz gut .
Auf jeden Fall hat sie , was Plattenverkäufe angeht , die Nase vorn .
Aber die Kritiken , die Jasmin Wagner für ihre letzte Platte bekommen hat , gefallen mir schon besser .
Allo !
Allo ! syndrome : Meet the Yorkshirewoman who woke up with a French accent , and the Brummie who started speaking like an Italian
Fickle voice : Richard Murray , pictured with his wife Amy , suffers from Foreign Accent Syndrome
Wendy Hasnip is now used to the routine .
Climbing into a taxi , she tells the driver where she wants to go , then waits for the inevitable questions to start .
‘ You ’re a long way from home , love .
Whereabouts in Birmingham are you from ? ’ they ask .
Wendy smiles patiently , then explains that , actually , she ’s a pure - blood Yorkshire woman , albeit having lived down south for the past 36 years .
Three decades spent in Kent and more recently in Sussex may have softened her vowels , but she ’s never lived anywhere near the West Midlands in her life .
But for Wendy , 57 , being mistaken for a Brummie represents progress .
Ten years ago , she spent 18 months with a broad , French accent - sounding ‘ like something from Allo Allo ’ - after suffering a minor stroke .
Since then , bizarrely , her accent has evolved during her long recovery and passed through several different hues , resulting in her being mistaken for a wide variety of nationalities .
‘ I ’ve been asked what region of Ireland I ’m from , and more recently where in the West Midlands .
I ’m yet to be asked whereabouts in Yorkshire I ’m from .
That will be a good day for me , ’ she says .
Wendy , an award - winning special needs teacher , now living in Bexhill - on - Sea , in East Sussex , suffers from Foreign Accent Syndrome , a very rare but recognised medical condition in which , due to a stroke or brain injury , a person starts speaking in a different accent .
The syndrome was first discovered in Norway in 1941 when a young woman who ’d been injured in a bombing raid woke up speaking with a German accent .
Since then , there have been only 60 recorded cases worldwide .
Last week , IT project manager Sarah Colwill was featured in the Mail after an excruciating migraine attack last month left her with a Chinese accent .
The 35 - year - old , who lives in Plymouth , suffered an acute hemiplegic migraine , which causes the blood vessels in the brain to expand , resulting in stroke - like symptoms .
‘ I just want my own voice back , but I do n’t know if I ever will , ’ said Mrs Colwill last week .
‘ I spoke to my stepdaughter on the phone from hospital and she did n’t recognise me .
‘ Since then I ’ve had my friends hanging up on me because they think I ’m a hoax caller . ’
She is now having speech therapy to try to revert to her Devon accent .
Foreign Accent Syndrome : Sarah Colwill , left , speaks with a Chinese accent ; Wendy Hasnip , right , from Yorkshire , spent 18 months with a French accent
The most fascinating question her story posed was just how long these extraordinary symptoms last .
As I discovered this week in talking to Wendy Hasnip and others who suffered the same symptoms some time ago , the answer is that they can continue for many years .
Other noted cases have included Linda Walker , a Geordie who woke up after a stroke with a distinct Jamaican accent in 2006 , and Scot Tom Paterson , who earlier this year woke from a coma , after a car crash , speaking like a Pole .
Professor Sophie Scott , from University College London ’s Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience , says : ‘ Speech is very important for humans , and a lot of different parts of the brain are used , as well as what we call the articulator parts of the body such as the tongue , jaw and voice box .
‘ Where something relatively minor has happened to the brain and a patient has n’t totally lost their power of speech , they find themselves in a position where they know the words they want to say , but cannot coordinate their tongue , mouth , lips and voice box to formulate the words .
‘ Typical traits include substituting “ d ” for “ t ” and adding an extra syllable at the end of words , similar to how a foreigner would speak when attempting English .
‘ A native English speaker will immediately interpret these differences as a foreign accent — it is a natural reaction for us to try to “ place ” someone .
‘ Interestingly , when recordings of these sufferers ’ speech is played to foreigners , they do not hear a foreign accent , just someone speaking with difficulty . ’
WHO KNEW ?
Of the 61 reported cases of Foreign Accent Syndrome worldwide , 58 were due to a stroke or head injury , and one linked to a migraine
So much for the theory , but how does it affect people in everyday life ?
Wendy admits she was terrified when her voice started to bend out of recognisable shape , literally syllable by syllable , one afternoon over coffee in November 1999 .
She ’d suffered a minor stroke a couple of weeks previously while at work , at the Watergate School in Lewisham , South London .
‘ I started to feel really unwell - totally drained and exhausted , ’ she says .
‘ I lost my speech and I could n’t walk properly .
After two weeks in hospital , Wendy was discharged .
‘ As a divorced mum to six boys , then aged between ten and 18 , I knew I had to get home and “ get on with it ” .
My speech was quite slurred at first , but gradually started to return , as did my mobility .
Then one day , a couple of weeks later , I was having coffee with my mother Freda , who lived a few doors away in Otford , near Sevenoaks , where I lived at the time , when I noticed my voice starting to speed up .
Then I detected a slight accent , which sounded French . ’
Wendy is unsure whether she ’d suffered another stroke at this point , or if this was a sign of her speech patterns evolving as her brain began its recovery and compensation process .
‘ I ’d only ever spent a weekend in France , so I had no idea why this was happening to me .
I was powerless to stop it .
It was a very strange sensation .
‘ My intonation and sentence structure were muddled and confused , like a foreign national struggling with English .
I was using a different vocabulary , calling things “ bizarre ” — a word I do n’t normally use . ’
Assuming it was part of her recovery process , Wendy did n’t go back to hospital but determined to carry on as normal .
A few days later - and by now speaking with a heavy French accent - she was escorting her mother to a hospital appointment when she explained her strange - sounding voice to volunteers in the hospital shop .
‘ One said she ’d heard of this condition called Foreign Accent Syndrome and offered to look it up on the internet for me . ’
New voice : Scottish Tom Paterson developed an Ayrshire accent after waking up from a six - week coma
It was here Wendy learned of the work of two Oxford University researchers , cognitive neuropsychologist Dr Jennifer Gurd and phonetician Dr John Coleman , whose studies into the phenomenon were published in 2002 .
She happily offered herself as one of their guinea pigs and underwent various tests and brain scans at Oxford ’s John Radcliffe Hospital .
The researchers identified tiny areas of damage in various parts of volunteers ’ brains , which , they suggested , could bring about subtle changes in vocal features , which were interpreted by listeners as a foreign accent .
Wendy was hugely relieved : ‘ Once I had a diagnosis , and some sort of explanation , the fear factor was removed .
I was reassured that my accent would probably return to normal eventually . ’
The French accent did fade after about 18 months , but today there is a definite West Midlands twang .
Wendy says that although it would be nice to get her ‘ real ’ voice back , she is relieved to have escaped relatively unscathed .
Yorkshire native Chris Gregory had a similar experience of suddenly having a different accent two years ago when he awoke from a coma speaking with a broad Irish brogue .
The 32 - year - old from Sheffield spoke ( and sang ) like a native Dubliner and treated staff at Sheffield ’s Royal Hallamshire Hospital to a word - perfect rendition of Danny Boy as they brought him round following brain surgery .
Chris - who ’s now back at work as a landscape gardener - cannot remember a thing about the incident and has to take his wife Mary ’s word for what happened .
Geordie Linda
Walker woke up after a stroke with a Jamaican accent
‘ I ’ve told Mary that she should have videoed me .
I do n’t even know the words to Danny Boy . ’
Chris was in hospital in December 2007 having tests on a benign , egg - sized tumour which had been discovered in the right side of his brain three years earlier .
His medical team had decided that , although operable , it was safer to leave the tumour where it was , but booked in Chris for regular scans to monitor it .
At one of these routine appointments , Chris and Mary - who was then his fiancée - were told the tumour had grown and a biopsy was arranged .
It was during this procedure that surgeons accidentally severed a blood vessel , causing bleeding in Chris ’s brain and leaving him delirious and in terrible pain .
From this point on , Chris relies on Mary to recall what happened .
She says : ‘ Once the bleeding was identified , surgeons operated to remove a 50 p - size piece of Chris ’s skull to relieve the pressure on his brain .
He was then put in a drug - induced coma for two days to give his brain time to rest . ’
The day his medical team woke him up , Mary , 37 , recalls walking into the ward hearing someone singing Danny Boy at the top of his voice .
‘ It sounded like a drunken Irishman and seemed to be coming from the direction of Chris ’s bed .
I thought it could n’t possibly be him , but when I pulled back the curtains , Chris was sitting up , belting out the tune with all the right words , and in a broad Irish accent .
‘ From that point , Chris kept referring to me as “ da broid ” whenever I walked in the room .
‘ His accent was absolutely perfect , but he had no connection with the country . ’
Mary says she was too relieved that Chris was alive to be worried .
The next morning , Chris ’s accent was back to broad Sheffield and he had no memory of his performance .
He spent another week in hospital and was back at work , fully fit , in April .
Specialists linked the incident to Foreign Accent Syndrome and concluded that parts of Chris ’s brain had been temporarily disabled by the pressure of the blood clot , distorting his pronunciation and word formation .
Subsequent brain scans have shown no further change in the tumour .
The couple married , as planned , in November 2008 , at a hotel in Sheffield .
‘ We joked afterwards that we should visit Ireland , but so far we still have n’t , ’ says Mary .
' I had to learn to talk again from scratch .
I was taught how to shape my mouth , and where to put my tongue to form sounds , and I practised with my wife Amy every night '
‘ Looking back , it did have its funny moments , but I ’m still so glad we got the old Chris back . ’
While he escaped relatively unscathed , the same cannot be said for Richard Murray , a born - and - bred Brummie who is still mistaken for a Welshman five years following a devastating stroke days after returning from his honeymoon in 2005 .
‘ Since that day , he has spoken with various accents , starting with Italian , passing through French and Polish , and then arriving back in the UK , somewhere between Birmingham and Cardiff .
‘ Chatting to people out and about in the town inevitably used to lead to the question : “ How long have you lived here , then ? ” ’ says Richard , 34 , a sales development manager , now living in Hereford .
‘ Nowadays , people tend to think I am Welsh , which does n’t prompt so many questions .
I really do n’t mind what nationality they think I am , I ’m still so grateful to be understood at all . ’
Doctors believe Richard ’s stroke was caused by a blood clot travelling to his brain from his big toe , which he ’d broken on honeymoon in Mauritius nine days earlier then probably exacerbated during the 13 - hour flight home .
Nine days later , he collapsed .
‘ I was in the kitchen and simply dropped to the floor .
‘ The right side of my body was paralysed and I was totally unable to speak . ’
Terrified , he was transferred to Cardiff Hospital ’s special neurological unit , where he was treated with drugs to break down the clot lodged in the left side of his brain - the area controlling the mechanics of speech .
‘ I still had the vocabulary and I could remember how words were supposed to sound - I just could n’t make my mouth and tongue make those sounds ; all that came out were grunts .
It was incredibly frustrating . ’
A week later , Richard was discharged from hospital , by which time he had full use of his arms and legs , but was still mute .
The wait for an NHS speech therapy was several months , but luckily his friend Sue Whitefoot , a qualified speech therapist , agreed to help him free of charge .
‘ I had to learn to talk again from scratch .
I was taught how to shape my mouth , and where to put my tongue to form sounds , and I practised with my wife Amy every night in front of a mirror . ’
Within two weeks , Richard had learned four basic words : ‘ hi’ , ‘ bye ’ , ‘ yes ’ and ‘ no ’ .
The minute he ’d mastered them , his new accent was apparent .
‘ Initially , I sounded Italian , but then turned more French .
‘ Once , in the supermarket the checkout assistant asked me a question which I could n’t answer , having used up my four stock words , and all I could do was shrug .
I heard someone in the queue behind me mutter : “ Bloody foreigner , why do n’t you learn English ? ” ’
With Sue and Amy ’s tireless support , Richard was able to return to his old job as a financial planning manager six months later .
‘ I warned clients at the outset that my accent had changed , and was continually changing , so they would know it was me when I called , not an Italian or Frenchman masquerading as me . ’
Four years on , Richard is now father to Olivia , three , and two - year - old Finlay , and says he ’s finally at a point where speech is coming naturally .
‘ The French accent has gone , for now .
It could come back .
It would be nice to have my old Birmingham accent back , but I am happy simply being able to talk — even if everyone ’s convinced I ’m a Welshman . ’
RICHARD LEE , a marijuana entrepreneur , has in recent years turned part of Oakland into the cannabis capital of California and perhaps the world .
Among his businesses is Oaksterdam University ( a play on Amsterdam , where he got the idea ) , which teaches students all aspects of the weed , from the horticultural to the medical and legal , and has since spawned copycats elsewhere .
But this year Mr Lee wants to do more .
He has sponsored a voter initiative , which has just been cleared for the November ballot , for the legalisation of marijuana in California .
Adults would be allowed to own up to an ounce ( 28.5 grams ) at a time for recreational use and could grow some in their homes .
The state , its cities and its counties would be able to regulate and tax it .
If the measure passes — a poll last year found 56 % in favour — California may once again lead the nation not only in usage but also in policy .
Californian voters were the first , in 1996 , to allow medical use of marijuana .
Since then , 13 states and the District of Columbia have followed , and several more are considering it , including Arizona and South Dakota , both of which will also vote on the matter this year .
California 's ballot measure would mark a new phase in decriminalisation , says Ethan Nadelmann , the founder of the Drug Policy Alliance , which lobbies for more enlightened drug laws .
Why vilify or even lock up adults who wish simply to enjoy in moderation a substance no more toxic than alcohol , when you could instead tax and regulate the trade ?
It would help state budgets , which are in crisis .
A tax - collecting agency in California , which confronts a $ 20 billion deficit , has estimated the potential revenues at more than $ 1 billion , plus savings from not locking people up .
That said , there would be legal hurdles .
Since 1961 an international treaty has banned non-medical use of narcotic drugs , and America 's federal law considers even medical use of cannabis a crime .
But Eric Holder , America 's attorney - general , last year signalled that cracking down on cannabis would not be one of his priorities .
This suggests that marijuana could follow the path that alcohol took in the 1930s .
Then , also during an economic crisis , the federal government stood back as the states relaxed Prohibition , until the 21st amendment officially ended it .

A new report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office shows that the Transportation Security Administration plans to install more than double the number of whole - body scanners at U.S. airports than originally planned .
Instead of deploying 878 units by the end of 2014 , the TSA now plans to install as many as 1,800 scanners -- or advanced imaging technologies -- at U.S. airports .
Rather than using them as an optional , secondary screening measure , the TSA 's revised strategy calls for increasing the use of the devices as a compulsory , primary screening measure " where feasible , " the report said .
The TSA 's revised plans stem from the failed Christmas Day bombing attempt of Northwest Flight 25 .
The new plans will cost the TSA an additional $ 2.4 billion in staffing alone , the GAO said .
The report called on the TSA to do a complete cost - benefit analysis of the technology to determine an optimal deployment strategy .
" While GAO recognizes that TSA is attempting to address a vulnerability exposed by the December 2009 attempted attack , a cost - benefit analysis is important as it would help inform TSA 's judgment , " the report said .
The TSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
Whole - body scanners are designed to detect nonmetallic weapons and explosives concealed under a passenger 's clothing , such as the explosive PETN powder that the accused would - be Christmas Day bomber , 23 - year - old Nigerian Umar Abdul Mutallab , concealed in his underwear .
The technology is being rolled out at 30 major U.S. airports , most recently at Boston 's Logan International and Chicago 's O'Hare .
Supporters of the scanners say the technology is vital to bolstering security at U.S. airports .
Despite complaints by travelers subjected to whole - body scans , the technology appears to be supported by a majority of Americans .
A USA Today Gallup poll taken in the aftermath of the failed bombing attempt indicated considerable support , with 78 % of the respondents favoring the use of whole - body scanners if it improved airline security .
Privacy groups and others opposed to the technology , meanwhile , claim that use of the scanners amounts to a strip search of air travelers .
Security analysts and even the GAO itself have called for a thorough review of the effectiveness of the technology in day - to - day airport security operations .
Last week 's GAO report ( download PDF ) is the agency 's third in the last six months to touch on whole - body scanners .
Like the previous reports , this one also raised questions about the effectiveness of the technology and whether a body scanner would have been able to thwart the Christmas Day bomber .
The report also said the GAO is reviewing the results of operational tests of the scanners conducted by the TSA , to get a better understanding of the technology 's effectiveness .
The GAO noted that the TSA has made an estimate of the life - cycle costs associated with the use of whole - body scanners but has so far not conducted a cost - benefit analysis of using the technology compared with other means , such as pat - downs , metal detectors or other practices .
The TSA 's revised plans to deploy 1,800 scanners represents a twofold increase from previous plans , the report said .
For fiscal 2011 , the TSA has requested 3,550 additional full - time employees to operate the machines at a cost of nearly $ 220 million .
From 2012 to 2104 , the agency will likely need additional staff to operate the devices , each of which costs $ 170,000 and requires three full - time employees to run it .

Tangible evidence of Masdar PV ’s commitment to become a major player in the solar photovoltaic sector came precisely at the turn of the decade with commissioning of a thin - film installation on the roof of its production halls in Ichtershausen , Germany .
Connected to the German grid on 31 December , 2009 , the 260 kW installation , comprising a total of 2900 modules , has secured feed - in payments of € 0.4037 / kWh for the next 20 years under the national EEG law .
The installation is anticipated to generate approximately 223 MWh and gross earnings of some € 90,000 [ US $ 122,700 ] annually .
While the installation at Ichtershausen could be considered a commercial success , and even a major step forward in Masdar ’s photovoltaic strategy , it is by no means the extent of its $ 2 billion solar thin - film PV investment programme , first outlined in mid-2008 .
This massive financial commitment , one of the largest ever made in the thin - film PV sector , will fund a three - phase PV manufacturing and expansion strategy which forms a part of the Masdar Initiative ’s drive to become a world leader in alternative energy .
Phase one involves an investment of $ 600 million to fund the development of two new manufacturing facilities .
In August , 2008 , Masdar PV broke ground on the first site at Ichtershausen , near Efurt .
The € 150 million [ US $ 230 million ] installation became operational in October 2009 , with delivery of the first solar modules to concrete manufacturer Beton Fertigteilbau Erfurt ( BFE ) for the construction of a 1 MWp open space solar park .
With a targeted annual capacity of 65 MW , the facility occupies a 15 hectare site and produces 5.7 m² modules .
Full capacity of the current production line should come in the third quarter of 2010 .
The modules , currently the world ’s largest , are produced using SunFab equipment from Applied Materials , adapted and optimised in cooperation with research partners and leading manufacturers in the sector , the company says .
Thin -Film ‘ Key ’ to Making PV Competitive With Fossil
Along with Applied , among other Masdar PV partners are the Helmhotz - Zantrum Berlin for Materials and Energie ( HZB ) — headed by Masdar PV research and development partner , Professor Dr. Bernd Rech , Manz Automation AG — for the development of new types of equipment for the production of thin - film solar modules , and FH Nordhausen Polytechnic , which specializes in systems engineering in the renewable energy field .
Research and development capabilities appear to form a fundamental part of the Masdar strategy to become one of the top three global suppliers of thin - film modules in the coming years .
Announcing the strategic alliance agreement with HZB in November 2008 , Masdar said the four - year programme was designed to substantially boost the efficiency of large - area PV modules .
Under the umbrella of the thin - film PV Competence Centre Berlin ( PVcomB ) , itself a joint initiative of HZB and the Technical University of Berlin , the move secured Masdar access to a world - class PV research institute as well as a major technical university .
Dr Rainer Gegenwart , CEO of Masdar PV , commented : ‘ Our success depends on using the most cost - efficient , innovative technology .
This partnership with PVcomB offers Masdar PV a crucial differentiator by combining their world - class ability to boost efficiencies and our team ’s experience in thin - film PV production .
This combination will provide us a major cost and technology advantage over competitors . ’
In addition , Masdar PV will also be using the roof installation at Ichtershausen as a test facility in the future .
‘ We want to also make use of the installation in order to test the energy yield of our solar modules in conjunction with various inverters ’ , explains Joachim Nell , COO / CMO of Masdar PV .
Use is therefore being made of inverter products from both Xantrex Technology and SMA Solar Technology .
Masdar PV ’s thin - film based tandem - junction amorphous silicon ( a - Si / a - Si ) PV modules are designed for use in open - space solar parks , or in large roof PV applications .
The company says that manufacturing of large - surface area substrates , compared with competitors of say 1.4 m² , significantly reduces total system costs .
Among other things , fewer cables and connectors are needed , for example , and the company claims the modules offer particularly high yields under diffuse lighting and high ambient temperatures , possessing the best cost - to - performance ratio currently on the market .
Furthermore , Masdar argues , the use of thin - film technology — which requires less than 1 % of the semiconductor material found in crystalline PV modules — is key to rapidly driving down the cost of PV and making it fully - competitive with fossil fuels .
Indeed , the company believes that the technology for grid - parity solar power already exists in most sunny markets , given the matter of achieving the right scale to hit lower costs .
Masdar PV says it intends to combine proven PV technology , advanced manufacturing capability , and R&D expertise , together with scale in order to deliver these lower costs .
Part of its strategy to achieve this involved choosing Germany ’s ‘ solar valley ’ in Thurungia as the site for its first plant .
Masdar says it did so because it is currently the centre of the global PV industry with access to a highly - qualified specialist workforce in the area of photovoltaics , excellent links with universities , institutes and technical colleges , and forward - looking regional government policies to promote the location of new , technology - led companies into the area .
Crucially , the German installation will act as a reference plant for technology and knowledge transfer to the larger Abu Dhabi plant that will be executed by a joint German - Abu Dhabi team .
A Multi-Country Strategy for Global Leadership
This second , sister facility is currently under development in Abu Dhabi and is expected to begin initial production by the second quarter of 2010 .
It is anticipated to have a yearly capacity of 130 MW , giving a combined annual total of 195 MW from the two sites .
This output is already committed to major PV system installers in Europe and for Masdar ’s own energy generation needs , the company says .
This approach represents a significant step in Masdar ’s objective to transform Abu Dhabi into a developer and exporter of technology , rather than an importer .
With a goal of reaching 1 GW of annual production by 2014 through capacity expansions and other new plants , this multi-country operation will allow Masdar PV to become a global leader in thin - film PV , it believes .
Dr. Sultan Al Jaber , CEO of Masdar , said : ‘ Thin - film PV is a key part of our build - deploy - develop strategy to actively build a strong position in alternative energy .
This [ $ 2 billion investment ] marks a major milestone for Masdar and Abu Dhabi .
It will not only establish Masdar as a major global PV player , but will be the first high - tech semiconductor nano - manufacturing facility of its kind in the entire region ’ , he added .
Commenting on the implications of the Masdar PV development , Dr. Winfried Hoffmann , president of the European Photovoltaic Industry Association , observed : ‘ The entry of such powerful energy leaders into solar is very exciting , and could change the dynamics of the entire industry ’ , adding that the move not only added capacity , but also opened new future big markets in and around the Middle East with good insolation and the capital to deploy PV systems .
Like many others in the sector , Masdar PV believes that thin - film technology is set to play an important role in the global solar PV industry of the future .
It cites studies undertaken by the bank Sarasin , which found that in 2008 the market share of the thin - film technologies rose to 1100 MW of generated power , or 16 % of the market .
According to the company , total thin - film production was forecast to reach some 2100 MW in 2009 , while the total worldwide PV production is expected to be 10.5 GW .
The company concludes that thin - film ’s market share will therefore have risen to 20 % , despite the financial crisis , observing that the entire PV industry is becoming more global and less susceptible to the changing conditions in key markets .
It is therefore realistic , they say , to expect stable growth over the coming years , peaking in 2020 in an annual newly - installed PV capacity of 155 GW .
This would result — in the period between 2012 and 2020 — in an average annual growth of some 30 % .
Non-European markets are expected to develop even more rapidly towards 2020 , since they have regions with greater amounts of sunshine that want to catch up with solar energy development , Masdar PV added .
The U.S. has been singled out by Masdar PV as a market with particularly strong potential .
‘ There are currently excellent opportunities in the U.S. , as the country will grow rapidly to become one of the largest solar markets .
Particularly for our thin - film modules there are over - proportional growth opportunities .
We want to use them ’ , said Dr Gegenwart , noting that Masdar PV is considering the option of building an additional manufacturing facility in North America .
‘ We are going to make this decision based on the requirements of the market — presumably at the end of the next year [ 2010 ] , when the perspectives for the global solar industry have considerably brightened up again ’ , he added .
Grounding in R&D
That a strong theme of research and development should run at the core of Masdar PV is no surprise .
Masdar PV GmbH is a 100 % subsidiary of the Masdar Initiative , Abu Dhabi ’s multi-billion dollar investment platform for the development and commercialization of renewable , alternative and sustainable energy technologies .
In January 2008 , Abu Dhabi announced it will invest $ 15 billion in Masdar , the largest single government commitment of its kind .
It is driven by the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company ( ADFEC ) , wholly - owned by the government - owned Mubadala Development Company .
The Masdar Initiative is divided into five business units and among others Masdar PV is joined by the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology ( MIST ) and the Masdar Research Network , both established to implement high - quality training and the networking of researchers , two cornerstones of the Masdar Initiative .
MIST is currently being established with the assistance of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) .
Meanwhile , the Masdar Research Network links researchers worldwide in a range of disciplines , forming a nucleus of renewable energy development .
Institutes that have joined the network so far include Imperial College London ( UK ) ; RWTH Aachen University ( Germany ) ; University of Waterloo ( Canada ) ; Tokyo Institute of Technology ( Japan ) ; Columbia University ( USA ) and DLR , the German Aerospace Centre , which is heavily involved in energy research .
Masdar has also partnered with research organisation Fraunhofer - Gesellschaft to develop a Sustainable Cities Research Centre in Masdar City , the organization ’s first Middle Eastern research hub .
The research centre will focus on critical technologies for sustainable cities , including solar energy through the Fraunhofer Institutes for Solar Energy Systems ( ISE ) .
The agreement also includes collaborations with MIST and other institutions to undertake joint research .
Commenting , Prof. Hans - Jörg Bullinger , president of Fraunhofer Gesellschaft said : ‘ Masdar City will be a magnet for the world ’s top minds in renewable energy and a hub of innovation .
As a living laboratory , it will connect research and application every day across the full spectrum of clean technologies . ’
More recently , in December 2009 , South Korea ’s Ministry of Knowledge Economy signed a memorandum of understanding with Masdar on collaboration in renewable energy between MIST and Korean research and academic institutions , as well as prospects for establishing of a Korean clean tech cluster within Masdar City .
Already home of the International Renewable Energy Agency ( IRENA ) , this flagship development will be developed over six phases and is due to be completed by 2016 .
The first building , part of the MIST campus , is set to open in the second quarter of 2010 and the first commercial buildings in 2011 , but the nearby Abu Dhabi city is offering temporary facilities .
Masdar City has also attracted considerable commercial interest .
GE has , for example , become an anchor partner in the Masdar Initiative and plans to house its first ‘ Ecomagination Centre ’ focused on clean tech development , at the city .
Masdar PV aims to establish itself as one of the leading providers of thin - film PV modules worldwide and the foundations for this have been laid at Ichtershausen .
But the seeds of its long term success may lie in its commitment to developing a new ‘ solar valley ’ in the deserts of Arabia .
It shows that it is possible to nurture not just a renewables market in a previously barren land , but a renewables industry too .

Can you give examples of proofs without words ?
In particular , can you give examples of proofs without words for non-trivial results ?
( One could ask if this is of interest to mathematicians , and I would say yes , in so far as the kind of little gems that usually fall under the title of ' proofs without words ' is quite capable of providing the aesthetic rush we all so professionally appreciate .
That is why we will sometimes stubbornly stare at one of these mathematical autostereograms with determination until we joyously see it . )

YouGov ’s daily poll is out – the first since the second debate – and it seems to have had virtually no effect .
Topline figures with changes since yesterday are CON 34%( nc ) , LAB 29 %( nc ) , LDEM 29 % ( +1 ) .
No significant change since yesterday , and certainly not the sort of massive bounce we saw from the first debate ( and realistically , I would n’t expect one .
The polling last night showed there was no runaway winner of the second debate in the way Nick Clegg won the first , and the effect of Nick Clegg being on the same platform and being given the same stature as the other two leaders was always a ‘ one shot ’ effect ) .

Tokyo
Following the success of a half - price subsidy for CO2 - busting fuel - cell heat and energy generators for homes , Japan is now poised to ship its attention to supplying the UK and Germany with this hi-tech next - generation energy source .
With over 5,000 fuel cells providing heat and energy for conventional homes up and down Japan , the BBC has learnt that companies such as electronics giant Panasonic are in talks with EU governments about the possibility of bringing these proven energy and carbon - saving devices to market in Europe and elsewhere .
Panasonic has described the interest in its commercial fuel - cell project from the German , Korean and UK governments as " intense " , and is confident that Japan , as the first to start commercial sales for homes last year , will be the forerunner in bringing the technology into common use .
Fuel cells - a technology that has been around for more than 100 years - convert fuels such as hydrogen and natural gas into electricity through an electrochemical reaction .
The resultant heat generated also warms buildings in gas - boiler - sized boxes known as cogeneration fuel cells .
The idea is to generate all of the heating and hot water and the majority of the electricity needed by a typical UK home , without the need to be connected to the energy wasteful national grid .
Such efficient use of gas supplies can save the consumer around 25 % of total energy costs , and reduce each home 's CO2 emissions by up to 2.5 tonnes per annum , according to their makers .
They also claim customers can earn back the system 's relatively high cost , running at present into thousands of pounds , within a few years through utility bill savings .
Cost issue Panasonic and Toshiba , another manufacturer of home - use fuel cells in Japan , sell their cogeneration fuel cells through energy companies such as Tokyo Gas for around 3.1 to 2.2 million yen .
Panasonic claims around 3,000 customers so far , including the Japanese PM 's office .
Half that price is met by the government on each purchase , while other incentives bring the real price down for consumers to about 1 million yen ( £ 7,300 ) .
Residential fuel cells already provide heat and energy for a few homes in Japan
" If the price falls again still , its popularity will gain momentum , " general manager of Panasonic 's fuel cell project , Mr Yasumasa Kurosaki , told the BBC .
He added that the company aimed at fixing the per-unit price at around 500,000 yen , and get it even lower in the near future .
With economies of scale , Panasonic says , such devices could be competitively priced at around a couple of thousand of pounds by 2013 .
" With over 40,000 hours running time already logged , we have proven the safety , reliability and CO2 savings of our devices in the real world while sales are improving gradually .
We expect next year 's sales to be up 20 - 30 % on the last fiscal year , " he said .
The UK government has estimated that microgeneration products , such as fuel - cell combined - heat - and - power ( CHP ) units , have the potential to supply over one - third of the country 's total electricity needs and help meet its environmental obligations .
However , high capital costs are still a major barrier to widespread adoption of fuel - cell technology .
Fuel - cell makers have yet to turn a profit despite the massive investments in Japan and elsewhere around the world .
But some are optimistic the gas - burning - without - combustion systems could be the answer to soaring fuel costs and lowering carbon emissions .
Pay - back time " Once fuel cells hit the US $ 5,000 ( £ 3,300 ) mark , which we imagine will happen in the next 2 years , these units will become as compelling to home owners as energy - saving water - heaters and double - glazing , " Tokyo- based entrepreneur and business analyst Terrie Lloyd told the BBC .
" It will be hard to ignore a product that might save US $ 2,500 or more a year on energy bills . "
The UK government meanwhile recently announced further support for the adoption of the technology with a money - back feed - in - tariff ( FIT ) for all fuel - cell owners that starts this April .
Under the FIT , any household installing a fuel cell will receive a generation payment of 10p / kWh for all electricity generated over a 10 - year period , plus an additional export payment of 3p / kWh for any electricity that is not consumed in the home and is fed back into the grid .
Importantly , households will still retain the efficiency savings on their energy bills , providing an incentive to consume any electricity generated on - site , in preference to exporting to the grid .
" On average , a home fuel user can expect about £ 360 - a- year cash - back in addition to the energy bill savings from consuming the electricity generated on - site , " according to the UK 's leading fuel - cell maker , Ceres Power .
The company plans to go into mass production after completing field studies this year .
Initial prices for its generators are not yet available but they are unlikely to match Japanese competiveness , says Mr Lloyd , as Japan has achieved a big start with widespread commercialization last year .
Export possibilities Despite high prices , some think the market is ready to explode .
Tokyo - based research firm Fuji- Keizai Group has estimated Japan 's market for fuel cells will expand nearly 100 - fold from fiscal 2009 to 1.61 trillion yen in fiscal 2025 owing to uptake of the technology for housing and vehicles .
Fuel - cell systems for housing , says its report , will serve as a driving force for the market until 2018 when fuel - celled cars are expected to take over demand .
Panasonic is bullish about possible exports of Japanese know - how to the UK and Germany where gas is generally cheaper than electricity per kW and solar cells offer a poor return on investment .
Mr Kurosaki said he was confident Panasonic could reduce costs , increase efficiency and extend the life of its units which now have a lifespan of 10 years to make an attractive package to overseas buyers and governments looking to cut CO2 emissions quickly .
With gas fuel for Japan 's fuel cells more costly per kW than electricity in Japan , some analysts see Japan 's nascent fuel - cell industry reaping benefits abroad .
And with such high prices for gas in energy - poor Japan , take up of the new technology may well fizzle out along with the government subsidies that support the current market .
Cutting capital costs and boosting sales to compete abroad seems the only likelihood of success for the Japanese makers if they are to scale up and be competitive without subsidies .

It is possible the starlings were trying to flee a predator
The deaths of 75 starlings which appeared to fall from the sky and crash land on to a driveway in Somerset has mystified the RSPCA animal charity .
The birds were spotted falling onto the entrance of a house in Coxley in Somerset on Sunday 7 March .
Animal welfare officer Alison Sparkes , who was called by police , said : " It was a remarkable sight , I 've never seen anything like it . "
There is no evidence the birds were ill or poisoned before they hit the ground .
Predator theory
Ms Sparkes said : " Onlookers said they heard a whooshing sound and then the birds just hit the ground .
" They had fallen on to the ground in quite a small area , about 12ft ( 3.6 m ) in diameter .
" They appeared to be in good condition other than injuries that they appear to have suffered when they hit they ground .
" Our best guess is that this happened because the starlings were trying to escape a predator such as a sparrow hawk and ended up crash landing . "
She said that the birds had suffered broken beaks , broken legs and wings and abdominal injuries .
Five of the birds survived the fall but had to be put down because of their severe injuries .
The argument over Arizona ’s harsh new immigration law has already sparked outrage from activists on both sides of the issue , and Monday ’s comments from an Iowa Republican congressional candidate will only add fuel to the fire .
During a Republican forum in Tama County , 3rd District candidate Pat Bertroche said police should catch illegal immigrants and document their whereabouts with microchips , the Des Moines Register reported .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I think we should catch Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢em , we should document Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢em , make sure we know where they are and where they are going .
I actually support microchipping them , ” Bertroche said .
“ I can microchip my dog so I can find it .
Why canÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t I microchip an illegal ?
ThatÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not a popular thing to say , but itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a lot cheaper than building a fence they can tunnel under .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
Bertroche has already backpedaled from the comment , telling the Associated Press he can’t understand why people would think he was suggesting illegal immigrants be micro-chipped or that he was comparing him to dogs .
“ I do n’t support microchipping anybody and it also did n’t occur to me I was comparing dogs to illegal immigrants , ” he said by phone .
Instead , Bertroche , a physician , said he was trying to “ illustrate a social commentary on how radical ” the immigration issue has become .
Immigrant rights activists have called Bertroche ’s comment “ absolutely appalling . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Sandra Sanchez , immigrants voice program director for the American Friends Services Committee , said the statement was obviously meant to Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ dehumanize other human beings .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I was really saddened to see a candidate for public office make such an irresponsible statement , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  she said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I talk to groups , congregations , schools all over the state , and I know a large majority of Iowans would be appalled by such an idea .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
As he continued to draw ire for the comment , Bertroche defended himself yet again Wednesday , this time blaming the media for his predicament .
ADVERTISEMENT
After being contacted directly by someone who was upset with his statement , Bertroche sent an e-mail that was turned over to The Iowa Independent .
He wrote that the whole situation is an Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ indictment on our media that someone has to say something this radical in order to bring attention to a reasoned and thoughtful idea .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
Bertroche is one of seven candidates seeking the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic incumbent Leonard Boswell .
ADVERTISEMENT
He compared microchipping illegal immigrants to what he said are other radical ideas .
“ Of all the major ideas that are out there , there are those that are extremely radical , ” he said .
“ Building a fence is radical and it wo n’t work .
Shooting them at the border is radical . ”
The Associated Press contributed to this report .

For “ Wowie , ” one of 18 finalists chosen from about 100 entries , the emphasis was more on imagination than technique .
The credits were scrawled with a Sharpie on the writhing belly and hairy limbs of that eight - minute short ’s star .
“ He was going to have them written on his hand , that ’s where it started , ” said Craig Webster , a University of Iowa graduate arts student who , with Florina Titz , directed , edited and produced the film , a love story about a “ delusional postman . ”
But the film ’s star , Luther Bangert , whom Mr. Webster describes as a “ guy who rides a unicycle ” around Iowa City , turned out to have been a circus performer .
Among other things , Mr. Bangert did some impressive contortions to get an abdominal shot crediting the directors of photography .
The fleshy titles of “ Wowie ” are now in competition with the slick aerial sequence that opens the director Jason Reitman ’s “ Up in the Air ” and the clever vignettes of noir buffs stepping through the pages of a detective thriller in the HBO series “ Bored to Death . ”
Inspiration for the competition , Ms. Pierson said , came from discussions with representatives of AIGA , the graphic artists association , in the course of a film poster contest .
The festival ’s programmers began talking about an award limited to movie titles but decided to include television when they realized they were all captivated by the miniature animated fable about a man in free fall over the opening titles of the AMC series “ Mad Men . ” ( “ Mad Men ” was not nominated for this competition , which is limited to new works from 2009 . )
The modern approach to film titles crystallized , more or less , in 1955 with “ The Man With the Golden Arm . ”
It opened with a kind of jazz ballet in which dancing white lines , over music by Elmer Bernstein , eventually tightened into the contorted arm of a drug addict .
Porn virus publishes web history of victims on the net
One of Kenzero 's victims is reported to be a school headmaster in Japan .
A new type of malware infects PCs using file - share sites and publishes the user 's net history on a public website before demanding a fee for its removal .
The Japanese trojan virus installs itself on computers using a popular file - share service called Winny , used by up to 200 m people .
It targets those downloading illegal copies of games in the Hentai genre , an explicit form of anime .
Website Yomiuri claims that 5500 people have so far admitted to being infected .
The virus , known as Kenzero , is being monitored by web security firm Trend Micro in Japan .
Masquerading as a game installation screen , it requests the PC owner 's personal details .
It then takes screengrabs of the user 's web history and publishes it online in their name , before sending an e-mail or pop - up screen demanding a credit card payment of 1500 yen ( £ 10 ) to " settle your violation of copyright law " and remove the webpage .
Held to ransom
The website that the history is published on is owned by a shell company called Romancing Inc .
It is registered to a fictitious individual called Shoen Overns .
" We 've seen the name before in association with the Zeus and Koobface trojans .
It is an established criminal gang that is continuously involved in this sort of activity , " said Rik Ferguson , senior security advisor at Trend Micro .
Kenzero is a twist on ransomware , he added , which infects a computer and encrypts the documents , pictures and music stored on it , before demanding a fee for a decryption key .
" Interestingly we 've seen a separate incident that focuses on European victims , " he said .
A fictitious organization calling itself the ICPP copyright foundation issues threatening pop-ups and letters after a virus searches the computer hard drive for illegal content - regardless of whether it actually finds anything .
It offers a " pretrial settlement " fine of $ 400 ( £ 258 ) payable by credit card , and warns of costly court cases and even jail sentences if the victim ignores the notice .
However rather than take the money , the outfit sells on the credit card details , said Mr Ferguson .
" If you find you are getting pop-ups demanding payments to settle copyright infringement lawsuits , ignore them and use a free online anti-malware scanner immediately to check for malware , " was his advice .
" And if there 's online content that you want to get hold of , get it from a reputable website - if that means paying that 's what you have to do . "

On May 5 , 2005 , the residents of Spokane , Washington , awoke to one of the strangest headlines in the town ’s history : “ West Tied to Sex Abuse in ’70s , Using Office to Lure Young Men . ”
The popular , socially conservative Republican mayor of Spokane , Jim West , had been outed by the town ’s newspaper , which told the sordid story of a man with two lives : in public , he had once sponsored legislation forbidding gays from teaching in public schools , while in private , the paper alleged , he was trawling for young men online , using the trappings of his office to lure them into sexual relationships .
But as bizarre as the revelations were , so too were the newspaper ’s methods .
FRONTLINE producers Rachel Dretzin and Barak Goodman investigate the complex relationship between politics , sexuality , fear , and judgment in one all - American town .
[ Explore more stories on the original website for A Hidden Life . ]
The nine - year - old son of a Wits scientist found a fossil of a new hominid species that lived 1,95 - million years ago , the scientist revealed on Thursday .
Speaking at the official unveiling of two partial fossils found in the Cradle of Humankind , Professor Lee Berger said his child Matthew found the fossil of the child on August 15 2008 .
Berger was mapping the cave in the area when he found a number of fossils in a cave .
He took Matthew and his dog Tal to the site and gave Matthew a talk on fossils .
“ I said let ’s go and find fossils and a minute and a half later he called me and said he had found a fossil , ” Berger said .
“ I knew he had found an antelope fossil but he was my nine - year - old son and I encouraged fossil hunting so I had to go and look . ”
Inspecting the fossil , Berger realised it was the clavicle [ shoulder bone ] of an earlier hominid .
A few days later , he and a group of scientists went to the cave and found the second fossil , a female between her late 20s and 30s .
“ They may have lived together — they looked into each other ’s eyes — they may have been related and they died at the same time , ” said Berger .
The new species has been named Australopithecus sediba , said Berger .
Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe attended the unveiling at the Cradle of Humankind .
– Sapa
Americans like things big ; we like big cars , big portions of food , big screen TVs …
You get the idea .
These animals are proof that Mother Nature is probably European , because these animals display the kind of forward thinking efficiency that many European manufacturers employ .
They are also really , really small .
I just hope there are n’t too many called “ pygmy ” animals .
1 .
Miniature Horses
When I first saw that picture , I was convinced it was photo - shopped .
I mean seriously , that is n’t a horse ; that is a Barbie toy .
Then I saw this , and my mind was blown .
Miniature horses are typically less than 3 feet tall , which makes riding them a bit difficult , but they are n’t ponies , they are real horses .
People sometimes train them as service animals ( be the first on your block with a “ Seeing Eye Horse ” ) , and even as house pets , since I presume they make tiny road apples .
However , they are still horses when it comes down to it , and their natural reaction to being scared is to run like hell , so they wo n’t be replacing your Black Lab anytime soon for those long walks in the woods playing fetch .
2 .
Brazilian Golden Frog
I have seen small frogs before , but in every case they were barely more than pollywogs without a tail .
That thing in the picture is a full grown adult .
Wikipedia makes the distinction that this is the smallest frog in the Southern Hemisphere , the smallest frog in the Northern Hemisphere being Eleutherodactylus Iberia , which I could n’t find any pictures of .
The adults of the northern frog top out at 8.5 mm while the Brazilian Golden reaches a “ massive ” 9.8 mm .
On the plus side , they are a brightly colored frog from South America that is n’t covered in neurotoxin , like poison arrow frogs but it does make them tiny , crunchy food for practically anything that eats meat .
They are also endangered , but listed on the IUCN rating system as “ Least Concern ” , so there are no “ save the tiny Brazilian Frog ” funds .
3 .
Kitti’s Hog Nosed Bat
Also called the Bumblebee bat , they are tiny bats from Thailand that reach no more than 1.3 inches .
They are one of the world ’s very few animals with a spine that is in danger of being taken out by a flyswatter , but apparently habitat encroachment is what is doing them in , although I would not have been even a little bit surprised to find out “ Bigger bats ” made the list of things that kill them .
They have so much head and ear fur that their eyes are barely visible , and although they usually only cluster in groups of 10 - 15 , they can sometimes form swarms of up to 500 , which is actually quite a bit more terrifying than a mosquito swarm .
Fortunately , they are insectivores , so no one is in danger of being drained by a swarming mass of tiny vampires .
4 .
Pygmy Hippo
These things have always struck me as weird .
Regular hippos are several tons of violent terror ; they apparently are the deadliest animal in Africa .
Yes , yes , I know , Mosquitoes kill more than anything , but I have had to argue with people to get them to wear bug spray to avoid dying ( people have contracted EEE and West Nile where I live , but people still refuse to wear it ) .
If we had hippo swarms , I can guarantee they would wear hippo spray to avoid being mauled .
The pygmies , though , are downright cute .
They are like the hippo version of a dog that always stays a puppy .
They have the unfortunate position of living in Liberia of all places , meaning one of the causes for their endangered status ( yep , another endangered one ) is “ war ” .
On the plus side , they do well in captivity and also breed well , so they have a nice strong zoo population to fall back on .
On that note , there is an interesting story about a former president and a pygmy hippo ; Harvey Firestone ( the tire guy ) gave one to Calvin Coolidge , who donated it to the Smithsonian .
His name was Billy , and Billy was a testament to how willing these guys are to breed in captivity ; almost every pygmy hippo in a zoo in America is related to Billy .
5 .
Pygmy Hog
… I find it incredibly interesting that this is n’t called a “ pygmy pig ” .
That just seems like it should be ; it ’s fun to say at any rate .
Guess what ?
They are endangered .
Surprised ?
Neither am I ( any more ) .
They used to range all over southern Asia , but these days they figure there are about 150 of them left .
To put that into perspecitve , my graduating class from High School was about 300 people .
More kids graduated from my ( horrible ) high school than there are pygmy pigs in the world .
They do have the most awesome pig genus name , however , Porcula .
That immediatley conjures an image of a tiny pig with fangs and speaks like Bella Lugosi .
Efforts to conserve them have been hampered by the fact that they arent as cute as Bengal Tigers and Indian Rhinos .
Ouch .
Thanks to these piggies not being marketable , we may never know the joy of tiny BLT sandwiches , so act quickly if you want to try one .
( Note ; do not go kill endangered pigs for bacon )
Twenty people will lose their jobs after TV3 axed struggling breakfast news shows Sunrise and ASB Business .
TV3 confirmed in a statement that both shows were being taken off the air from today , but a one - hour special featuring highlights from Sunrise 's two - and - a - half years will screen tomorrow from 7 am .
Stuff.co.nz understands staff were told the news today at an emotional meeting during which tears were shed .
No indication was made by presenters during this morning 's show that it was their last , but sources told Stuff.
co.nz they had known for some time .
MediaWorks TV Executive Director Ian Audsley blamed the axing on costs being unsustainable in the current economic climate .
" We have not taken this decision lightly , and it has been the subject of a lot of debate and discussion at both a board and management level – ultimately it has been the board 's decision , " Audsley said in a statement .
" Unfortunately this decision results in at least 20 redundancies across the television business and that is the toughest aspect for all of us at TV3 .
We are , however , able to offer redeployment in some cases .
" Despite the terrific work of the people involved and the commitment of everyone at TV3 , we 've not been able to make these programmes work financially .
" Today 's announcement is not a reflection on the calibre of the people involved in the production of the programmes .
They 're as good and capable a team as any I ’ve seen anywhere , " he said .
Sunrise , hosted by former Nightline presenter Carly Flynn and Oliver Driver , has struggled in the ratings since starting in October , 2007 , with TV One 's Breakfast charting well ahead of its competitor .
On Tuesday , Breakfast had 169,600 viewers , well up on Sunrise 's 21,490 .
Dominion Post TV reviewer Jane Bowron said the news was n't surprising .
The show missed the mark by aiming for younger viewers , and did n't provide enough difference from TVNZ's Breakfast , Bowron said .
" They were trying to mirror Breakfast , but they needed a different format , " she said .
" There were too many people working on it .
I think they should have gone for a more budget feel and the viewers might have liked it .
" Watching Sunrise was like going to a café where there 's a whole lot of young people behind the counter having a chat , and nobody serving the customer . "
Bowron also believed that the upcoming maternity leave of Flynn may have had something to do with the timing of the announcement .
" People like Carly Flynn , she 's got great likeability as an interviewer .
Without her they 'd be in trouble .
Who would they put in her place ? "
Paul Henry may also have been a factor in the downfall of Sunrise , said Bowron .
" Whether or not you like the deeply prejudiced Paul Henry , people like to watch him to see what he 's going to say next .
He has that shock jock mentaility . "
The producer of ASB Business , Liz Kirshberg , confirmed she had lost her job in the axing .
She said she was disappointed it " did not hang in for the long haul " .
" But it 's a commercial decision and nothing to do with the calibre of the people working on the show . "
TVNZ news crews reportedly camped outside TV3's offices on Flower Street after the news broke .
TVNZ spokeswoman Megan Richards blamed the recession - and not ratings - for the decision .
" We 're sad to see it .
We 're sympathetic to the situation as all media who have been on the receiving end of the recession would be .
Really , this is not about ratings - it's about the recession . "
A Facebook campaign has started , asking for TV3 to reinstate the show .
Original host James Coleman was replaced by Driver in September , 2008 .
Flynn said Sunrise hosts were n't commenting until Friday during the farewell special .
Further questions were met with a " no comment " before Flynn hung up the phone .
TV3 said replacement shows for Sunrise and ASB Business would be announced shortly .

University at Buffalo club talks robots ...
To be honest , I ’m a little jealous of these guys .
As you read further you ’ll understand why .
I loved to experiment with my toy robots when I was a kid and then tried building a few of my own .
My parts budget was always way too small to afford the right stuff and my expertise was always too little to make what I had do anything impressive .
The benefits of doing this work in a group are many .
You can pool your resources and afford better parts and equipment .
Multiple brains means a multiplication of ideas and ingenuity .
The social aspect of working within a group tends to keep you more motivated and makes the work a lot more fun .
Robotics is a perfect science to build a club around .
Recently I was listening to my radio and heard an announcement about the University at Buffalo Robotics Club demonstrating at our city science museum .
It grabbed my interest right away and I contacted them to answer some questions for an article .
Colin Lea , the club 's current president , responded and was happy to participate with the help of his fellow club members :
Q. Can you tell me how and when your club was formed ?
Was it an extension of the university ’s curriculum or was it born solely out of individual interests ?
A. About 12 years ago our club branched out of the local IEEE student club at UB , however it was n't until 2000 when we were officially established in the Student Association .
Our classes mostly focus on theory so clubs provide a way of applying these ideas in practical situations .
There is n't an exhaustive document to refer to , so we really only know bits of our past .
Since our start we have participated in several competitions including Robocup , Sumobots , battlebots , the Trinity Firefighter Competition , the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition , and possible others .
A brief overview of our accomplishments can be found on our website .
Q. Does there seem to be a favorite robot character from the entertainment industry among your members ?
A . For most of us our interests came from more real - world robotics applications rather than a particular character in entertainment .
The DARPA Grand and Urban Challenges were certainly influential as well as the Mars Rover .
I remember being awestruck hearing about the accomplishments of the rover .
If we had to choose one entity then perhaps Walle ?
Q . What types of robotics do you focus on most within the club ?
A . Our current efforts specialize in wheeled mobile robots .
For the past three years we have focused on our entry into the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition .
Additionally , we have recently worked on entries into the Trinity Firefighter Competition as well as a vehicle for our University 's battlebots competition .
Our current flagship robot is for the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition .
We have created a vehicle about the size of a mini-ATV that must traverse a couple of obstacle courses .
In one it has to stay within white lines that mimic a road while avoiding cones , barrels , and other obstacles .
The other involves travelling to specific locations in a field filled with barrels and fences .
The robot is completely autonomous so once the vehicle starts we can't touch it .
Last year we placed 12th out of over 50 teams overall .
Q . For wheeled or track locomotion of a robot have you found a particular motor type to be the most reliable and accurate to control ?
A. Motors vary largely depending on the project .
For our IGVC project we are currently using NPCs but we are n't entirely happy with them .
We are looking for something a little more efficient for next year .
For our smaller platform we like the geared motors ( w/ encoders ) from Super Droid Robotics .
Q . There are experiments being done with materials that contract with an electrical signal , much like human muscle tissue .
Have you tried any of these materials in your experiments ?
A . We have not worked with any of these materials .
There is a lot of cool work going on with bio-robotics but nothing that we have investigated .
Q. A human has five senses feeding signals to its brain so it can process , or perceive , its environment .
Ideally a high functioning robot must also have many sensors to process its environment to do its work correctly .
What sensor technologies are experimented with most in your club and why ?
A . Our sensors range from cheap infrared distance sensors costing 10 - 20 dollars to a high - end SICK Laser Rangefinder that retails at several thousand .
The laser rangefinder is a very cool piece of equipment that tells us the distance to nearest objects 180 degrees around us .
We use this to detect and avoid objects in our path for the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition .
We use this for demonstrations during tours and everyone seems to find it really cool .
For reference , it is the big yellow thing on the front of our vehicle .
We also recently got a flame detector for our Firefighter entry which is able to tell us where a candle is located in a room .
The point of the contest is to extinguish a flame so the sensor is invaluable .
With our video camera we have experimented with cool stuff such as face detection and finding lane markers on the ground .
Q. For the “ brain ” part there ’s a huge selection available of microcontroller chips , single - board computers , and micro - PCs .
It ’s a very different situation now than it was in the ‘ 80s and before .
Is there a bit of the ‘ kid in the candy store ’ type feeling when selecting a controlling processor for your machine ?
A . We use two types of micros within the club : Atmel AVRs and Arduino .
Technically the Arduino also uses Atmels , but we count it separately .
It is really nice for prototyping and especially for newer members who do n't have experience programming lower level micros .
It is something we recommend for anyone new to robotics or electronics .
For our larger projects we create our own printed circuit boards ( PCBs ) and include surface mount Atmel chips .
Over the past few years Atmel has reigned due to internal documentation and support for them .
They are nice because of the free compiler as well the cheap programmers that are available to put code on the chip .
Q. What ’s the favored programming language for robotics control ?
A . It depends on the application .
For all microcontroller projects we use variants of C. For Atmels we use embedded C with the gcc compiler and for the Arduino we use its own C - based language .
C provides easier access to lower level control and is very fast .
It is also much easier to program than Assembly , our other option for Atmels .
Last year for our larger project we decided to program in Java largely because of our familiarity .
We are planning on shifting this program over to C++ in the next year in order to get better performance .
Matlab is taught to all mechanical engineers so it has also been used as a test - bed for new algorithms .
Q . In any complex creation there ’s always a compromise between what you imagine , what you ’d like to do , and what practicality ( and money ) allows you to do .
What do you find most frustrating when dealing with this reality ?
A . We often come up with grandiose plans claiming that we are going to produce everything by hand for really cheap while making products that are better than anything commercially available .
Then reality sinks in .
Because we all have classes and other commitments we have to carfeully weigh time vs money .
We have a large enough budget that we do n't have to scrounge around for everything , but not enough to buy everything we can dream .
Due to the structure of our club , where we have about a year to complete a project , our frustration usually comes from knowing that we wo n't have enough time to do everything we want .
Q. Ray Kurzweil defines the “ singularity ” as the point where human and machine intelligence becomes equal .
It may be possible but it does n’t seem like we ’re anywhere close .
What are some of the feelings within your club on this issue ?
A . It will be a long time before robots reach human intelligence .
There is a lot of current research going on within personal robotics which will bring robots into the same living area as humans , but these machines are slow and clunky .
Do n't get me wrong , some of this stuff is really cool ( see Willow Garage ) , but it will be decades before we can get robots that communicate with humans in real - time and can actually process and think on their own .
Q. I imagine some of these events give a fast education in what works and what does n’t .
What are some of your best lessons so far ?
A. Test , test , test !
There have been times in the past where we have built elaborate projects , but did n't have enough time to fix all of the bugs .
This is a problem we had with our IGVC Vehicle last year .
To remedy this , this year we built a test platform that mimic our larger vehicle .
The idea is that we are able to test algorithms on a smaller vehicle during the winter and while our other vehicle is being worked on .
Q. How would you advise somebody who wanted to get started in the science and construction of robots ?
A . It 's unfortunate that there is n't more out there for novices .
Lego Mindstorms are a great introduction but a little expensive .
The age range on the Mindstorms is early teens to adults .
It comes with a basic graphical programming language but also can be used with Java , C++ , Matlab , and other languages .
Sparkfun has a lot of parts , including some introductory kits for sale .
For someone interested in getting into physical computing ( programming physical devices such as motors and lights ) then we definitely suggest learning about the Arduino .

An executive for Toyota Motor Corp. in January urged colleagues in an e-mail to “ not mention about the mechanical failures ” of accelerator pedals in its vehicles , prompting a response from the company ’s top U.S. spokesman that said , “ We are not protecting our customers by keeping this quiet , ” according to internal company documents reviewed by The Times .
“ The time to hide on this one is over , ” the e-mail from spokesman Irv Miller continued .
“ We need to come clean . ”
The exchange , which occurred just days before a massive recall of Toyota vehicles to repair accelerator pedals , is the clearest indication so far that the Japanese carmaker was debating internally when to disclose that its accelerators pedals could become stuck and cause drivers to lose control of vehicles .
At the time the e-mails were sent , the company was publicly blaming the problem on floor mats .
The automaker finally issued a recall covering 2.3 million U.S. vehicles on Jan. 21 , five days after the e-mail exchange among executives at the company ’s U.S. sales headquarters in Torrance .
In the wake of the recalls , the company took the unprecedented step of shutting down North American factories and suspending sales while it implemented a fix for the problem .
The entire handling of the matter violated U.S. law , according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , which on Monday said it was seeking a record $ 16.4 - million fine against Toyota for delaying disclosure of the pedal defect at least four months after identifying the problem .
Toyota has said it ’s considering how it will respond to the fine .
The e-mails began early on Jan. 16 , with Katsuhiko Koganei , an executive from company headquarters in Japan assigned to the Torrance office as an “ executive coordinator ” for communications , urging a company spokesman to keep quiet about the matter and “ not mention about the mechanical failures of pedal because we have not clarified the real cause of the sticking pedal formally and the remedy for the matter has not been confirmed . ”
Koganei , who copied half a dozen Toyota officials with the e-mail , said he had discussed the issue with three other officials whom he identified only by last names and said “ all of them are concerned about the comment with mechanical failures might raise another uneasiness of customers . ”
The Koganei e-mail was sent to Toyota spokesman Mike Michels , who was trying to develop a strategy for responding to media inquiries into an incident in New Jersey , in which a customer got his Toyota Avalon into a dealership while the engine was racing out of control .
The company internally had determined that the cause of the incident was a sticky pedal , but Toyota had not yet disclosed the defect either to the public or federal safety regulators .
Miller , group vice president for environmental and public affairs , sent the reply that said he disagreed with keeping the matter secret .
He added that top Toyota executives were traveling to Washington to discuss the company ’s options with federal safety regulators .
“ We better just hope that they can get NHTSA to work with us in coming with a workable solution that does not put us out of business , ” Miller said .
Miller retired from the company about two weeks later .
He declined to comment on Wednesday when contacted at his home .
Company spokesman Michels said Wednesday that Miller ’s resignation had been long planned and was unrelated to the issue involving the disclosure of the pedal defect .
The company also issued a statement Wednesday saying it could not comment directly on the Miller e-mail because it was a private communication .
But the statement added , “ We have publicly acknowledged on several occasions that the company did a poor job of communicating during the period preceding our recent recalls .
We have subsequently taken a number of important steps to improve our communications with regulators and customers on safety - related matters to ensure that this does not happen again . ”
The e-mails were among 70,000 documents that the Transportation Department requested from Toyota in its inquiry into the company ’s handling of the acceleration issue .
The department gave those documents to Congress .
The e-mail exchange was first reported online by the Associated Press on Monday .
The e-mail exchange about how to respond to the New Jersey incident was prompted by a request for comment by ABC News , Michels said .
At the time , Toyota was insisting that the only cause of sudden acceleration involved out - of - place floor mats that could jam the accelerator pedal .
“ There was n’t any direction to conceal or not disclose information within Toyota , ” Michels said .
“ It was eagerness to get the information out there . ”
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood was sharply critical of Toyota ’s disclosure practices this week , saying after the $ 16.4 - million fine levied Monday that it was simply the first issue that came under examination and that other fines are possible .

The usually impressive Inside Higher Ed today runs an unusually insipid piece about the Organization of American Historians ’ annual meeting .
In addition to panels like Footnotes : Pros and Cons , Why We Are Still Relevant , and Should Dogs Be Allowed in the Office ? , there was apparently a delightful rant session on reinterpreting the New Deal :
Panelist Robert S. McElvaine , who is Elizabeth Chisholm Professor of Arts & Letters and chair of the department of history at Millsaps College , focused on the argument – made , he said , by many conservatives today – that the failure of the New Deal to end the Great Depression shows that government spending is n’t the way to revive a slumping economy .
“ The most important thing to realize , ” said McElvaine , “ is that so - called conservatives – I prefer to call them ‘ regressives ’ ” – have long been trying to “ restore the conditions that created the Great Depression in the first place . ”
“ These are people of faith , ” McElvaine continued , “ and their basic faith is in the market as God . ” President Obama , McElvaine said , has taken “ flak for saying we need to spread the wealth a little , but that ’s true , not just in a moral sense but in an economic sense . ”
People have got to have money to buy things , he said , in order to keep the economy strong .
( Social Darwinism , he added , “ should be called ‘ antisocial Darwinism . ’ ” )
Talk about inflammatory !
And wrong , even !
Yours truly , for instance , worships blown glass and Funyuns , not the market or God .
For a guy who has written “ seven books ” and “ been a guest on approximately 75 television and radio programs , ” McElvaine is n’t one for nuance .
Do you think he says the same thing over and over again in his classes ?
“ You there , with the Ron Paul sticker on your laptop , FDR is a saint and Amity Shlaes ate paint chips as a child .
WRITE THAT DOWN ! ”
And then there ’s this :
The idea that New Deal history offers a very specific set of lessons for our own time came up again during the Q&A period , when one attendee – Jennifer Ross - Nazzal , a historian with the NASA Johnson Space Center who also works as an adjunct instructor for the University of Maryland University College – asked the panelists about how to handle “ students who are attracted to the arguments of the teabaggers . ”
“ Basically I try to present facts , ” McElvaine said .
Still , he acknowledged , “ to some people , facts are irrelevant . ”
So , kudos to the very professional Jennifer Ross - Nazzal for using a slur at an academic convention –this is 2010 and it would have been obnoxiously prudish and uptight of her to say “ Tea Party movement ” instead of “ teabaggers ” –and double kudos to McElvaine for providing his fact - hating students with the incentive to spit their gum in his open grade book and then slam it shut next time he turns around to snort another line of John Kenneth Galbraith ’s dried blood !
If you did n’t already think the people behind the RIAA and MPAA were insane , we ’re positive that your opinion on them will change as soon as your read what the two associations have proposed in a recent letter to the Office of Intellectual Property Enforcement .
Here are but some of the changes the two have asked for :
The installation of spyware on computers which would seek out and automatically delete illegally obtained media
Censorship of the internet which would block the transfer of illegal files
Giving border guards the authority to search one ’s tech gear for illegal files
The lobbying of foreign governments to follow suit
Having the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security actively and swiftly enforcing copyright laws
Scary as hell , right ?

Minimalist Linux desktops
by Richard Hillesley
Lightweight desktops have a multitude of uses , on netbooks , for mobile devices , for older hardware , for users with limited requirements of their systems , for connecting to applications in the cloud , and for bare knuckled programmers who prefer to work closer to the metal .
Puppy lightweight Linux .
The most popular desktops for Linux – KDE and GNOME – are are equal to the demands of most users , but if you are a sysadmin or programmer who does most of his or her work in a shell , or on the command line through vim or vi or Emacs , your demands of a desktop environment or a window manager may be relatively limited .
A fully - featured desktop environment may , perversely , sometimes get in the way of useful work .
For such users a minimalist window manager becomes desirable because it gives the ability to open multiple shells , to test and run programs and simultaneously browse files or the web , read mail or play games - but does away with the need for the unused extras , hidden libraries and add - ons , surplus menu options , applets and panels which may be seen as superfluous to the main objective , of getting your work done .
All that is required from the window manager is that it is efficient and economical with space and memory , provides a file manager , allows opening multiple windows and gives access to a limited range of software .
Window dressing
Linux users have a wide variety of alternative and minimalist desktops to choose from , some of which are more useful , interesting or adventurous than others .
In this context the lightweight desktops that are available for GNU / Linux can be broadly separated into complete desktop environments , such as LXDE , ROX Desktop or Xfce , and window managers , such as Enlightenment ( E17 ) , Window Maker , Openbox or Fluxbox .
A window manager may be incorporated into a desktop environment or run as a self - sufficient entity .
The tiny Linux distributions , such as Puppy Linux or Damn Small Linux , are designed to run on USB sticks or business card memory and use a window manager such as Joe 's Window Manager ( JWM ) , which gives to each of these distributions a passing imitation of a classic desktop , although the programs that are fired up by the window manager are independent applications .
In contrast , the applications used in an integrated desktop environment , such as GNOME and KDE , are written using a common toolkit and incorporate a common look and feel .
Other popular distributions , including versions or derivatives of Ubuntu , Mandriva and Linux Mint , use LXDE , Xfce , Fluxbox or Openbox as their desktop managers - and most distributions offer the option of downloading a range of alternative desktops and window managers which can be selected from the log - in screen .
A lightweight desktop or window manager is n't to everyone 's taste , and may lack the easy functionality of an integrated desktop , but for those users who do n't care for , or need , the superfluities and window dressing of a classic desktop , a lightweight desktop environment or window manager is far less profligate with processing power and memory , and can be just as useful .
Only idiots will use it
A feature of full blown desktop environments such as KDE and GNOME is that they hide the complexities of the underlying system .
Configuration is made easy and the options are restricted to protect the user .
A side effect of this approach is that it can also limit the possibilities for other kinds of users , as Linus Torvalds noted in December 2006 when he complained to the GNOME usability mailing list that " This 'users are idiots , and are confused by functionality ' mentality of GNOME is a disease .
If you think your users are idiots , only idiots will use it .
I do n't use GNOME , because in striving to be simple , it has long since reached the point where it simply does n't do what I need it to do . "
Three years later he changed his tune when the KDE team radically changed the look and feel of KDE with the release of version 4.0 .
" I thought KDE 4.0 was such a disaster I switched to GNOME " , he is reported to have said .
" I hate the fact that my right button does n't do what I want it to do . "
GNOME , like most of the successful products of open source , is subject to relatively rapid change .
Nonetheless his original complaint against GNOME does explain why some users who are familiar with the power and versatility of the command line can find the conventional desktop limiting and restrictive , and may prefer to work from within a minimalist windowing environment .
PCMan
Such a minimalist environment is offered by LXDE , ( Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment ) , which sees itself as the fast , energy saving and lightweight solution for " computers on the low end of the performance spectrum such as new generation netbooks and other small mobile computers , " as well as performing well on older computers .
Most minimalist desktops for Linux have a relatively long history and pre-date the coming of KDE and GNOME in the late nineties , but LXDE is relatively recent , begun in 2006 by a Taiwanese programmer , Hong Yen Jee , also known as PCMan , who developed the first component of LXDE , the PCMan file manager , and gave as one of his reasons , " because re-inventing the wheel is cool , and we love it . "
Considering its lack of bloat , LXDE is surprisingly fully featured , includes an image viewer and audio player , can be configured with an " EeePC like Launcher user interface or a MS Windows like application panel , " and will perform well on a Pentium II with as little as 192MB of memory .
LXDE claims to use about 45 MB of memory on i386 machines , although such figures can be compromised by the utilities you choose to run , and on older machines it is probably wiser to run a lightweight office suite such as AbiWord rather than OpenOffice .
LXDE is highly configurable , and performs the simple tasks well .
The PCMan file manager is fast and fully featured , with tabbed browsing , volume management , drag and drop and search facilities , and is in the process of being rewritten to improve its usability .
For the cloud
The LXDE desktop .
LXDE is written in GTK +
2.0 and uses OpenBox as its default window manager , although the user is free to use another window manager .
There is a healthy developer community , who work to a set of design principles which stress the reduction of dependencies on external libraries to reduce the kind of bloat that tends to afflict larger projects .
Contributors are also asked to " consider the conventions of both GNOME and Windows , and try to follow the habit of most users .
Do not deliberately make the GUI different only because you want to be different from Windows .
Usability is always the top concern .
Windows might not be good in some areas , but like it or not , most computer users in the world are used to it .
Trying to fight your users is apparently unwise . "
LXDE is " designed for cloud networks such as local freifunk [ free radio ] clouds or the global Internet cloud , " is used on Eeebuntu , can be installed on Intel , MIPS or ARM machines , is licensed under the GPL and LGPL , and is probably the speediest of the alternative desktop environments , comparing favourably with the better known Xfce in adhoc benchmark tests performed by the Linux Mint developers .

Among rhesus macaque monkeys , mothers who weigh more and have had previous pregnancies produce more and better breast milk for their babies than mothers who weigh less and are less experienced .
Scientists from the Smithsonian Institution and the University of California , Davis are using this natural variation in breast milk quality and quantity to show that a mother 's milk sends a reliable signal to infants about their environment .
This signal may program the infant 's behavior and temperament according to expectations of available resources and discourages temperaments that prove risky when food is scarce .
The study was published in the American Journal of Primatology Feb. 16 .
Researchers used large groups of rhesus macaques living in an outdoor enclosure at the California National Primate Research Center at UC Davis .
Researchers collected milk two different times from 59 mothers : once when their infants were 1 month old and again when the infants were 3 1/2 months old .
They recorded the quantity of milk produced by each mother , and the energy value of each one 's milk was analyzed for its content of sugars , proteins and fat .
These figures were combined to calculate the available milk energy generated by each mother .
Although all of the monkeys in the study were fed the same diet , the researchers found natural variation in the quantity and richness of the milk generated by the 59 mothers .
Milk from mothers who weighed more and had had previous pregnancies contained higher available energy when their infants were 1 month old than the milk of lighter , less experienced mothers .

" This is the first study for any mammal that presents evidence that natural variation in available milk energy from the mother is associated with later variation in infant behavior and temperament , " said Katie Hinde , the study 's lead author and anthropologist at the California National Primate Research Center and the nutrition laboratory at the Smithsonian 's National Zoo .
" Our results suggest that the milk energy available soon after birth may be a nutritional cue that calibrates the infant 's behavior to environmental or maternal conditions . "
At 3 to 4 months old , each infant was temporarily separated from its mother and assessed according to its behavior and temperament .
The study found that infants whose mothers had higher levels of milk energy soon after their birth coped more effectively ( moved around more , explored more , ate and drank ) and showed greater confidence ( were more playful , curious and active ) .
Infants whose mothers had lower milk energy had lower activity levels and were less confident when separated from their mother .
Mothers and infants were reunited immediately after the experiment .
Rhesus macaques are found throughout mainland Asia : from Afghanistan to India and from Thailand to southern China .
A free - ranging colony of rhesus macaques was established in 1938 on Cayo Santiago — a small island off of the east coast of Puerto Rico .
The only primates with a broader geographic distribution than rhesus macaques are humans .

Ochre found in this cave at the tip of Pinnacle Point in South Africa has offered up key evidence that early humans were engaging in symbolic behavior long before anthropologists previously surmised .

When and where did the cognitive abilities of modern humans arise ?
It 's a big question -- one debated by anthropologists for decades .
It 's an even bigger question for an undergraduate thesis , but senior Logan Bartram has a leg up on this ambitious project : he helped unearth artifacts that are playing a critical role in shaping our knowledge about human origins .
In the summer of 2009 , Bartram and fellow UVM student Kristina Bauman were accepted to join a team of archaeologists at a pivotal dig site on the coast of South Africa .
It 's the shells , ochre and tools at this site -- and not the paintings in the caves of Europe -- that many anthropologists today cite as the first signs of higher human cognitive power .
Signs of ( intelligent ) life
One such scientist -- and principal investigator for this National Science Foundation - funded excavation -- is paleoanthropologist Curtis Marean , a professor at Arizona State University 's Institute of Human Origins .
Marean 's research , which is highly transdisciplinary in nature , drawing on expertise from geologists , plant biologists , geneticists , nutritionists , and others , pinpoints caves along the coast of South Africa as a likely habitat of the small population of Homo sapiens we 're directly descended from today .
Marean 's work shows that the migration of hominids to the coast of Africa may have helped develop -- or at least coincided with -- a boost in brain function .
The ochre at the cave sites along the Indian Ocean is a sign of symbolic behavior , whether it was used for self adornment or markings on stone .
Small blades that would have been affixed to stone or wood , instead of just held in hand , are evidence of complex tools .
And an appetite for seafood , as evidenced by burned shells in ash pits , means that these early humans were able to use tides and lunar schedules to successfully harvest shellfish as a dietary staple .
The work at these sites , which was recently featured in the three - part Nova special " Becoming Human " ( in which Bartram and Bauman have cameo appearances ) , has extended the origin of modern cognitive abilities further back in time , to roughly 170,000 years ago .
Since this was not a field school designed to teach archaeological skills to newcomers , Bartram -- a novice -- had to learn the techniques on the job .
His training ground was an embankment in a rock shelter , where he cleared away sand deposits in search of the landscape surface inhabited by early humans .
The digging was slow and methodical .
Electronic distance measurement tools collected data to document the precise location in space for each artifact , which allows researchers back in the lab to reconstruct three - dimensional maps of the site .
" You 're digging down , and you can see right in the strata what 's going on , " Bartram says while pointing to an image he took of a cross-section view of the ledge .
A black line bisecting the beige sand is the remains of a hearth -- concreted ash and burned shells are what 's left behind from an ancient seafood dinner .
Brain food
Why did our ancestors move to the coasts ?
Climate change and drought throughout Africa meant fewer resources on land just shy of 200,000 years ago .
The nutrition offered up by the sea was life sustaining -- a point driven home for Bartram when the site director foraged for mussels at lunchtime on a rock formation just below the caves .
For a pre-med student like Bartram , the idea that higher cognitive function may have been aided by the brain - building omega - 3 fatty acids that seafood provides is an intriguing one .
The southern coast of Africa is also known for amazing biodiversity and an abundance of tuberous plants , which are high in carbohydrates .
" You couple that with shellfish , and you 've got a really nice nutritional package going on , " Bartram says .
" Is it the reason we evolved , just because we had access to this nutrient ?
Probably not .
But the ability to have that available to you and raise kids who are getting complete brain food -- there 's no way that could have hurt . "
Back at UVM , Bartram 's wrapping up his thesis : " Evidence for Modern Human Behavioral Origins on the Southern African Coast . "
While based on his time in Africa , where he unearthed his own share of stone tools and looked out at the sea from the same cave shelters our ancestors once shared , he says that his thesis work is really about reviewing the published research .
" It 's certainly a library project ... There 's been so much literature published on these issues , and from this site , " Bartram says .
" If nothing else , my thesis is helping me reaffirm the experience I had , not just for others , but for myself . "

Is it possible that a vacation can change a life for the better ?
Apart from de-stressing and re-charging , vacations bring many adventures that might result in a life changing experience .
Montana ’s rich landscape , spectacular scenery and intriguing history make it one of the most sought after vacation destinations .
It is believed that one of the greatest things about a Montana vacation is that people often feel like they have the entire state to themselves .
Visitors can enjoy un-crowded hiking trails , short lift lines and quiet fishing trips .
Because of this and many more reasons , Montana is often referred to as ‘ The last best place ’ .
Whitefish Montana is a great choice for family vacations and romantic getaways .
Complementing the historic feel of downtown Whitefish Montana is the dramatic landscape that rises up around the small city .
Whitefish is located in the shadows of Big Mountain and a line of mountains stretch across the horizon just north of town .
It is quite a divine setting , especially when one considers that Whitefish also lies on the shores of beautiful Whitefish Lake .
There are some luxury lakefront private Vacation Homes on the head of Whitefish Lake , which provide excellent lodging and accommodation .
Visitors can also enjoy swimming , hiking , biking , water skiing etc , which are all at their doorstep .
Situated in a prime location , these vacation homes provide convenient reach to the famous Glacier International Airport , Whitefish Mountain Resort , Glacier National Park and downtown Whitefish .
Fine dining , one of the major attractions of Montana is also at an easy reach from these Lake Lodge Resorts .
North Shore Resorts are perfect if one wants to enjoy a Rocky Mountain getaway , an adventure vacation , or visit to Yellowstone or Glacier National Park .
Montana vacations provide variety and enjoyment for everyone in the family or a group .
With all the great things to see and do in Montana , people often extend their stay much beyond what they have planned .
Spending some good time with family or friends at the Whitefish Lake House can be one of the most remarkable moments of life , and can give individuals a chance to make a positive difference in their lives .
So , simply free your mind from the boundaries and pressure of your work and take advantage of what this beautiful world has to offer !
Francis Eugene George is not just a cardinal .
He is also president of the United States conference of catholic bishops and sets the tone and direction for church policy and position in the country .
His comments , therefore , on the positive attributes of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( LDS ) , more commonly known as Mormons , seem surprising given the enormous theological and demographic differences between the two groups .
Or do his words herald a spirit of co-operation among disparate religious movements in the fight against secularism ?
Last Tuesday , in a speech called Catholics and Latter - day Saints : partners in the defence of religious freedom , he told an audience that Catholics and Mormons must stand together as a " vital bulwark " against those who wanted to " reduce religion to a purely private reality " .
The LDS church has proved its mettle in contentious areas .
Were it not for their involvement in Proposition 8 , there is every chance the same - sex marriage ban in California would not have been passed .
Noting their ability to mobilise member support around issues that also concern Catholics , Cardinal George praised Mormons for their work to protect the rights of those who did not want to participate in abortion or assisted suicide and to defend marriage as a heterosexual institution .
" When the government fails to protect the consciences of its citizens , it falls to religious bodies to defend them , " he said .
He also claimed that Catholics and Mormons shared more than a common understanding of religious freedom : they enjoyed a common experience of growing from a small , sometimes persecuted , religious minority to larger communities of 67 million Catholics and about six million Mormons .
But it 's disingenuous of George to play up the similarities .
Catholicism has been part of the US landscape for a lot longer than the LDS church .
Immigrant communities ensure that the religion , its values and institutions , survive and evolve .
It is the majority Christian movement in the US , boasting a profile and privilege that other denominations do not .
And then there 's the church 's 2007 statement , which reasserted the universal primacy of Roman Catholicism .
So why the cosying up ?
There is an increasingly secular mood in the US and religious groups are all too aware of it .
The Roman Catholic hierarchy knows it cannot rely solely on its congregations to campaign on touchstone issues and a " vital bulwark " – in the shape of the devout , wealthy and organised LDS church – is just what 's needed to help it .
Frederick Brooks is best known as the author of The Mythical Man-Month , a book on software project management first written in 1975 and still popular 35 years later .
Brooks has a new collection of essays entitled The Design of Design that was just released this month .
In his chapter on collaboration in design , Brooks notes
“ Many hands make light work ” — Often
But many hands make more work —
Always
Collaboration may reduce the amount of work per person , but it will certainly increase the total amount of work to be done .
In addition , collaboration is likely to reduce the quality of a design .
Earlier in the same chapter Brooks says
Most great works have been made by one mind .
The exceptions have been made by two minds .
He gives a long list of designers to support this claim : Homer , Bach , Shakespeare , Gilbert and Sullivan , Michelangelo , Watt , Edison , the Wright Brothers …
The great works Brooks alludes to may have been implemented by teams , but they were not designed by teams .
You can hear Brooks explain why he believes design work does n’t partition well in his talk “ Collaboration and Telecollaboration in Design . ”
There ’s a link to the audio in my blog post on Brooks and conceptual integrity .
LONDON
SITTING in his studio here , a converted warehouse north of King ’s Cross , on a recent chilly morning , the artist Antony Gormley was talking about the sensation he was hoping to cause with “ Event Horizon , ” his first public art project in New York .
It had been conceived as a shocker : from next Friday through Aug. 15 , 31 naked men  or rather 31 slightly different sculptures of the same naked man , Mr. Gormley himself  will be perched on rooftops , standing on the grounds of Madison Square Park and dotting the sidewalks around the Flatiron district .
“ When I did it in London ”  in 2007 these same figures could be found on bridges , buildings and streets along the South Bank of the Thames River  “ the reaction was quite remarkable , ” he said .
“ People would stop .
They would notice one ; they would immediately stop somebody else on the street , pointing to the thing .
Then gatherings of people would result , and quite quickly they would register their environment in a way they had n’t before . ”
In New York the project , not yet fully installed , has already caused a stir , but one Mr. Gormley could hardly have anticipated .
Last week the New York City Police Department pre-emptively reassured the public that the figures were not potential jumpers on the verge of committing suicide .
According to news reports the police had not received any emergency calls but promised to respond even if the location corresponded to an “ Event Horizon ” figure .
Still , for some , the project recalled memories of victims of 9/11 leaping to their deaths .

An atheist who left leaflets mocking Jesus Christ , Islam and the Pope in an airport 's prayer room has been given an Asbo .
Harry Taylor , 59 , from Higher Broughton , Salford , left the anti-religious posters in prayer rooms at Liverpool John Lennon Airport in November and December 2008 .
Taylor denied three counts of causing religiously aggravated harassment during his trial at Liverpool Crown Court .
But he was found guilty by a jury and given a suspended six - month sentence yesterday , as well as an Asbo forbidding him from carrying anti-religious leaflets in public .

Crashing Towards a New World Social Order 2012
Richard K. Moore writes : Historical background – the establishment of capitalist supremacy
When the Industrial Revolution began in Britain , in the late 1700s , there was lots of money to be made by investing in factories and mills , by opening up new markets , and by gaining control of sources of raw materials .
The folks who had the most money to invest , however , were not so much in Britain but more in Holland .
Holland was the leading Western power in the 1600s , and its bankers were the leading capitalists .
In pursuit of profit , Dutch capital flowed to the British stock market , and thus the Dutch funded the rise of Britain , who subsequently eclipsed Holland both economically and geopolitically .
In this way British industrialism came to be dominated by wealthy investors , and capitalism became the dominant economic system .
This led to a major social transformation .
Britain had been essentially an aristocratic society , dominated by landholding families .
As capitalism became dominant economically , capitalists became dominant politically .
Tax structures and import - export policies were gradually changed to favor investors over landowners .
It was no longer economically viable to simply maintain an estate in the countryside : one needed to develop it , turn it to more productive use .
Victorian dramas are filled with stories of aristocratic families who fall on hard times , and are forced to sell off their properties .
For dramatic purposes , this decline is typically attributed to a failure in some character , a weak eldest son perhaps .
But in fact the decline of aristocracy was part of a larger social transformation brought on by the rise of capitalism .
The business of the capitalist is the management of capital , and this management is generally handled through the mediation of banks and brokerage houses .
It should not be surprising that investment bankers came to occupy the top of the hierarchy of capitalist wealth and power .
And in fact , there are a handful of banking families , including the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers , who have come to dominate economic and political affairs in the Western world .
Unlike aristocrats , capitalists are not tied to a place , or to the maintenance of a place .
Capital is disloyal and mobile – it flows to where the most growth can be found , as it flowed from Holland to Britain , then from Britain to the USA , and most recently from everywhere to China .
Just as a copper mine might be exploited and then abandoned , so under capitalism a whole nation can be exploited and then abandoned , as we see in the rusting industrial areas of America and Britain .
This detachment from place leads to a different kind of geopolitics under capitalism , as compared to aristocracy .
A king goes to war when he sees an advantage to his nation in doing so .
Historians can ' explain ' the wars of pre-capitalist days , in terms of the aggrandizement of monarchs and nations .
A capitalist stirs up a war in order to make profits , and in fact our elite banking families have financed both sides of most military conflicts since at least World War 1 .
Hence historians have a hard time ' explaining ' World War 1 in terms of national motivations and objectives .
In pre-capitalist days warfare was like chess , each side trying to win .
Under capitalism warfare is more like a casino , where the players battle it out as long as they can get credit for more chips , and the real winner always turns out to be the house – the bankers who finance the war and decide who will be the last man standing .
Not only are wars the most profitable of all capitalist ventures , but by choosing the winners , and managing the reconstruction , the elite banking families are able , over time , to tune the geopolitical configuration to suit their own interests .
Nations and populations are but pawns in their games .
Millions die in wars , infrastructures are destroyed , and while the world mourns , the bankers are counting their winnings and making plans for their postwar reconstruction investments .
From their position of power , as the financiers of governments , the banking elite have over time perfected their methods of control .
Staying always behind the scenes , they pull the strings controlling the media , the political parties , the intelligence agencies , the stock markets , and the offices of government .
And perhaps their greatest lever of power is their control over currencies .
By means of their central - bank scam , they engineer boom and bust cycles , and they print money from nothing and then loan it at interest to governments .
The power of the banking elites is both absolute and subtle ...
" Some of the biggest men in the United
States are afraid of something .
They
know there is a power somewhere , so
organised , so subtle , so watchful , so
interlocked , so complete , so pervasive
that they had better not speak above
their breath when they speak in
condemnation of it . "
-- President Woodrow Wilson
The end of growth – capitalists vs. capitalism
It was always inevitable , on a finite planet , that there would be a limit to economic growth .
Industrialization has enabled us to rush headlong toward that limit over the past two centuries .
Production has become ever more efficient , markets have become ever more global , and finally we have reached the point where the paradigm of perpetual growth can no longer be maintained .
Indeed , that point was actually reached by about 1970 .
Since then capital has not so much sought growth through increased production , but rather by extracting greater returns from relatively flat production levels .
Hence globalization , which moved production to low - waged areas , providing greater profit margins .
Hence privatization , which transfers revenue streams to investors that formerly went to national treasuries .
Hence derivative and currency markets , which create the electronic illusion of economic growth , without actually producing anything in the real world .
If one studies the collapse of civilizations , one learns that failure - to - adapt is fatal .
Continuing on the path of pursuing growth would be such a failure to adapt .
And if one reads the financial pages these days , one finds that it is full of doomsayers .
We read that the Eurozone is doomed , and Greece is just the first casualty .
We read that stimulus packages are not working , unemployment is increasing , the dollar is in deep trouble , growth continues to stagnate , business real estate will be the next bubble to burst , etc .
It is easy to get the impression that capitalism is failing to adapt , and that our societies are in danger of collapsing into chaos .
Such an impression would be partly right and partly wrong .
In order to understand the real situation we need to make a clear distinction between the capitalist elite and capitalism itself .
Capitalism is an economic system driven by growth ; the capitalist elite are the folks who have managed to gain control of the Western world while capitalism has operated over the past two centuries .
The capitalist system is past its sell - by date , the banking elite are well aware of that fact – and they are adapting .
Capitalism is a vehicle that helped bring the bankers to absolute power , but they have no more loyalty to that system than they have to place , or to anything or anyone else .
As mentioned earlier , they think on a global scale , with nations and populations as pawns .
They define what money is and they issue it , just like the banker in a game of Monopoly .
They can also make up a new game with a new kind of money .
They have long outgrown any need to rely on any particular economic system in order to maintain their power .
Capitalism was handy in an era of rapid growth .
For an era of non-growth , a different game is being prepared .
Thus , capitalism has not been allowed to die a natural death .
First it was put on a life - support system , as mentioned above , with globalization , privatization , derivative markets , etc .
Then it was injected with a euthanasia death - drug , in the form of toxic derivatives .
And when the planned collapse occurred , rather than industrial capitalism being bailed out , the elite bankers were bailed out .
It 's not that the banks were too big to fail , rather the bankers were too politically powerful to fail .
They made governments an offer they could n't refuse .
The outcome of the trillion - dollar bailouts was easily predictable , although you would n't know that from reading the financial pages .
National budgets were already stretched , and they certainly did not have reserves available to service the bailouts .
Thus the bailouts amounted to nothing more than the taking on of immense new debts by governments .
In order to fulfill the bailout commitments , the money would need to be borrowed from the same financial institutions that were being bailed out .
With the bailouts , Western governments delivered their nations in hock to the bankers .
The governments are now in perpetual debt bondage to the bankers .
Rather than the banks going into receivership , governments are now in receivership .
Obama 's cabinet and advisors are nearly all from Wall Street ; they are in the White House so they can keep close watch over their new acquisition , the once sovereign USA .
Perhaps they will soon be presiding over its liquidation .
The bankers are now in control of national budgets .
They say what can be funded and what can't .
When it comes to financing their wars and weapons production , no limits are set .
When it comes to public services , then we are told deficits must be held in check .
The situation was expressed very well by Brian Cowan , Ireland 's government chief .
In the very same week that Ireland pledged 200 billion Euro to bailout the banks , he was being asked why he was cutting a few million Euro off of critical service budgets .
He replied , " I 'm sorry , but the funds just are n't there " .
Of course they 're not there !
The treasury was given away .
The cupboard is bare .
As we might expect , the highest priority for budgets is servicing the debt to the banks .
Just as most of the third world is in debt slavery to the IMF , so the whole West is now in debt slavery to its own central banks .
Greece is the harbinger of what is to happen everywhere .
The carbon economy – controlling consumption
In a non -growth economy , the mechanisms of production will become relatively static .
Instead of corporations competing to innovate , we 'll have production bureaucracies .
They 'll be semi-state , semi- private bureaucracies , concerned about budgets and quotas rather than growth , somewhat along the lines of the Soviet model .
Such an environment is not driven by a need for growth capital , and it does not enable a profitable game of Monopoly .
We can already see steps being taken to shift the corporate model towards the bureaucratic model , through increased government intervention in economic affairs .
With the Wall Street bailouts , the forced restructuring of General Motors , the call for centralized micromanagement of banking and industry , and the mandating of health insurance coverage , the government is saying that the market is to superseded by government directives .
Not that we should bemoan the demise of exploitive capitalism , but before celebrating we need to understand what it is being replaced with .
In an era of capitalism and growth , the focus of the game has been on the production side of the economy .
The game was aimed at controlling the means of growth : access to capital .
The growth - engine of capitalism created the demand for capital ; the bankers controlled the supply .
Taxes were mostly based on income , again related to the production side of the economy .
In an era of non -growth , the focus of the game will be on the consumption side of the economy .
The game will be aimed at controlling the necessities of life : access to food and energy .
Population creates the demand for the necessities of life ; the bankers intend to control the supply .
Taxes will be mostly based on consumption , particularly of energy .
That 's what the global warming scare is all about , with its carbon taxes and carbon credits .
Already in Britain there is talk of carbon quotas , like gasoline rationing in wartime .
It 's not just that you 'll pay taxes on energy , but the amount of energy you can consume will be determined by government directive .
Carbon credits will be issued to you , which you can use for driving , for heating , or on rare occasions for air travel .
Also in Britain , the highways are being wired so that they can track how many miles you drive , tax you accordingly , and penalize you if you travel over your limit .
We can expect these kinds of things to spread throughout the West , as it's the same international bankers who are in charge everywhere .
In terms of propaganda , this control over consumption is being sold as a solution to global warming and peak oil .
The propaganda campaign has been very successful , and the whole environmental movement has been captured by it .
In Copenhagen , demonstrators confronted the police , carrying signs in support of carbon taxes and carbon credits .
But in fact the carbon regime has nothing to do with climate or with sustainability .
It is all about micromanaging every aspect of our lives , as well as every aspect of the economy .
If the folks who are running things actually cared about sustainability , they'd be investing in efficient mass transit , and they'd be shifting agriculture from petroleum - intensive , water - intensive methods to sustainable methods .
Instead they are mandating biofuels and selling us electric cars , which are no more sustainable or carbon - efficient than standard cars .
Indeed , the real purpose behind biofuels is genocide .
With food prices linked to energy prices , and agriculture land being converted from food production to fuel production , the result can only be a massive increase in third - world starvation .
Depopulation has long been a stated goal in elite circles , and the Rockefeller dynasty has frequently been involved in eugenics projects of various kinds .
' The War on Terrorism ' – preparing the way for the transition
The so - called War on Terrorism has two parts .
The first part is a pretext for arbitrary abuse of citizen 's rights , whenever Homeland Security claims the action is necessary for security reasons .
The second part is a pretext for US military aggression anywhere in the world , whenever the White House claims that Al Qaeda is active there .
I emphasized the word ' claims ' above , because the terrorism pretext is being used to justify arbitrary powers , both domestically and globally .
No hard evidence need be presented to Congress , the UN , or anyone else , before some nation is invaded , someone is kidnapped and tortured as a ' terrorist suspect ' , or some new invasive security measure is implemented .
When powers are arbitrary , then we are no longer living under the rule of law , neither domestically nor internationally .
We are living under the rule of men , as you would expect in a dictatorship , or in an old - fashioned kingdom or empire .
Part 1 : Preparing the way for a new social order
In a very real sense , the terrorism pretext is being used to undo everything that The Enlightenment and the republication revolutions achieved two centuries ago .
The very heart of the Bill of Rights – due process – has been abandoned .
The gulag , the concentration camp , and the secret arrest in the night – these we have always associated with fascist and communist dictatorships – and now they are not only functioning under US jurisdiction , but being justified publicly by the President himself .
Is there really a terrorist threat to the homeland , and would these measures be a sensible response to such a threat ?
People sre strongly divided in their answers to these questions .
Quite a bit of hard forensic evidence has come to light , including links to intelligence agencies , and my own view is that most of the dramatic ' terrorist ' events in the US , UK , and Europe have been covert false - flag operations .
From an historical perspective this would not be at all surprising .
Such operations have been standard practice – modus operandi – in many nations , though we usually do n't get proof until years later .
For example , every war the US has been involved in has had its own phony Gulf of Tonkin Incident , or its Weapons of Mass Destruction scam , in one form or another .
It 's a formula that works .
Instant mobilization of public opinion , prompt passage without debate of enabling resolutions and legislation .
Why would the War on Terrorism be any different ?
As regards motive : while Muslims have only suffered as a result of these dramatic events , our elite bankers have been able to create a police - state infrastructure that can be used to deal with any foreseeable popular resistance or civic chaos that might emerge as they prepare the way for their post - capitalist future .
With the collapse , the bailouts , and the total failure to pursue any kind of effective recovery strategy , the signals are very clear : the system will be allowed to collapse totally , thus clearing the ground for a pre-architected ' solution ' .
Ground Zero can be seen as a metaphor , with the capitalist economy as the Twin Towers .
And the toxic derivatives illustrate the fact that the collapse is actually a controlled demolition .
It seems to me inevitable , given the many signals , that martial law will be part of the transition process , allegedly to deal with the problems of economic collapse .
Perhaps a collapse in the food - supply chain , due to a collapse in the energy - supply chain .
The US emergency responses in New Orleans and again in Haiti give us more signals , actual test trials , of what kind of ' emergency response ' we can expect .
First and foremost comes the security of the occupation forces .
Those suffering in the emergency are treated more like insurgents than victims in need of help .
In the case of Haiti , the US response can only be described as an intentional genocide project .
When people are pinned under rubble in an earthquake , the first 48 hours , and 72 hours , are absolutely critical points , as regards survival rates .
When the US military systematically blocked incoming aid for those critical hours , turning back doctors and emergency teams , they sealed the fate of many thousands who could have been saved .
One can imagine many nightmare scenarios , given these various signals , these ominous signs .
World Wars 1 and 2 were nightmares that really happened , with millions dying , and these same banking dynasties orchestrated those scenarios and then covered their tracks .
We must also keep in mind the Shock Doctrine , where catastrophe is seen as opportunity – when ' things can be done that otherwise could not be accomplished ' .
We are still being impacted by the shock waves that were sent out on 9/11 , and again when the financial system collapsed .
And the the really big shock , the general collapse of society , is yet to come .
The ultimate version of the Shock Doctrine : ' If the collapse is total , we can accomplish any damned thing we want to accomplish ' .
I wo n't venture a guess about how this transition process will play out , but I do expect that it will be a nightmare of one description or another .
Already the growing homeless population is suffering a nightmare , by any civilized standards .
One day you 're living in a home whose value is going up , commuting to a good job , and the next thing you know your family is out on the streets .
That 's a nightmare .
The transition time will be a difficult time , but it will be a transition , it will be temporary , like a war .
And like a war , it will enable social and economic reconstruction in the aftermath .
Consider how Japan and Germany were socially and politically transformed by the postwar reconstruction process .
Those were exercises in social engineering , as were the preceding transformations under Mussolini and Hitler .
Although the outcomes were quite different , in each case a total collapse / defeat was the preamble to reconstruction .
A total collapse of the capitalist economy is simply the application of a proven formula .
The second part of the formula will be some new social order , or perhaps some old social order , or some mixture .
Something appropriate to a non -growth , command economy .
That 's part 1 of the War on Terrorism : it has enabled the creation of the police - state infrastructures required to to deal with the collapse of society , and to provide security for the reconstruction process .
Part 2 : Preparing the way for global domination
Part 2 of the War on Terrorism is about the geopolitical dimensions of a non -growth - based global economy .
Earlier I suggested that geopolitics was different under capitalism , than it was under sovereign monarchs .
The whole dynamic was different , and outcomes were weighed on a different scale .
Similarly , many things will change in a shift from chaotic , growth - oriented capitalism , to a centralized , micromanaged , economic regime .
Consider , for example , the significance of control over oil reserves .
In a growth economy , profits were the prize , and controlling the markets and the distribution channels amounted to holding a winning hand in the game .
The local dictators could manage things as they pleased , and take their cut of oil revenues , as long as they honored their contracts with the oil majors , who were happy to sell to the highest bidders .
In a non -growth economy , where the focus is on direct control over the supply and distributions of resources , it becomes necessary to secure , in the military sense , the sources of petroleum , and the routes for its distribution .
It is no longer sufficient to merely profit from unbridled operations .
Securing of the sources , and directly allocating the distribution , is the foundation for micromanaging the non-growth economy .
This applies to other critical resources as well , such as uranium , and the rare minerals needed by the ' defense ' and electronics industries .
In fact we are in the midst of a resource - grab war , with China and Russia making long - term energy deals with Iran and Venezuela , China buying up agricultural land in Africa , Washington making long - term deals for Brazilian biofuels , and there are many other examples .
In many ways imperialism is reverting to colonial days , when direct administration was the model , rather than the capitalist model : profiting from corporate investments under dictators who suppress their populations .
There is a natural reversion to the dynamics of the ' good old days of empire ' when the Great Powers of Europe focused their economic activity within their individual spheres of influence .
Everyone knows that global resource limits are being reached , partly from population pressures , and partly from resource - exploitation practices .
For this reason alone , we have the peaceful part of the resource - grab war .
In Iraq , Afghanistan , and now in Pakistan and Yemen , the US , with NATO support , is playing a very non-peaceful hand in the resource - grab game .
It 's the hand of a bully , ' I have the biggest gun , so I 'll take what I want ' .
These aggressive actions are very provocative to Russia and China , and threatening to their vital economic interests .
An attack on Iran would be more than a provocation , it would be a direct slap in the face , a challenge : ' Fight now or resign yourself to being subdued piecemeal ' .
In addition to all this petroleum grabbing , the US has been surrounding Russia and China with military bases , and has recently accelerated the installations of anti-missile systems on their borders , over the strong objections of Russia and China .
The US is being intentionally provocative , and it is threatening vital interests of these potential adversaries .
Alliances are being formed in response , on a bilateral basis , and in the form of the SCO .
China and Russia are very close in their military cooperation , and technology sharing .
Their strategic planning is based on the expectation of a US attack , and their strategic response is based on the principle of asymmetric warfare .
For example , a million dollar missile capable of taking out a multi-billion dollar aircraft carrier .
Or perhaps a handful of missiles capable of disabling the Pentagon 's command - and - control satellite systems .
Meanwhile the US is spending astronomical sums developing a first - strike capability , with space - based weapons systems , control - of - theater capability , forward - based ' tactical ' nukes , etc .
The new anti-missile systems are an important part of a first - strike strategy , reducing the ability of Russia or China to retaliate .
These systems are more than just provocative .
They are the modern equivalent of marching your armies up to your adversary 's border .
If there is a nuclear exchange between the major powers , historians will cite all of these things I 've mentioned as ' obvious signs ' that war was coming .
Parallels would be drawn to the pre-World War 1 scenario , when Germany was eclipsing Britain economically , as China is eclipsing the US now .
In both cases a ' desperate attempt to maintain hegemony ' would be seen as the cause of the war .
There may or may not be a World War 3 , but all of these preparations make it clear that our banking elite intend to preside over a global system , by hook or by crook .
If they wanted a peaceful arrangement , a splitting of the third - world pie , so to speak , it could be easily arranged at any time , along with substantial nuclear disarmament .
China and Russia would like to see a stable , multi- polar world ; it is only our elite bankers who are obsessed with world domination .
It is possible that nuclear war is a ' desired outcome ' , accomplishing depopulation , and making the collapse even more total .
Or perhaps China and Russia will be given an offer they can't refuse : ' Surrender your economic sovereignty to our global system , or face the consequences ' .
One way or another , the elite bankers , the masters of the universe , intend to preside over a micromanaged global system .
The collapse project is now well underway , and the ' surround your enemy ' project seems to be more or less completed .
From a strategic perspective , there will be some trigger point , some stage in the economic collapse scenario , when geopolitical confrontation is judged to be most advantageous .
It 's a multi- dimensional chess board , and with the stakes so high , you can rest assured that the timing of the various moves will be carefully coordinated .
And from the overall shape of the board , we seem to be nearing the endgame .
Prognosis 2012 – a Neo Dark Age
2012 might not be the exact year , but it 's difficult to see the endgame lasting much beyond that , and the masters of the universe love symbolism , as with 911 ( both in Chile and in Manhattan ) , KLA 007 , and others .
2012 is loaded with symbolism , eg. the Mayan Calendar , and the Internet is buzzing with various 2012 - related prophecies , survival strategies , anticipated alien interventions , alignments with galactic radiation fields , etc .
And then there is the Hollywood film , 2012 , which explicitly portrays the demise of most of humanity , and the pre-planned salvation of a select few .
One never knows with Hollywood productions , what is escapist fantasy , and what is aimed at preparing the public mind symbolically for what is to come .
Whatever the exact date , all the threads will come together , geopolitically and domestically , and the world will change .
It will be a new era , just as capitalism was a new era after aristocracy , and the Dark Ages followed the era of the Roman Empire .
Each era has its own structure , its own economics , its own social forms , and its own mythology .
These things must relate to one another coherently , and their nature follows from the fundamental power relationships and economic circumstances of the system .
In our post -2012 world , we have for the first time one centralized global government , and one ruling elite clique , a kind of extended royal family , the lords of finance .
As we can see with the IMF , WHO , and the WTO , and the other pieces of the embryonic world government , the institutions of governance will make no pretensions about popular representation or democratic responsiveness .
Rule will be by means of autocratic global bureaucracies , who take their marching orders from the royal family .
This model has already been operating for some time , within its various spheres of influence , as with the restructuring programs forced on the third world , as a condition for getting financing .
Whenever there is a change of era , the previous era is always demonized in mythology .
In the Garden of Eden story the serpent is demonized – a revered symbol in paganism , the predecessor to Christianity .
When republics came along , the demonization of monarchs was an important part of the process .
In the post -2012 world , democracy and national sovereignty will be demonized .
This will be very important , in getting people to accept totalitarian rule , and the mythology will contain much that is true ...
In those terrible dark days , before the blessed unification of humanity , anarchy reigned in the world .
One nation would attack another , no better than predators in the wild .
Nations had no coherent policies ; voters would swing from one party to another , keeping governments always in transition and confusion .
How did they ever think that masses of semi-educated people could govern themselves , and run a complex society ?
Democracy was an ill - conceived experiment that led only to corruption and chaotic governance .
How lucky we are to be in this well - ordered world , where humanity has finally grown up , and those with the best expertise make the decisions .
The economics of non-growth are radically different than capitalist economics .
The unit of exchange is likely to be a carbon credit , entitling you to consume the equivalent of one kilogram of fuel .
Everything will have a carbon value , allegedly based on how much energy it took to produce it and transport it to market .
' Green consciousness ' will be a primary ethic , conditioned early into children .
Getting by with less is a virtue ; using energy is anti-social ; austerity is a responsible and necessary condition .
As with every currency , the bankers will want to manage the scarcity of carbon credits , and that 's where global warming alarmism becomes important .
Regardless of the availability of resources , carbon credits can be kept arbitrarily scarce simply by setting carbon budgets , based on directives from the IPCC , another of our emerging units of global bureaucratic governance .
Such IPCC directives will be the equivalent of the Federal Reserve announcing a change in interest rates .
Those budgets set the scale of economic activity .
Presumably nations will continue to exist , as official units of governance .
However security and policing will be largely centralized and privatized .
Like the Roman Legions , the security apparatus will be loyal to the center of empire , not to the place where someone happens to be stationed .
We have seen this trend already in the US , as mercenaries have become big business , and police forces are increasingly federalized , militarized , and alienated from the general public .
Just as airports have now been federalized , all transport systems will be under the jurisdiction of the security apparatus .
Terrorism will continue as an ongoing bogey - man , justifying whatever security procedures are deemed desirable for social - control purposes .
The whole security apparatus will have a monolithic quality to it , a similarity of character regardless of the specific security tasks or location .
Everyone dressed in the same Evil Empire black outfits , with big florescent letters on the back of their flack jackets .
In essence , the security apparatus will be an occupying army , the emperor 's garrison in the provinces .
On a daily basis , you will need to go through checkpoints of various kinds , with varying levels of security requirements .
This is where biometrics becomes important .
If people can be implanted with chips , then much of the security can be automated , and everyone can be tracked at at all times , and their past activity retrieved .
The chip links into your credit balance , so you 've got all your currency always with you , along with your medical records and lots else that you do n't know about .
There is very little left as regards national sovereignty .
Nothing much in the way of foreign policy will have any meaning .
With security marching to its own law and its distant drummer , the main role of so - called ' government ' will be to allocate and administer the carbon - credit budget that it receives from the IPCC .
The IPCC decides how much wealth a nation will receive in a given year , and the government then decides how to distribute that wealth in the form of public services and entitlements .
Wealth being measured by the entitlement to expend energy .
In a fundamental sense , this is how things already are , following the collapse and the bailouts .
Because governments are so deeply in debt , the bankers are able to dictate the terms of national budgets , as a condition of keeping credit lines open .
The carbon economy , with its centrally determined budgets , provides a much simpler and more direct way of micromanaging economic activity and resource distribution throughout the globe .
In order to clear the way for the carbon - credit economy , it will be necessary for Western currencies to collapse , to become worthless , as nations become increasingly insolvent , and the global financial system continues to be systematically dismantled .
The carbon currency will be introduced as an enlightened , progressive ' solution ' to the crisis , a currency linked to something real , and to sustainability .
The old monetary system will be demonized , and again the mythology will contain much that is true ...
The pursuit of money is the root of all evil , and the capitalist system was inherently evil .
It encouraged greed , and consumption , and it cared nothing about wasting resources .
People thought the more money they had , the better off they were .
How much wiser we are now , to live within our means , and to understand that a credit is a token of stewardship .
Culturally , the post - capitalist era will be a bit like the medieval era , with aristocrats and lords on top , and the rest peasants and serfs .
A definite upper class and lower class .
Just as only the old upper class had horses and carriages , only the new upper class will be entitled to access substantial carbon credits .
Wealth will be measured by entitlements , more than by acquisitions or earnings .
Those outside the bureaucratic hierarchies are the serfs , with subsistence entitlements .
Within the bureaucracies , entitlements are related to rank in the hierarchy .
Those who operate in the central global institutions are lords of empire , with unlimited access to credits .
But there is no sequestering of wealth , or building of economic empires , outside the structures of the designated bureaucracies .
Entitlements are about access to resources and facilities , to be used or not used , but not to be saved and used as capital .
The flow of entitlements comes downward , micromanaged from the top .
It 's a dole economy , at all levels , for people and governments alike – the global regimentation of consumption .
As regards regimentation , the post - capitalist culture will also be a bit like the Soviet system .
Here 's your entitlement card , here 's your job assignment , and here 's where you 'll be living .
With the pervasive security apparatus , and the micromanagement of economic activity , the scenario is clearly about fine - grained social control , according to centralized guidelines and directives .
Presumably media will be carefully programmed , with escapist trivia , and a sophisticated version of 1984 - style groupthink propaganda pseudo - news , which is pretty much what we already have today .
The non-commercial Internet , if there is one , will be limited to monitored , officially - designated chat sites , and other kinds of sanitized forums .
With such a focus on social micromanagement , I do not expect the family unit to survive in the new era , and I expect child - abuse alarmism will be the lever used to destabilize the family .
The stage has been set with all the revelations about church and institutional child sexual abuse .
Such revelations could have been uncovered any time in the past century , but they came out at a certain time , just as all these other transitional things have been happening .
People are now aware that widespread child abuse happens , and they have been conditioned to support strong measures to prevent it .
Whenever I turn on the TV , I see at least one public - service ad , with shocking images , about children who are physically or sexually abused , or criminally neglected , in their homes , and there 's a hotline phone number that children can call .
It is easy to see how the category of abuse can be expanded , to include parents who do n't follow vaccination schedules , whose purchase records do n't indicate healthy diets , who have dubious psychological profiles , etc .
The state of poverty could be deemed abusive neglect .
With the right media presentation , abuse alarmism would be easy to stir up .
Ultimately , a ' child rights ' movement becomes an anti-family movement .
The state must directly protect the child from birth .
The family is demonized ...
How scary were the old days , when unlicensed , untrained couples had total control over vulnerable children , behind closed doors , with whatever neuroses , addictions , or perversions the parents happened to possess .
How did this vestige of patriarchal slavery , this safe - house den of abuse , continue so long to exist , and not be recognized for what it was ?
How much better off we are now , with children being raised scientifically , by trained staff , where they are taught healthy values .
Ever since public education was introduced , the state and the family have competed to control childhood conditioning .
In religious families , the church has made its own contribution to conditioning .
In the micromanaged post - capitalist future , with its Shock Doctrine birth scenario , it would make good sense to take that opportunity to implement the ' final solution ' of social control , which is for the state to monopolize child raising .
This would eliminate from society the parent - child bond , and hence family - related bonds in general .
No longer is there a concept of relatives .
There 's just worker bees , security bees , and queen bees , who dole out the honey .
Postscript
This has been an extensive and somewhat detailed prognosis , regarding the architecture of the post - capitalist regime , and the transition process required to bring it about .
The term ' new world order ' is too weak a term to characterize the radical nature of the social transformation anticipated in the prognosis .
A more apt characterization would be a ' quantum leap in the domestication of the human species ' .
Micromanaged lives and microprogrammed beliefs and thoughts .
A once wild primate species transformed into something resembling more a bee or ant culture .
Needless to say , regular use of psychotropic drugs would be mandated , so that people could cope emotionally with such a sterile , inhuman environment .
For such a profound transformation to be possible , it is easy to see that a very great shock is required , on the scale of collapse and social chaos , and possibly on the scale of a nuclear exchange .
There needs to be an implicit mandate to ' do whatever is necessary to get society running again ' .
The shock needs to leave people in a condition of total helplessness comparable to the survivors in the bombed - out rubble of Germany and Japan after World War 2 .
Nothing less will do .
The accuracy of the prognosis , as prediction , is of course impossible to know in advance .
However each part of the prognosis has been based on precedents that have been set , modus operandi that has been observed , trends that have been initiated , sentiments that have been expressed , signals that have been given , and actions that have been taken whose consequences can be confidently predicted .
In addition , in looking at all of these indicators together , one sees a certain mindset , an absolutist determination to implement the ' ideal solution ' , without compromise , using extreme means , and with unbridled audacity .
World wars have been rehearsals for this historic moment .
The police state infrastructure is in place and has been tested .
The economy is in the process of collapse .
The enemy is surrounded with missiles .
Arbitrary powers have been assumed .
If not now , the ultimate prize , then when will there be a better opportunity ?
Our elite planners are backed up by competent think tanks , and they know that the new society must have coherence of various kinds .
They 've had quite a bit of experience with social engineering , nurturing the rise of fascism , and then engineering the postwar regimes .
They understand the importance of mythology .
For example there is the mythology of the holocaust , where the story is all about extermination per se , and the story is not told of the primary mission of the concentration camps , which was to provide slave labor for war production .
And some of the companies using the slave labor were American owned , and were supplying the German war machine .
Thus does mythology , though containing truth , succeed in hiding the tracks and the crimes of elite perps , leaving others to carry the whole burden of historical demonization .
So I think there is a sound basis for anticipating the kinds of mythology that would be designed for leaving behind and rejecting the old ways , and seeing the new as a salvation .
There is a long historical precedent of era changes linked with mythology changes , often expressed in religious terms .
There will be a familiar ring to the new mythology , a remixing and re-prioritizing of familiar values and assumptions , so as to resonate with the dynamics of the new regime .
The nature of the carbon economy has been somewhat clearly signaled .
Carbon budgets , and carbon credits , are clearly destined to become primary components of the economy .
As we 've seen with the elite and grassroots supported global warming movement , the arbitrary scarcity of carbon credits can be easily regulated on the pretext of environmentalism .
And peak oil alarmism is always available as a backup .
As elite spokespeople have often expressed , when the time comes , the masses will demand the new world order .
The focus on control over consumption , resources , and distribution is implicit in the emphasis on energy limits , is latent in the geopolitical situation , as regards depletion of global resources , and is indicated by the need for a new unifying paradigm , as the growth paradigm is no longer viable .
The nature of the security apparatus has been clearly signaled by the responses to demonstrations ever since 1998 in Seattle , by the increased use of hardened - killer mercenaries at home and abroad , by excessive and abusive police behavior , by airport security procedures , by Guantanamo and renditions , by the creation of a domestic branch of the army , dedicated to responding to civil emergencies , and by the way Katrina and Haiti have been handled .
It would be a major mistake to think of those last two as bungled operations .
They were exercises in collapse management of a certain kind , to be applied to certain populations , where the training and equipment appropriate for combat in Afghanistan is seen as being appropriate for administering aid to civilian disaster victims .
These selected disaster victims will be seen primarily as threats to civil order , or perhaps undesirables to be incarcerated or eliminated .
They will be demonized as rioters and looters .
Assistance will comes later , if at all .
And it can all be broadcast on TV , and somehow be seen as the way things have to be .
These two exercises were not bungled at all .
They were alarmingly successful , most notably in the case of the realtime PR mythology .
The limited role of national governments , being primarily allocators of mandated budgets , has been clearly signaled by long - standing IMF policies in the third world , and by the way the bankers have been dictating to governments , in the wake of the over - extended bailout commitments .
The carbon entitlement budgeting paradigm accomplishes the same micromanagement in a much more direct way , and is the natural outcome of the push toward hard carbon limits .

05 Mar 10 , 10:23 Greek Debt - Great article .
My country is in the eye of a storm that has yet to peak .
We Greeks are the worst liars and cheats of the world .
We are the vermin of the economic system .
We are the abomination that must be abolished from the face of the earth in the pristine New Order that is upon us , where the magic press creates money for all except for those who believe that it does .
We should never have touched the money that was thrown from the overflying helicopters .
Of all the Greeks , there must be one who is the worst .
Well , I have a terrible confession to make .
It 's me .
It is my 2000 euros a month Professor 's salary in some public educational institution that derailed the world economy .
It is me , the superfluous public servant of 30 some years who is trying to educate Greece 's youth primarily by Spartan example and honesty .
It is me , the teacher of the healing arts , national pride , love and tolerance for all and the wisdom of the ancients .
It is me who attracted the speculative thunderbolts of Paulson , Greenspan and Soros .
Gather the woods and plant the stake .
Tie me up and throw the torch .
Better yet , starve me slowly to death through salary cuts .
It will provide more advertisement time for Bloomberg and CNN .
Upon the cleansing demise of the unbeliever the skies will clear , natural order will be restored and the Dow will go through the roof .

Methinks Richard K. Moore is more than a little overwrought .
=:-)
This long screed , yet another turgid personal hallucination on the prophetical nature of Orwell 's 1984 , is overly long , laborious to read through .
Depressing because of the author 's inability to more healthily separate his overwrought libertarian 's agenda - laden slant on things , from a calmer objective appraisal .
I have nothing here against libertarians , only please , give me a sane one to talk to !
Yes , we do have a world with a few very powerful banking families .
No , it 's highly unlikely that even when they willfully " tip events into crisis " , as Mr. Moore darkly suggests , they can any more reliably determine an outcome than can any other mortal .
The notion that a developed nation world trembling on the brink of economic implosion after 40 years of runaway debt accumulation is an entity which " the bankers " can skillfully " exploit " is ( sadly ) the imaginary figment of a man who is having a tough time remaining grounded in reality faced with these large events .
This is a gigantic whale of a global crisis , which defies any one groups ability to " manipulate " .
An analogy might be poking at a giant sand - hill with a stick .
Not even the cleverest poker can predict where the sand - hill will shift or collapse , and therefore the act of poking is an extremely dangerous exercise should it have to rely on any predictable result .
The mind which unerringly veers to manipulatory conclusions when facing the largest crises in history betrays itself as a mind drawn to vast simplifications , and they seem drearily to always carry the obsessive Orwellian preoccupation as their raison d'etre .
In my view this authors conclusions are simplistic , while professing to a penetrating vision instead - and his turgid and dark fantasies of everything being exquisitely ** orchestrated * * via a diabolically clever top - down " central banker control " do n't make him a psychologically attractive one either .

16 Mar 10 , 15:56 Crashing Toward A New World Social Order 2012
Mr. Moore 's analysis is cogent and believable , as far as INTENTIONS of the international bankers are concerned , but the problem is that after a nuclear war , the underlying premise - that the infrastructure of communications and therefore control remains intact - is eliminated .
Also eliminated from the picture , are financial centers such as New York , London , and Israel itself , along with the international bankers .
They will not be able to sit in their comfortable offices to preside over the Neo Dark Age , because they will have all - or most of them - been vaporized in the nuclear exchanges .
Another factor not taken into account , is the vaporization of the dollar and the pound , and all paper currencies in fact , through the demise of the dollar as the reserve currency of the world .
The US 's monstrous military might depends on the ability to pay its soldiers - with what ?
Zimbabwe dollars ?
That wo n't go far ...
Sure , the international bankers aspire to total power , but they may well bring down the house upon themselves , in their efforts ; they are doing pretty well , in that respect , so far .
So , thankfully , I can take a different view of the future than Mr. Moore .
Dark times ahead , to be sure , with the specter of nuclear war awaiting us .
But things will turn out differently after that , for those that survive , from what Moore paints as the future .
The globalized world is already fragmenting .
I think this trend will continue , and a good thing it is .

22 Mar 10 , 21:11 New World Order Possibly Corporatism
I respect the authors opinion , but the idea of a centralized \ doled out economy seems like a very odd thing to try after what happened with the Soviet Union and most attempts at a " One World Government " in the past .
It would be a failure from the start since as Hugo pointed out the only way to have any sort of sound society even through a dictatorship would still require a sound financial system which simply could not happen without having capitalism .
For instance what does the central government do when it runs out of money or in this case permits ?
And if it tried to print more that would cause it to inevitably collapse since the permits or money would become worthless .
I believe instead of a central government it wont be much different then what we have now .
There will be institutions like the central banks , IMF that will do the governing which would basically be a " world government " so to speak .
So I think each industry would basically start to govern itself .
I cant see how anyone even the bankers could create a system that is without capitalism , it would inevitably collapse , as it has always done .
I think you will see the major corporates will eventually replace governments and everyone will work / rely on them which is basically the case now .
Also its interesting how many big companies are loaded with cash which would allow them to basically monopolize there respective industry through cheap buyouts , they just need the government to get out of their way to do that ( Government bankruptcy / fire sale ? ) .
The worst thing that I think may happen is instead of a world war the world may find itself in a " corporate war " so to speak between the rising Asian and Western multinationals fighting over total control .
It does sound like it would be a major change and even crazy but I mean we already rely on big business for : food , energy , work , health , money , entertainment , transport , and even security more then ever before .
I do agree though that either way one thing I think I can guarantee is we worldwide are headed for major change but in that aspect people have never really changed for thousands of years .

28 Nov 11 , 11:40 who controls the new world order
The Pope controls the new world order or more specifically the Jesuit General .
Through secret societies such as the knights of malta who by the way started the cia and opus dei who started the fbi .
The crux of the matter is a National Sunday starting from America which will become universal .
Study Revelation where it speaks about the lamb like beast coming out of the sea when the beast out of the sea seemed to receive a deadly wound .
This was the papacy whose papal states were taken away from him by Napolean .
The very same year France recognized America 's independance .
So America and the Papacy are in biblical prophecy .
The popes title in latin is vicarius filli dei .
The numerical value of this title is 666 .
You think they do not know this ?
Ofcourse they do and they do not want you to find out either .
The way you can tell if a protest is effective is when the target of the action ca n’t stop complaining about it .
For two days in a row , Glenn Beck has devoted valuable airtime to castigating the proponents of an advertiser boycott that began last year in response to Beck calling President Obama a racist with “ a deep - seated hatred of white people . ”
For Beck to divert so much time from fabricating paranoid conspiracy theories to fabricating smears on his perceived enemies is revealing .
His anxiety could not be more apparent , even as he pretends that the efforts directed against him are making him happy :
“ The fact is , I have n’t felt this good and positive in a long time .
Why ?
Because the boycott attempts are the most transparent AstroTurf attacks I have ever seen or ever heard of . ”
Ever ?
The truth is that the boycotts were initiated by a very small group that most people ( including me ) had never heard of .
Color of Change began the effort with a small email list and a campaign to communicate with Beck ’s advertisers .
This shoestring effort produced surprising results , getting more than 100 advertisers to refuse to permit their commercials on Beck ’s show .
[ Note : StopBeck later joined the effort further enhancing its effectiveness ]
Beck spent the majority of his rebuttal inventing a plot that went all the way up to the White House .
The first brick thrown by Beck was at his perennial nemesis , Van Jones .
However , while Jones was a co-founder of Color Of Change , he left the organization two years prior to the Beck boycott .
That did n’t stop
Beck from building his cloud castle of hate .
He then tied Jones to Rev. Jim Wallis of the Sojourners .
However , Wallis had nothing to do with the advertiser boycott , then or now .
Wallis entered the picture after Beck took an astonishingly stupid stand against social justice and advised his listeners to “ run ” from any church that advocated it .
Wallis responded by calling for Christians who believe in the venerable Christian practice of social justice to run from Glenn Beck .
And of course , Beck had to inject his distaste for working Americans by slandering unions .
So he tethered Andy Stern to the boycott effort , although Stern and his SEIU had no part in the year - old boycott until about two weeks ago when they signed on with a new push by MoveOn.org .
After this hallucinatory construction of a widespread cabal attacking him , Beck capped it off with a wild accusation that it was a high level plot that the President was “ coordinating from the Oval Office ” :
“ Is it possible , maybe , that pointing out every night that there are radicals , Marxists , and communists , in the White House , maybe that struck a nerve ?
Has someone decided that they must destroy my career and silence me because we ’ve stumbled onto something ? [… ]
Has there ever been a case in American history … where an American president administration tried to destroy the livelihood of a private citizen with whom they disagree .
Ca n’t think of any . ”
Beck ’s paranoia led to this declaration that nothing like this had ever happened before .
He then immediately contradicted himself by comparing it to Richard Nixon ’s famous “ enemies list . ”
The only problem with that comparison is that Nixon ’s list was documented and Beck ’s delusions still only exist in his twisted cranium .
What ’s more , Nixon sought to use the power of the government against his opponents , but the Beck boycott relies entirely on the efforts of individual citizens engaging in free expression .
Nevertheless ,
Beck elevates this to an absurd altitude wherein he literally compares himself with victims of Nazi atrocities :
“ Where ’s the media ?
Do the rest of you in this business think it ’s gonna stop with me ?
Really ?
Once they get me what happens to you ?
Is there absolutely no chance whatsoever that you might be a target at some point in the future ?
What is that poem …
First they came for the Jews and I stayed silent … ”
Now they are coming for Glenn Beck .
It is so like Beck to manifest his Messianic complex in this fashion .
He is the persecuted one that suffers for his congregation .
And his stylings are getting more televengelical and Apocalyptic by the day .
Witness this fire and brimstone sermon :
It is a bizarre world .
It is an upside down , inside out , quantum physics world . [ … ]
It is the eve of destruction in America .
I believe in God .
I believe rights come from man , and this Constitution , and the founding of this nation , were divinely inspired .
These are God ’s rights and God ’s freedoms .
If we appreciate those rights , if we do the right thing [… ] we are going to have to pay the consequence for our living and mistreating these rights .
But in the end , have no fear , because nothing will thwart Him .
Because these are His rights .
This was His Constitution .
This was His country for His purposes , not ours .
And nothing … nothing …will thwart Him in the end .
Hallelujah .
This may be the first time I have heard anyone declare that the Constitution was “ divinely inspired . ”
To my knowledge , it has not been included in any version of the Bible .
Thomas Jefferson and James Madison have not been beatified , nor is George Washington a saint .
But in Beck ’s mind a new holy doctrine has been proclaimed .
One that permitted human slavery and denied women the right to vote .
If the Constitution was divinely inspired , then what right did later generations have to amend it ?
Were they also the servants of God ?
And if so , did God screw up when he ratified Prohibition or the right to levy income taxes ?
I have said this before , and it is all too apparent that it must be repeated : I genuinely hope that the people who care for Glenn Beck get him the help that he so obviously requires .
It is way too tempting for his family and his producers and his hangers on , to hold back and revel in the riches he generates for them .
But they will surely regret it when he self - destructs and splatters them all with the blood of their greed .
Now I ’m sounding a little Biblical .
And so I speaketh not further for the time is at hand for me to shuteth up .
For now …..

Homophobia : Start ' Em Young A high school in Mississippi has decided to cancel prom rather than allow a lesbian student to A.… Read more
Eighteen - year - old Constance McMillen asked Itawamba County Agricultural High School beforehand if she could wear a tux and bring her girlfriend Minerva to the April 2 prom .
When the school said no , the ACLU gave it a deadline of Wednesday to change its policy against same - sex dates .
The school responded by canceling the entire prom , which McMillen called " retaliation " because " a bunch of kids at school are really going to hate me for this . "

Indeed , when she returned to school — reluctantly , and at the behest of her father — she did receive some " unfriendly looks . "
She tells the AP that one student said , " Thanks for ruining my senior year . "
But McMillen is n't alone .
The ACLU has filed a federal complaint " asking the court to reinstate the prom for all students at the school and charging Itawamba County School District officials with violating Constance McMillen 's First Amendment right to freedom of expression . "
Roger Ebert , who basically just keeps getting more awesome , drew attention to her case on Twitter , writing , " It 's okay if girls go to a prom together because they can't get dates , but god forbid if they like each other . "
And BuzzFeed has an email address readers can use to tell the school board to " let Constance take her girlfriend to prom ! "
That would be tmcneese@itawamba.k12.ms.us — feel free to drop them a line if you , like Ebert , the ACLU , and us , are on Team Constance .
Update : Several people have gotten email bounces from the above address .
A different address can be found here .

Earlier : Homophobia : Start ' Em Young
It 's not hard to figure out the attraction of living in your parents ' basement .
Free rent !
Your Mom makes you sandwiches !
Awesome .
But why is a whole generation of young people kicking it at the 'rents ?
Science has the answer .
There are basically two theories .
One : today 's adult children are fickle , overgrown babies who need their parents to tuck them in at night and are so enamored with themselves that they refuse to get a job unless it is as special as themselves .
Or , two : vast economic shifts have conspired such that it is impossible for these young people live on their own .
( Hang out for even a minute with those recently graduated from college and you will see that they vastly prefer the second theory . )
A big study from the MacArthur Research Network on Transitions to Adulthood just came out and ... it shows both theories are kind of true !
First :
The " impossible " theory .
Far from suffering from some new form of mass infantalization , the study suggests it is the American Way to live with your parents into adulthood .
The study confirms that , young Americans are indeed " living at home longer , are financially insecure and are making lower wages . "
But it also says that living at home in your younger years was the norm until recently .
In the early 1900s , the grandparents of today 's basement - dwellers also lived at home , existing in a state of " semi-autonomy , " building up their personal resources until they could set out on their own and start a family .
Then the Boomer generation came around .
Because there were so many awesome factory jobs in post - World War II America — and , probably , their newly - revolutionized sexuality was being hampered by Mom always listening through the door — everyone moved out of the house soon as they could .
But the study says the Boomers were an " anomaly . "
Now , our post - industrial economy has returned us to a baseline of American extended adolescence , with adult children happily ensconced with their parents until they finally find a Tumblr follower to settle down with .
Americans were never meant to strike out on their own !
Except there is one crucial difference between today 's parental cohabitators and those of yore — and here 's where the big baby theory comes in :
Where the young adults of the 1900s helped support the household , statistics show that parents today spend 10 percent of their income supporting their adult children .
Conclusion : Young people living at home today are big American babies .

Aliens exist and they live in our midst disguised as humans - at least , that 's what 20 percent of people polled in a global survey believe .
The Reuters Ipsos poll of 23,000 adults in 22 countries showed that more than 40 percent of people from India and China believe that aliens walk among us disguised as humans , while those least likely to believe in this are from Belgium , Sweden and the Netherlands ( 8 percent each ) .
However , the majority of people polled , or 80 percent , do n't believe aliens in our midst .
" It would appear that that there 's a modest correlation between the most populated countries and those more likely to indicate there may be aliens disguised amongst them compared with those countries with the smaller populations , " said John Wright , Senior Vice President of market research firm Ipsos .
" Maybe the it's a simple case that in a less populated country you are more likely to know your next door neighbour better , " he said .
More men than women - 22 percent vs 17 percent - believe that alien beings are on earth .

Perhaps the most interesting , poignant and , possibly , threatening type of writer and thinker is the one who not only defies conventional categorizations of thought but also offers a deeply penetrating critique of those illusions many hold to be the most sacred .
Ernst Junger ( 1895 - 1998 ) , who first came to literary prominence during Germany ’s Weimar era as a diarist of the experiences of a front line stormtrooper during the Great War , is one such writer .
Both the controversial nature of his writing and its staying power are demonstrated by the fact that he remains one of the most important yet widely disliked literary and cultural figures of twentieth century Germany .
As recently as 1993 , when Junger would have been ninety - eight years of age , he was the subject of an intensely hostile exchange in the “ New York Review of Books ” between an admirer and a detractor of his work .
(1 ) On the occasion of his one hundreth birthday in 1995 , Junger was the subject of a scathing , derisive musical performed in East Berlin .
Yet Junger was also the recipient of Germany ’s most prestigious literary awards , the Goethe Prize and the Schiller Memorial Prize .
Junger , who converted to Catholicism at the age of 101 , received a commendation from Pope John Paul II and was an honored guest of French President Francois Mitterand and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl at the Franco - German reconciliation ceremony at Verdun in 1984 .
Though he was an exceptional achiever during virtually every stage of his extraordinarily long life , it was his work during the Weimar period that not only secured for a Junger a presence in German cultural and political history , but also became the standard by which much of his later work was evaluated and by which his reputation was , and still is , debated . ( 2 )
Ernst Junger was born on March 29 , 1895 in Heidelberg , but was raised in Hanover .
His father , also named Ernst , was an academically trained chemist who became wealthy as the owner of a pharmaceutical manufacturing business , finding himself successful enough to essentially retire while he was still in his forties .
Though raised as an evangelical Protestant , Junger ’s father did not believe in any formal religion , nor did his mother , Karoline , an educated middle class German woman whose interests included Germany ’s rich literary tradition and the cause of women ’s emancipation .
His parents ’ politics seem to have been liberal , though not radical , in the manner not uncommon to the rising bourgeoise of Germany ’s upper middle class during the pre-war period .
It was in this affluent , secure bourgeoise environment that Ernst Junger grew up .
Indeed , many of Junger ’s later activities and professed beliefs are easily understood as a revolt against the comfort and safety of his upbringing .
As a child , he was an avid reader of the tales of adventurers and soldiers , but a poor academic student who did not adjust well to the regimented Prussian educational system .
Junger ’s instructors consistently complained of his inattentiveness .
As an adolescent , he became involved with the Wandervogel , roughly the German equivalent of the Boy Scouts .
( 3 )
It was while attending a boarding school near his parents ’ home in 1913 , at the age of seventeen , that Junger first demonstrated his first propensity for what might be called an “ adventurist ” way of life .
With only six months left before graduation , Junger left school , leaving no word to his family as to his destination .
Using money given to him for school - related fees and expenses to buy a firearm and a railroad ticket to Verdun , Junger subsequently enlisted in the French Foreign Legion , an elite military unit of the French armed forces that accepted enlistees of any nationality and had a reputation for attracting fugitives , criminals and career mercenaries .
Junger had no intention of staying with the Legion .
He only wanted to be posted to Africa , as he eventually was .
Junger then deserted , only to be captured and sentenced to jail .
Eventually his father found a capable lawyer for his wayward son and secured his release .
Junger then returned to his studies and underwent a belated high school graduation .
However , it was only a very short time later that Junger was back in uniform . ( 4 )
Warrior and War Diarist
Ernst Junger immediately volunteered for military service when he heard the news that Germany was at war in the summer of 1914 .
After two months of training , Junger was assigned to a reserve unit stationed at Champagne .
He was afraid the war would end before he had the opportunity to see any action .
This attitude was not uncommon among many recruits or conscripts who fought in the war for their respective states .
The question immediately arises at to why so many young people would wish to look into the face of death with such enthusiasm .
Perhaps they really did not understand the horrors that awaited them .
In Junger ’s case , his rebellion against the security and luxury of his bourgeoise upbringing had already been ably demonstrated by his excursion with the French Foreign Legion .
Because of his high school education , something that soldiers of more proletarian origins lacked , Junger was selected to train to become an officer .
Shortly before beginning his officer ’s training , Junger was exposed to combat for the first time .
From the start , he carried pocket - sized notebooks with him and recorded his observations on the front lines .
His writings while at the front exhibit a distinctive tone of detachment , as though he is simply an observer watching while the enemy fires at others .
In the middle part of 1915 , Junger suffered his first war wound , a bullet graze to the thigh that required only two weeks of recovery time .
Afterwards , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant .
( 5 )
At age twenty - one , Junger was the leader of a reconnaissance team at the Somme whose purpose was to go out at night and search for British landmines .
Early on , he acquired the reputation of a brave soldier who lacked the preoccupation with his own safety common to most of the fighting men .
The introduction of steel artifacts into the war , tanks for the British side and steel helmets for the Germans , made a deep impression on Junger .
Wounded three times at the Somme , Junger was awarded the Iron Medal First Class .
Upon recovery , he returned to the front lines .
A combat daredevil , he once held out against a much larger British force with only twenty men .
After being transferred to fight the French at Flanders , he lost ten of his fourteen men and was wounded in the left hand by a blast from French shelling .
After being harshly criticized by a superior officer for the number of men lost on that particular mission , Junger began to develop a contempt for the military hierarchy whom he regarded as having achieved their status as a result of their class position , frequently lacking combat experience of their own .
In late 1917 , having already experienced nearly three full years of combat , Junger was wounded for the fifth time during a surprise assault by the British .
He was grazed in the head by a bullet , acquiring two holes in his helmet in the process .
His performance in this battle won him the Knights Cross of the Hohenzollerns .
In March 1918 , Junger participated in another fierce battle with the British , losing 87 of his 150 men . ( 6 )
Nothing impressed Junger more than personal bravery and endurance on the part of soldiers .
He once “ fell to the ground in tears ” at the sight of a young recruit who had only days earlier been unable to carry an ammunition case by himself suddenly being able to carry two cases of missles after surviving an attack of British shells .
A recurring theme in Junger ’s writings on his war experiences is the way in which war brings out the most savage human impulses .
Essentially , human beings are given full license to engage in behavior that would be considered criminal during peacetime .
He wrote casually about burning occupied towns during the course of retreat or a shift of position .
However , Junger also demonstrated a capacity for merciful behavior during his combat efforts .
He refrained from shooting a cornered British soldier after the foe displayed a portrait of his family to Junger .
He was wounded yet again in August of 1918 .
Having been shot in the chest and directly through a lung , this was his most serious wound yet .
After being hit , he still managed to shoot dead yet another British officer .
As Junger was being carried off the battlefield on a stretcher , one of the stretcher carriers was killed by a British bullet .
Another German soldier attempted to carry Junger on his back , but the soldier was shot dead himself and Junger fell to the ground .
Finally , a medic recovered him and pulled him out of harm ’s way .
This episode would be the end of his battle experiences during the Great War .
( 7 )
In Storms of Steel
Junger ’s keeping of his wartime diaries paid off quite well in the long run .
They were to become the basis of his first and most famous book , In Storms of Steel , published in 1920 .
The title was given to the book by Junger himself , having found the phrase in an old Icelandic saga .
It was at the suggestion of his father that Junger first sought to have his wartime memoirs published .
Initially , he found no takers , antiwar sentiment being extremely high in Germany at the time , until his father at last arranged to have the work published privately .
In Storms of Steel differs considerably from similar works published by war veterans during the same era , such as Erich Maria Remarque ’s All Quiet on the Western Front and John Dos Passos ’ Three Soldiers .
Junger ’s book reflects none of the disillusionment with war by those experienced in its horrors of the kind found in these other works .
Instead , Junger depicted warfare as an adventure in which the soldier faced the highest possible challenge , a battle to the death with a mortal enemy .
Though Junger certainly considered himself to be a patriot and , under the influence of Maurice Barres ( 8 ) , eventually became a strident German nationalist , his depiction of military combat as an idyllic setting where human wills face the supreme test rose far above ordinary nationalist sentiments .
Junger ’s warrior ideal was not merely the patriot fighting out of a profound sense of loyalty to his country nor the stereotype of the dutiful soldier whose sense of honor and obedience compels him to follow the orders of his superiors in a headlong march towards death .
Nor was the warrior prototype exalted by Junger necessarily an idealist fighting for some alleged greater good such as a political ideal or religious devotion .
Instead , war itself is the ideal for Junger .
On this question , he was profoundly influenced by Nietzsche , whose dictum “ a good war justifies any cause ” , provides an apt characterization of Junger ’s depiction of the life ( and death ) of the combat soldier . ( 9 )
This aspect of Junger ’s outlook is illustrated quite well by the ending he chose to give to the first edition of In Storms of Steel .
Although the second edition ( published in 1926 ) ends with the nationalist rallying cry , “ Germany lives and shall never go under ! ” , a sentiment that was deleted for the third edition published in 1934 at the onset of the Nazi era , the original edition ends simply with Junger in the hospital after being wounded for the final time and receiving word that he has received yet another commendation for his valor as a combat soldier .
There is no mention of Germany ’s defeat a few months later .
Nationalism aside , the book is clearly about Junger , not about Germany , and Junger ’s depiction of the war simultaneously displays an extraordinary level detachment for someone who lived in the face of death for four years and a highly personalized account of the war where battle is first and foremost about the assertion of one ’s own “ will to power ” with cliched patriotic pieties being of secondary concern .
Indeed , Junger goes so far as to say there were winners and losers on both sides of the war .
The true winners were not those who fought in a particular army or for a particular country , but who rose to the challenge placed before them and essentially achieved what Junger regarded as a higher state of enlightenment .
He believed the war had revealed certain fundamental truths about the human condition .
First , the illusions of the old bourgeoise order concerning peace , progress and prosperity had been inalterably shattered .
This was not an uncommon sentiment during that time , but it is a revelation that Junger seems to revel in while others found it to be overwhelmingly devastating .
Indeed , the lifelong champion of Enlightenment liberalism , Bertrand Russell , whose life was almost as long as Junger ’s and who observed many of the same events from a much different philosophical perspective , once remarked that no one who had been born before 1914 knew what it was like to be truly happy .
( 10 ) A second observation advanced by Junger had to do with the role of technology in transforming the nature of war , not only in a purely mechanical sense , but on a much greater existential level .
Before , man had commanded weaponry in the course of combat .
Now weaponry of the kind made possible by modern technology and industrial civilization essentially commanded man .
The machines did the fighting .
Man simply resisted this external domination .
Lastly , the supremacy of might and the ruthless nature of human existence had been demonstrated .
Nietzsche was right .
The tragic , Darwinian nature of the human condition had been revealed as an irrevocable law .
In Storms of Steel was only the first of several works based on his experiences as a combat officer that were produced by Junger during the 1920s .
Copse 125 described a battle between two small groups of combatants .
In this work , Junger continued to explore the philosophical themes present in his first work .
The type of technologically driven warfare that emerged during the Great War is characterized as reducing men to automatons driven by airplanes , tanks and machine guns .
Once again , jingoistic nationalism is downplayed as a contributing factor to the essence of combat soldier ’s spirit .
Another work of Junger ’s from the early 1920s , Battle as Inner Experience , explored the psychology of war .
Junger suggested that civilization itself was but a mere mask for the “ primordial ” nature of humanity that once again reveals itself during war .
Indeed , war had the effect of elevating humanity to a higher level .
The warrior becomes a kind of god - like animal , divine in his superhuman qualities , but animalistic in his bloodlust .
The perpetual threat of imminent death is a kind of intoxicant .
Life is at its finest when death is closest .
Junger described war as a struggle for a cause that overshadows the respective political or cultural ideals of the combatants .
This overarching cause is courage .
The fighter is honor bound to respect the courage of his mortal enemy .
Drawing on the philosophy of Nietzsche , Junger argued that the war had produced a “ new race ” that had replaced the old pieties , such as those drawn from religion , with a new recognition of the primacy of the “ will to power ” .
( 11 )
Conservative Revolutionary
Junger ’s writings about the war quickly earned him the status of a celebrity during the Weimar period .
Battle as Inner Experience contained the prescient suggestion that the young men who had experienced the greatest war the world had yet to see at that point could never be successfully re-integrated into the old bougeoise order from which they came .
For these fighters , the war had been a spiritual experience .
Having endured so much only to see their side lose on such seemingly humiliating terms , the veterans of the war were aliens to the rationalistic , anti-militarist , liberal republic that emerged in 1918 at the close of the war .
Junger was at his parents ’ home recovering from war wounds during the time of the attempted coup by the leftist workers ’ and soldiers ’ councils and subsequent suppression of these by the Freikorps .
He experimented with psychoactive drugs such as cocaine and opium during this time , something that he would continue to do much later in life .
Upon recovery , he went back into active duty in the much diminished Germany army .
Junger ’s earliest works , such as In Storms of Steel , were published during this time and he also wrote for military journals on the more technical and specialized aspects of combat and military technology .
Interestingly , Junger attributed Germany ’s defeat in the war simply to poor leadership , both military and civilian , and rejected the “ stab in the back ” legend that consoled less keen veterans .
After leaving the army in 1923 , Junger continued to write , producing a novella about a soldier during the war titled Sturm , and also began to study the philosophy of Oswald Spengler .
His first work as a philosopher of nationalism appeared the Nazi paper Volkischer Beobachter in September , 1923 .
Critiquing the failed Marxist revolution of 1918 , Junger argued that the leftist coup failed because of its lacking of fresh ideas .
It was simply a regurgitation of the egalitarian outllook of the French Revolution .
The revolutionary left appealed only to the material wants of the Germany people in Junger ’s views .
A successful revolution would have to be much more than that .
It would have to appeal to their spiritual or “ folkish ” instincts as well .
Over the next few years Junger studied the natural sciences at the University of Leipzig and in 1925 , at age thirty , he married nineteen - year - old Gretha von Jeinsen .
Around this time , he also became a full - time political writer .
Junger was hostile to Weimar democracy and its commercial bourgeiose society .
His emerging political ideal was one of an elite warrior caste that stood above petty partisan politics and the middle class obsession with material acquisition .
Junger became involved with the the Stahlhelm , a right - wing veterans group , and was a contributer to its paper , Die Standardite .
He associated himself with the younger , more militant members of the organization who favored an uncompromised nationalist revolution and eschewed the parliamentary system .
Junger ’s weekly column in Die Standardite disseminated his nationalist ideology to his less educated readers .
Junger ’s views at this point were a mixture of Spengler , Social Darwinism , the traditionalist philosophy of the French rightist Maurice Barres , opposition to the internationalism of the left that had seemingly been discredited by the events of 1914 , irrationalism and anti-parliamentarianism .
He took a favorable view of the working class and praised the Nazis ’ efforts to win proletarian sympathies .
Junger also argued that a nationalist outlook need not be attached to one particular form of government , even suggesting that a liberal monarchy would be inferior to a nationalist republic .
( 12 )
In an essay for Die Standardite titled “ The Machine ” , Junger argued that the principal struggle was not between social classes or political parties but between man and technology .
He was not anti-technological in a Luddite sense , but regarded the technological apparatus of modernity to have achieved a position of superiority over mankind which needed to be reversed .
He was concerned that the mechanized efficiency of modern life produced a corrosive effect on the human spirit .
Junger considered the Nazis ’ glorification of peasant life to be antiquated .
Ever the realist , he believed the world of the rural people to be in a state of irreversible decline .
Instead , Junger espoused a “ metropolitan nationalism ” centered on the urban working class .
Nationalism was the antidote to the anti-particularist materialism of the Marxists who , in Junger ’s views , simply mirrored the liberals in their efforts to reduce the individual to a component of a mechanized mass society .
The humanitarian rhetoric of the left Junger dismissed as the hypocritical cant of power - seekers feigning benevolence .
He began to pin his hopes for a nationalist revolution on the younger veterans who comprised much of the urban working class .
In 1926 , Junger became editor of Arminius , which also featured the writings of Nazi leaders like Alfred Rosenberg and Joseph Goebbels .
In 1927 , he contributed his final article to the Nazi paper , calling for a new definition of the “ worker ” , one not rooted in Marxist ideology but the idea of the worker as a civilian counterpart to the soldier who struggles fervently for the nationalist ideal .
Junger and Hitler had exchanged copies of their respective writings and a scheduled meeting between the two was canceled due to a change in Hitler ’s itinerary .
Junger respected Hitler ’s abilities as an orator , but came to feel he lacked the ability to become a true leader .
He also found Nazi ideology to be intellectually shallow , many of the Nazi movement ’s leaders to be talentless and was displeased by the vulgarity , crassly opportunistic and overly theatrical aspects of Nazi public rallies .
Always an elitist , Junger considered the Nazis ’ pandering the common people to be debased .
As he became more skeptical of the Nazis , Junger began writing for a wider circle of readers beyond that of the militant nationalist right - wing .
His works began to appear in the Jewish liberal Leopold Schwarzchild ’s Das Tagebuch and the “ national - bolshevik ” Ernst Niekisch ’s Widerstand .
Junger began to assemble around himself an elite corps of bohemian , eccentric intellectuals who would meet regularly on Friday evenings .
This group included some of the most interesting personalities of the Weimar period .
Among them were the Freikorps veteran Ernst von Salomon , Otto von Strasser , who with his brother Gregor led a leftist anti-Hitler faction of the Nazi movement , the national - bolshevik Niekisch , the Jewish anarchist Erich Muhsam who had figured prominently in the early phase of the failed leftist revolution of 1918 , the American writer Thomas Wolfe and the expressionist writer Arnolt Bronnen .
Many among this group espoused a type of revolutionary socialism based on nationalism rather than class , disdaining the Nazis ’ opportunistic outreach efforts to the middle class .
Some , like Niekisch , favored an alliance between Germany and Soviet Russia against the liberal - capitalist powers of the West .
Occasionally , Joseph Goebbels would turn up at these meetings hoping to convert the group , particularly Junger himself , whose war writings he had admired , to the Nazi cause .
These efforts by the Nazi propaganda master proved unsuccessful .
Junger regarded Goebbels as a shallow ideologue who spoke in platitudes even in private conversation .
( 13 )
The final break between Ernst Junger and the NSDAP occurred in September 1929 .
Junger published an article in Schwarzchild ’s Tagebuch attacking and ridiculing the Nazis as sell outs for having reinvented themselves as a parliamentary party .
He also dismissed their racism and anti-Semitism as ridiculous , stating that according to the Nazis a nationalist is simply someone who “ eats three Jews for breakfast . ”
He condemned the Nazis for pandering to the liberal middle class and reactionary traditional conservatives “ with lengthy tirades against the decline in morals , against abortion , strikes , lockouts , and the reduction of police and military forces . ”
Goebbels responded by attacking Junger in the Nazi press , accusing him being motivated by personal literary ambition , and insisting this had caused him “ to vilify the national socialist movement , probably so as to make himself popular in his new kosher surroundings ” and dismissing Junger ’s attacks by proclaiming the Nazis did not “ debate with renegades who abuse us in the smutty press of Jewish traitors . ” ( 14 )
Junger on the Jewish Question
Junger held complicated views on the question of German Jews .
He considered anti-Semitism of the type espoused by Hitler to be crude and reactionary .
Yet his own version of nationalism required a level of homogeneity that was difficult to reconcile with the subnational status of Germany Jewry .
Junger suggested that Jews should assimilate and pledge their loyalty to Germany once and for all .
Yet he expressed admiration for Orthodox Judaism and indifference to Zionism .
Junger maintained personal friendships with Jews and wrote for a Jewish owned publication .
During this time his Jewish publisher Schwarzchild published an article examining Junger ’s views on the Jews of Germany .
Schwarzchild insisted that Junger was nothing like his Nazi rivals on the far right .
Junger ’s nationalism was based on an aristocratic warrior ethos , while Hitler ’s was more comparable to the criminal underworld .
Hitler ’s men were “ plebian alley scum ” .
However , Schwarzchild also characterized Junger ’s rendition of nationalism as motivated by little more than a fervent rejection of bourgeoise society and lacking in attention to political realities and serious economic questions .
( 15 )
The Worker
Other than In Storms of Steel , Junger ’s The Worker : Mastery and Form was his most influential work from the Weimar era .
Junger would later distance himself from this work , published in 1932 , and it was reprinted in the 1950s only after Junger was prompted to do so by Martin Heidegger .
In The Worker , Junger outlines his vision of a future state ordered as a technocracy based on workers and soldiers led by a warrior elite .
Workers are no longer simply components of an industrial machine , whether capitalist or communist , but have become a kind of civilian - soldier operating as an economic warrior .
Just as the soldier glories in his accomplishments in battle , so does the worker glory in the achievements expressed through his work .
Junger predicted that continued technological advancements would render the worker / capitalist dichotomy obsolete .
He also incorporated the political philosophy of his friend Carl Schmitt into his worldview .
As Schmitt saw international relations as a Hobbesian battle between rival powers , Junger believed each state would eventually adopt a system not unlike what he described in The Worker .
Each state would maintain its own technocratic order with the workers and soldiers of each country playing essentially the same role on behalf of their respective nations .
International affairs would be a crucible where the will to power of the different nations would be tested .
Junger ’s vision contains a certain amount prescience .
The general trend in politics at the time was a movement towards the kind of technocratic state Junger described .
These took on many varied forms including German National Socialism , Italian Fascism , Soviet Communism , the growing welfare states of Western Europe and America ’s New Deal .
Coming on the eve of World War Two , Junger ’s prediction of a global Hobbesian struggle between national collectives possessing previously unimagined levels of technological sophistication also seems rather prophetic .
Junger once again attacked the bourgeoise as anachronistic .
Its values of material luxury and safety he regarded as unfit for the violent world of the future . ( 16 )
The National Socialist Era
By the time Hitler took power in 1933 , Junger ’s war writings had become commonly used in high schools and universities as examples of wartime literature , and Junger enjoyed success within the context of German popular culture as well .
Excerpts of Junger ’s works were featured in military journals .
The Nazis tried to coopt his semi-celebrity status , but he was uncooperative .
Junger was appointed to the Nazified German Academcy of Poetry , but declined the position .
When the Nazi Party ’s paper published some of his work in 1934 , Junger wrote a letter of protest .
The Nazi regime , despite its best efforts to capitalize on his reputation , viewed Junger with suspicioun .
His past association with the national - bolshevik Ersnt Niekisch , the Jewish anarchist Erich Muhsam and the anti-Hitler Nazi Otto von Strasser , all of whom were either eventually killed or exiled by the Third Reich , led the Nazis to regard Junger as a potential subversive .
On several occasions , Junger received visits from the Gestapo in search of some of his former friends .
During the early years of the Nazi regime , Junger was in the fortunate position of being able to economically afford travel outside of Germany .
He journeyed to Norway , Brazil , Greece and Morocco during this time , and published several works based on his travels .
( 17 )
Junger ’s most significant work from the Nazi period is the novel On the Marble Cliffs .
The book is an allegorical attack on the Hitler regime .
It was written in 1939 , the same year that Junger reentered the German army .
The book describes a mysterious villian that threatens a community , a sinister warlord called the “ Head Ranger ” .
This character is never featured in the plot of the novel , but maintains a forboding presence that is universal ( much like “ Big Brother ” in George Orwell ’s 1984 ) .
Another character in the novel , “ Braquemart ” , is described as having physical characteristics remarkably similar to those of Goebbels .
The book sold fourteen thousand copies during its first two weeks in publication .
Swiss reviewers immediately recognized the allegorical references to the Nazi state in the novel .
The Nazi Party ’s organ , Volkische Beobachter , stated that Ernst Jünger was flirting with a bullet to the head .
Goebbels urged Hitler to ban the book , but Hitler refused , probably not wanting to show his hand .
Indeed , Hitler gave orders that Junger not be harmed .
( 18 )
Junger was stationed in France for most of the Second World War .
Once again , he kept diaries of the experience .
Once again , he expressed concern that he might not get to see any action before the war was over .
While Junger did not have the opportunity to experience the level of danger and daredevil heroics he had during the Great War , he did receive yet another medal , the Iron Cross , for retrieving the body of a dead corporal while under heavy fire .
Junger also published some of his war diaries during this time .
However , the German government took a dim view of these , viewing them as too sympathetic to the occupied French .
Junger ’s duties included censorship of the mail coming into France from German civilians .
He took a rather liberal approach to this responsibility and simply disposed of incriminating documents rather than turning them over for investigation .
In doing so , he probably saved lives .
He also encountered members of France ’s literary and cultural elite , among them the actor Louis Ferdinand Celine , a raving anti-Semite and pro-Vichyite who suggested Hitler ’s harsh measures against the Jews had not been heavy handed enough .
As rumors of the Nazi extermination programs began to spread , Junger wrote in his diary that the mechanization of the human spirit of the type he had written about in the past had apparently generated a higher level of human depravity .
When he saw three young French - Jewish girls wearing the yellow stars required by the Nazis , he wrote that he felt embarrassed to be in the Nazi army .
In July of 1942 , Junger observed the mass arrest of French Jews , the beginning of implementation of the “ Final Solution ” .
He described the scene as follows :
“ Parents were first separated from their children , so there was wailing to be heard in the streets .
At no moment may I forget that I am surrounded by the unfortunate , by those suffering to the very depths , else what sort of person , what sort of officer would I be ?
The uniform obliges one to grant protection wherever it goes .
Of course one has the impression that one must also , like Don Quixote , take on millions . ” ( 19 )
An entry into Junger ’s diary from October 16 , 1943 suggests that an unnamed army officer had told Junger about the use of crematoria and poison gas to murder Jews en masse .
Rumors of plots against Hitler circulated among the officers with whom Junger maintained contact .
His son , Ernstl , was arrested after an informant claimed he had spoken critically of Hitler .
Ernstl Junger was imprisoned for three months , then placed in a penal battalion where he was killed in action in Italy .
On July 20 , 1944 an unsuccessful assassination attempt was carried out against Hitler .
It is still disputed as to whether or not Junger knew of the plot or had a role in its planning .
Among those arrested for their role in the attemt on Hitler ’s life were members of Junger ’s immediate circle of associates and superior officers within the German army .
Junger was dishonorably discharged shortly afterward .
( 20 )
Following the close of the Second World War , Junger came under suspicion from the Allied occupational authorities because of his far right - wing nationalist and militarist past .
He refused to cooperate with the Allies De-Nazification programs and was barred from publishing for four years .
He would go on to live another half century , producing many more literary works , becoming a close friend of Albert Hoffman , the inventor of the hallucinogen LSD , with which he experimented .
In a 1977 novel , Eumeswil , he took his tendency towards viewing the world around him with detachment to a newer , more clearly articulated level with his invention of the concept of the “ Anarch ” .
This idea , heavily influenced by the writings of the early nineteenth century German philosopher Max Stirner , championed the solitary individual who remains true to himself within the context of whatever external circumstances happen to be present .
Some sample quotations from this work illustrate the philosophy and worldview of the elderly Junger quite well :
“ For the anarch , if he remains free of being ruled , whether by sovereign or society , this does not mean he refuses to serve in any way .
In general , he serves no worse than anyone else , and sometimes even better , if he likes the game .
He only holds back from the pledge , the sacrifice , the ultimate devotion … I serve in the Casbah ; if , while doing this , I die for the Condor , it would be an accident , perhaps even an obliging gesture , but nothing more . ”
“ The egalitarian mania of demagogues is even more dangerous than the brutality of men in gallooned coats .
For the anarch , this remains theoretical , because he avoids both sides .
Anyone who has been oppressed can get back on his feet if the oppression did not cost him his life .
A man who has been equalized is physically and morally ruined .
Anyone who is different is not equal ; that is one of the reasons why the Jews are so often targeted . ”
“ The anarch , recognizing no government , but not indulging in paradisal dreams as the anarchist does , is , for that very reason , a neutral observer . ”
“ Opposition is collaboration . ”
“ A basic theme for the anarch is how man , left to his own devices , can defy superior force – whether state , society or the elements – by making use of their rules without submitting to them . ”
“ … malcontents … prowl through the institutions eternally dissatisfied , always disappointed .
Connected with this is their love of cellars and rooftops , exile and prisons , and also banishment , on which they actually pride themselves .
When the structure finally caves in they are the first to be killed in the collapse .
Why do they not know that the world remains inalterable in change ?
Because they never find their way down to its real depth , their own .
That is the sole place of essence , safety .
And so they do themselves in . ”
“ The anarch may not be spared prisons – as one fluke of existence among others .
He will then find the fault in himself . ”
“ We are touching one a … distinction between anarch and anarchist ; the relation to authority , to legislative power .
The anarchist is their mortal enemy , while the anarch refuses to acknowledge them .
He seeks neither to gain hold of them , nor to topple them , nor to alter them – their impact bypasses him .
He must resign himself only to the whirlwinds they generate . ”
“ The anarch is no individualist , either .
He wishes to present himself neither as a Great Man nor as a Free Spirit .
His own measure is enough for him ; freedom is not his goal ; it is his property .
He does not come on as foe or reformer : one can get along nicely with him in shacks or in palaces .
Life is too short and too beautiful to sacrifice for ideas , although contamination is not always avoidable .
But hats off to the martyrs . ”
“ We can expect as little from society as from the state .
Salvation lies in the individual . ” ( 21 )

8. Maurice Barrès ( September 22 , 1862 – December 4 , 1923 ) was a French novelist , journalist , an anti-semite , nationalist politician and agitator .
Leaning towards the far - left in his youth as a Boulangist deputy , he progressively developed a theory close to Romantic nationalism and shifted to the right during the Dreyfus Affair , leading the Anti-Dreyfusards alongside Charles Maurras .
In 1906 , he was elected both to the Académie française and as deputy of the Seine department , and until his death he sat with the conservative Entente républicaine démocratique .
A strong supporter of the Union sacrée( Holy Union ) during World War I , Barrès remained a major influence of generations of French writers , as well as of monarchists , although he was not a monarchist himself .

How does our spiritual identity affect our actions and how we shape our world ?
Modus Operandi
When I think of the “ spirit ” of something I think of its modus operandi ; what is its “ method of operating ? ”
What makes it function ?
What drives it to work ?
When I think of the spirit of a human being , I ask myself , “ What does that being live for ? ”
What makes him or her get up every morning ?
What makes his or her life worth living ?
What source of energy does that person draw upon to do what they do ?
Unspoken Values
Evolution and biology can describe the reasons behind a lot of basic instincts and behavior , but they do n’t answer a whole lot about the values we hold implicitly through our traditions , customs , culture , and art .
We all go through rituals that define our existence .
It could be watching TV , going to church , reading books , meditating , playing sports , doing your job , eating , videogames , working out at the gym , writing , taking care of your kids … you get the point – if you do it periodically then it is a ritual – and these habits implicitly tell us what we value out of life .
But how often do you ask yourself , “ Why do I do the things I do ? ”
It can seem like a stupid question because we take these things for granted .
Maybe you do them because you have always done them and that is just who you are .
I hear people give me that response a lot , but that is circular reasoning ; saying those things only reinforces who we are , even if that modus operandi is n’t doing ourselves much justice .
Backbone = Identity
I would n’t say that our actions define ourselves ( although that might be a behaviorist approach to identity ) , but I do think how we define ourselves plays a significant role in our actions .
Buddism and many Eastern philosophies put a strong emphasis on the “ nature of self ” as a spiritual guide .
They also recognize that how we think of our self determines certain values we hold about our world .
For example , many schools of Buddhism recognize a non-dualistic nature between self / other ( that we are all interconnected and no one is separate ) , thus compassion and loving - kindness become logical moral values to hold in our relationships with friends , family , neighbors , coworkers other acquaintances , and nature itself .
Some of the big questions regarding anybody ’s life are ,
“ How do I fit into the world at large ? ”
“ What purpose do I serve in life ? ”
“ How can I improve conditions for myself and others ? ”
Only you can answer these questions with your own reason and experience , but let it be known that your answers have a profound impact on how you live your life .
Thus , I would argue these questions are worth contemplating through daily introspection , meditation , or prayer .
Getting Off The Soapbox For A Moment
Before I conclude this post let me just clear up a few things that often get misunderstood when I write about spirituality .
I do not intend to change anyone ’s values or how they live their life .
What I am suggesting is that we take the time to question why we live the way we do .
It is a deep question , directed towards you , but not one that I can provide the answers for .
I think when we try to make a change or improvement in our lives we often take the most basic questions for granted .
But often those fundamental questions are the catalysts for the biggest improvements one can make in their life .
I write in order to get people thinking and re-evaluating that world which we take for granted .
I want to bring into light implicit assumptions and beliefs , and get individuals to think critically about these ideas they have grown up with all their life .
Through doing this individuals can grow a stronger backbone , become more dedicated to what they actually love to do , and drop actions which have become “ no good ” habits of familiarity that we have wrongly identified to .
But – because we are all diverse individuals with separate interests and talents – it is up to each from their own individual perspective to decide what is right and wrong for them .
There is no objective good for everyone ; our traditions , culture , art , and tastes ( our “ pursuit of happiness ” ) should be particular to our personality .
We should not take anything as given just because we have grown up with it or some higher authority has “ bestowed ” it upon us .
Even the values I hold implicitly in my writings should be doubted and questioned .
A Healthy Backbone Builds New Elements , Gets Rid Of Old
A spiritual backbone gives you a center to stand on but it is not necessarily fixed in one place .
Just like your spine is built of various bone elements , your spiritual spine too is mobile and multi-faceted .
The only thing different is your spiritual spine never stops growing and evolving in new ways ( whether you are conscious of it or not ) .
Your relationship with the world is never fixed , it is always changing ; new aspects are constantly arising and fading into the ever - expanding shape of time .
From a day - to - day basis things may seem to be moving slow , but when you reflect on months or years they can seem like eternities apart .
The world is actually a really exciting and dynamic place if we keep our eyes open to it .
Not many things remain the same over extended periods of time .
Is n’t that what evolution is all about ?
The only thing worse than not having a spiritual backbone at all is having a concrete one , which refuses to change in the face of new evidence and experience .
Extreme fundamentalists from all religions share this illness , like when biblical literalism takes precedence over scientifically - gathered facts .
Man is not omniscient nor infallible , that is why God forgives and , most importantly , why we should forgive ourselves .
All actions and creations of men , including the Bible , are not perfect .
This is why spirituality in all of its form is a never - ending process and not a goal - seeking one .
Living In Congruence
When our unspoken values become spoken we are more conscious of the driving forces in our world .
Now we know why we get up every morning and we are proud to live out our lives in congruences with those values .
This requires a higher level of consciousness .
No longer is our modus operandi like a puppet on strings , but now we are the puppet masters .
We understand the reason behind our rituals ; we do n’t just live them out obediently but with a sense of joy , flow , and engagement .
There is purpose behind every action .
We embody what we believe and we act in accordance .
As Gandhi once said , we “ Become the change we wish to see in the world . ”
Within that cycle , within every action , we are constantly being born and re-born into a different world .
So do n’t stay static , never be afraid to re-align your spiritual backbone , and keep living the life you want to live ( as you see fit ) .
The world depends on your moral courage and aptitude .

Alex 's creators hope to target the 12 million Britons who are not PC users .
People confused and frustrated by computers can now turn to a laptop called Alex built just for them .
Based on Linux , the laptop comes with simplified e-mail , web browsing , image editing and office software .
Those who sign up for Alex pay £ 39.95 a month for telephone support , software updates and broadband access .
Its creators hope the laptop and its simple suite of software proves to be a popular alternative to the Windows and Mac operating systems .
" Alex is not designed as a super - computer , " said Barney Morrison - Lyons , head of technology at The Broadband Computer Company which is behind Alex .
" We 're not buying into the current computer market . "
If this ambitious plan succeeds it could play an important role in bringing Linux - based operating systems to a much wider public
Rory Cellan- Jones
BBC 's technology correspondent
Read Rory 's thoughts in full
The idea behind Alex was to make using a computer a " simple and enjoyable " experience , said Andy Hudson , one of the founders of the company .
Subscribers to Alex receive a USB stick which contains user - encrypted data and enables them to log on to their desktop from any Alex computer .
For their monthly fee , customers also get anti-virus software and 10 GB of storage space on the Broadband Computer Company 's servers .
Broadband is supplied by Southampton - based ISP Murphx .
More than £ 2.5 m has been invested in developing the product , the company claims .
" We 're the little guy , we know that , " said co-founder Harry Drnec , who is credited with turning the energy drink company Red Bull into a profitable business in the UK .
Back to basics
As well as communication tools such as e-mail , Alex comes loaded with a suite of open office software including applications compatible with Microsoft 's Excel and PowerPoint file formats .
The desktop is more comprehensive than that of Simplicity , a computer aimed at older people launched by TV presenter Valerie Singleton in 2009 .
Mr Hudson said the company also intends to launch an application store for Alex for customers who want to add more features and functions to their computer .
" People who love Linux will be keen to develop for this , " he said .
The BBC 's technology correspondent Rory Cellan - Jones said that Alex was an ambitious concept .
" Alex is trying to do three things : win new people over to the internet , introduce a new - and more expensive - way of using computers , and take on the might of Microsoft , " he said .
" If the company succeeds it will be a huge boost for the cause of Linux computing . "

Only about one in 10 prostate cancers detected by screening actually poses a threat to a man 's life , according to a new analysis conducted by researchers from the University if Cambridge .
The findings come from a preliminary analysis of data from the ongoing Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment trial ( ProtecT ) , funded by the United Kingdom 's Department of Health .
Under ProtecT , approximately 250,000 men between the ages of 50 and 69 are undergoing prostate cancer screening and analysis .
Only 10 percent of the men being screened had elevated levels of the prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) , which is considered a marker of cancer risk .
ProtecT comes as the United Kingdom considers implementing a nationwide prostate cancer screening program .
Yet because the majority of prostate cancers are slow - growing and may never pose a threat to a man 's life , growing numbers of medical professionals are questioning this plan .
Prostate cancer treatment can carry severe side effects , including impotence and incontinence .
Preliminary analysis of the ProtecT data shows that 25 percent of men with elevated PSA levels ( roughly 2.5 percent of males in the study ) had some form of prostate cancer .
This means that if the United Kingdom implements population - wide screening , 160,000 cases of cancer will be detected each year , in comparison with the current 30,000 .
Neal notes that this is what happened when PSA testing became widespread in the United States .
" There was an epidemic of prostate cancer in America , " he said .
" The number of cases virtually tripled in five years . "
Yet the ProtecT data show that only 12 percent of detected prostate cancers had spread beyond the prostate gland , indicating a dangerous form of the disease .
" What we do n't want to do is to treat a man at 65 who is destined to die at 85 of a stroke , " researcher David E. Neal said .

No , it is not a plot from the next crime tv series or a Hollywood movie , but what happened with a Flordia woman , Paula Eileen Carroll .
On July 18 , 1975 she was sentenced to 5 years at Florida Correctional Institution — now Lowell Correctional Institution — in Ocala on the charges of theft .
She and fellow inmate escaped on September 3 1975 .
The other inmate was quickly captured .
Paula assumed the identity of of a living woman in West Virginia .
Acting on an anonymous tip , the Brevard County Sheriff ’s Office quietly arrested Carroll at 9 a.m.
Tuesday , her 56th birthday , outside the Melbourne home where she has lived since 1986 , according to property records .
As her alias , Carroll used the name and Social Security number of a living woman in West Virginia .
” We thought we knew her good .
Then this happens , ” said Joe Massimini , who lives three houses down Albert Drive from Carroll ’s home .
“ The way she helped people , I never thought this would be possible . ”
In 1975 Paula Eileen Carroll was sentenced to five years in a Florida prison on charges of theft .
Carroll , 21 Source : www.floridatoday.com
She is supposed to finish the remainder of her sentence and any additional sentence due to the escape .
It does make you think about the main reason for prison time .
Is it as a punishment or something to keep you away from society till you can reform .
If it is the later , then she should be given a shorter sentence .
A lot of you have e-mailed me to note that Virginia governor Bob McDonnell has decided to honor those who fought to preserve , and extend , white supremacy .
I do n't really have much to say .
The GOP is , effectively , the party of willfully unlettered Utopians .
It is the party of choice for those who believe global warming is a hoax , that humans roamed the earth with dinosaurs , and that homosexuals should work harder at not being gay .
That the party of unadulterated quackery also believes that Birth Of A Nation is more true to the Civil War than Battle Cry Of Freedom , is to be expected .
Ignorance does not respect boundaries .
It is , at times , qualified and those who know more , often struggle to say more .
But people who believe that the Census is actually a covert attempt to put Americans in concentration camps , are also likely to believe that slavery was incidental to the Civil War .
This is who they are -- the proud and ignorant .
If you believe that if we still had segregation we would n't " have had all these problems , " this is the movement for you .
If you believe that your president is a Muslim sleeper agent , this is the movement for you .
If you honor a flag raised explicitly to destroy this country then this is the movement for you .
If you flirt with secession , even now , then this movement is for you .
If you are a " Real American " with no demonstrable interest in " Real America " then , by God , this movement of alchemists and creationists , of anti-science and hair tonic , is for you .
Two young men were drinking rum on a downtown Oakland street , angry at life and looking for someone to punch , before they happened on a San Francisco man who had come to town with his father to shop , prosecutors said Thursday .
Lavonte Drummer and Dominic Davis , both 18 and Oakland residents , were charged with murder in connection with what authorities called a random , unprovoked attack on the son on April 16 and the subsequent fatal beating of his father , Tian Sheng Yu , 59 , of San Francisco .
Although there has been speculation that the attack was motivated in part by race - Drummer and Davis are African American , and the elder Yu was a Chinese immigrant - Chief Deputy District Attorney Tom Rogers said the suspects could have sucker - punched anyone who crossed their path on Telegraph Avenue near the Fox Theater .
He said there was no evidence the attack was a hate crime .
Rogers painted a picture of the defendants as thugs with juvenile arrest records who were killing time on a Friday afternoon by sharing a bottle of Bacardi rum and grousing about their lives .
Drummer in particular , he said , was " frustrated by personal circumstances . "
" Drummer stated that he had anger and frustration over his life and planned on hitting someone , " police wrote in a statement that outlined grounds for the arrests .
Shopping for coins
It was random bad luck , Rogers said , that brought Yu and his son , Jin Cheng Yu , 27 , into contact with the two as they were on their way to shop for coins at a jewelry store .
The son was the first victim , being sucker - punched by Drummer as the elder
Yu was parking his car , Rogers said .
Tian Sheng
Yu approached the two men and , in Mandarin , demanded an explanation .
He " gestured to both suspects with his finger , but did not touch either suspect , " the police statement said .
Video of the attack shows Drummer punching the elder
Yu with his right hand , Rogers said .
Davis then hit him with a left hook , authorities said .
Tian Sheng
Yu " appeared dazed for just an instant , and fell straight backward and hit his head " on the concrete , Rogers said .
Son steps in
Jin Cheng
Yu moved in and was punched by both attackers .
The younger Yu returned punches , and both he and Drummer fell to the sidewalk , authorities said .
Witnesses then chased the attackers away .
Tian Sheng
Yu never regained consciousness and died Tuesday of a skull fracture and a brain injury .
A subsequent outpouring of tips , including some from people who knew the suspects and recognized them from a video released by police , led to the men's arrests , investigators said .
Drummer and Davis appeared before Judge Robert McGuiness of Alameda County Superior Court but did not enter a plea .
They are being held without bail .
Among those attending Thursday 's hearing were Police Chief Anthony Batts , Jin Cheng Yu and his mother , Zhi Rui Wang , 56 .
Oakland Chinatown organizer Carl Chan , speaking on the family 's behalf , said they were saddened by their loss and that their " hearts go out to the families of the two young men . "
" True justice is no more violence , " Chan said .
In deciding against filing hate crime charges , prosecutors noted that the men's criminal histories did not appear to include racial overtones .
Drummer has a felony assault conviction as a juvenile for punching a 55 - year - old African American man from behind at an Oakland convenience store in September 2009 .
The victim hit his head on the pavement , lost consciousness and had to have seven stitches , Rogers said .
Both Davis and Drummer were arrested in April 2007 for allegedly trying to rob a 31 - year - old white man in Berkeley .
They were released to their parents because charges were never filed .
Donington Park has revealed that it has set a target of August to re-open circuit activities following the aborted plan to host the British Grand Prix .
Simon Gillett 's Donington Ventures Leisure Ltd had secured a 17 year deal to take the event to the East Midlands venue , but the plans lurched from one disaster to the next before DVLL entered administration in November and British GP moved back to Silverstone .
The aborted plans have left the famous Donington circuit in a state of disrepair and have seen numerous championships - including the British Superbike Championship - elect to take its races elsewhere as questions continued to be raised about the future of the venue .
With the likes of the BARC and Jonathan Palmer 's MotorSport Vision group having been linked with taking over the circuit , Donington owners the Wheatcroft family have now revealed that a target date of August has been set to reopen the venue for on - track activities .
Plans and costings to carry out the remedial work required are currently being worked out , with project advisors led by ex-Aggregate Industries director Philip Barltrop and Duncan Green of Pick Everard Consulting Engineers , having held meetings with John Symes of the MSA .
" We are currently finalising plans and costings for the works to repair the damage done in and around the race track at Donington Park , " Kevin Wheatcroft said .
" We are confident that the new improved race track can be re-opened , subject to obtaining the necessary racing licences , during August 2010 . "
The statement from the circuit also revealed that race director Robert Fearnall is already working on an appropriate race programme for 2010 which will be announced as soon as possible .
The British Touring Car Championship is due to visit Donington Park for the penultimate rounds of the season in September - with series director Alan Gow stating on more than one occasion that he was confident the event would take place - while the British GT Championship season finale is slated to take place the following month .
The announcement from Donington comes on the same day that Silverstone officially launched the new Arena circuit which will host the British Grand Prix later this year .
Like a lot of states stuck in long - term economic goo , Ohio is pushing for more public funding for the shift from old dead technological industries to a bright , shining future of …taxpayer - financed industries .
To wit , the pay - for - itself " Third Frontier " initiative which only apparently needs $ 1.2 billion in public bonds to get the high - tech party started :
Ohioans face the choice whether to authorize $ 700 million in bonds for the program , extending the $ 500 million bond issue approved in 2005 .
Backers of the initiative claim that already the Third Frontier has generated almost $ 7 billion in " economic impact " and " a nearly $ 10 return on every dollar of State investment " ( page 9 in PDF ) .
You know , if that 's plausible , then why the hell would n't they tell voters to quintuple down on the damn program ?
Like a lot of states , Ohio is dead - broke , with a current $ 3.2 billion budget deficit .
That 's for all sorts of obvious reasons ( such as massive and growing pension and health - care commitments , overspending on all sorts of non-core businesses , funding B.S. development programs such as " Third Frontier , " etc. ) and for some less - obvious reasons .
A big one ?
The mentality that is summed up in the following statement by the owner of the Cincinnati Reds , Bob Castellini , a big supporter of the " Third Frontier " :
" This is a no - brainer , " said produce - company owner Castellini , calling himself an advocate of limited government who is " about as free market as it gets . "
" Ohio needs to transform from an old - school manufacturing state to a technology - based economy , " he said .
And what better way to do it than get the public to pay for it ?
If they do n't , Ohio might have to woo new businessess the old - fashioned way : via lower taxes , less regulation , a decently edumicated workforce ( try vouchers ! ) , decent infrastructure ( a rare good the state might oversee ) , and other less - glamorous activities than shoveling grants at businessmen .
More here .
You know what else was a no - brainer ?
The deal the Reds got for their newish stadium , which opened in 2003 :
Owner : City of Cincinnati and Hamilton County
Cost : $ 325 million
Public financing : $ 280 million , or 86 percent , primarily from a half - cent - per - dollar sales tax increase approved by the voters in 1996
Private financing : $ 45 million , or 14 percent , primarily from a naming rights deal with Great American Insurance Company
Lease : 35 years ( 2003 - 2037 ) ; $ 2.5 million annually for the first 9 years ;
One dollar annually for the final 26 years ;
The Reds keep all revenue generated by the ballpark .
I 'd like to humbly submit that whosoever calls himself " as free market as it gets " and backs these sorts of public fleecings of the economy does n't understand the meaning of the term " free market . "

The Temporary Autonomous Zone , Ontological Anarchy , Poetic Terrorism
By Hakim Bey
THE TEMPORARY AUTONOMOUS ZONE
“ … this time however I come as the victorious Dionysus , who will turn the world into a holiday … Not that I have much time … ”
– Nietzsche ( from his last “ insane ” letter to Cosima Wagner ) Part 3
Pirate Utopias
THE SEA - ROVERS AND CORSAIRS of the 18th century created an “ information network ” that spanned the globe : primitive and devoted primarily to grim business , the net nevertheless functioned admirably .
Scattered throughout the net were islands , remote hideouts where ships could be watered and provisioned , booty traded for luxuries and necessities .
Some of these islands supported “ intentional communities , ” whole mini-societies living consciously outside the law and determined to keep it up , even if only for a short but merry life .
Some years ago I looked through a lot of secondary material on piracy hoping to find a study of these enclaves – but it appeared as if no historian has yet found them worthy of analysis .
( William Burroughs has mentioned the subject , as did the late British anarchist Larry Law–but no systematic research has been carried out . )
I retreated to primary sources and constructed my own theory , some aspects of which will be discussed in this essay .
I called the settlements “ Pirate Utopias . ” Recently Bruce Sterling , one of the leading exponents of Cyberpunk science fiction , published a near - future romance based on the assumption that the decay of political systems will lead to a decentralized proliferation of experiments in living : giant worker - owned corporations , independent enclaves devoted to “ data piracy , ” Green - Social - Democrat enclaves , Zerowork enclaves , anarchist liberated zones , etc .
The information economy which supports this diversity is called the Net ; the enclaves ( and the book 's title ) are Islands in the Net .
The medieval Assassins founded a “ State ” which consisted of a network of remote mountain valleys and castles , separated by thousands of miles , strategically invulnerable to invasion , connected by the information flow of secret agents , at war with all governments , and devoted only to knowledge .
Modern technology , culminating in the spy satellite , makes this kind of autonomy a romantic dream .
No more pirate islands !
In the future the same technology – freed from all political control–could make possible an entire world of autonomous zones .
But for now the concept remains precisely science fiction–pure speculation .
Are we who live in the present doomed never to experience autonomy , never to stand for one moment on a bit of land ruled only by freedom ?
Are we reduced either to nostalgia for the past or nostalgia for the future ?
Must we wait until the entire world is freed of political control before even one of us can claim to know freedom ?
Logic and emotion unite to condemn such a supposition .
Reason demands that one cannot struggle for what one does not know ; and the heart revolts at a universe so cruel as to visit such injustices on our generation alone of humankind .
To say that “ I will not be free till all humans ( or all sentient creatures ) are free ” is simply to cave in to a kind of nirvana - stupor , to abdicate our humanity , to define ourselves as losers .
I believe that by extrapolating from past and future stories about “ islands in the net ” we may collect evidence to suggest that a certain kind of “ free enclave ” is not only possible in our time but also existent .
All my research and speculation has crystallized around the concept of the TEMPORARY AUTONOMOUS ZONE ( hereafter abbreviated TAZ ) .
Despite its synthesizing force for my own thinking , however , I do n't intend the TAZ to be taken as more than an essay ( “ attempt ” ) , a suggestion , almost a poetic fancy .
Despite the occasional Ranterish enthusiasm of my language I am not trying to construct political dogma .
In fact I have deliberately refrained from defining the TAZ–I circle around the subject , firing off exploratory beams .
In the end the TAZ is almost self - explanatory .
If the phrase became current it would be understood without difficulty … understood in action .
Part 3
Waiting for the Revolution
HOW IS IT THAT “ the world turned upside - down ” always manages to Right itself ?
Why does reaction always follow revolution , like seasons in Hell ?
Uprising , or the Latin form insurrection , are words used by historians to label failed revolutions –movements which do not match the expected curve , the consensus - approved trajectory : revolution , reaction , betrayal , the founding of a stronger and even more oppressive State – the turning of the wheel , the return of history again and again to its highest form : jackboot on the face of humanity forever .
By failing to follow this curve , the up - rising suggests the possibility of a movement outside and beyond the Hegelian spiral of that “ progress ” which is secretly nothing more than a vicious circle .
Surgo–rise up , surge .
Insurgo–rise up , raise oneself up .
A bootstrap operation .
A goodbye to that wretched parody of the karmic round , historical revolutionary futility .
The slogan “ Revolution ! ” has mutated from tocsin to toxin , a malign pseudo - Gnostic fate - trap , a nightmare where no matter how we struggle we never escape that evil Aeon , that incubus the State , one State after another , every “ heaven ” ruled by yet one more evil angel .
If History IS “ Time , ” as it claims to be , then the uprising is a moment that springs up and out of Time , violates the “ law ” of History .
If the State IS History , as it claims to be , then the insurrection is the forbidden moment , an unforgivable denial of the dialectic–shimmying up the pole and out of the smokehole , a shaman 's maneuver carried out at an “ impossible angle ” to the universe .
History says the Revolution attains “ permanence , ” or at least duration , while the uprising is “ temporary . ”
In this sense an uprising is like a “ peak experience ” as opposed to the standard of “ ordinary ” consciousness and experience .
Like festivals , uprisings cannot happen every day–otherwise they would not be “ nonordinary . ”
But such moments of intensity give shape and meaning to the entirety of a life .
The shaman returns –you can't stay up on the roof forever – but things have changed , shifts and integrations have occurred–a difference is made .
You will argue that this is a counsel of despair .
What of the anarchist dream , the Stateless state , the Commune , the autonomous zone with duration , a free society , a free culture ?
Are we to abandon that hope in return for some existentialist acte gratuit ?
The point is not to change consciousness but to change the world .
I accept this as a fair criticism .
I 'd make two rejoinders nevertheless ; first , revolution has never yet resulted in achieving this dream .
The vision comes to life in the moment of uprising –but as soon as “ the Revolution ” triumphs and the State returns , the dream and the ideal are already betrayed .
I have not given up hope or even expectation of change–but I distrust the word Revolution .
Second , even if we replace the revolutionary approach with a concept of insurrection blossoming spontaneously into anarchist culture , our own particular historical situation is not propitious for such a vast undertaking .
Absolutely nothing but a futile martyrdom could possibly result now from a head - on collision with the terminal State , the megacorporate information State , the empire of Spectacle and Simulation .
Its guns are all pointed at us , while our meager weaponry finds nothing to aim at but a hysteresis , a rigid vacuity , a Spook capable of smothering every spark in an ectoplasm of information , a society of capitulation ruled by the image of the Cop and the absorbent eye of the TV screen .
In short , we 're not touting the TAZ as an exclusive end in itself , replacing all other forms of organization , tactics , and goals .
We recommend it because it can provide the quality of enhancement associated with the uprising without necessarily leading to violence and martyrdom .
The TAZ is like an uprising which does not engage directly with the State , a guerilla operation which liberates an area ( of land , of time , of imagination ) and then dissolves itself to re-form elsewhere / elsewhen , before the State can crush it .
Because the State is concerned primarily with Simulation rather than substance , the TAZ can “ occupy ” these areas clandestinely and carry on its festal purposes for quite a while in relative peace .
Perhaps certain small TAZs have lasted whole lifetimes because they went unnoticed , like hillbilly enclaves –because they never intersected with the Spectacle , never appeared outside that real life which is invisible to the agents of Simulation .
Babylon takes its abstractions for realities ; precisely within this margin of error the TAZ can come into existence .
Getting the TAZ started may involve tactics of violence and defense , but its greatest strength lies in its invisibility –the State cannot recognize it because History has no definition of it .
As soon as the TAZ is named ( represented , mediated ) , it must vanish , it will vanish , leaving behind it an empty husk , only to spring up again somewhere else , once again invisible because undefinable in terms of the Spectacle .
The TAZ is thus a perfect tactic for an era in which the State is omnipresent and all - powerful and yet simultaneously riddled with cracks and vacancies .
And because the TAZ is a microcosm of that “ anarchist dream ” of a free culture , I can think of no better tactic by which to work toward that goal while at the same time experiencing some of its benefits here and now .
In sum , realism demands not only that we give up waiting for “ the Revolution ” but also that we give up wanting it .
“ Uprising , ” yes–as often as possible and even at the risk of violence .
The spasming of the Simulated State will be “ spectacular , ” but in most cases the best and most radical tactic will be to refuse to engage in spectacular violence , to withdraw from the area of simulation , to disappear .
The TAZ is an encampment of guerilla ontologists : strike and run away .
Keep moving the entire tribe , even if it 's only data in the Web .
The TAZ must be capable of defense ; but both the “ strike ” and the “ defense ” should , if possible , evade the violence of the State , which is no longer a meaningful violence .
The strike is made at structures of control , essentially at ideas ; the defense is “ invisibility , ” a martial art , and “ invulnerability ” –an “ occult ” art within the martial arts .
The “ nomadic war machine ” conquers without being noticed and moves on before the map can be adjusted .
As to the future–Only the autonomous can plan autonomy , organize for it , create it .
It 's a bootstrap operation .
The first step is somewhat akin to satori–the realization that the TAZ begins with a simple act of realization .
( Note : See Appendix C , quote by Renzo Novatore ) Part 3
The Psychotopology of Everyday Life
THE CONCEPT OF THE TAZ arises first out of a critique of Revolution , and an appreciation of the Insurrection .
The former labels the latter a failure ; but for us uprising represents a far more interesting possibility , from the standard of a psychology of liberation , than all the “ successful ” revolutions of bourgeoisie , communists , fascists , etc .
The second generating force behind the TAZ springs from the historical development I call “ the closure of the map . ”
The last bit of Earth unclaimed by any nation - state was eaten up in 1899 .
Ours is the first century without terra incognita , without a frontier .
Nationality is the highest principle of world governance –not one speck of rock in the South Seas can be left open , not one remote valley , not even the Moon and planets .
This is the apotheosis of “ territorial gangsterism . ”
Not one square inch of Earth goes unpoliced or untaxed … in theory .
The “ map ” is a political abstract grid , a gigantic con enforced by the carrot / stick conditioning of the “ Expert ” State , until for most of us the map becomes the territory - - no longer “ Turtle Island , ” but “ the USA . ”
And yet because the map is an abstraction it cannot cover Earth with 1:1 accuracy .
Within the fractal complexities of actual geography the map can see only dimensional grids .
Hidden enfolded immensities escape the measuring rod .
The map is not accurate ; the map cannot be accurate .
So–Revolution is closed , but insurgency is open .
For the time being we concentrate our force on temporary “ power surges , ” avoiding all entanglements with “ permanent solutions . ”
And –the map is closed , but the autonomous zone is open .
Metaphorically it unfolds within the fractal dimensions invisible to the cartography of Control .
And here we should introduce the concept of psychotopology ( and - topography ) as an alternative “ science ” to that of the State 's surveying and mapmaking and “ psychic imperialism . ”
Only psychotopography can draw 1:1 maps of reality because only the human mind provides sufficient complexity to model the real .
But a 1:1 map cannot “ control ” its territory because it is virtually identical with its territory .
It can only be used to suggest , in a sense gesture towards , certain features .
We are looking for “ spaces ” ( geographic , social , cultural , imaginal ) with potential to flower as autonomous zones–and we are looking for times in which these spaces are relatively open , either through neglect on the part of the State or because they have somehow escaped notice by the mapmakers , or for whatever reason .
Psychotopology is the art of dowsing for potential TAZs .
The closures of Revolution and of the map , however , are only the negative sources of the TAZ ; much remains to be said of its positive inspirations .
Reaction alone cannot provide the energy needed to “ manifest ” a TAZ .
An uprising must be for something as well .
1 . First , we can speak of a natural anthropology of the TAZ .
The nuclear family is the base unit of consensus society , but not of the TAZ .
( “ Families ! –how I hate them !
the misers of love ! ” – Gide )
The nuclear family , with its attendant “ oedipal miseries , ” appears to have been a Neolithic invention , a response to the “ agricultural revolution ” with its imposed scarcity and its imposed hierarchy .
The Paleolithic model is at once more primal and more radical : the band .
The typical hunter / gatherer nomadic or semi- nomadic band consists of about 50 people .
Within larger tribal societies the band - structure is fulfilled by clans within the tribe , or by sodalities such as initiatic or secret societies , hunt or war societies , gender societies , “ children 's republics , ” and so on .
If the nuclear family is produced by scarcity ( and results in miserliness ) , the band is produced by abundance–and results in prodigality .
The family is closed , by genetics , by the male 's possession of women and children , by the hierarchic totality of agricultural / industrial society .
The band is open–not to everyone , of course , but to the affinity group , the initiates sworn to a bond of love .
The band is not part of a larger hierarchy , but rather part of a horizontal pattern of custom , extended kinship , contract and alliance , spiritual affinities , etc. ( American Indian society preserves certain aspects of this structure even now . )
In our own post - Spectacular Society of Simulation many forces are working –largely invisibly –to phase out the nuclear family and bring back the band .
Breakdowns in the structure of Work resonate in the shattered “ stability ” of the unit - home and unit -family .
One 's “ band ” nowadays includes friends , ex-spouses and lovers , people met at different jobs and pow - wows , affinity groups , special interest networks , mail networks , etc .
The nuclear family becomes more and more obviously a trap , a cultural sinkhole , a neurotic secret implosion of split atoms–and the obvious counter - strategy emerges spontaneously in the almost unconscious rediscovery of the more archaic and yet more post - industrial possibility of the band .
2 . The TAZ as festival .
Stephen Pearl Andrews once offered , as an image of anarchist society , the dinner party , in which all structure of authority dissolves in conviviality and celebration ( see Appendix C ) .
Here we might also invoke Fourier and his concept of the senses as the basis of social becoming –“ touch - rut ” and “ gastrosophy , ” and his paean to the neglected implications of smell and taste .
The ancient concepts of jubilee and saturnalia originate in an intuition that certain events lie outside the scope of “ profane time , ” the measuring - rod of the State and of History .
These holidays literally occupied gaps in the calendar–intercalary intervals .
By the Middle Ages , nearly a third of the year was given over to holidays .
Perhaps the riots against calendar reform had less to do with the “ eleven lost days ” than with a sense that imperial science was conspiring to close up these gaps in the calendar where the people 's freedoms had accumulated–a coup d'etat , a mapping of the year , a seizure of time itself , turning the organic cosmos into a clockwork universe .
The death of the festival .
Participants in insurrection invariably note its festive aspects , even in the midst of armed struggle , danger , and risk .
The uprising is like a saturnalia which has slipped loose ( or been forced to vanish ) from its intercalary interval and is now at liberty to pop up anywhere or when .
Freed of time and place , it nevertheless possesses a nose for the ripeness of events , and an affinity for the genius loci ; the science of psychotopology indicates “ flows of forces ” and “ spots of power ” ( to borrow occultist metaphors ) which localize the TAZ spatio - temporally , or at least help to define its relation to moment and locale .
The media invite us to “ come celebrate the moments of your life ” with the spurious unification of commodity and spectacle , the famous non-event of pure representation .
In response to this obscenity we have , on the one hand , the spectrum of refusal ( chronicled by the Situationists , John Zerzan , Bob Black et al. ) –and on the other hand , the emergence of a festal culture removed and even hidden from the would - be managers of our leisure .
“ Fight for the right to party ” is in fact not a parody of the radical struggle but a new manifestation of it , appropriate to an age which offers TVs and telephones as ways to “ reach out and touch ” other human beings , ways to “ Be There ! ” Pearl Andrews was right : the dinner party is already “ the seed of the new society taking shape within the shell of the old ” ( IWW Preamble ) .
The sixties - style “ tribal gathering , ” the forest conclave of eco-saboteurs , the idyllic Beltane of the neo-pagans , anarchist conferences , gay faery circles …
Harlem rent parties of the twenties , nightclubs , banquets , old - time libertarian picnics–we should realize that all these are already “ liberated zones ” of a sort , or at least potential TAZs .
Whether open only to a few friends , like a dinner party , or to thousands of celebrants , like a Be - In , the party is always “ open ” because it is not “ ordered ” ; it may be planned , but unless it “ happens ” it 's a failure .
The element of spontaneity is crucial .
The essence of the party : face - to - face , a group of humans synergize their efforts to realize mutual desires , whether for good food and cheer , dance , conversation , the arts of life ; perhaps even for erotic pleasure , or to create a communal artwork , or to attain the very transport of bliss– in short , a “ union of egoists ” ( as Stirner put it ) in its simplest form–or else , in Kropotkin 's terms , a basic biological drive to “ mutual aid . ”
( Here we should also mention Bataille 's “ economy of excess ” and his theory of potlatch culture . )
3 . Vital in shaping TAZ reality is the concept of psychic nomadism ( or as we jokingly call it , “ rootless cosmopolitanism ” ) .
Aspects of this phenomenon have been discussed by Deleuze and Guattari in Nomadology and the War Machine , by Lyotard in Driftworks and by various authors in the “ Oasis ” issue of Semiotext ( e ) .
We use the term “ psychic nomadism ” here rather than “ urban nomadism , ” “ nomadology , ” “ driftwork , ” etc. , simply in order to garner all these concepts into a single loose complex , to be studied in light of the coming - into - being of the TAZ .
“ The death of God , ” in some ways a de-centering of the entire “ European ” project , opened a multi- perspectived post - ideological worldview able to move “ rootlessly ” from philosophy to tribal myth , from natural science to Taoism– able to see for the first time through eyes like some golden insect 's , each facet giving a view of an entirely other world .
But this vision was attained at the expense of inhabiting an epoch where speed and “ commodity fetishism ” have created a tyrannical false unity which tends to blur all cultural diversity and individuality , so that “ one place is as good as another . ”
This paradox creates “ gypsies , ” psychic travellers driven by desire or curiosity , wanderers with shallow loyalties ( in fact disloyal to the “ European Project ” which has lost all its charm and vitality ) , not tied down to any particular time and place , in search of diversity and adventure …
This description covers not only the X - class artists and intellectuals but also migrant laborers , refugees , the “ homeless , ” tourists , the RV and mobile - home culture –also people who “ travel ” via the Net , but may never leave their own rooms ( or those like Thoreau who “ have travelled much–in Concord ” ) ; and finally it includes “ everybody , ” all of us , living through our automobiles , our vacations , our TVs , books , movies , telephones , changing jobs , changing “ lifestyles , ” religions , diets , etc. , etc. Psychic nomadism as a tactic , what Deleuze & Guattari metaphorically call “ the war machine , ” shifts the paradox from a passive to an active and perhaps even “ violent ” mode .
“ God ” 's last throes and deathbed rattles have been going on for such a long time –in the form of Capitalism , Fascism , and Communism , for example –that there 's still a lot of “ creative destruction ” to be carried out by post - Bakuninist post - Nietzschean commandos or apaches ( literally “ enemies ” ) of the old Consensus .
These nomads practice the razzia , they are corsairs , they are viruses ; they have both need and desire for TAZs , camps of black tents under the desert stars , interzones , hidden fortified oases along secret caravan routes , “ liberated ” bits of jungle and bad - land , no - go areas , black markets , and underground bazaars .
These nomads chart their courses by strange stars , which might be luminous clusters of data in cyberspace , or perhaps hallucinations .
Lay down a map of the land ; over that , set a map of political change ; over that , a map of the Net , especially the counter - Net with its emphasis on clandestine information - flow and logistics–and finally , over all , the 1:1 map of the creative imagination , aesthetics , values .
The resultant grid comes to life , animated by unexpected eddies and surges of energy , coagulations of light , secret tunnels , surprises .
Part 3
The Net and the Web
THE NEXT FACTOR CONTRIBUTING to the TAZ is so vast and ambiguous that it needs a section unto itself .
We 've spoken of the Net , which can be defined as the totality of all information and communication transfer .
Some of these transfers are privileged and limited to various elites , which gives the Net a hierarchic aspect .
Other transactions are open to all–so the Net has a horizontal or non-hierarchic aspect as well .
Military and Intelligence data are restricted , as are banking and currency information and the like .
But for the most part the telephone , the postal system , public data banks , etc. are accessible to everyone and anyone .
Thus within the Net there has begun to emerge a shadowy sort of counter - Net , which we will call the Web ( as if the Net were a fishing - net and the Web were spider - webs woven through the interstices and broken sections of the Net ) .
Generally we 'll use the term
Web to refer to the alternate horizontal open structure of info - exchange , the non-hierarchic network , and reserve the term counter - Net to indicate clandestine illegal and rebellious use of the Web , including actual data - piracy and other forms of leeching off the Net itself .
Net , Web , and counter - Net are all parts of the same whole pattern - complex–they blur into each other at innumerable points .
The terms are not meant to define areas but to suggest tendencies .
( Digression : Before you condemn the Web or counter - Net for its “ parasitism , ” which can never be a truly revolutionary force , ask yourself what “ production ” consists of in the Age of Simulation .
What is the “ productive class ” ?
Perhaps you 'll be forced to admit that these terms seem to have lost their meaning .
In any case the answers to such questions are so complex that the TAZ tends to ignore them altogether and simply picks up what it can use .
“ Culture is our Nature ” – and we are the thieving magpies , or the hunter / gatherers of the world of CommTech . )
The present forms of the unofficial Web are , one must suppose , still rather primitive : the marginal zine network , the BBS networks , pirated software , hacking , phone - phreaking , some influence in print and radio , almost none in the other big media–no TV stations , no satellites , no fiber - optics , no cable , etc. , etc .
However the Net itself presents a pattern of changing / evolving relations between subjects ( “ users ” ) and objects ( “ data ” ) .
The nature of these relations has been exhaustively explored , from McLuhan to Virilio .
It would take pages and pages to “ prove ” what by now “ everyone knows . ”
Rather than rehash it all , I am interested in asking how these evolving relations suggest modes of implementation for the TAZ .
The TAZ has a temporary but actual location in time and a temporary but actual location in space .
But clearly it must also have “ location ” in the Web , and this location is of a different sort , not actual but virtual , not immediate but instantaneous .
The Web not only provides logistical support for the TAZ , it also helps to bring it into being ; crudely speaking one might say that the TAZ “ exists ” in information - space as well as in the “ real world . ”
The Web can compact a great deal of time , as data , into an infinitesimal “ space . ”
We have noted that the TAZ , because it is temporary , must necessarily lack some of the advantages of a freedom which experiences duration and a more - or - less fixed locale .
But the Web can provide a kind of substitute for some of this duration and locale–it can inform the TAZ , from its inception , with vast amounts of compacted time and space which have been “ subtilized ” as data .
At this moment in the evolution of the Web , and considering our demands for the “ face - to - face ” and the sensual , we must consider the Web primarily as a support system , capable of carrying information from one TAZ to another , of defending the TAZ , rendering it “ invisible ” or giving it teeth , as the situation might demand .
But more than that :
If the TAZ is a nomad camp , then the Web helps provide the epics , songs , genealogies and legends of the tribe ; it provides the secret caravan routes and raiding trails which make up the flowlines of tribal economy ; it even contains some of the very roads they will follow , some of the very dreams they will experience as signs and portents .
The Web does not depend for its existence on any computer technology .
Word - of - mouth , mail , the marginal zine network , “ phone trees , ” and the like already suffice to construct an information webwork .
The key is not the brand or level of tech involved , but the openness and horizontality of the structure .
Nevertheless , the whole concept of the Net implies the use of computers .
In the SciFi imagination the Net is headed for the condition of Cyberspace ( as in Tron or Neuromancer ) and the pseudo - telepathy of “ virtual reality . ”
As a Cyberpunk fan I can't help but envision “ reality hacking ” playing a major role in the creation of TAZs .
Like Gibson and Sterling I am assuming that the official Net will never succeed in shutting down the Web or the counter - Net–that data - piracy , unauthorized transmissions and the free flow of information can never be frozen .
( In fact , as I understand it , chaos theory predicts that any universal Control - system is impossible . )
However , leaving aside all mere speculation about the future , we must face a very serious question about the Web and the tech it involves .
The TAZ desires above all to avoid mediation , to experience its existence as immediate .
The very essence of the affair is “ breast - to - breast ” as the sufis say , or face - to - face .
But , BUT : the very essence of the Web is mediation .
Machines here are our ambassadors –the flesh is irrelevant except as a terminal , with all the sinister connotations of the term .
The TAZ may perhaps best find its own space by wrapping its head around two seemingly contradictory attitudes toward Hi- Tech and its apotheosis the Net : ( 1 ) what we might call the Fifth Estate / Neo- Paleolithic Post - Situ Ultra - Green position , which construes itself as a luddite argument against mediation and against the Net ; and ( 2 ) the Cyberpunk utopianists , futuro - libertarians , Reality Hackers and their allies who see the Net as a step forward in evolution , and who assume that any possible ill effects of mediation can be overcome–at least , once we 've liberated the means of production .
The TAZ agrees with the hackers because it wants to come into being –in part–through the Net , even through the mediation of the Net .
But it also agrees with the greens because it retains intense awareness of itself as body and feels only revulsion for CyberGnosis , the attempt to transcend the body through instantaneity and simulation .
The TAZ tends to view the Tech / anti-Tech dichotomy as misleading , like most dichotomies , in which apparent opposites turn out to be falsifications or even hallucinations caused by semantics .
This is a way of saying that the TAZ wants to live in this world , not in the idea of another world , some visionary world born of false unification ( all green OR all metal ) which can only be more pie in the sky by - & - by ( or as Alice put it , “ Jam yesterday or jam tomorrow , but never jam today ” ) .
The TAZ is “ utopian ” in the sense that it envisions an intensification of everyday life , or as the Surrealists might have said , life 's penetration by the Marvelous .
But it can not be utopian in the actual meaning of the word , nowhere , or NoPlace Place .
The TAZ is somewhere .
It lies at the intersection of many forces , like some pagan power - spot at the junction of mysterious ley - lines , visible to the adept in seemingly unrelated bits of terrain , landscape , flows of air , water , animals .
But now the lines are not all etched in time and space .
Some of them exist only “ within ” the Web , even though they also intersect with real times and places .
Perhaps some of the lines are “ non-ordinary ” in the sense that no convention for quantifying them exists .
These lines might better be studied in the light of chaos science than of sociology , statistics , economics , etc .
The patterns of force which bring the TAZ into being have something in common with those chaotic “ Strange Attractors ” which exist , so to speak , between the dimensions .
The TAZ by its very nature seizes every available means to realize itself–it will come to life whether in a cave or an L - 5 Space City–but above all it will live , now , or as soon as possible , in however suspect or ramshackle a form , spontaneously , without regard for ideology or even anti- ideology .
It will use the computer because the computer exists , but it will also use powers which are so completely unrelated to alienation or simulation that they guarantee a certain psychic paleolithism to the TAZ , a primordial - shamanic spirit which will “ infect ” even the Net itself ( the true meaning of Cyberpunk as I read it ) .
Because the TAZ is an intensification , a surplus , an excess , a potlatch , life spending itself in living rather than merely surviving ( that snivelling shibboleth of the eighties ) , it can not be defined either by Tech or anti-Tech .
It contradicts itself like a true despiser of hobgoblins , because it wills itself to be , at any cost in damage to “ perfection , ” to the immobility of the final .
In the Mandelbrot Set and its computer - graphic realization we watch–in a fractal universe–maps which are embedded and in fact hidden within maps within maps etc. to the limits of computational power .
What is it for , this map which in a sense bears a 1:1 relation with a fractal dimension ?
What can one do with it , other than admire its psychedelic elegance ?
If we were to imagine an information map–a cartographic projection of the Net in its entirety –we would have to include in it the features of chaos , which have already begun to appear , for example , in the operations of complex parallel processing , telecommunications , transfers of electronic “ money , ” viruses , guerilla hacking and so on .
Each of these “ areas ” of chaos could be represented by topographs similar to the Mandelbrot Set , such that the “ peninsulas ” are embedded or hidden within the map–such that they seem to “ disappear . ”
This “ writing ” –parts of which vanish , parts of which efface themselves –represents the very process by which the Net is already compromised , incomplete to its own view , ultimately un-Controllable .
In other words , the M Set , or something like it , might prove to be useful in “ plotting ” ( in all senses of the word ) the emergence of the counterNet as a chaotic process , a “ creative evolution ” in Prigogine 's term .
If nothing else the M Set serves as a metaphor for a “ mapping ” of the TAZ 's interface with the Net as a disappearance of information .
Every “ catastrophe ” in the Net is a node of power for the Web , the counter - Net .
The Net will be damaged by chaos , while the Web may thrive on it .
Whether through simple data - piracy , or else by a more complex development of actual rapport with chaos , the Web - hacker , the cybernetician of the TAZ , will find ways to take advantage of perturbations , crashes , and breakdowns in the Net ( ways to make information out of “ entropy ” ) .
As a bricoleur , a scavenger of information shards , smuggler , blackmailer , perhaps even cyberterrorist , the TAZ - hacker will work for the evolution of clandestine fractal connections .
These connections , and the different information that flows among and between them , will form “ power outlets ” for the coming - into - being of the TAZ itself - - as if one were to steal electricity from the energy - monopoly to light an abandoned house for squatters .
Thus the Web , in order to produce situations conducive to the TAZ , will parasitize the Net–but we can also conceive of this strategy as an attempt to build toward the construction of an alternative and autonomous Net , “ free ” and no longer parasitic , which will serve as the basis for a “ new society emerging from the shell of the old . ”
The counter - Net and the TAZ can be considered , practically speaking , as ends in themselves –but theoretically they can also be viewed as forms of struggle toward a different reality .
Having said this we must still admit to some qualms about computers , some still unanswered questions , especially about the Personal Computer .
The story of computer networks , BBSs and various other experiments in electro - democracy has so far been one of hobbyism for the most part .
Many anarchists and libertarians have deep faith in the PC as a weapon of liberation and self - liberation – but no real gains to show , no palpable liberty .
I have little interest in some hypothetical emergent entrepreneurial class of self - employed data / word processors who will soon be able to carry on a vast cottage industry or piecemeal shitwork for various corporations and bureaucracies .
Moreover it takes no ESP to foresee that this “ class ” will develop its underclass–a sort of lumpen yuppetariat : housewives , for example , who will provide their families with “ second incomes ” by turning their own homes into electro - sweatshops , little Work - tyrannies where the “ boss ” is a computer network .
Also I am not impressed by the sort of information and services proffered by contemporary “ radical ” networks .
Somewhere–one is told –there exists an “ information economy . ”
Maybe so ; but the info being traded over the “ alternative ” BBSs seems to consist entirely of chitchat and techie - talk .
Is this an economy ?
or merely a pastime for enthusiasts ?
OK , PCs have created yet another “ print revolution ” –OK , marginal webworks are evolving –OK , I can now carry on six phone conversations at once .
But what difference has this made in my ordinary life ?
Frankly , I already had plenty of data to enrich my perceptions , what with books , movies , TV , theater , telephones , the U.S. Postal Service , altered states of consciousness , and so on .
Do I really need a PC in order to obtain yet more such data ?
You offer me secret information ?
Well … perhaps
I 'm tempted–but still I demand marvelous secrets , not just unlisted telephone numbers or the trivia of cops and politicians .
Most of all I want computers to provide me with information linked to real goods –“ the good things in life , ” as the IWW Preamble puts it .
And here , since I 'm accusing the hackers and BBSers of irritating intellectual vagueness , I must myself descend from the baroque clouds of Theory & Critique and explain what I mean by “ real goods . ”
Let 's say that for both political and personal reasons I desire good food , better than I can obtain from Capitalism– unpolluted food still blessed with strong and natural flavors .
To complicate the game imagine that the food I crave is illegal–raw milk perhaps , or the exquisite Cuban fruit mamey , which cannot be imported fresh into the U.S. because its seed is hallucinogenic ( or so I 'm told ) .
I am not a farmer .
Let 's pretend I 'm an importer of rare perfumes and aphrodisiacs , and sharpen the play by assuming most of my stock is also illegal .
Or maybe I only want to trade word processing services for organic turnips , but refuse to report the transaction to the IRS ( as required by law , believe it or not ) .
Or maybe I want to meet other humans for consensual but illegal acts of mutual pleasure ( this has actually been tried , but all the hard - sex BBSs have been busted–and what use is an underground with lousy security ? ) .
In short , assume that I 'm fed up with mere information , the ghost in the machine .
According to you , computers should already be quite capable of facilitating my desires for food , drugs , sex , tax evasion .
So what 's the matter ?
Why is n't it happening ?
The TAZ has occurred , is occurring , and will occur with or without the computer .
But for the TAZ to reach its full potential it must become less a matter of spontaneous combustion and more a matter of “ islands in the Net . ”
The Net , or rather the counter - Net , assumes the promise of an integral aspect of the TAZ , an addition that will multiply its potential , a “ quantum jump ” ( odd how this expression has come to mean a big leap ) in complexity and significance .
The TAZ must now exist within a world of pure space , the world of the senses .
Liminal , even evanescent , the TAZ must combine information and desire in order to fulfill its adventure ( its “ happening ” ) , in order to fill itself to the borders of its destiny , to saturate itself with its own becoming .
Perhaps the Neo- Paleolithic School are correct when they assert that all forms of alienation and mediation must be destroyed or abandoned before our goals can be realized –or perhaps true anarchy will be realized only in Outer Space , as some futuro - libertarians assert .
But the TAZ does not concern itself very much with “ was ” or “ will be . ”
The TAZ is interested in results , successful raids on consensus reality , breakthroughs into more intense and more abundant life .
If the computer can not be used in this project , then the computer will have to be overcome .
My intuition however suggests that the counter - Net is already coming into being , perhaps already exists –but I can not prove it .
I 've based the theory of the TAZ in large part on this intuition .
Of course the Web also involves non-computerized networks of exchange such as samizdat , the black market , etc. –but the full potential of non-hierarchic information networking logically leads to the computer as the tool par excellence .
Now I 'm waiting for the hackers to prove I 'm right , that my intuition is valid .
Where are my turnips ?
Part 3
" Gone to Croatan "
WE HAVE NO DESIRE to define the TAZ or to elaborate dogmas about how it must be created .
Our contention is rather that it has been created , will be created , and is being created .
Therefore it would prove more valuable and interesting to look at some TAZs past and present , and to speculate about future manifestations ; by evoking a few prototypes we may be able to gauge the potential scope of the complex , and perhaps even get a glimpse of an “ archetype . ”
Rather than attempt any sort of encyclopaedism we 'll adopt a scatter - shot technique , a mosaic of glimpses , beginning quite arbitrarily with the 16th - 17th centuries and the settlement of the New World .
The opening of the “ new ” world was conceived from the start as an occultist operation .
The magus John Dee , spiritual advisor to Elizabeth I , seems to have invented the concept of “ magical imperialism ” and infected an entire generation with it .
Halkyut and Raleigh fell under his spell , and Raleigh used his connections with the “ School of Night ” –a cabal of advanced thinkers , aristocrats , and adepts–to further the causes of exploration , colonization and mapmaking .
The Tempest was a propaganda - piece for the new ideology , and the Roanoke Colony was its first showcase experiment .
The alchemical view of the New World associated it with materia prima or hyle , the “ state of Nature , ” innocence and all - possibility ( “ Virgin -ia ” ) , a chaos or inchoateness which the adept would transmute into “ gold , ” that is , into spiritual perfection as well as material abundance .
But this alchemical vision is also informed in part by an actual fascination with the inchoate , a sneaking sympathy for it , a feeling of yearning for its formless form which took the symbol of the “ Indian ” for its focus : “ Man ” in the state of nature , uncorrupted by “ government . ”
Caliban , the Wild Man , is lodged like a virus in the very machine of Occult Imperialism ; the forest / animal / humans are invested from the very start with the magic power of the marginal , despised and outcaste .
On the one hand Caliban is ugly , and Nature a “ howling wilderness ” –on the other , Caliban is noble and unchained , and Nature an Eden .
This split in European consciousness predates the Romantic / Classical dichotomy ; it 's rooted in Renaissance High Magic .
The discovery of America ( Eldorado , the Fountain of Youth ) crystallized it ; and it precipitated in actual schemes for colonization .
We were taught in elementary school that the first settlements in Roanoke failed ; the colonists disappeared , leaving behind them only the cryptic message “ Gone To Croatan . ”
Later reports of “ grey - eyed Indians ” were dismissed as legend .
What really happened , the textbook implied , was that the Indians massacred the defenseless settlers .
However , “ Croatan ” was not some Eldorado ; it was the name of a neighboring tribe of friendly Indians .
Apparently the settlement was simply moved back from the coast into the Great Dismal Swamp and absorbed into the tribe .
And the grey - eyed Indians were real–they 're still there , and they still call themselves Croatans .
So –the very first colony in the New World chose to renounce its contract with Prospero ( Dee / Raleigh / Empire ) and go over to the Wild Men with Caliban .
They dropped out .
They became “ Indians , ” “ went native , ” opted for chaos over the appalling miseries of serfing for the plutocrats and intellectuals of London .
As America came into being where once there had been “ Turtle Island , ” Croatan remained embedded in its collective psyche .
Out beyond the frontier , the state of Nature ( i.e. no State ) still prevailed –and within the consciousness of the settlers the option of wildness always lurked , the temptation to give up on Church , farmwork , literacy , taxes– all the burdens of civilization–and “ go to Croatan ” in some way or another .
Moreover , as the Revolution in England was betrayed , first by Cromwell and then by Restoration , waves of Protestant radicals fled or were transported to the New World ( which had now become a prison , a place of exile ) .
Antinomians , Familists , rogue Quakers , Levellers , Diggers , and Ranters were now introduced to the occult shadow of wildness , and rushed to embrace it .
Anne Hutchinson and her friends were only the best known ( i.e. the most upper - class ) of the Antinomians –having had the bad luck to be caught up in Bay Colony politics –but a much more radical wing of the movement clearly existed .
The incidents Hawthorne relates in “ The Maypole of Merry Mount ” are thoroughly historical ; apparently the extremists had decided to renounce Christianity altogether and revert to paganism .
If they had succeeded in uniting with their Indian allies the result might have been an Antinomian / Celtic / Algonquin syncretic religion , a sort of 17th century North American Santeria .
Sectarians were able to thrive better under the looser and more corrupt administrations in the Caribbean , where rival European interests had left many islands deserted or even unclaimed .
Barbados and Jamaica in particular must have been settled by many extremists , and I believe that Levellerish and Ranterish influences contributed to the Buccaneer “ utopia ” on Tortuga .
Here for the first time , thanks to Esquemelin , we can study a successful New World proto - TAZ in some depth .
Fleeing from hideous “ benefits ” of Imperialism such as slavery , serfdom , racism and intolerance , from the tortures of impressment and the living death of the plantations , the Buccaneers adopted Indian ways , intermarried with Caribs , accepted blacks and Spaniards as equals , rejected all nationality , elected their captains democratically , and reverted to the “ state of Nature . ”
Having declared themselves “ at war with all the world , ” they sailed forth to plunder under mutual contracts called “ Articles ” which were so egalitarian that every member received a full share and the Captain usually only 1 1/4 or 1 1/2 shares .
Flogging and punishments were forbidden– quarrels were settled by vote or by the code duello .
It is simply wrong to brand the pirates as mere sea-going highwaymen or even proto- capitalists , as some historians have done .
In a sense they were “ social bandits , ” although their base communities were not traditional peasant societies but “ utopias ” created almost ex nihilo in terra incognita , enclaves of total liberty occupying empty spaces on the map .
After the fall of Tortuga , the Buccaneer ideal remained alive all through the “ Golden Age ” of Piracy ( ca. 1660 - 1720 ) , and resulted in land - settlements in Belize , for example , which was founded by Buccaneers .
Then , as the scene shifted to Madagascar–an island still unclaimed by any imperial power and ruled only by a patchwork of native kings ( chiefs ) eager for pirate allies –the Pirate Utopia reached its highest form .
Defoe 's account of Captain Mission and the founding of Libertatia may be , as some historians claim , a literary hoax meant to propagandize for radical Whig theory – but it was embedded in The General History of the Pyrates ( 1724 - 28 ) , most of which is still accepted as true and accurate .
Moreover the story of Capt .
Mission was not criticized when the book appeared and many old Madagascar hands still survived .
They seem to have believed it , no doubt because they had experienced pirate enclaves very much like Libertatia .
Once again , rescued slaves , natives , and even traditional enemies such as the Portuguese were all invited to join as equals .
( Liberating slave ships was a major preoccupation . )
Land was held in common , representatives elected for short terms , booty shared ; doctrines of liberty were preached far more radical than even those of Common Sense .
Libertatia hoped to endure , and Mission died in its defense .
But most of the pirate utopias were meant to be temporary ; in fact the corsairs ' true “ republics ” were their ships , which sailed under Articles .
The shore enclaves usually had no law at all .
The last classic example , Nassau in the Bahamas , a beachfront resort of shacks and tents devoted to wine , women ( and probably boys too , to judge by Birge 's Sodomy and Piracy ) , song ( the pirates were inordinately fond of music and used to hire on bands for entire cruises ) , and wretched excess , vanished overnight when the British fleet appeared in the Bay .
Blackbeard and “ Calico Jack ” Rackham and his crew of pirate women moved on to wilder shores and nastier fates , while others meekly accepted the Pardon and reformed .
But the Buccaneer tradition lasted , both in Madagascar where the mixed - blood children of the pirates began to carve out kingdoms of their own , and in the Caribbean , where escaped slaves as well as mixed black / white / red groups were able to thrive in the mountains and backlands as “ Maroons . ”
The Maroon community in Jamaica still retained a degree of autonomy and many of the old folkways when Zora Neale Hurston visited there in the 1920's ( see Tell My Horse ) .
The Maroons of Suriname still practice African “ paganism . ”
Throughout the 18th century , North America also produced a number of drop - out “ tri-racial isolate communities . ”
( This clinical - sounding term was invented by the Eugenics Movement , which produced the first scientific studies of these communities .
Unfortunately the “ science ” merely served as an excuse for hatred of racial “ mongrels ” and the poor , and the “ solution to the problem ” was usually forced sterilization . )
The nuclei invariably consisted of runaway slaves and serfs , “ criminals ” ( i.e. the very poor ) , “ prostitutes ” ( i.e. white women who married non-whites ) , and members of various native tribes .
In some cases , such as the Seminole and Cherokee , the traditional tribal structure absorbed the newcomers ; in other cases , new tribes were formed .
Thus we have the Maroons of the Great Dismal Swamp , who persisted through the 18th and 19th centuries , adopting runaway slaves , functioning as a way station on the Underground Railway , and serving as a religious and ideological center for slave rebellions .
The religion was HooDoo , a mixture of African , native , and Christian elements , and according to the historian H. Leaming - Bey the elders of the faith and the leaders of the Great Dismal Maroons were known as “ the Seven Finger High Glister . ”
The Ramapaughs of northern New Jersey ( incorrectly known as the “ Jackson Whites ” ) present another romantic and archetypal genealogy : freed slaves of the Dutch poltroons , various Delaware and Algonquin clans , the usual “ prostitutes , ” the “ Hessians ” ( a catch - phrase for lost British mercenaries , drop - out Loyalists , etc. ) , and local bands of social bandits such as Claudius Smith's .
An African - Islamic origin is claimed by some of the groups , such as the Moors of Delaware and the Ben Ishmaels , who migrated from Kentucky to Ohio in the mid-18th century .
The Ishmaels practiced polygamy , never drank alcohol , made their living as minstrels , intermarried with Indians and adopted their customs , and were so devoted to nomadism that they built their houses on wheels .
Their annual migration triangulated on frontier towns with names like Mecca and Medina .
In the 19th century some of them espoused anarchist ideals , and they were targeted by the Eugenicists for a particularly vicious pogrom of salvation - by - extermination .
Some of the earliest Eugenics laws were passed in their honor .
As a tribe they “ disappeared ” in the 1920's , but probably swelled the ranks of early “ Black Islamic ” sects such as the Moorish Science Temple .
I myself grew up on legends of the “ Kallikaks ” of the nearby New Jersey Pine Barrens ( and of course on Lovecraft , a rabid racist who was fascinated by the isolate communities ) .
The legends turned out to be folk - memories of the slanders of the Eugenicists , whose U.S. headquarters were in Vineland , NJ , and who undertook the usual “ reforms ” against “ miscegenation ” and “ feeblemindedness ” in the Barrens ( including the publication of photographs of the Kallikaks , crudely and obviously retouched to make them look like monsters of misbreeding ) .
The “ isolate communities ” –at least , those which have retained their identity into the 20th century –consistently refuse to be absorbed into either mainstream culture or the black “ subculture ” into which modern sociologists prefer to categorize them .
In the 1970's , inspired by the Native American renaissance , a number of groups –including the Moors and the Ramapaughs–applied to the B.I.A. for recognition as Indian tribes .
They received support from native activists but were refused official status .
If they 'd won , after all , it might have set a dangerous precedent for drop - outs of all sorts , from “ white Peyotists ” and hippies to black nationalists , aryans , anarchists and libertarians – a “ reservation ” for anyone and everyone !
The “ European Project ” cannot recognize the existence of the Wild Man– green chaos is still too much of a threat to the imperial dream of order .
Essentially the Moors and Ramapaughs rejected the “ diachronic ” or historical explanation of their origins in favor of a “ synchronic ” self - identity based on a “ myth ” of Indian adoption .
Or to put it another way , they named themselves “ Indians . ”
If everyone who wished “ to be an Indian ” could accomplish this by an act of self - naming , imagine what a departure to Croatan would take place .
That old occult shadow still haunts the remnants of our forests ( which , by the way , have greatly increased in the Northeast since the 18 - 19th century as vast tracts of farmland return to scrub .
Thoreau on his deathbed dreamed of the return of “ … Indians … forests … ” : the return of the repressed ) .
The Moors and Ramapaughs of course have good materialist reasons to think of themselves as Indians–after all , they have Indian ancestors–but if we view their self - naming in “ mythic ” as well as historical terms we 'll learn more of relevance to our quest for the TAZ .
Within tribal societies there exist what some anthropologists call mannenbunden : totemic societies devoted to an identity with “ Nature ” in the act of shapeshifting , of becoming the totem - animal ( werewolves , jaguar shamans , leopard men , cat - witches , etc. ) .
In the context of an entire colonial society ( as Taussig points out in Shamanism , Colonialism and the Wild Man ) the shapeshifting power is seen as inhering in the native culture as a whole– thus the most repressed sector of the society acquires a paradoxical power through the myth of its occult knowledge , which is feared and desired by the colonist .
Of course the natives really do have certain occult knowledge ; but in response to Imperial perception of native culture as a kind of “ spiritual wild ( er ) ness , ” the natives come to see themselves more and more consciously in that role .
Even as they are marginalized , the Margin takes on an aura of magic .
Before the whiteman , they were simply tribes of people–now , they are “ guardians of Nature , ” inhabitants of the “ state of Nature . ”
Finally the colonist himself is seduced by this “ myth . ”
Whenever an American wants to drop out or back into Nature , invariably he “ becomes an Indian . ”
The Massachusetts radical democrats ( spiritual descendents of the radical Protestants ) who organized the Tea Party , and who literally believed that governments could be abolished ( the whole Berkshire region declared itself in a “ state of Nature ” ! ) , disguised themselves as “ Mohawks . ”
Thus the colonists , who suddenly saw themselves marginalized vis-·- vis the motherland , adopted the role of the marginalized natives , thereby ( in a sense ) seeking to participate in their occult power , their mythic radiance .
From the Mountain Men to the Boy Scouts , the dream of “ becoming an Indian ” flows beneath myriad strands of American history , culture and consciousness .
The sexual imagery connected to “ tri-racial ” groups also bears out this hypothesis .
“ Natives ” of course are always immoral , but racial renegades and drop - outs must be downright polymorphous - perverse .
The Buccaneers were buggers , the Maroons and Mountain Men were miscegenists , the “ Jukes and Kallikaks ” indulged in fornication and incest ( leading to mutations such as polydactyly ) , the children ran around naked and masturbated openly , etc. , etc. Reverting to a “ state of Nature ” paradoxically seems to allow for the practice of every “ unnatural ” act ; or so it would appear if we believe the Puritans and Eugenicists .
And since many people in repressed moralistic racist societies secretly desire exactly these licentious acts , they project them outwards onto the marginalized , and thereby convince themselves that they themselves remain civilized and pure .
And in fact some marginalized communities do really reject consensus morality –the pirates certainly did ! –and no doubt actually act out some of civilization 's repressed desires .
( Would n't you ? )
Becoming “ wild ” is always an erotic act , an act of nakedness .
Before leaving the subject of the “ tri-racial isolates , ” I 'd like to recall Nietzsche 's enthusiasm for “ race mixing . ”
Impressed by the vigor and beauty of hybrid cultures , he offered miscegenation not only as a solution to the problem of race but also as the principle for a new humanity freed of ethnic and national chauvinism–a precursor to the “ psychic nomad , ” perhaps .
Nietzsche 's dream still seems as remote now as it did to him .
Chauvinism still rules OK .
Mixed cultures remain submerged .
But the autonomous zones of the Buccaneers and Maroons , Ishmaels and Moors , Ramapaughs and “ Kallikaks ” remain , or their stories remain , as indications of what Nietzsche might have called “ the Will to Power as Disappearance . ”
We must return to this theme .
Part 3
Music as an Organizational Principle
MEANWHILE , HOWEVER , WE TURN to the history of classical anarchism in the light of the TAZ concept .
Before the “ closure of the map , ” a good deal of anti- authoritarian energy went into “ escapist ” communes such as Modern Times , the various Phalansteries , and so on .
Interestingly , some of them were not intended to last “ forever , ” but only as long as the project proved fulfilling .
By Socialist / Utopian standards these experiments were “ failures , ” and therefore we know little about them .
When escape beyond the frontier proved impossible , the era of revolutionary urban Communes began in Europe .
The Communes of Paris , Lyons and Marseilles did not survive long enough to take on any characteristics of permanence , and one wonders if they were meant to .
From our point of view the chief matter of fascination is the spirit of the Communes .
During and after these years anarchists took up the practice of revolutionary nomadism , drifting from uprising to uprising , looking to keep alive in themselves the intensity of spirit they experienced in the moment of insurrection .
In fact , certain anarchists of the Stirnerite / Nietzschean strain came to look on this activity as an end in itself , a way of always occupying an autonomous zone , the interzone which opens up in the midst or wake of war and revolution ( cf. Pynchon 's “ zone ” in Gravity 's Rainbow ) .
They declared that if any socialist revolution succeeded , they'd be the first to turn against it .
Short of universal anarchy they had no intention of ever stopping .
In Russia in 1917 they greeted the free Soviets with joy : this was their goal .
But as soon as the Bolsheviks betrayed the Revolution , the individualist anarchists were the first to go back on the warpath .
After Kronstadt , of course , all anarchists condemned the “ Soviet Union ” ( a contradiction in terms ) and moved on in search of new insurrections .
Makhno's Ukraine and anarchist Spain were meant to have duration , and despite the exigencies of continual war both succeeded to a certain extent : not that they lasted a “ long time , ” but they were successfully organized and could have persisted if not for outside aggression .
Therefore , from among the experiments of the inter - War period I 'll concentrate instead on the madcap Republic of Fiume , which is much less well known , and was not meant to endure .
Gabriele D'Annunzio , Decadent poet , artist , musician , aesthete , womanizer , pioneer daredevil aeronautist , black magician , genius and cad , emerged from World War I as a hero with a small army at his beck and command : the “ Arditi . ”
At a loss for adventure , he decided to capture the city of Fiume from Yugoslavia and give it to Italy .
After a necromantic ceremony with his mistress in a cemetery in Venice he set out to conquer Fiume , and succeeded without any trouble to speak of .
But Italy turned down his generous offer ; the Prime Minister called him a fool .
In a huff , D'Annunzio decided to declare independence and see how long he could get away with it .
He and one of his anarchist friends wrote the Constitution , which declared music to be the central principle of the State .
The Navy ( made up of deserters and Milanese anarchist maritime unionists ) named themselves the Uscochi , after the long - vanished pirates who once lived on local offshore islands and preyed on Venetian and Ottoman shipping .
The modern Uscochi succeeded in some wild coups : several rich Italian merchant vessels suddenly gave the Republic a future : money in the coffers !
Artists , bohemians , adventurers , anarchists ( D'Annunzio corresponded with Malatesta ) , fugitives and Stateless refugees , homosexuals , military dandies ( the uniform was black with pirate skull - &- crossbones–later stolen by the SS ) , and crank reformers of every stripe ( including Buddhists , Theosophists and Vedantists ) began to show up at Fiume in droves .
The party never stopped .
Every morning D'Annunzio read poetry and manifestos from his balcony ; every evening a concert , then fireworks .
This made up the entire activity of the government .
Eighteen months later , when the wine and money had run out and the Italian fleet finally showed up and lobbed a few shells at the Municipal Palace , no one had the energy to resist .
D'Annunzio , like many Italian anarchists , later veered toward fascism–in fact , Mussolini ( the ex-Syndicalist ) himself seduced the poet along that route .
By the time D'Annunzio realized his error it was too late : he was too old and sick .
But Il Duce had him killed anyway–pushed off a balcony–and turned him into a “ martyr . ”
As for Fiume , though it lacked the seriousness of the free Ukraine or Barcelona , it can probably teach us more about certain aspects of our quest .
It was in some ways the last of the pirate utopias ( or the only modern example ) –in other ways , perhaps , it was very nearly the first modern TAZ .
I believe that if we compare Fiume with the Paris uprising of 1968 ( also the Italian urban insurrections of the early seventies ) , as well as with the American countercultural communes and their anarcho - New Left influences , we should notice certain similarities , such as : –the importance of aesthetic theory ( cf. the Situationists ) –also , what might be called “ pirate economics , ” living high off the surplus of social overproduction–even the popularity of colorful military uniforms–and the concept of music as revolutionary social change–and finally their shared air of impermanence , of being ready to move on , shape - shift , re-locate to other universities , mountaintops , ghettos , factories , safe houses , abandoned farms–or even other planes of reality .
No one was trying to impose yet another Revolutionary Dictatorship , either at Fiume , Paris , or Millbrook .
Either the world would change , or it would n't .
Meanwhile keep on the move and live intensely .
The Munich Soviet ( or “ Council Republic ” ) of 1919 exhibited certain features of the TAZ , even though–like most revolutions–its stated goals were not exactly “ temporary . ”
Gustav Landauer 's participation as Minister of Culture along with Silvio Gesell as Minister of Economics and other anti- authoritarian and extreme libertarian socialists such as the poet / playwrights Erich Mªhsam and Ernst Toller , and Ret Marut ( the novelist B. Traven ) , gave the Soviet a distinct anarchist flavor .
Landauer , who had spent years of isolation working on his grand synthesis of Nietzsche , Proudhon , Kropotkin , Stirner , Meister Eckhardt , the radical mystics , and the Romantic volk - philosophers , knew from the start that the Soviet was doomed ; he hoped only that it would last long enough to be understood .
Kurt Eisner , the martyred founder of the Soviet , believed quite literally that poets and poetry should form the basis of the revolution .
Plans were launched to devote a large piece of Bavaria to an experiment in anarcho - socialist economy and community .
Landauer drew up proposals for a Free School system and a People 's Theater .
Support for the Soviet was more or less confined to the poorest working - class and bohemian neighborhoods of Munich , and to groups like the Wandervogel ( the neo- Romantic youth movement ) , Jewish radicals ( like Buber ) , the Expressionists , and other marginals .
Thus historians dismiss it as the “ Coffeehouse Republic ” and belittle its significance in comparison with Marxist and Spartacist participation in Germany 's post - War revolution (s ) .
Outmaneuvered by the Communists and eventually murdered by soldiers under the influence of the occult / fascist Thule Society , Landauer deserves to be remembered as a saint .
Yet even anarchists nowadays tend to misunderstand and condemn him for “ selling out ” to a “ socialist government . ”
If the Soviet had lasted even a year , we would weep at the mention of its beauty –but before even the first flowers of that Spring had wilted , the geist and the spirit of poetry were crushed , and we have forgotten .
Imagine what it must have been to breathe the air of a city in which the Minister of Culture has just predicted that schoolchildren will soon be memorizing the works of Walt Whitman .
Ah for a time machine …
Part 3
The Will to Power as Disappearance
FOUCAULT , BAUDRILLARD , ET AL .
have discussed various modes of “ disappearance ” at great length .
Here I wish to suggest that the TAZ is in some sense a tactic of disappearance .
When the Theorists speak of the disappearance of the Social they mean in part the impossibility of the “ Social Revolution , ” and in part the impossibility of “ the State ” – the abyss of power , the end of the discourse of power .
The anarchist question in this case should then be :
Why bother to confront a “ power ” which has lost all meaning and become sheer Simulation ?
Such confrontations will only result in dangerous and ugly spasms of violence by the emptyheaded shit - for - brains who 've inherited the keys to all the armories and prisons .
( Perhaps this is a crude american misunderstanding of sublime and subtle Franco - Germanic Theory .
If so , fine ; whoever said understanding was needed to make use of an idea ? )
As I read it , disappearance seems to be a very logical radical option for our time , not at all a disaster or death for the radical project .
Unlike the morbid deathfreak nihilistic interpretation of Theory , mine intends to mine it for useful strategies in the always - ongoing “ revolution of everyday life ” : the struggle that cannot cease even with the last failure of political or social revolution because nothing except the end of the world can bring an end to everyday life , nor to our aspirations for the good things , for the Marvelous .
And as Nietzsche said , if the world could come to an end , logically it would have done so ; it has not , so it does not .
And so , as one of the sufis said , no matter how many draughts of forbidden wine we drink , we will carry this raging thirst into eternity .
Zerzan and Black have independently noted certain “ elements of Refusal ” ( Zerzan 's term ) which perhaps can be seen as somehow symptomatic of a radical culture of disappearance , partly unconscious but partly conscious , which influences far more people than any leftist or anarchist idea .
These gestures are made against institutions , and in that sense are “ negative ” – but each negative gesture also suggests a “ positive ” tactic to replace rather than merely refuse the despised institution .
For example , the negative gesture against schooling is “ voluntary illiteracy . ”
Since I do not share the liberal worship of literacy for the sake of social ameliorization , I cannot quite share the gasps of dismay heard everywhere at this phenomenon : I sympathize with children who refuse books along with the garbage in the books .
There are however positive alternatives which make use of the same energy of disappearance .
Home - schooling and craft - apprenticeship , like truancy , result in an absence from the prison of school .
Hacking is another form of “ education ” with certain features of “ invisibility . ”
A mass - scale negative gesture against politics consists simply of not voting .
“ Apathy ” ( i.e. a healthy boredom with the weary Spectacle ) keeps over half the nation from the polls ; anarchism never accomplished as much !
( Nor did anarchism have anything to do with the failure of the recent Census . )
Again , there are positive parallels : “ networking ” as an alternative to politics is practiced at many levels of society , and non-hierarchic organization has attained popularity even outside the anarchist movement , simply because it works .
( ACT UP and Earth First ! are two examples .
Alcoholics Anonymous , oddly enough , is another . )
Refusal of Work can take the forms of absenteeism , on - job drunkenness , sabotage , and sheer inattention – but it can also give rise to new modes of rebellion : more self - employment , participation in the “ black ” economy and “ lavoro nero , ” welfare scams and other criminal options , pot farming , etc.–all more or less “ invisible ” activities compared to traditional leftist confrontational tactics such as the general strike .
Refusal of the Church ?
Well , the “ negative gesture ” here probably consists of …watching television .
But the positive alternatives include all sorts of non-authoritarian forms of spirituality , from “ unchurched ” Christianity to neo- paganism .
The “ Free Religions ” as I like to call them– small , self - created , half - serious / half - fun cults influenced by such currents as Discordianism and anarcho - Taoism–are to be found all over marginal America , and provide a growing “ fourth way ” outside the mainstream churches , the televangelical bigots , and New Age vapidity and consumerism .
It might also be said that the chief refusal of orthodoxy consists of the construction of “ private moralities ” in the Nietzschean sense : the spirituality of “ free spirits . ”
The negative refusal of Home is “ homelessness , ” which most consider a form of victimization , not wishing to be forced into nomadology .
But “ homelessness ” can in a sense be a virtue , an adventure–so it appears , at least , to the huge international movement of the squatters , our modern hobos .
The negative refusal of the Family is clearly divorce , or some other symptom of “ breakdown . ”
The positive alternative springs from the realization that life can be happier without the nuclear family , whereupon a hundred flowers bloom –from single parentage to group marriage to erotic affinity group .
The “ European Project ” fights a major rearguard action in defense of “ Family ” –oedipal misery lies at the heart of Control .
Alternatives exist–but they must remain in hiding , especially since the War against Sex of the 1980's and 1990's .
What is the refusal of Art ?
The “ negative gesture ” is not to be found in the silly nihilism of an “ Art Strike ” or the defacing of some famous painting –it is to be seen in the almost universal glassy - eyed boredom that creeps over most people at the very mention of the word .
But what would the “ positive gesture ” consist of ?
Is it possible to imagine an aesthetics that does not engage , that removes itself from History and even from the Market ?
or at least tends to do so ?
which wants to replace representation with presence ?
How does presence make itself felt even in ( or through ) representation ?
“ Chaos Linguistics ” traces a presence which is continually disappearing from all orderings of language and meaning - systems ; an elusive presence , evanescent , latif ( “ subtle , ” a term in sufi alchemy ) –the Strange Attractor around which memes accrue , chaotically forming new and spontaneous orders .
Here we have an aesthetics of the borderland between chaos and order , the margin , the area of “ catastrophe ” where the breakdown of the system can equal enlightenment .
( Note : for an explanation of “ Chaos Linguistics ” see Appendix A , then please read this paragraph again . )
The disappearance of the artist IS “ the suppression and realization of art , ” in Situationist terms .
But from where do we vanish ?
And are we ever seen or heard of again ?
We go to Croatan – what 's our fate ?
All our art consists of a goodbye note to history –“ Gone To Croatan ” – but where is it , and what will we do there ?
First :
We 're not talking here about literally vanishing from the world and its future : –no escape backward in time to paleolithic “ original leisure society ” –no forever utopia , no backmountain hideaway , no island ; also , no post - Revolutionary utopia–most likely no Revolution at all ! – also , no VONU , no anarchist Space Stations–nor do we accept a “ Baudrillardian disappearance ” into the silence of an ironic hyperconformity .
I have no quarrel with any Rimbauds who escape Art for whatever Abyssinia they can find .
But we can't build an aesthetics , even an aesthetics of disappearance , on the simple act of never coming back .
By saying we 're not an avant - garde and that there is no avant - garde , we 've written our “ Gone To Croatan ” – the question then becomes , how to envision “ everyday life ” in Croatan ?
particularly if we cannot say that Croatan exists in Time ( Stone Age or Post - Revolution ) or Space , either as utopia or as some forgotten midwestern town or as Abyssinia ?
Where and when is the world of unmediated creativity ?
If it can exist , it does exist–but perhaps only as a sort of alternate reality which we so far have not learned to perceive .
Where would we look for the seeds –the weeds cracking through our sidewalks –from this other world into our world ?
the clues , the right directions for searching ?
a finger pointing at the moon ?
I believe , or would at least like to propose , that the only solution to the “ suppression and realization ” of Art lies in the emergence of the TAZ .
I would strongly reject the criticism that the TAZ itself is “ nothing but ” a work of art , although it may have some of the trappings .
I do suggest that the TAZ is the only possible “ time ” and “ place ” for art to happen for the sheer pleasure of creative play , and as an actual contribution to the forces which allow the TAZ to cohere and manifest .
Art in the World of Art has become a commodity ; but deeper than that lies the problem of re-presentation itself , and the refusal of all mediation .
In the TAZ art as a commodity will simply become impossible ; it will instead be a condition of life .
Mediation is harder to overcome , but the removal of all barriers between artists and “ users ” of art will tend toward a condition in which ( as A.K. Coomaraswamy described it ) “ the artist is not a special sort of person , but every person is a special sort of artist . ”
In sum : disappearance is not necessarily a “ catastrophe ” – except in the mathematical sense of “ a sudden topological change . ”
All the positive gestures sketched here seem to involve various degrees of invisibility rather than traditional revolutionary confrontation .
The “ New Left ” never really believed in its own existence till it saw itself on the Evening News .
The New Autonomy , by contrast , will either infiltrate the media and subvert “ it ” from within–or else never be “ seen ” at all .
The TAZ exists not only beyond Control but also beyond definition , beyond gazing and naming as acts of enslaving , beyond the understanding of the State , beyond the State 's ability to see .
Part 3
Ratholes in the Babylon of Information
THE TAZ AS A CONSCIOUS radical tactic will emerge under certain conditions : Psychological liberation .
That is , we must realize ( make real ) the moments and spaces in which freedom is not only possible but actual .
We must know in what ways we are genuinely oppressed , and also in what ways we are self - repressed or ensnared in a fantasy in which ideas oppress us .
WORK , for example , is a far more actual source of misery for most of us than legislative politics .
Alienation is far more dangerous for us than toothless outdated dying ideologies .
Mental addiction to “ ideals ” – which in fact turn out to be mere projections of our resentment and sensations of victimization –will never further our project .
The TAZ is not a harbinger of some pie - in - the - sky Social Utopia to which we must sacrifice our lives that our children 's children may breathe a bit of free air .
The TAZ must be the scene of our present autonomy , but it can only exist on the condition that we already know ourselves as free beings .
The counter - Net must expand .
At present it reflects more abstraction than actuality .
Zines and BBSs exchange information , which is part of the necessary groundwork of the TAZ , but very little of this information relates to concrete goods and services necessary for the autonomous life .
We do not live in CyberSpace ; to dream that we do is to fall into CyberGnosis , the false transcendence of the body .
The TAZ is a physical place and we are either in it or not .
All the senses must be involved .
The Web is like a new sense in some ways , but it must be added to the others– the others must not be subtracted from it , as in some horrible parody of the mystic trance .
Without the Web , the full realization of the TAZ - complex would be impossible .
But the Web is not the end in itself .
It 's a weapon .
The apparatus of Control –the “ State ” –must ( or so we must assume ) continue to deliquesce and petrify simultaneously , must progress on its present course in which hysterical rigidity comes more and more to mask a vacuity , an abyss of power .
As power “ disappears , ” our will to power must be disappearance .
We 've already dealt with the question of whether the TAZ can be viewed “ merely ” as a work of art .
But you will also demand to know whether it is more than a poor rat - hole in the Babylon of Information , or rather a maze of tunnels , more and more connected , but devoted only to the economic dead - end of piratical parasitism ?
I 'll answer that I 'd rather be a rat in the wall than a rat in the cage– but I 'll also insist that the TAZ transcends these categories .
A world in which the TAZ succeeded in putting down roots might resemble the world envisioned by “ P.M. ” in his fantasy novel bolo ' bolo .
Perhaps the TAZ is a “ proto - bolo . ”
But inasmuch as the TAZ exists now , it stands for much more than the mundanity of negativity or countercultural drop - out - ism .
We 've mentioned the festal aspect of the moment which is unControlled , and which adheres in spontaneous self - ordering , however brief .
It is “ epiphanic ” –a peak experience on the social as well as individual scale .
Liberation is realized struggle –this is the essence of Nietzsche 's “ self - overcoming . ”
The present thesis might also take for a sign Nietzsche 's wandering .
It is the precursor of the drift , in the Situ sense of the derive and Lyotard 's definition of driftwork .
We can foresee a whole new geography , a kind of pilgrimage - map in which holy sites are replaced by peak experiences and TAZs : a real science of psychotopography , perhaps to be called “ geo- autonomy ” or “ anarchomancy . ”
The TAZ involves a kind of ferality , a growth from tameness to wild ( er ) ness , a “ return ” which is also a step forward .
It also demands a “ yoga ” of chaos , a project of “ higher ” orderings ( of consciousness or simply of life ) which are approached by “ surfing the wave - front of chaos , ” of complex dynamism .
The TAZ is an art of life in continual rising up , wild but gentle–a seducer not a rapist , a smuggler rather than a bloody pirate , a dancer not an eschatologist .
Let us admit that we have attended parties where for one brief night a republic of gratified desires was attained .
Shall we not confess that the politics of that night have more reality and force for us than those of , say , the entire U.S. Government ?
Some of the “ parties ” we 've mentioned lasted for two or three years .
Is this something worth imagining , worth fighting for ?
Let us study invisibility , webworking , psychic nomadism–and who knows what we might attain ?

Appendix A. Chaos Linguistics
NOT YET A SCIENCE but a proposition :
That certain problems in linguistics might be solved by viewing language as a complex dynamical system or “ Chaos field . ”
Of all the responses to Saussure 's linguistics , two have special interest here : the first , “ antilinguistics , ” can be traced –in the modern period–from Rimbaud 's departure for Abyssinia ; to Nietzsche 's “ I fear that while we still have grammar we have not yet killed God ” ; to dada ; to Korzybski's “ the Map is not the Territory ” ; to Burroughs ' cut-ups and “ breakthrough in the Gray Room ” ; to Zerzan 's attack on language itself as representation and mediation .
The second , Chomskyan Linguistics , with its belief in “ universal grammar ” and its tree diagrams , represents ( I believe ) an attempt to “ save ” language by discovering “ hidden invariables , ” much in the same way certain scientists are trying to “ save ” physics from the “ irrationality ” of quantum mechanics .
Although as an anarchist Chomsky might have been expected to side with the nihilists , in fact his beautiful theory has more in common with platonism or sufism than with anarchism .
Traditional metaphysics describes language as pure light shining through the colored glass of the archetypes ; Chomsky speaks of “ innate ” grammars .
Words are leaves , branches are sentences , mother tongues are limbs , language families are trunks , and the roots are in “ heaven ” … or the DNA .
I call this “ hermetalinguistics ” –hermetic and metaphysical .
Nihilism ( or “ HeavyMetalinguistics ” in honor of Burroughs ) seems to me to have brought language to a dead end and threatened to render it “ impossible ” ( a great feat , but a depressing one ) - - while Chomsky holds out the promise and hope of a last - minute revelation , which I find equally difficult to accept .
I too would like to “ save ” language , but without recourse to any “ Spooks , ” or supposed rules about God , dice , and the Universe .
Returning to Saussure , and his posthumously published notes on anagrams in Latin poetry , we find certain hints of a process which somehow escapes the sign / signifier dynamic .
Saussure was confronted with the suggestion of some sort of “ meta ” - linguistics which happens within language rather than being imposed as a categorical imperative from “ outside . ”
As soon as language begins to play , as in the acrostic poems he examined , it seems to resonate with self - amplifying complexity .
Saussure tried to quantify the anagrams but his figures kept running away from him ( as if perhaps nonlinear equations were involved ) .
Also , he began to find the anagrams everywhere , even in Latin prose .
He began to wonder if he were hallucinating –or if anagrams were a natural unconscious process of parole .
He abandoned the project .
I wonder : if enough of this sort of data were crunched through a computer , would we begin to be able to model language in terms of complex dynamical systems ?
Grammars then would not be “ innate , ” but would emerge from chaos as spontaneously evolving “ higher orders , ” in Prigogine 's sense of “ creative evolution . ”
Grammars could be thought of as “ Strange Attractors , ” like the hidden pattern which “ caused ” the anagrams–patterns which are “ real ” but have “ existence ” only in terms of the sub - patterns they manifest .
If meaning is elusive , perhaps it is because consciousness itself , and therefore language , is fractal .
I find this theory more satisfyingly anarchistic than either anti-linguistics or Chomskyanism .
It suggests that language can overcome representation and mediation , not because it is innate , but because it is chaos .
It would suggest that all dadaistic experimentation ( Feyerabend described his school of scientific epistemology as “ anarchist dada ” ) in sound poetry , gesture , cut - up , beast languages , etc.–all this was aimed neither at discovering nor destroying meaning , but at creating it .
Nihilism points out gloomily that language “ arbitrarily ” creates meaning .
Chaos Linguistics happily agrees , but adds that language can overcome language , that language can create freedom out of semantic tyranny 's confusion and decay .

Appendix B. Applied Hedonics
THE BONNOT GANG WERE vegetarians and drank only water .
They came to a bad ( tho ' picturesque ) end .
Vegetables and water , in themselves excellent things–pure zen really –should n't be consumed as martyrdom but as an epiphany .
Self - denial as radical praxis , the Leveller impulse , tastes of millenarian gloom–and this current on the Left shares an historical wellspring with the neo-puritan fundamentalism and moralic reaction of our decade .
The New Ascesis , whether practiced by anorexic health - cranks , thin - lipped police sociologists , downtown straight - edge nihilists , cornpone fascist baptists , socialist torpedoes , drug - free Republicans … in every case the motive force is the same : resentment .
resentment
In the face of contemporary pecksniffian anaesthesia we 'll erect a whole gallery of forebears , heros who carried on the struggle against bad consciousness but still knew how to party , a genial gene pool , a rare and difficult category to define , great minds not just for Truth but for the truth of pleasure , serious but not sober , whose sunny disposition makes them not sluggish but sharp , brilliant but not tormented .
Imagine a Nietzsche with good digestion .
Not the tepid Epicureans nor the bloated Sybarites .
Sort of a spiritual hedonism , an actual Path of Pleasure , vision of a good life which is both noble and possible , rooted in a sense of the magnificent over - abundance of reality .

History , materialism , monism , positivism , and all the “ isms ” of this world are old and rusty tools which I do n't need or mind anymore .
My principle is life , my end is death .
I wish to live my life intensely for to embrace my life tragically .
You are waiting for the revolution ?
My own began a long time ago !
When you will be ready ( God , what an endless wait ! )
I wo n't mind going along with you for awhile .
But when you 'll stop , I shall continue on my insane and triumphal way toward the great and sublime conquest of the nothing !
Any society that you build will have its limits .
And outside the limits of any society the unruly and heroic tramps will wander , with their wild & virgin thoughts –they who cannot live without planning ever new and dreadful outbursts of rebellion !
I shall be among them !
And after me , as before me , there will be those saying to their fellows : “ So turn to yourselves rather than to your Gods or to your idols .
Find what hides in yourselves ; bring it to light ; show yourselves ! ”
Because every person ; who , searching his own inwardness , extracts what was mysteriously hidden therein ; is a shadow eclipsing any form of society which can exist under the sun !
All societies tremble when the scornful aristocracy of the tramps , the inaccessibles , the uniques , the rulers over the ideal , and the conquerors of the nothing resolutely advances .
So , come on iconoclasts , forward !

PIRATE RANT
Captain Bellamy Daniel Defoe , writing under the pen name Captain Charles Johnson , wrote what became the first standard historical text on pirates , A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pirates .
According to Patrick Pringle 's Jolly Roger , pirate recruitment was most effective among the unemployed , escaped bondsmen , and transported criminals .
The high seas made for an instantaneous levelling of class inequalities .
Defoe relates that a pirate named Captain Bellamy made this speech to the captain of a merchant vessel he had taken as a prize .
The captain of the merchant vessel had just declined an invitation to join the pirates .
I am sorry they wo n't let you have your sloop again , for I scorn to do any one a mischief , when it is not to my advantage ; damn the sloop , we must sink her , and she might be of use to you .
Though you are a sneaking puppy , and so are all those who will submit to be governed by laws which rich men have made for their own security ; for the cowardly whelps have not the courage otherwise to defend what they get by knavery ; but damn ye altogether : damn them for a pack of crafty rascals , and you , who serve them , for a parcel of hen - hearted numbskulls .
They vilify us , the scoundrels do , when there is only this difference , they rob the poor under the cover of law , forsooth , and we plunder the rich under the protection of our own courage .
Had you not better make then one of us , than sneak after these villains for employment ?
When the captain replied that his conscience would not let him break the laws of God and man , the pirate Bellamy continued :
You are a devilish conscience rascal , I am a free prince , and I have as much authority to make war on the whole world , as he who has a hundred sail of ships at sea , and an army of 100,000 men in the field ; and this my conscience tells me : but there is no arguing with such snivelling puppies , who allow superiors to kick them about deck at pleasure .
THE DINNER PARTY
Enlarge By John McConnico , AP
In this Aug. 16 , 2005 file photo , an iceberg melts in Kulusuk , Greenland near the arctic circle .
" If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you , " then , with apologies to Kipling , you might not be a climate scientist .
Well - publicized troubles have mounted for those forecasting global warming .
First , there was last year 's release of hacked e-mails from the United Kingdom 's University of East Anglia , showing some climate scientists really dislike their critics ( investigations are still ongoing ) .
Then there was the recent discovery of a botched prediction that all Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035 in one of the Nobel - Prize - winning 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) reports .
Instead , the glaciers are only shrinking about as much as glaciers everywhere , twice as fast as they did 40 years ago , suggest results from NASA 's GRACE gravity - measuring orbiter .
The recent controversies " have really shaken the confidence of the public in the conduct of science , " according to atmospheric scientist Ralph Cicerone , head of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences .
Cicerone was speaking at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting last month on a panel calling for more communication and release of data to rebuild lost trust for scientists .
IPCC chiefs have made similar calls in the handling of their reports .
Scientists see reason for worry in polls like one released in December by Fox News that found 23 % of respondents saw global warming as " not a problem , " up from 12 % in 2005 .
Also at the AAAS meeting , Yale , American University and George Mason University released a survey of 978 people challenging the notion that people 18 to 35 were any more engaged than their elders on climate change .
Statistically , 44 % in that age range — matching the national average — found global warming as either " not too important " or " not at all important , " even though they grew up in an era when climate scientists had found it very likely that temperatures had increased over the last century due to fossil fuel emissions of greenhouse gases .
But what " if " ( apologies to Kipling again ) scientists are misreading those poll results and conflating them with news coverage of the recent public - relations black eyes from e-mails and the glacier mistake ?
What 's really happening , suggests polling expert Jon Krosnick of Stanford University , is " scientists are over - reacting .
It 's another funny instance of scientists ignoring science . "
Krosnick and his colleagues argue that polling suggesting less interest in fixing climate change might indicate the public has its mind on more immediate problems in the midst of a global economic downturn , with the U.S. unemployment rate stuck at 9.7 % .
The AAAS - released survey of young people , for example , finds that 82 % of them trust scientists for information on global warming and the national average is 74 % .
" Very few professions enjoy the level of confidence from the public that scientists do , and those numbers have n't changed much in a decade , " he says .
" We do n't see a lot of evidence that the general public in the United States is picking up on the ( University of East Anglia ) e-mails .
It 's too inside baseball . "
So to try to see what is happening , Krosnick and colleagues tried a new approach to a standard polling question , " What do you think is the most important problem facing this country today ? "
In a September survey of 906 adults , they asked the question in different ways :
• When asked , without being given any examples of problems , 0 % mentioned global warming , but 52 % mentioned jobs or the economy .
• When asked — with problems such as stopping crime , terrorism or global warming mentioned — 6 % selected the climate concern , and 34 % mentioned jobs or the economy .
• When asked , " What do you think will be the most important problem facing the world in the future ? " global warming moved to 9 % , with 24 % saying jobs or the economy .
• And when asked , " What do you think will be the most serious problem facing the world in the future if nothing is done to stop it ? " global warming moved to 15 % , with jobs or the economy falling to 13 % .
In a follow - up December Associated Press / Stanford University poll of 1,005 adults , they found simply asking the last question bumped global warming up to 12 % of the responses , up from 1 % for problems today , effectively a statistical tie with the September poll .
It could just be that people think that global warming is a problem the government will solve in the future , Krosnick suggests , so today they are worried about their jobs instead .
The part of the population already deeply opposed to climate change science likely has been inflamed further by the recent controversies , he adds , but that may be about as far as it goes .
" It is certainly possible that public confidence in climate scientists has declined since our last survey in December , but it 's not likely , since little time has passed , and there has been no huge news of huge dissemination of the old news . "
American University 's Matthew Nisbet , part of the team behind the youth attitudes poll , says that even if polling does n't show the brouhaha about the IPCC glaciers affecting the general public , there is the chance that it could affect " elite " opinion - makers and then trickle down to the public .
" Elected officials are most inclined to react to and respond to what Americans believe are the pressing problems today not in the future , since these are the priorities they are most likely to be evaluated on in the next election , " he adds .
One example came Thursday , when Sen. Jay Rockefeller , D.- W. Va. , rolled out legislation to bar the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions from power plants burning West Virginia 's coal .
Rockefeller did n't cite new doubts about climate science , notes Daniel Lashof of the Natural Resources Defense Council , an environmental group , but jobs .
" At a time when so many people are hurting , we need to put decisions about clean coal and our energy future into the hands of the people and their elected representatives , not a federal environmental agency , " Rockefeller said in a statement .
" No senator I 've spoken to has mentioned the e-mails in their thinking about climate , " Lashof says .
" The focus is much more on the economy , national security , clean energy jobs . "
One Senator who has complained loudly is Sen. James Inhofe , R. - Okla. , who in 2003 famously called climate change a " hoax . "
But Inhofe has already convinced the people he is going to convince , Krosnick says .
" Public opinion changes when leaders who previously held one opinion , suddenly switch . "
Arguments about science do obscure news and television discussions over steps to take in dealing with climate , from investing in nuclear power to regulating coal plants , Lashof adds .
“ While there are some signs of progress , we are still not serving the needs of the current crop of school pupils as well as we should and parental background remains a much more significant determiner of children 's life chances in the UK than elsewhere . ”

There are Rally events , and there are life events .
WRC Corona Rally Mexico Rally America was both .

Bill Caswell and I received word in January that a Rally America legal car would be eligible to compete in Rally America , a Mexican national rally run concurrently with WRC Corona Rally Mexico .
Some teams would dream about competing ; Bill and I said screw it , we 're going .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
I was in a new car with a new driver , as I frequently have found myself over the years .
With Mexico
I was now adding a new rule structure in a new country with a steep - to - me language barrier .
As a co-driver my work started months before the event .
I read the supplementary regulations , created time tables and movement plans , emailed the event officials and Bill to no end .
I constantly stayed in contact with Bill , calling and texting as important dates approached , reminding him the day that entry forms were due , finding information on brokers and the border crossing .
Advertisement
With the Rally in the 100 Acre Wood the week directly before Mexico I was forced to put everything on the shelf sooner than I had hoped .
I went to Missouri to co-drive for one of my regular drivers , Dillon Van Way in the Team 600 Ford Focus SVT , and left Bill to the car for the final days before we were due to set out .
While in Missouri my cell phone decided that it had enough of my abuse and gave up , I was out of contact with Bill during the final vital prep hours .
After the champagne spray at 100AW
I was able to call him on Dillon 's cell only to be reassured that he was leaving Chicago in the morning .
Advertisement
Sunday , February 28 :
I woke up at 6:30 am and called Bill .
The plan was to leave Rolla , MO at 7:00 am .
No answer .
I waited at the hotel for a few hours and tried again .
Still nothing .
Advertisement
After checking out I went to the house of one of our Team 600 crew who happened to live in town .
I sat around , cat napping throughout the day , running to a truck stop every few hours to try to get a hold of Bill on a pay phone .
When I finally got through , Bill told me he ran into some last minute motor issues and was still in Chicago .
Monday , March 1 :
We were supposed to be in Laredo , attempting the border crossing in the morning so we could make Leon , GTO in time for recce on Tuesday .
Instead I continued to loaf around watching TV .
I kept checking in with Bill for updates .
He was finally able to hit the road around 7:00 pm .
Advertisement
Tuesday , March 2 :
Bill arrived in Rolla at 1:00 am .
We were 37 hours behind schedule by that point so we drove in shifts nonstop to Laredo .
After driving down Piotr Wiktorcyk and Pat Moro 's cars last year for Rally of the Nations I had gotten used to driving unfamiliar tow rigs through the night across the country with little to no sleep , making this a familiar if annoying action .
Advertisement
We got to Laredo at 5:00 pm and drove straight across the border .
The Mexican customs agents wanted to look in the trailer , so we showed them .
That only piqued their interest , causing them to look deeper into more boxes of gear .
My rudimentary Spanish skills were n't enough to get us through the border , luckily I always keep event documents on hand .
I pulled out our movement plan which had the WRC Corona Rally Mexico logo on the cover .
When the agent saw it his eyes lit up ; " Ahh , Rah - lee ?
Go , go . "
Our day stopped at the immigration office .
To get into Mexico we needed the title and a letter for our service van allowing it past the inner Mexican border .
I can't get into why we did n't have them for a few years , but the short version is we were sent back to the US despite our broker 's best attempts to bribe the officials .
Advertisement
As we tried to cross back over we got caught on a cross over road between bridge one and bridge two leading between Laredo , TX and Nuevo Laredo , MX .
The road is two lanes wide with concrete barriers a foot and a half high on either side .
Nothing out of the ordinary , until a cartel decided to make war in front of us .
We rounded what had to be the only corner on the mile long road when a car pulled across the path blocking us in .
With the trailer we had no way of turning around .
Suddenly dozens of people ran out of nearby buildings brandishing machine guns .
We spent a frantic ten minutes backing up to the sounds of Spanish screaming and automatic weapons fire .
Our broker simply explained it as " Mexico , she has problems . "
We rushed across the bridge , darting between heavily armed Mexican military vehicles and took shelter in the Days Inn Laredo .

Wednesday , March 3 :
Bill was able to " procure " another van in the morning .
We transferred our gear over and successfully crossed into Mexico .
We drove through the night .
Advertisement
Thursday , March 4 :
We arrived in Leon at 5:00 am and fell straight in bed .
Bill and I woke after three hours of sleep and took the service rig across the street to the Poliforum service park .
Event officials guided us through the building and down a ramp into our service area .
The truck , once down the ramp , lifted the back of the trailer and scrapped the entry way into the Poliforum .
Luckily I was driving and luckily all eyes were on us .
It was a great way to introduce ourselves to the Rally world .
Advertisement
We unpacked , Bill set to work on final details for the car , I got deep into the paperwork for the weekend .
Both Bill and I were nervous that we would n't pass tech .
There was n't anything wrong with the car ; it 's just that being faced with a WRC level tech inspection with a 20 year old car is a bit intimidating .
All of the tech inspectors were more than friendly and soon our fears were assuaged .
We were cleared to start .
Advertisement
Around 4:00 p.m. we left the service park for the Siloa holding area , the first portion of the ceremonial start .
No description I can give will be adequate enough to explain how the night went .
The transit to Siloa was simple enough , but when we arrived at the holding area we were greeted by tens of thousands of screaming fans .
Bill and I were heroes .
We were in an attainable car on the world stage and everyone loved us .
As soon as all of the cars were parked the fans streamed past the barriers for autographs and photos .
Someone was setting fireworks off on the roof tops , girls kept asking for photos and kisses on the cheeks and everyone , including local police , wanted autographs .
Bill and I were happy to oblige .
Advertisement
We were released at one minute intervals from Siloa , starting off of a ceremonial ramp , into the streets .
For the next 30 km we transited down city streets and freeways lined with people .
Police blocked every entrance and two officers , lights and sirens blaring , followed us to Guanajuato .
We were free to drive as fast as we wanted , through toll booths with no charge , feeling like banditos fleeing from the police .
When we arrived in Guanajuato we were thrust into a scene that made Siloa look tame .
The crowds built to over one hindered thousand screaming Rally fans .
It was stop and go traffic for three miles with people parting for us to inch forward , swallowing us from behind after we passed .
Several girls blew kisses which I grabbed with a wink and smile only to watch them swoon .
It was an odd feeling .
Advertisement
The official start ramp , after three other false ramps , was a spinning platform surrounded by banners , grandstands and spot lights .
The crowd went nuts when we pulled up .
After driving down we immediately transited back to Leon , wondering the whole way if we were dreaming about the previous four hours of our lives .
Advertisement
Friday , March 5 :
The day started oddly like any Rally day despite the previous night 's festivities .
We set to work in the service park .
Bill on the car , myself on route books .
Advertisement
Since we missed recce we were going to be forced to do the whole weekend on very thin tulips .
Luckily for us we met Nicolas Fuchs , a PWRC competitor and current Peruvian national champion .
His co-driver , Juan Pedro Cilloniz , allowed me to photo copy his pace notes .
They were in Spanish and in a method neither Bill nor I had used before , but they were something .
I wrote at the beginning of every stage that I=Left and D=Right and was forced to call that good .
Other symbols I had to learn at speed were " L " = crest , " l " = long , " sc" =tightens , " sa " =opens and " boda " =off camber .
Our in car video can attest that I was n't perfect at translating Spanish to English at speed , but I was at least 95 % accurate .
Advertisement
The first stage loop went alright .
We bashed the rear left corner enough to rip the strut mount from the car , but not damage the shock .
Bill took out the Bilstein to prevent it from banging around and we ran the last loop without any left rear suspension .
Surprisingly we were sitting in third , but we were soon faced with a fuel pump failure on the transit to stage 7 .
Advertisement
Using only a screw driver and a pocket knife borrowed off of a local cop Bill removed the pump from the car , stripped wires out of the in car video system and jumped the pump forward and in reverse off the car 's battery until it spit out the piece of sand that clogged it .
He jammed the pump back in the tank and we rushed to the next stage only to be told it was closed and we had to transit through .
The next story involves high speeds , GPS tracking , a Policía Federal road block and chase and other bits of James Bond level international intrigue .
Like the previous story about our service vehicle , I can't get into this one for a few years unless coerced by a cold brew .
Advertisement
After some " issues " we returned to the service park and set to repairing the car under Super Rally regulations .
I received some bad news from home and spent the night on the phone to Michigan leaving Bill to work on the car .
He was able to wrap up all of our issues to allow us to start on Saturday .
Advertisement
Saturday , March 6 :
We started the day third on the road .
With our Super Rally penalties we were sitting in last , but that did n't stick .
We attacked the stages in anger , quickly climbing back up the order to fourth .
Advertisement
On stage one we entered a tight yet fast downhill section with a little too much gusto .
The back of the car slid off the road on the right and went off a bridge .
My first reaction was , " well , we 're done . "
Bill just kept on the gas and a well placed BMW trailing link caught the edge of the concrete bridge before the tire and somehow bounced us back on the road .
According to the laws of physics it should n't have been possible , yet we found ourselves on still on the road and still pushing hard .
I love those moments .
On stage three we approached what my notes said was a dip .
It was n't a dip .
I said it was n't a dip when we could clearly see what it was .
Bill gunned it .
It was a massive jump .
Massive .
We landed hard and broke the right motor mount , but instead of slowing down Bill just kept pushing .
We entered the final Superspecials sitting back in third .
Advertisement
Of note was a young lady , maybe 20 or so , at the beginning of the Superspecial in the VIP area .
She held a sign that said " I love Slocum . "
I 've gone international .
I called her over but the security guards would n't let her pass .
I scolded them out and they let her approach the car .
I asked for her hand and gave it a kiss , feeling like an American lothario .
She giggled and the security guard forced her back as we moved up to the start line .
It was reported to me later that she spent the remainder of the Superspecial bragging to the crowd around her that I kissed her .
I am an American lothario .
Advertisement
Once back to the service park Bill again set to working on the car .
He was able to fabricate a new motor mount using a piece of tubing and angle iron .
Unfortunately we went over our allotted service time and pulled 4:20 in penalties , moving us to fourth , but we were still in it .
Advertisement
Sunday , March 7 :
We were solidly in fourth to start the day .
There were only four stages left so we decided to play it smart and drive for the finish .
We had no issues , the car was even better than when we started on Friday .
I was comfortable with the notes ;
Bill was comfortable with the car and the stages .

After 22 stages , several severe mechanical issues , border delays and dozens of other reasons why it should n't have happened , we finished WRC Corona Rally Mexico Rally America .
The final verdict came down that another car had been disqualified resulting in us moving up to third .
The event that should never have occurred ended better than either of us could have hoped .
The ceremonial finish was just as insane as the other spectator events .
Thousands of people , thousands of photos and autographs , kisses all around .
I burned out two sharpies over the weekend on autographs alone .
The only thing left was to party .

Bill got trashed inside with other drivers , doing shots with Petter and Henning Solberg ; I hung around with other co-drivers outside drinking water and talking about how hard it is to get drivers to listen .
Event workers hung out in between both groups trying to look natural .
I went back to the hotel around 2:00 , Bill stumbled in around 5:30 .
Nothing can do justice in describing what it 's like to compete at a WRC event .
Even though it was the Mexican National event , we still experienced everything in the big show .
If the chance comes to compete again I suggest others take advantage , I know I will .

Slocum 's simple mantra is to never say no to an adventure .
As a person who has been using marijuana illegally for over half of his life , I have had to adopt tricks and techniques to get by in the “ real world . ”
One of the most uncomfortable situations is passing a pre-employment drug screening .
Now , I ’m not advocating dishonesty with your employer but a urinalysis unfairly punishes weed smokers while cokeheads and meth addicts get a free pass since those drugs only show up in a urinalysis within 72 hours of use while marijuana can stay in the system for 30 days or more .
I do n’t smoke before work ( usually ) and it never affects my ability to perform the functions of my job , but after a long day , nothing sounds better then a big , green bowl .
First off , if you can just stop smoking for thirty days then do it .
It ’s the simple solution to this situation .
However , sometimes you do n’t have that much time to prepare so you have to improvise .
I have had to take ten to fifteen of these tests over the years with a 100 % success rate .
I just got a new job last week and had to give a urine sample for testing .
There are too important elements when it comes to effectively passing : obtaining a clean sample and keeping it within temperature .
We all have friends that do n’t smoke and they are the best sources of clean urine .
I ’ve heard of people using the fake stuff you can order over the internet or buy at your local head - shops and passing but why pay for the fake stuff when you can get the real thing for free ?
I just have my buddy fill up a balloon or an unlubricated condom and seal it up .
I then drive strait to the facility with the “ container ” of urine on my dash with the defrost on to help keep the temperature high .
This is where it can get tricky .
Since you are just taking a pre-employment screening , they cannot search you , so I “ hide ” the “ container ” in my underwear and bring a small pair of nail clippers and hide the clippers in a pocket or my shoe .
I then carefully walk in to the facility and register .
When they call me to take the test , they usually ask you to remove all items for your pockets but I am sure to keep the nail clippers in my pocket .
Once they close the door , I use the clippers to clip a hole in the “ container ” and fill up the cup .
I then empty the remaining “ sample ” into the toilet and hide the empty “ container ” in my shoe .
I do n’t like to have to do this and if there was an easier way I would use it .
However this is the world we live in and until there is real change , I am forced to play this stupid game .
Incidentally , I would be remiss in not at least pointing out that if you are a meth addict or cokehead and want help , addiction treatment and information is available online .

“ Holy Crap , ” I thought when my editor forwarded me today ’s AIPAC press release , supposedly calling for a freeze on Israeli settlements .
It turns out the statement , which would have been a massive departure from traditional AIPAC policies , was a stunt orchestrated by the anti-everything activist organization Code Pink .
I was n’t the only person who got punk ’d : NPR , C - SPAN and Al Jazeera all ran with the story before news broke that it was false .
Code Pink has so far refused to admit how they pulled it off .
But it ’s clear that the press release was sent from a fake email address mirroring that of AIPAC media director Josh Block : block@aipac.org .
His real email is jblock@aipac.org .
For much of the past fifty years , AIPAC has gained massive support in the American Jewish community .
But as Israeli policy toward Palestinians became increasingly out of step with American liberals , Jews began taking a softer approach to the debate .
As Robert Dreyfuss explained last September for Mother Jones , these liberals have mounted a challenge to the AIPAC hegemony under the banner of J Street , the self - proclaimed “ pro-Israel , pro-peace ” lobby .
Today ’s statement would have been a momentus agreement between the foes on a national security matter .
In reality , AIPAC has strongly opposed the Obama administration ’s recent criticism of Israeli settlements .
Last week , the real Josh Block released ( pdf ) a statement demanding that Obama “ work to immediately defuse the tension with Israel . ”
Meanwhile , J Street penned an op -ed in the Wall Street Journal in support of the Obama administration ’s stance .
The stunt is consistent with the growing trend among activists to hijack corporations by releasing false policy statements that force the a company to explain a politically unpopular position .
This has been most famously employed by the Yes Men , who last October released a statement , supposedly on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce , announcing belief in Global Warming .
It did n’t take long for the Chamber to reaffirm its denialist position .
With prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington this week to discuss settlements , the stunt was perfectly timed .
But unless AIPAC follows the Chamber ’s example and sues Code Pink , do n’t expect this story to have the same impact or receive the same exposure as the Yes Men ’s hoax .

KANSAS CITY / NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Agricultural seed giant Monsanto Co MON.N posted a lower - than - expected quarterly profit and warned that potent competition , primarily in its struggling Roundup herbicide business , would make it hard to meet its 2010 financial targets .

The company has seen stiff herbicide competition from rivals such as DuPont DD.N on pricing and technology and its patent for the Roundup herbicide will expire in 2015 .
“ The first half of 2010 has seen some new market realities , ” Monsanto Chief Executive Hugh Grant said on a conference call .
“ We ’re seeing evidence of margin compression ” in the herbicide business .
Monsanto warned on Wednesday that full - year results would likely be at the low end of its announced range of $ 3.10 to $ 3.30 and it was unlikely to meet its long - promised goal of doubling 2007 gross profit by 2012 .
“ While there may be options to make an accelerated push for 2012 , it ’s clear to me that achieving that objective would involve making short - term choices that are not in the long - range interests of the business , ” Grant said .
Monsanto executives said fiscal third - quarter profit would be “ somewhat less ” than last year and that more than 45 percent of its earnings would need to come in the second half of the year to hit the low end of its annual forecast .
The outlook pushed Monsanto shares down more than 3 percent in morning trading .
The shares closed on Wednesday down 2 percent at $ 68.09 , while the shares of rival DuPont slipped 0.05 percent to $ 38.79 .
PROFIT DOWN 19 PERCENT
The St. Louis - based company said its fiscal second - quarter net income fell 19 percent to $ 887 million , or $ 1.60 per share , compared with $ 1.09 billion , or $ 1.97 per share , a year earlier .
Excluding restructuring charges , Monsanto earned $ 1.70 per share .
By that measure , analysts were expecting $ 1.73 a share , according to Thomson Reuters I/B/ E/S .
Revenue fell 4 percent to $ 3.89 billion due largely to lower prices for the company ’s glyphosate - based Roundup herbicide .
Analysts had forecast revenue of $ 3.93 billion .
“ I ’m pleasantly shocked ” by the results , Edward Jones analyst Dan Ortwerth said .
“ I expected a disaster .
Roundup ( herbicide ) is a train wreck , but we knew that .
But the seed business is holding up well . ”
Grant said Monsanto is committed to Roundup , the most popular herbicide in the world .
The company has already launched a second generation of Roundup that will not be subject to the patent expiration .
Roundup is the underpinning of a major franchise for Monsanto that includes soy , corn and other seeds that are resistant to its main chemical , allowing farmers to use the herbicide liberally without fear of damaging crops .
Already , competition is starting to harm results .
Gross profit in the quarter slipped 17 percent to $ 2.1 billion because of price declines for Roundup .
For the first six months of the fiscal year , gross profit was down 30 percent or $ 1.2 billion .
And for fiscal 2010 , Monsanto now expects gross profit from its herbicides business of about $ 600 million , down from last fall ’s forecast of $ 650 million to $ 750 million .
In fiscal 2009 , the company made $ 1.84 billion from its herbicide business .
Seed sales and the company ’s genetic traits -- which are engineered into seeds to make crops resistant to pests , drought and other ailments -- grew in the quarter .
But executives admitted that Monsanto ’s share of the corn market was flat compared with 2009 and that the company had lost ground in the soybean market .
Monsanto is one of the world ’s largest producers of genetically modified seeds and the company has had problems recently with regions resistant to the technology .
The European Union , which bans GMOs , is currently weighing whether Monsanto ’s patent for soybean seeds extends to cover imports of processed soybean meal from Argentina to the EU .
At stake is more than 3 billion euros ( $ 4.1 billion ) of annual trade in Argentine soymeal to Europe .
Argentina is the world ’s top soymeal supplier and the European Union is its No. 1 client .

Monsanto took a restructuring expense of $ 84 million in the quarter , including a $ 54 million charge for U.S. corn cost - of - goods sold to exit some product lines in its U.S. branded corn business .

President George W. Bush ’s legal counsel and chief “ torture architect ” John
Yoo did n’t receive a warm welcome from everyone at the University of Virginia during a speech Tuesday .
Yoo , who was instrumental in constructing the legal framework with which the Bush administration carried out harsh interrogation techniques , intended to speak about his new book , Crisis and Command .
But some members of the audience refused to ignore his transgressions .

According to the Charlottesville , VA newspaper C - Ville , one man shouted at Yoo and then told the audience , “ I ca n’t believe that you all would actually tolerate a war criminal in your midst !
It speaks volumes about this country and the state that we ’re in ! ”
He was promptly escorted out by the police .
“ John , what about the torture memos ?
Can we talk about those ? ” someone else interjected during his speech .
Yoo did n’t flinch , replying , “ We ’ll get to that , do n’t worry . ”
“ There ’s nothing that justifies torture , John Yoo , ” said another , to which others responded with calls of , “ Oh shut up , ” and “ Throw her out . ”
One spectator held up a pink sign that read in block letters : “ SHAME ON YOO . ”
C - Ville reports that five members of the audience were ejected from Yoo ’s forum , and one was briefly held by the police .
Lieutenant Melissa Fielding of the UVA Police Department “ said that she has not witnessed protests of this magnitude during her time at UVA , ” the paper added .

Outside the Miller Center where he spoke , another protest reportedly ensued throughout the afternoon , which local law enforcement officials kept a close eye on .
The Bush lawyer was last month cleared of criminal charges by a Justice Department probe , and escaped with a slap on the wrist for “ professional misconduct . ”
George Gilliam , who chaired the event , expressed “ great personal sadness ” at the behavior of some of the dissenters , saying , “ We pride ourselves in this room on extending simple civil courtesy to our speakers . ”

Non-blocking ActiveRecord & Rails
Rails and MySQL go hand in hand .
ActiveRecord is perfectly capable of using a number of different databases but MySQL is by far the most popular choice for production deployments .
And therein lies a dirty secret : when it comes to performance and ‘ scalability ’ of the framework , the Ruby MySQL gem is a serious offender .
The presence of the GIL means that concurrency is already somewhat of a myth in the Ruby VM , but the architecture of the driver makes the problem even worse .
Let ’s take a look under the hood .
Dissecting Ruby MySQL drivers
The native mysql gem many of us use in production was designed to expose a blocking API : you issue a SQL query , and the library blocks until the server returns a response .
So far so good , but unfortunately it also introduces a nasty side effect .
Because it blocks inside of the native code ( inside mysql_real_query ( ) C function ) , the entire Ruby VM is frozen while we wait for the response .
So , if you query happens to have taken several seconds , it means that no other block , fiber , or thread will be executed by the Ruby VM .
Ever wondered why your threaded Mongrel server never really flexed its threaded muscle ?
Well , now you know .
Fortunately , the little known mysqlplus gem addresses the immediate problem .
Instead of using a single blocking call , it forwards the query to the server , and then starts polling for the response .
For the curious , there are also two implementations , one in pure Ruby with a select loop , and a native ( C ) one which uses rb_thread_select .
The benefit ?
Well , now you can have multiple threads execute database queries without blocking the entire VM !
In fact , with a little extra work , we can even get some concurrency out of ActiveRecord .
However , we could even drop threads in our quest for concurrency !
Instead of making every thread poll on a socket , we could pass each of those sockets to a single event loop ( EventMachine ) library , and let it handle all the IO scheduling for us : gem install em-mysqlplus .
Same API , in fact , it uses mysqlplus under the covers , but now every query has a callback for true non-blocking database access .
Take a look at a few examples in the slides :

Non-blocking Rails with MySQL
Now we come around full circle .
The downside of a true asynchronous library is that it requires callbacks , spaghetti code and a fully asynchronous stack .
Thankfully , we already have
Thin for our async app server , and with the introduction of Fibers in Ruby 1.9 , we can wrap our asynchronous driver to behave just as if it had a blocking API .
So , we install em-mysqlplus , require em-synchrony to emulate the ‘ blocking api ’ , implement an activerecord adapter , and we finally have a fully non-blocking ActiveRecord driver which we can drop into our Rails app !
Well , almost , a few other modifications : Rails provides a threaded ConnectionPool , which we need to replace with a Fiber aware one , and finally , we need to disable the built in Mutex ( hap tip to Mike Perham for doing all the dirty work for us ) .
Now let ’s give it a try :
class WidgetsController < ApplicationController def index Widget . find_by_sql ( " select sleep ( 1 ) " ) render : text =>
" Oh hai " end end
$ thin - D start $ ab -c 5 -n 10 http://127.0.0.1/widgets/
# Server Software : thin # Server Hostname : 127.0.0.1 # Server Port : 3000 # # Concurrency Level : 5 # Time taken for tests : 2.210 seconds # Complete requests : 10 # Requests per second : 4.53 [ #/sec ] ( mean )
Our widget action simulates a blocking one - second query , we start up a single thin server , and run an ab test against it : 10 requests , with a max concurrency of 5 .
And as you can see , the test finishes in just slightly over 2 seconds !
Rails 3 , Ruby 1.9 and Drizzle
By mid summer we will see production releases of Rails 3 , Ruby 1.9 , and Drizzle , and that convergence is worth paying attention to .
Both Rails 3 and Ruby 1.9 offer raw performance improvements across the board .
In the meantime , Drizzle already provides a fully async libdrizzle driver ( talks to MySQL & Drizzle ) which we could adopt to future proof our applications .
Combine all three with a fibered ActiveRecord driver , an async application server such as Thin , and we could make some serious steps forward when it comes to performance of Rails : significantly lower memory footprint and much better performance across the board .
Most robots covered on this site push the envelope of technology , by working in space or eerily replicating flesh - and - blood humans .
But for Sam Todo , a student in the Togolese Republic in Africa , robotics is a way to put the outdated technology found in the garbage to new , innovative uses .
In this video , Todo displays a humanoid robot he created almost entirely from discarded TV parts .
But not now .
And the current news blackout along the border has only amplified fears , as false rumors of impending shootouts circulate unchecked , prompting many parents to pull their children from school and businesses to close .
It means that a mother can huddle on the floor of a closet with her daughter for what seems like eternity as fierce gunfire is exchanged outside their home , as occurred here recently , and then find not a word of it in the next day ’s paper .
And it means that helicopters can swoop overhead , military vehicles can roar through the streets and the entire neighborhood can sound like a war movie , and television can lead off the next day ’s broadcast talking about something else .
Even some authorities , including Mayor Óscar Lubbert of Reynosa , acknowledge that without news reports , it is harder for them to get a full picture of how much blood is spilled overnight , partly because the traffickers sometimes haul their dead comrades away before the sun comes up .
The violence was so fearsome last month that the American Embassy in Mexico City temporarily closed the consular agency in Reynosa , which offers assistance to Americans , many of whom manage the hundreds of manufacturing plants based here .
Closed on Feb. 24 , the office reopened on March 8 after a lull in the bloodshed , which has continued sporadically in recent days with clashes between traffickers and the police .
What remains unclear is whether the combatants have called it quits or are merely reloading for more battles to come .
Rarely , if ever , do the local news media mention the names of the groups engaged in combat or their top leadership .
The Texas press broke the story that the Drug Enforcement Administration traced the upsurge in violence in Reynosa to Jan. 18 , when a member of the Gulf Cartel killed a top lieutenant of the rival Zeta gang named Victor Mendoza .
The Zetas , founded by former members of the Mexican special forces and known for both their organization and their brutality , demanded the shooter .
The Gulf Cartel , which once used the Zetas as enforcers but now vows to eliminate them , refused .
Cooking meat at high temperatures or until it is well done could increase the risk of bladder cancer , say experts .
The warning to barbecue lovers adds weight to other research that suggested charred meat could cause other cancers , including pancreatic cancer .
In the latest study , scientists found that people who eat meat regularly , especially meat that is well done or cooked at high temperatures , may have a higher chance of developing bladder cancer .
Those with certain genetic traits also appear to be more at risk , according to the 12 - year study of 884 people with bladder cancer and 878 without .
Experts have shown that cooking meat at high temperatures creates chemicals that are not originally present in uncooked meat .
These heterocyclic amines ( HCAs ) are carcinogenic .
HCAs develop when amino acids ( the building blocks of proteins ) and creatine ( a chemical found in muscles ) react at high cooking temperatures .
The latest study was led by Jie Lin , an assistant professor at the University of Texas , and was presented at the American Association for Cancer Research 's annual meeting in Washington .
The team looked at the association between meat intake , HCAs and bladder cancer .
The National Cancer Institute 's food frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary intake of different meat and the results were split into four groups , from the lowest to the highest meat intake .
Compared with those in the lowest group of red meat intake , people in the top group – those people who consumed the most red meat – were 48 % more likely to suffer bladder cancer than those with the lowest intake .
" Higher intakes of beef steaks , pork chops and bacon were associated with increased bladder cancer risk in a dose - response pattern , " the researchers said .
The researchers added that people who ate a lot of fried chicken and fried fish were also at " significantly increased risk " .
Red meat that was either medium or well done was linked with a 46 % and 94 % increased risk of cancer respectively compared with that which was cooked long enough to still be rare .
The researchers analysed each person 's DNA to look for genetic variants in how the body responds to HCAs .
They found that people with seven or more unfavourable genotypes who had the highest red meat intake were almost five times more likely to suffer bladder cancer as those without .
Professor Xifeng
Wu , who worked on the study , said : " The results support what we suspected : people who eat a lot of red meat , particularly well done , seem to have a higher likelihood of bladder cancer . "
LAKE CITY , Fla. , March 9 ( UPI ) --
Authorities in Florida said residents who saw a man attempting to steal their car used the vehicle 's remote - controlled locking mechanism to prevent his escape .
The Columbia County Sheriff 's Office said the Lake City residents were alerted to a man trying to break into their car by a neighbor at about 5:40 a.m.
Friday and they used the remote control on their keychain to keep the alleged attempted thief from exiting the car , The Gainesville Sun reported Tuesday .

" So every time he tried to get out of the car , the owners just kept hitting the lock button on their key fob , and eventually he gave up trying to get out , " sheriff 's spokesman Sgt. Ed Seifert said .
Travis James Neeley , 19 , was arrested and charged with burglary of a vehicle , possession of burglary tools , criminal mischief and trespassing .
Investigators said another man , Peter Anthony Scandizzo , 25 , was seen driving by the scene of the incident and is believed to have been involved in the burglary plot .
He abandoned his car after a short chase and was arrested at about 8:30 a.m. in a Lake City home believed to belong to his mother .
Scandizzo was charged with fleeing and eluding , possession of marijuana , possession of burglary tools , loitering and prowling , conspiracy to commit burglary and resisting arrest .
Morgan 's Wonderland , First Large Theme Park for Those With Special Needs , Opens Saturday Morgan 's Wonderland focuses on people with cognitive and physical limitations .
April 9 , 2010  --
Saturday marks the grand opening of the first large theme park dedicated to people with special needs , and it's the realization of one father 's vision for his own daughter .
Morgan 's Wonderland , a 25 - acre oasis of fun for children and adults with special needs in San Antonio , Texas , grew out of an incident Gordon Hartman witnessed .
His 16 - year - old daughter Morgan – for whom the park is named – has a severe cognitive delay .
One day some years ago , he observed her watching other children who were playing in a pool .
He knew she wanted to join them , but because of the girl 's inability to communicate properly , she could n't .
For the former real estate developer , it was a defining moment , inspiring him to create a place where the words ' could n't ' , ' should n't ' and ' ca n't ' were n't part of the vocabulary .
He took $ 1 million of his own money , raised an additional $ 29 million , and built the theme park .
" I think ( Morgan ) was the true reason we worked so hard with so many people over the last three years to make this a reality , " he told " Good Morning America . "
" The blessing that Morgan has brought is beyond anything that I ever could have imagined and could explain . "
Park is High - Tech , Fully Accessible
The park 's 25 attractions are tailored to suit a wide range of cognitive and physical needs .
For the curious , there 's the Sensory Village with its abundance of light , touch and sound .
The carousel can lift wheelchairs up and down , and off - road vehicles are fully accessible to wheelchair - users .
There 's a music garden , water play area , pirate 's island , an amphitheater and the Wonderland Express -- a locomotive that runs through landscapes reminiscent of exotic , faraway lands .
The park also offers guests special bracelets with microchips so they can keep track of children who may wander off .
The radio frequency technology enables users to check on children from screens located all across the park .
Park Environment Enables the Disabled , Parent Says
Because big numbers can be overwhelming for many people with special needs , the park keeps careful control of the crowd size .
What 's more , for people with special needs , the park is all free .
Family members or caregivers get in for $ 5 .
The park has already been open to visitors , and they think it 's great .
Debbie West 's 11 - year - old son , Ashton , has cerebral palsy and ditaxia .
He struggles every day because of his condition , but on the day they visited the park , West watched her son enjoying a place where the accommodations were specially designed with him in mind .
" You know seeing ( him ) here without that limitation , it 's just overwhelming , " she said .
" I just admire anybody with disabilities who can just , they find their way , they make their way and do what they want to do , but they have to do it differently , " she said .
" You are only disabled in an environment that makes you that way .
And you are not here . "
For Gordon Hartman , that makes it all worthwhile .
" The best thing is when these kids come up to me and hug me and say ' thank you , ' and they do n't have to say thank you , you can see it in their eyes , " he said .
" That 's a good feeling . "

According to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas , a prisoner who was slammed to a concrete floor and punched and kicked by a guard after asking for a grievance form -- but suffered neither serious nor permanent harm -- has no claim that his constitutional rights were violated .
Thomas objected when the high court , in a little - noted recent opinion , said this unprovoked and malicious assault by a North Carolina prison guard amounted to cruel and unusual punishment .
The court ’s decision came a few days after Thomas ’ now - famous former law clerk John C .
Yoo was charged with flawed reasoning , but not professional misconduct , as a Justice Department lawyer when he applied much the same view toward the treatment of Al Qaeda prisoners .
In the so - called torture memos in 2002 , Yoo reasoned that subjecting prisoners to simulated drowning or “ stress positions ” in cold cells was not illegal torture because it did not cause the intense pain of a serious injury , equivalent to “ death or organ failure . ”

Thomas ’ consistent record of dismissing claims of prison brutality , most of them joined by Justice Antonin Scalia , shows that Yoo ’s view of torture was not that of a rogue lawyer .
Instead , it represents a strain of conservative thinking that looks back in history to define cruelty and torture , rather than toward what the court has called the “ evolving standards of decency . ”
Over two decades , Thomas and Scalia have repeatedly dissented when the court ruled for prisoners who alleged they were subjected to cruelty .
They include an inmate who was handcuffed to a “ hitching post ” and forced to stand shirtless for seven hours in the hot summer sun of Alabama .
Another involved an inmate from Louisiana who was repeatedly punched in the mouth by a guard .
According to Thomas , this harsh treatment did not qualify as cruel and unusual punishment .
“ Judges -- not jailers -- impose punishment , ” he wrote .
The two justices explained that the word “ punishment ” as it was used in the English Bill of Rights in 1689 referred to judges imposing punishment for a crime .
Prison guards do not impose “ punishment ” even if they mete out cruelty , they said .

Scalia raised eyebrows when he repeated this view on the CBS TV program “ 60 Minutes . ”
When asked about torture and cruelty toward prisoners , he discounted the possibility .
“ Has anyone ever referred to torture as punishment ?
I do n’t think so , ” Scalia said .
“ What ’s he punishing you for ?
He ’s trying to extract ” information , he said .
Yoo took a similar approach in his 2002 memo .
He said a CIA interrogator could not violate the law against using torture if his “ specific intent ” was to obtain information rather than to inflict pain .
This is one area of law where Thomas and Scalia are not in sync with the court ’s other conservatives .
When he was a young Justice Department lawyer , Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. argued on behalf of Keith Hudson , the Louisiana inmate who had been punched in the mouth and kicked by a prison guard .
A supervisor stood by and told the officers “ not to have too much fun . ”
The punches left Hudson with a swollen face , loosened teeth and a cracked dental plate .
Roberts argued in 1991 that this unprovoked beating was cruel and unusual punishment , and the high court agreed in a 7 - 2 decision in Hudson vs. McMillian .

Thomas and Scalia dissented and said Hudson did not have a “ serious injury . ”
Justice Harry A. Blackmun took them to task for this view .
If adopted , it would “ place various kinds of state - sponsored torture and abuse entirely beyond the pale of the Constitution , ” Blackmun wrote .
As examples , he cited “ whipping them with rubber hoses , beating them with naked fists , shocking them with electric currents , asphyxiating them short of death , intentionally exposing them to heat and cold , or forcibly injecting them with psychosis - inducing drugs . ”
The same issue of prison cruelty arose two weeks ago in the case from North Carolina .
In a 7 - 2 decision , with Roberts in the majority , the court revived a suit from Jamey Wilkins , who had filed a handwritten petition to the justices .
He had been punched and kicked , but a judge threw out his claim without a hearing because he did not show he had suffered a serious or permanent injury .
The Supreme Court reversed this decision and repeated its view that the use of “ excessive physical force ” is cruel and unusual punishment if it is malicious and unprovoked .
“ I continue to believe Hudson was wrongly decided , ” Thomas said .

Sheena Iyengar is the psychologist responsible for the famous jam experiment .
You may have heard about it :
At a luxury food store in Menlo Park , researchers set up a table offering samples of jam .
Sometimes , there were six different flavors to choose from .
At other times , there were 24 .
( In both cases , popular flavors like strawberry were left out . )
Shoppers were more likely to stop by the table with more flavors .
But after the taste test , those who chose from the smaller number were 10 times more likely to actually buy jam : 30 percent versus 3 percent .
Having too many options , it seems , made it harder to settle on a single selection .
Wherever she goes , people tell Iyengar about her own experiment .
The head of Fidelity Research explained it to her , as did a McKinsey & Company executive and a random woman sitting next to her on a plane .
A colleague told her he had heard Rush Limbaugh denounce it on the radio .
That rant was probably a reaction to Barry Schwartz , the author of “ The Paradox of Choice ” ( 2004 ) , who often cites the jam study in antimarket polemics lamenting the abundance of consumer choice .
In Schwartz ’s ideal world , stores would n’t offer such ridiculous , brain - ­taxing plenitude .
Who needs two dozen types of jam ?
“ The study hardly seems mine anymore , now that it has received so much attention and been described in so many different ways , ” Iyengar , a professor at Columbia Business School , writes in “ The Art of Choosing . ”
“ From the various versions people have heard and passed on , ” she adds , “ a refrain has emerged : More is less .
That is , more choice leads to less satisfaction or fulfillment or happiness . ”
Now Iyengar is having her own say about the jam experiment and the many other puzzles and paradoxes of choice .
More choice is not always better , she suggests , but neither is less .
The optimal amount of choice lies somewhere in between infinity and very little , and that optimum depends on context and culture .
“ In practice , people can cope with larger assortments than research on our basic cognitive limitations might suggest , ” Iyengar writes .
“ After all , visiting the cereal aisle does n’t usually give shoppers a nervous breakdown . ”

Oh what a great year for debate on Roth IRA ’s and Roth IRA Conversions !
Roth IRAs are a great tool for building up retirement savings , but some things have changed for conversions .
2010 has ushered in some new Roth IRA rules - here ’s what you need to know about the 2010 Roth conversions .
I recently received a comment from a reader that I thought garnered a little more attention .
Here ’s what the reader asked :
My wife and I had traditional non-deductible IRAs and converted at the beginning of this year .
We assume that the Roth conversions would n’t cause us any tax liability since our contributions to the traditional IRAs exceeded their values at the time of the conversion .
Have you heard anything about the tax implications of Roth conversions from traditional non-deductible IRAs ?
So what we know from the statement above is that they converted to Roth IRAs from Traditional , non-deductible IRAs .
We also know that there were no gains in the account , meaning it was strictly contributions – and they ’re wondering what their tax implications will be on this move .
This is a GREAT question !
What is a Traditional Non-Deductible IRA
Let ’s define what a traditional , non-deductible IRA is so that we are all on the same page .
Generally speaking a traditional IRA allows money to be contributed pre-tax , which means that you get to take a deduction for it .
It ’s deductible off of your gross income .
This also means that when you withdraw from your IRAs this money becomes taxable at that time !
So , for example , you put in $ 5,000 to a traditional IRA , you are allowed to subtract $ 5,000 from your income , which in turn gives you less reportable income to pay taxes on .
Of course the IRS has some funky little rules to spoil how much you can stash into traditional IRAs .
Basically , if you already participate in an employer - sponsored retirement plan – meaning you have a 401k , 403b or SEP IRA etc. – AND you make too much money then you get phased out of your “ deductibility ” of the IRA and the contributions then turn into non-deductible IRA contributions !
It ’s as if you put after - tax money into the IRA .
What are the Income Limitations for Deductible IRAs
Let ’s take a look at the rules for tax year 2009 :
If you are a single filer and are covered by an employer - sponsored retirement plan you begin getting phased out of your deductible IRA contributions if you have an adjusted gross income ( AGI ) between $ 55,000 and $ 65,000 .
If you ’re married filing jointly , covered under an employer - sponsored retirement plan then you begin getting phased out between $ 89,000 and $ 109,000 AGI .
If you ’re making more than this then your entire contribution to the Traditional IRA is non-deductible !
What are the Tax Implications of a Non-Deductible IRA to Roth IRA Conversion
Back to the question at hand – how will this affect me on my taxes ?
So here ’s a couple things to consider :
What is your basis ( contributions to the IRA ) and what is the earnings amount ?
In the reader ’s case they did n’t have any gains to worry about .
But if they did , they ’d have to pay tax on the earnings portion .
If you had no other IRAs in place ( including SEP , SIMPLE and Traditional ) then you ’re good to go – no taxes due !
If you did have other IRAs in place , then you may not be in as great a shape as you thought – you may owe Uncle Sam !
Here ’s what I mean on the last two :
The rule with a Non-deductible IRA is that you MUST aggregate all your non-Roth IRAs together as one big account when doing a Roth conversion in order to determine the tax liability .
Here ’s an example :
Let ’s say you have two IRAs with a total value of $ 30,000 .
One is a traditional IRA that has a $ 15,000 balance and all of that is pre-tax .
The other is a non-deductible IRA that includes $ 15,000 of nondeductible , or after - tax , contributions and no earnings as in the reader ’s case .
If you decide to convert all $ 30,000 of your IRA money , then $ 15,000 ( the amount you contributed to the non-deductible IRA on an after - tax basis ) would not be taxable since you ’ve already paid the tax on that money .
But the remaining $ 15,000 would be taxable because Uncle Sam has n’t got his piece of that pie yet ( it ’s pre-tax contributions plus earnings that have not been taxed yet )
Let ’s say you only want to convert your non-deductible IRA funds since there are no gains and you ’ve already paid tax on the contributions – what happens ?
In theory , this is a great strategy , but as mentioned , you have to consider all non-Roth IRAs as one big pie .
The Uh-Oh
In the example above , your already - taxed nondeductible contributions of $ 15,000 account for 50 % of your total , while the $ 15,000 of pre-tax deductible contributions and investment earnings represent the other 50 % of your $ 30,000 IRA pie .
Whether you convert the entire $ 30,000 or just a slice of it , 50 % is considered taxable income .
It does n’t matter where you take that slice from ( non-deductible or pre-tax ) – each has the same ingredients of taxable and nontaxable money as the whole !
What You Need to Do
If you find yourself in this situation , you ’ll need to fill out IRS form 8606 and wade through the instructions and the mire !

SALT LAKE CITY 
The man charged with the kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart , who was abducted from her home here in 2002 and held for nine months as a captive teenage wife , is back in court , and back under the microscope .
Federal prosecutors are trying to convince a judge that the defendant , Brian D. Mitchell , is not a delusional religious zealot  as a state judge concluded in 2005 when he found Mr. Mitchell mentally incompetent to stand trial  but rather a calculating criminal who simply used the trappings of religion as a tool of control and manipulation , especially in the interest of his libido .
“ Lust trumped religion , ” Dr. Michael Welner , a forensic psychiatrist at New York University School of Medicine , testified Friday for the United States Attorney ’s Office at a mental competency hearing for Mr. Mitchell .
The hearing , which is to run through next week before Judge Dale A. Kimball of the Federal District Court here , is dissecting Mr. Mitchell ’s behavior in ways , prosecutors and witnesses said , that were not possible the first time because of new information .
That includes 54 interviews Dr. Welner conducted with Mr. Mitchell ’s friends and relatives , additional observation of Mr. Mitchell ’s behavior over the years , and deeper analysis of his religious life .
Depuis mardi et jusqu ’au 13 février 2011 , la Cité des Sciences et de l’Industrie organise à Paris une exposition sur la contrefaçon en partenariat notamment avec les dounanes , l ’Union des Fabriquants , et l’Institut National de la Propriété Intellectuelle ( INPI ) .
« La vraie expo qui parle du faux « , selon son slogan , aborde à la fois les questions de violation de droits des brevets , des marques ou des droits d’auteur .
Une vitrine idéale pour les groupes d’intérêts qui cherchent à enseigner aux plus jeunes le respect de la propriété intellectuelle .
Mais l’art libre et le logiciel libre n’ont pas voie au chapitre pour montrer qu’il existe une alternative entre le tout propriétaire des industries représentées , et la contrefaçon .
Selon Isabelle Vodjdani du collectif Libre Accès , « initialement , les commissaires de l’exposition avaient prévu de consacrer un modeste volet à la présentation du Libre « , avec la présentation dans un coin de salle d’un « texte concis définissant le Libre , ses enjeux et ses perspectives « .
Toutefois , rapporte - t - elle sur son blog , « quatre jours avant l’ouverture de l’exposition , j’ai reçu un mail de la commissaire en chef m’informant que mon texte ne pourra pas ê tre diffusé « .
Le message disait : « notre partenaire principal , l’INPI , est farouchement opposé à ce que l’exposition donne la parole aux défenseurs du « libre » .
Nous avons essayé de discuter et d’argumenter avec eux mais l’INPI reste intransigeant sur sa position .
Nous sommes donc obligés , avec grand regret , de ne pas présenter votre parole que vous aviez , aimablement , accepté de rédiger et d’enregistrer « .
Cette censure est dérangeante à plus d’un titre .
L’INPI est un établissement public qui a notamment pour mission de « former à la propriété industrielle et d’œuvrer pour son développement « .
Il assure ainsi chaque année environ 15 000 heures de formation , dont sont sans doute exclues les questions liées aux licences libres qui prennent pourtant une place croissante dans l’économie , en particulier du logiciel .
L’INPI est aussi « fortement impliqué dans l’élaboration du droit de la propriété industrielle et représente la France dans les instances communautaires et internationales compétentes « , ce qui en dit long sur la défense du libre par la France à l’échelle internationale .
La Cité des Sciences est elle aussi un établissement public , qui selon sa présidente Claudie Haigneré a vocation à « promouvoir , sur tout le territoire et avec l’ensemble des partenaires de terrain , le rayonnement de la culture scientifique et technique « .
Or le logiciel libre est une part importante de la culture scientifique et technique française .
L’exclure en obéissant aux injonctions de l’INPI est contraire aux objectifs de l’établissement .
Contacté en début de matinée , le service de communication de l’INPI nous a indiqué ne pas avoir connaissance de l’incident , mais il devrait revenir vers nous avec ses explications .
This is Chiropractic Awareness Week .
So let 's be aware .
How about some awareness that may prevent harm and help you make truly informed choices ?
First , you might be surprised to know that the founder of chiropractic therapy , Daniel David Palmer , wrote that , " 99 % of all diseases are caused by displaced vertebrae " .
In the 1860s , Palmer began to develop his theory that the spine was involved in almost every illness because the spinal cord connects the brain to the rest of the body .
Therefore any misalignment could cause a problem in distant parts of the body .
In fact , Palmer 's first chiropractic intervention supposedly cured a man who had been profoundly deaf for 17 years .
His second treatment was equally strange , because he claimed that he treated a patient with heart trouble by correcting a displaced vertebra .
You might think that modern chiropractors restrict themselves to treating back problems , but in fact they still possess some quite wacky ideas .
The fundamentalists argue that they can cure anything .
And even the more moderate chiropractors have ideas above their station .
The British Chiropractic Association claims that their members can help treat children with colic , sleeping and feeding problems , frequent ear infections , asthma and prolonged crying , even though there is not a jot of evidence .
This organisation is the respectable face of the chiropractic profession and yet it happily promotes bogus treatments .
I can confidently label these treatments as bogus because I have co-authored a book about alternative medicine with the world 's first professor of complementary medicine , Edzard Ernst .
He learned chiropractic techniques himself and used them as a doctor .
This is when he began to see the need for some critical evaluation .
Among other projects , he examined the evidence from 70 trials exploring the benefits of chiropractic therapy in conditions unrelated to the back .
He found no evidence to suggest that chiropractors could treat any such conditions .
But what about chiropractic in the context of treating back problems ?
Manipulating the spine can cure some problems , but results are mixed .
To be fair , conventional approaches , such as physiotherapy , also struggle to treat back problems with any consistency .
Nevertheless , conventional therapy is still preferable because of the serious dangers associated with chiropractic .
In 2001 , a systematic review of five studies revealed that roughly half of all chiropractic patients experience temporary adverse effects , such as pain , numbness , stiffness , dizziness and headaches .
These are relatively minor effects , but the frequency is very high , and this has to be weighed against the limited benefit offered by chiropractors .
More worryingly , the hallmark technique of the chiropractor , known as high - velocity , low - amplitude thrust , carries much more significant risks .
This involves pushing joints beyond their natural range of motion by applying a short , sharp force .
Although this is a safe procedure for most patients , others can suffer dislocations and fractures .
Worse still , manipulation of the neck can damage the vertebral arteries , which supply blood to the brain .
So - called vertebral dissection can ultimately cut off the blood supply , which in turn can lead to a stroke and even death .
Because there is usually a delay between the vertebral dissection and the blockage of blood to the brain , the link between chiropractic and strokes went unnoticed for many years .
Recently , however , it has been possible to identify cases where spinal manipulation has certainly been the cause of vertebral dissection .
Laurie Mathiason was a 20 - year - old Canadian waitress who visited a chiropractor 21 times between 1997 and 1998 to relieve her low - back pain .
On her penultimate visit she complained of stiffness in her neck .
That evening she began dropping plates at the restaurant , so she returned to the chiropractor .
As the chiropractor manipulated her neck , Mathiason began to cry , her eyes started to roll , she foamed at the mouth and her body began to convulse .
She was rushed to hospital , slipped into a coma and died three days later .
At the inquest , the coroner declared : " Laurie died of a ruptured vertebral artery , which occurred in association with a chiropractic manipulation of the neck . "
This case is not unique .
In Canada alone there have been several other women who have died after receiving chiropractic therapy , and Professor Ernst has identified about 700 cases of serious complications among the medical literature .
This should be a major concern for health officials , particularly as under - reporting will mean that the actual number of cases is much higher .
Bearing all of this in mind , I will leave you with one message for Chiropractic Awareness Week - if spinal manipulation were a drug with such serious adverse effects and so little demonstrable benefit , then it would almost certainly have been taken off the market .

The previous compiler magic has been replaced by a more systematic and predictable implementation in terms of implicit conversions .
Full details at : http://www.scala-lang.org/sid/7
Type specialization
Scala 2.8 adds specialized type parameters , which enable the compiler to generate transparently multiple versions of a given definition , and to use the most specific version whenever the static type information at a call site allows it .
Details at : http://www.scala-lang.org/sid/9
Named and default arguments
Named arguments improve the readability of method calls with many arguments .
Default arguments reduce code duplication , and enable " copy " methods for case classes , useful to generate quickly modified copies of case classes .
A complete description at : http://www.scala-lang.org/sid/1
Package objects
Packages can now contain besides classes and objects also methods , fields or type aliases .
These are added to a package by declaring a package object .
More capabilities might be added to package objects in subsequent releases .
Beefed up Scala Swing libraries , better documentation
Components publish key events , input events can be consumed , refactored window subhierarchy , additional demos , Swing listeners are installed lazily , more complete component caching , minor refactorings , bugfixes , more Scaladocs .
Design document at : http://www.scala-lang.org/sid/8
Revamped REPL
Many bugfixes .
Tab - completion for all packages on the classpath , as well as object and instance methods and fields , including type aliases and package objects .
Searchable history , integrated shell access , and a power mode which offers direct access to compiler internals .
Implicits changes
We have refined the implicit resolution process so that resolution is now able to determine type variables .
Improved equality
Equality across numeric types is to be consistent across all the primitives types , while also adhering to the equals / hashCode contract .
Numeric comparisons will have the same results as they would between Java primitives .
This is currently still being completed .
Packrat parser combinators
With support for packrat parsing , parser combinators are now able to handle left - recursive grammars and will show improved performance for ambiguous productions .
Improved XML library
Many bugfixes .
Type constructor inference
Type inference has been extended to deal with type constructors , so that , in certain cases , you can omit type parameter lists that contain higher - kinded types ( aka type constructors , e.g. , List ) .
Improved Annotations
Scala 2.8 adds support for nested java annotations .
For annotations on fields , it is now possible to specify which synthetic members ( getter / setter ) will have the annotation .
Documentation about Scala annotations can be found at : http://www.scala-lang.org/sid/5
Enhanced actors
New Reactors provide more lightweight , purely event - based actors with optional , implicit sender identification .
Support for actors with daemon - style semantics was added .
Actors can be configured to use the efficient JSR166y fork / join pool , resulting in significant performance improvements on 1.6 JVMs .
Schedulers are now pluggable and easier to customize .
Support for continuations
Continuations are supported by a compiler plugin , which is now supported as part of the main distribution .
Internal improvements
New presentation compiler
This new infrastructure , within the Scala compiler , enables IDEs to hook into the compiler to find efficiently information about the structure of the program under editing .
This new code offers a better platform for the development of IDE plugins .
New build manager
The new feature used by for example Eclipse to detect intelligently changes in the files and compile only necessary Scala sources , instead of performing clean build on whole projects .
This technique enables to significantly reduce the compilation time on bigger projects .
Speed improvements
The compiler now runs as optimised code .
In addition , a number of improvements and fine - tunings have further improved the compiler speed up to 50 % .
Bug fixes
Scala 2.8 includes a huge number of bug fixes ; the main ones are listed at : http://www.scala-lang.org/node/299
Scaladoc 2
A new look - and - feel , automatic comments expansion and wiki - like syntax , as well as compile - time error checking .
Read more about changes on the Scaladoc 2 mini-site .
Sbaz 2
Sbaz includes many bug fixes and enhancements .
It now gives better feedback to the user during lengthy downloads and while diagnosing dependency audits , which in turn have been re-factored and enhanced .
Sbaz should work properly on Windows using either cmd or cygwin , and is now capable of reliably updating itself .
Support for pack200 has been added , in some cases reducing file sizes up to 70 % .
Scalap
A new Scalap , contributed by the community , is included .
The new Scalap is aware of package objects and can decompile them by using < package_name >.
package
Scala IDE for Eclipse
The IDE has been extensively reworked with much functionality moved into the Scala compiler where it can be better maintained and reused by non-Eclipse IDEs and other tools .
The integration with Eclipse 's JDT has been deepened , and much previously Scala - specific behaviour and functionality is now provided directly by the JDT leading to across the board improvements .
If you would like to test the RC1 version of the plugin , just use the following update site :
http://www.scala-lang.org/scala-eclipse-plugin-rc
Please note that you must use this address as an update site within Eclipse as described on this page , it can not be visited using your internet browser .

Facebook to enter China within three months ?
Two years ago , there were reports about Facebook entering China , but now there is new inside information ?
I was pretty surprised when reading this news , especially because I just did a post comparing Renren ( Chinese Facebook ) and Facebook .
From iFeng :
On April 7 , according to a reliable source , the world ’s largest social networking site , Facebook , is preparing to enter China .
If all goes well , this plan will be implemented within 3 months .
Facebook has two ways to enter China : first , through a joint venture , and second , through cooperation and acquisition .
Now , I ’m not sure if this source is truly reliable , but the same report is coming from Sina and some other technology oriented sites as well .
Is there other evidence ?
According to the iFeng article :
Facebook was registered with a " .cn " domain name in 2006 , and that was when the media world also disseminated this information in China .
Additionally , afterwards Li Jiacheng invested more than 100 million U.S. dollars into Facebook and Facebook ’s potential entry into China was again brought up .
However , thus far , Facebook is still hovering on the outside .
So , it seems that there has been a build - up of events for Facebook to enter China .
Who is this Li Jiacheng ?
He is an extra wealthy Chinese that probably knows where to invest his money .
He is Chairman of Cheung Kong Holdings Limited and according to Forbes in 2008 , Li Jiacheng had total assets of up to 265 billion dollars .
I think if Facebook does enter China , they will probably have to agree to having their servers in China , or at least agree to a pretty strict and binding agreement in terms of content management .
Google just tried to prove that they " Do no evil , " and now Facebook might be changing their game plan .
Chinese internet experts are not too optimistic about Facebook ’s ability to capture a sizable market share in China .
Hu Yanping , the Director of DCCI Internet data centers in China , said that it will be very hard for Facebook to expand in China ’s current Internet environment , for most social networking already happens on QQ , Renren , or Kaixin001 .
Pretty strategic of China , right ?
Let local businesses get a firm grounding , and then let in the outsiders to fight for the leftovers .
Though Facebook ’s performance has been spectacular – they recently surpassed Google as the most visited site in the U.S.
Maybe that gave them enough of a confidence boost so they ’re not considering entry into the country with the most Internet users in the world .
DeviantARTist Zoroko went and created this Zora Link costume for herself to wear to Ohayocon .
It looks good .
No -- great .
No -- AMAZING .
It almost makes me wish I knew how to sew .
But it DOES make me wish I could have sex underwater without drowning ( I never learned to swim ) .
In the end I never really kept track of the final amount , but I estimate this costume cost at least $ 300 .
Each part took a good amount of time - I would say that the helmet was probably the most difficult out of the entire costume .
It was interesting trying to get the helmet to fit comfortably and get it to stay on my head without any problems ( lots and lots of hidden velcro ! ) .
The hat is filled with poly - fill to give it a more full overall look .
There are more details about how Zoroko made the costume over at her deviantART page if you 're interested , but I 'm having a hard time concentrating on anything but the whole underwater sex thing .
And I 'm not just saying that because I 'm standing on a chair with my penis in the fishtank , but I 110 % am .
Dammit you little plastic pirate , put the rum down and pay attention to me !
Hit the jump for several more shots of the impressiveness .

Chancellor Alistair Darling has set the stage for the general election with a Budget warning to voters not to put the recovery at risk by deserting Labour .
He cut stamp duty for first - time home buyers - but unveiled a series of tax increases for the better - off .
Mr Darling said Labour had been " right about the recovery " and cut by £ 11bn this year 's forecast £ 178bn deficit .
The Tories said Labour had made a " complete mess " of the economy and had " done nothing to clear it up " .
Tory leader David Cameron accused Mr Darling of stealing Tory policies on stamp duty and an extra tax on strong cider .
And , taunting Gordon Brown , he said : " The biggest risk to the recovery is five more years of this prime minister . "
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said both the chancellor and David Cameron were " in denial " about the scale of spending cuts needed and dismissed the budget as " a political dodge not an economic plan " .
" This is n't the preface to a new government but a footnote to 13 years of failure , " he added .
BBC Economics Editor Stephanie Flanders summed up Mr Darling 's message as " it 's bad , but not as bad as we thought - and not nearly as bad as it would have been under the Conservatives " .
Setting out the battle lines for the forthcoming election campaign , Mr Darling said : " The choice before the country now is whether to support those whose policies will suffocate our recovery and put our future at risk .
" Or support a government which has been right about the recession , right about the recovery , and is right about supporting the people and business of this country to build a prosperous future . "
Mr Darling said stamp duty on homes sales up to £ 250,000 would be suspended for two years for first time buyers , paid for by an increase to 5 % of the rate on £ 1 m homes .
This unfair fuel tax is another example of an uncaring , out of touch government .
Elfin Llwyd
Plaid Cymru
Cameron : Labour 's messed it up Darling in denial - Clegg
The chancellor also unveiled a series of other measures aimed at clawing back tax from high earners - likely to go down well with Labour MPs fighting an election next month .
He said he was freezing the inheritance tax threshold for another four years , in order to help pay for the costs of care for older people .
He also announced the end of some personal tax allowances on those earning more than £ 150,000 and a cut in tax relief on pensions for those with incomes above £ 130,000 a year .
He confirmed the government would stick to a 2.2 % real terms rise on spending this year but warned spending cuts after 2011 would be the " toughest for decades " .
' Toughest '
But to cut earlier , as the Conservatives were demanding , would be both wrong and " dangerous " and would risk derailing the recovery , he said .
" The task now is to bring down borrowing in a way which does not damage the recovery or the frontline services on which people depend , " he said .
" The challenge now is how we invest as a country to support the industries of the future and allow the talent of the British people to flourish . "
Mr Darling provoked roars of approval from Labour MPs when he announced a crackdown on tax evasion through new agreements with the governments of Dominica , Grenada and Belize - home of Tory " non dom " donor Lord Ashcroft .
The Treasury is insisting all of the new spending measures are fully funded from existing budgets and not paid for by the £ 11bn less than expected borrowing .
The stamp duty cut will cost the Treasury £ 230 m in 2010 - 11 and £ 290 m in 2011 - 12 to be funded by the introduction of a new higher stamp duty band of 5 % on properties costing more than £ 1 m from April next year .
Mr Darling said he would stagger next month 's scheduled increase in fuel duties - with the tax rising by a just a penny in April with another penny in October and the final instalment of 0.76 p in January next year .
But the most expensive measure in the Budget is a £ 600 m pledge to increase the winter fuel allowance for pensioners for another year .
Duty on beer , wine and spirits will increase as planned from midnight on Sunday , including 10 % on cider , with further increases to come on high strength cider .
Alcohol duties will also increase by 2 % above inflation for two further years from 2013 .
Tobacco duty will increase from today by 1 % above inflation and then increase by 2 % in real terms each year until 2014 .
In a series of measures aimed at boosting business , Mr Darling said business rates will be cut for one year from October , meaning a tax reduction for over 500,000 firms in England , and said state - owned banks would be forced to lend more .
He extended a six month job or training guarantee for under 24 - year - olds to March 2012 , and announced a one - off £ 270 m fund to create 20,000 extra university places .
Mr Darling said that stronger than expected tax receipts meant that government borrowing would be £ 167bn this year - £ 11bn down on the £ 178bn he predicted in the pre-Budget report in December .
' Right calls '
He said that the deficit would continue to fall faster than previously forecast - dropping to £ 74bn in 2014 - 15 , down £ 8bn on his earlier prediction .
The chancellor said he was standing by his forecast that the economy would grow by 1 to 1.5 % this year although he slightly downgraded his prediction for next year to 3 to 3.5 % compared to the 3.5 % in the pre-Budget report .
His forecast for the following years is unchanged .
He also revealed that the £ 2bn proceeds of a bank bonus tax was more than three times what the Treasury forecast in his pre-Budget report .

And he unveiled a guarantee to give everyone a basic bank account , giving up to a million more people access to bank accounts over the next five years .
Some of the more controversial measures in the Budget may not make it into law before polling day , which could be just six weeks away .
But the planned cut in stamp duty would probably stay in place whoever wins the election , as it is similar to existing Tory policy .
He also outlined plans to boost future economic growth , with billions invested in digital jobs , broadband for all , high - speed rail and biotech industries , using money from existing budgets .
Civil servant strike
If the Conservatives win the election they will produce an " emergency Budget " within 50 days of taking office which could reverse many of Mr Darling 's measures .
The chancellor did not unveil any new tax increases , with the new 50 % top rate of income tax expected to come into force from April and thresholds frozen .
Giving its reaction to the Budget , the SNP said Mr Darling should have scrapped the fuel duty increase altogether , adding : " The Labour government have shown they would rather save face with the City than support Scotland 's communities . "
Plaid Cymru 's leader at Westminster , Elfyn Llwyd , said : " This unfair fuel tax is another example of an uncaring , out of touch government . "
Business groups broadly welcomed the measures aimed at boosting enterprise .
CBI director general Richard Lambert said : " This was a clever , political budget .
However , anxiety remains on how the deficit is going to be paid down , and the growth forecasts for 2011 and beyond are still on the optimistic side . "
Derek Simpson , joint leader of the Unite trade union , said : " The last Budget before the election shows leadership and responsibility during difficult times . "
Lord Pearson , leader of the UK Independence Party , said : " The three old discredited parties who are debating our economy have once again avoided the elephant in the room , in any discussion about our economy which is of course the cost of our European Union membership . "
Green Party leader Caroline Lucas welcomed Mr Darling 's plan for a " green investment bank " but said overall the Budget was " a wasted opportunity to seriously put fairness at the heart of the agenda " .
« DR. DOOM : » : - Den greske krisen sprer seg
Professor Nouriel Roubini mener problemene med vaklende statsgjeld har forverret seg den siste tiden .
-KRISEN FORVERRES : Nouriel Roubini mener gjeldskrisen er i ferd med å spre seg til større OECD - land .

Den statlige gjeldskrisen i Europa , som i utgangspunktet dreiet seg om Hellas , er i ferd med å spre seg til mange av de andre store økonomiene i Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , ifølge Nouriel Roubini , økonomiprofessor ved New York University .
Professoren er også kjent som " Dr. Doom " , etter at han traff blink med sine spådommer om finanskrisen .
- Bærekraftighet i statsgjeld har eksplodert som et alvorlig problem i utviklede økonomier , spesielt i eurosonens " PIIGS " , Portugal , Italia , Irland , Hellas og Spania , men også i flere større OECD - land , inkludert USA , skriver Roubini i et notat publisert på Roubini Global Economics ' nettsider .
Møte om kriselån
I det frykten for konsekvensene av vulkanutbruddet på Island har begynt å avta noe , har Hellas igjen kommet i fokus :
Onsdag møtte greske myndigheter representanter for Det internasjonale pengefondet ( IMF ) for å begynne forhandlingene om betingelsene for et kriselån .
Årsakene til at Hellas sammen med flere andre euroland har havnet i denne knipen er sammensatte , mener Roubini .
- Problemene i eurosonen har oppstått først og fremst som en følge av tap av konkurransedyktighet .
Lønnsveksten og arbeidskostnadene har overgått produktiviteten .
Udisiplinert finanspolitikk har også bidratt til å forverre situasjonen , sammen med , og dette er avgjørende , appresieringen av euroen mellom årene 2002 og 2008 , slår professoren fast .
Tror ikke på redning
I likhet med den tilsvarende dystre George Soros mener Roubini det er lite betryggende at en redning av de greske statsfinansene nå kan stå på trappene .
- De nåværende EU / IMF - planene om å redde det verst stilte landet - Hellas - har blitt mottatt med velbegrunnet skepsis i markedene , ettersom tiltakene ikke tar hånd om kjernen i problemene ved gjeldssituasjonen .
Han venter derfor at eurosonen vil henge etter utviklingen i den økonomiske gjeninnhentingen gjennom 2010 , og anslår en vekst på 0,9 prosent i eurolandenes bruttonasjonalprodukt i år .
Til sammenligning venter han en vekst på 2,8 prosent i USA :
Asia , ekskludert Japan vil ifølge professoren ha en BNP - vekst på 8,2 prosent .

Burma ’s Oscar Moment
Over the next few days we ’re going to be hearing a lot about big blue aliens and George Clooney and bomb - disposal experts in the Iraq war .
But there ’s another film you should be rooting for when they hand out the little gold statues on March 7 .
Burma VJ has n’t been in the headlines much .
It has been making its way around the global film - festival circuit , garnering its share of awards .
Still , its U.S. box office receipts to date are measured in tens of thousands of dollars , not hundreds of millions .
Let ’s hope that ’s about to change .
The film is up for best documentary feature , and to be honest , I ca n’t imagine what could possibly compete .
You certainly can’t beat the story line .
In August 2007 a few thousand red-robed Buddhist monks took to the streets of Rangoon , Burma ’s biggest city , to join a nascent protest against the military dictatorship that has been crushing the life out of their country for nearly the past 50 years .
Burmese culture is deeply rooted in traditional Buddhist belief , so the monks ’ sally represented a particularly potent challenge to the regime .
What would happen next ?
Ordinary Burmese have risen up before .
A student - led nationwide protest back in 1988 had the generals on the run — until the Burmese Army retaliated with a bloodbath that took thousands of lives .
( The exact number will probably never be known . )
When the government grudgingly responded to popular pressure by allowing an election in 1990 , Burmese voters handed a solid victory to the party of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi .
The junta suppressed the results , threw Aung San Suu Kyi back into house arrest , and forced the country , at gunpoint , back into decades of stagnation .
News of the 1988 uprising trickled to the outside world in a few snippets of grainy film and a clutch of photographs , all precariously hand - delivered over the border to neighboring countries .
The events of 2007 would turn out differently .
As the monks ’ revolt that autumn took off , every moment was being filmed by a small squad of guerrilla video journalists — the " VJs " of the film ’s title — working for an opposition group , Democratic Voice of Burma ( DVB ) , that had spent years training them for just such an occasion .
The camera - wielding activists used cell phones and the Web to smuggle out their footage almost as fast as they shot it .
The images they recorded did n’t only generate international interest by keeping the outside world apprised of events ; their video was also beamed back into Burma via satellite , thus adding fuel to the protests .
This is the story told by Burma VJ .
Although the Danish filmmakers who crafted the documentary rely primarily on original footage shot by the DVB ’s on - scene journalists , they do n’t stop there .
We watch events unfold through the vantage point of Joshua , a DVB cameraman who has been forced to leave Burma because he has attracted the attention of government goons .
When the monks ’ protest begins , he ’s coordinating coverage from Thailand , keeping up with his colleagues back home by online chat and mobile phone .
Like us , he ’s at once involved and remote — a device that turns the unfolding story into an arresting mix of cinéma vérité and political thriller .
" I feel I want to fight for democracy , " Joshua informs us in a voice - over near the start of the film .
" But I think we had better make a longer plan .
We can not go out into the streets again and get shot because we have no more people to die . "
The protesters of 1988 , he muses , " were so brave , but sometimes I feel like they died for nothing . "
He wants , he says , to remind the world that " Burma is still here . "
That ’s exactly what Burma VJ manages to do .
The generals have kept their hold on Burmese society through the depressingly familiar mix of fear , force , and propaganda — and there are the handycams of the DVB reporters , cutting through it all .
We exult as ordinary citizens overcome their nervousness and join the monk - led processions .
We cheer as the crowd swarms in to protect the VJs from the white - shirted government thugs who try to drag them off to jail .
We marvel at the demonstrators ’ unforgettable chant : " May all beings living to the East be free ; all beings in the universe be free , free from fear , free from all distress ! "
And we choke up , with Joshua , when the monks finally dare to march down the road past the home of a certain Nobel Peace Prize laureate .
The VJs are n’t there , so all we manage to see is a blurry snapshot of Aung San Suu Kyi standing in her gateway , almost unrecognizable as she greets the monks .
" It ’s not a great photo , " Joshua muses .
" You can only see a small lady .
But we could n’t see her for a long time . "
Images , in short , are n’t just about their literal meanings ; they ’re also powerful conduits of emotion .
And , yes , they can also lie — as we see at the very beginning of the film , as Joshua contemplates government television broadcasts that depict a country happily united under its heroic leaders .
No question , the film reminds us of the overwhelming power of the unadulterated image , such as the video footage of a monk ’s corpse floating in a creek on Rangoon ’s outskirts , just after the moment when the regime finally decides to crack down on the monasteries .
Yet Burma VJ also touches upon the ambiguities that linger behind even the clearest images .
For example :
Is the aspiration to objectivity a luxury of people who live in healthy societies ?
The VJs in the film do n’t even pretend to be the usual journalistic bystanders .
They ’re perfectly happy to step in and strategize with the demonstrators .
We even see one journalist literally issuing marching orders :
He recommends a more effective route to a monk who ’s leading a procession , and the monk happily complies .
The fact is that there are no easy choices when you ’re trying to defy a regime as vicious as the one that rules Burma .
Just to take one example :
The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions accuses the country ’s military rulers of forcing hundreds of thousands of people — men and women , children and the elderly — to work against their will on government projects : " Refusal to work may lead to being detained , tortured , raped , or killed . "
Here ’s a cell - phone dialogue between Joshua and one of the activists on the other side of the border :
" People have to get arrested .
They have to die .
Monks , too . "
" Do n’t say that . "
" Our country is different from the rest of the world . "
" I do n’t understand politics .
But I do n’t want to see monks and people dying .
I ca n’t stand it anymore . "
" Be strong , my dear . "
That conversation , like many others in the film , is a reconstruction .
Jan Krogsgaard , one of the Danish filmmakers behind Burma VJ , explains that certain key moments in the narrative were n’t actually captured by the DVB journalists , so scenes were shot to fill in the gaps .
He insists that the makers of the film were careful not to stray too far from the bounds of authenticity ; some of the phone conversations in the film are based on the saved texts of online chats , for example .
In some cases identities had to be protected .
Director Anders Ostergaard even used actors in two episodes that are seamlessly presented as part of the DVB journalists ’ original on - location footage — a sleight of hand that has generated understandable controversy .
Time correspondent Andrew Marshall has taken the filmmakers to task for mixing authentic footage with acted scenes .
In an interview with me , Krogsgaard defended the reconstructions as " entirely legitimate , " saying they depict events that actually occurred but were n’t caught on camera , such as a secret police raid on the DVB ’s Rangoon headquarters as the government crackdown escalates .
( There is a corresponding disclaimer at the beginning of the film . )
This is an important discussion .
But I do n’t think it ultimately invalidates the film .
Burma VJ winds down just the way the story did in real life :
The regime ultimately succeeded in tamping down the protests by arresting the rebellious monks en masse .
Many of them remain in prison today .
The rest of the world may have moved on , but Burma continues to suffer .
At the end of February , the Burmese Supreme Court refused an appeal by Aung San Suu Kyi , who is struggling to be released in time for next year ’s scheduled general election .
The court ’s move was criticized even by Singapore , which has often been reluctant to scold the generals .
The outlook is n’t promising .
Even the small moral victories sometimes come at a depressing cost .
As Krogsgaard told me , the regime has been known to use DVB footage as an aid in identifying and arresting members of the opposition : " It ’s this unpleasant paradox — that every time you succeed , someone in Burma gets a harder time . "
For the moment , Burma is silent once again .
But the DVB ’s trainers have n’t given up .
They ’re hard at work , in Thailand and elsewhere , preparing the next generation of video journalists .
It will take as long as it takes .

Barak heading to US next week
An American official has played down the prospects of any immediate progress in US envoy George Mitchell ’s efforts to resume peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians .
" Are we expecting a breakthrough this visit ?
Probably not , " State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said Friday .
President Shimon Peres assured Mitchell on Friday that Israel was committed to peace .
Peres told Mitchell that whoever doubted Israel seriousness about achieving peace was making an error in judgment .
The president said that the Israelis , Palestinians and Americans are standing before a “ green light ” regarding the peace process .
Peres added that Mitchell ’s arrival in Israel was “ essential ” and that the Israeli government would like to see him succeed on his mission .
Earlier Friday , amid high hopes regarding the start of " proximity " Middle East peace negotiations , Mitchell reaffirmed the unshakable bond between Washington and Jerusalem during a meeting with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu , saying the special ties would only get stronger .
Mitchell stressed that the Obama administration was working to advance mutual Israeli and US interests , which he said were led by a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians based on the two - state solution , Israel Radio reported .
At the conclusion of the talks at the Prime Minister ’s Office in Jerusalem , the two agreed to meet again on Sunday .
Mitchell and Defense Minister Ehud Barak , meanwhile , agreed to meet again in Washington next week after their hour - long talks at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv on Friday morning .
Mitchell is hoping to announce the start of the indirect talks during his current three - day visit here .
The US envoy is expected to head to Ramallah in the evening for talks with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
Anticipation of a breakthrough was high on Thursday night , despite Netanyahu ’s reiterated refusal to halt construction in Jewish neighborhoods of east Jerusalem as the Palestinian Authority has been demanding .
Meanwhile , Barak ’s office announced that the defense minister would fly to the US on Sunday for meetings with heads of the Obama administration .
The meetings are expected to focus on security issues , including attempts to resume peace talks , said a statement Friday .
As well as Mitchell , Barak is set to meet US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , Defense Secretary Robert Gates , National Security Adviser James Jones , Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen and intelligence chiefs .

Glad to see the attempts to block this video by Nestlé were defeated .
Like the countless stories in recent years ago lead in toys or other harmful products introduced along the supply chain process , Nestlé is being targeted by Greenpeace because of the alleged ties to a company that is destroying the habitat of the endangered orangutan in Indonesia .
Nestlé probably did Greenpeace a favor in making this an even bigger story by trying to use their legal team to stop the video .
Remember , it ’s the best and brightest who go to work for these big corporates .

Mosul
Major Mark Bieger found this little girl after the car bomb that attacked our guys while kids were crowding around .
The soldiers here have been angry and sad for two days .
They are angry because the terrorists could just as easily have waited a block or two and attacked the patrol away from the kids .
Instead , the suicide bomber drove his car and hit the Stryker when about twenty children were jumping up and down and waving at the soldiers .
Major Bieger , I had seen him help rescue some of our guys a week earlier during another big attack , took some of our soldiers and rushed this little girl to our hospital .
He wanted her to have American surgeons and not to go to the Iraqi hospital .
She did n’t make it .
I snapped this picture when Major Bieger ran to take her away .
He kept stopping to talk with her and hug her .
The soldiers went back to that neighborhood the next day to ask what they could do .
The people were very warm and welcomed us into their homes , and many kids were actually running up to say hello and to ask soldiers to shake hands .
Eventually , some insurgents must have realized we were back and started shooting at us .
The American soldiers and Iraqi police started engaging the enemy and there was a running gun battle .
I saw at least one IP who was shot , but he looked okay and actually smiled at me despite the big bullet hole in his leg .
I smiled back .
One thing seems certain ; the people in that neighborhood share our feelings about the terrorists .
We are going to go back there , and if any terrorists come out , the soldiers hope to find them .
Everybody is still very angry that the insurgents attacked us when the kids were around .
Their day will come .
[ Post Script ]
The reaction to my photo of Major Bieger cradling Farah , the little girl who died in his arms , provoked a flood of messages and heartfelt responses from caring people around the world .
I have spent the last several days trying to read every message , and respond to as many as possible , but the flow has finally outpaced me , much as the swiftness of a river will finally defeat even the most determined swimmer .
This morning there was a banging on my door .
It was “ Q , ” loaded for battle , weapon in hand , wearing the military radio headphones with the microphone that wrapped around his face .
Bang , Bang , Bang !
Q hit my door .
“ Mike !
Where are you ? ! ”
“ Hold on , ” I said , opening the door .
“ Why are n’t you ready !
Grab your gear . . . we ’re going ! ”
My worn - out boots sat empty in the corner .
“ I ca n’t go today , ” I said , glancing in the direction of my laptop .
“ What ? ”
“ Just tell them I ca n’t go today . ”
“ Okay ! ” And Q trotted off back to his Stryker , leaving me behind .
The soldiers rolled out on their mission without me .
And now I sit here , answering a few final emails , while the men of Deuce Four patrol in Mosul .
My hands may be here , but my head and heart are on the streets in the struggle .
I ’ve been riding the wave of interest and feedback from that photo , but I need to get back to what I seem best equipped to do–posting dispatches about what is happening here in Iraq .
I will continue to read every message , and I offer my sincere thanks in advance for everyone who takes the time to send one , but , alas , with this dispatch , I must swim to shore .

Nvidia declares that 2010 is the year of the tablet and showcases a number of them running on its latest Tegra platform .
LAS VEGAS  Nvidia declared that 2010 is the year of the tablet at its CES2010 press conference , and went on to launch its latest Tegra 2 platform , running on a slew of them .
The company wanted these tablets to have the performance of a PC , but have the energy efficiency of a cell phone .
This is where the next generation of Nvidia 's Tegra 2 comes in .
It features a dual - core Cortex A9 processor part of its eight independent processors , which also include a Geforce GPU .
Nvidia claims Tegra 2 will have 10 times the performance of a smartphone , operating at only 500 milliwatts .
So battery life will be far better than products based on Qualcomm 's or Intel 's , according to Nvidia .
Mike Rayfield , Nvidia 's general manager for mobile products , said the company was switching Tegra 's focus from clamshell " smartbooks " to slate tablets in 2010 .
Considering that Tegra devices can't run Microsoft Windows  the OS does n't run on any ARM - based processor -- Nvidia wants to avoid the confusion that happened with the first Linux - based netbooks .
Those machines were returned to stores en masse because baffled consumers expected to be able to run Windows apps .
" People could be getting clamshells and assume they would be getting a Windows 7 PC , " Rayfield said .
" The tablet does n't have that kind of confusion . "
Tegra tablets will have desktop - level browsers with Flash support and extensive multimedia capabilities , but wo n't run familiar Windows software .
In fact , Nvidia announced that Adobe will port its Air platform to Tegra , enabling Flash for content such as digital magazines .
Five tablets were on display at the conference , including ones from FoxConn , MSI , NotionInk , Compal , and ICD  all working units with capacitive touchscreens ( 7 to 10 inches ) , no physical keyboards , some type of Linux interface ( the NotionInk and ICD tablets were running Android ) , and running on the same Tegra platform .
Each of these devices touts 140 hours of music playback and 16 hours of HD video .
And that 's the main appeal of Tegra the ability to playback rich video content ( in 720 p and 1080 p ) and be used primarily as an entertainment platform , while having all the battery benefits of a smartphone .
" If you want to buy a system that has days of battery life , has a great Web experience , but the Microsoft Office enterprise apps are n't necessary , then you buy this , " says Rayfield .
" I believe these devices will be significantly less expensive to build than a netbook , " he said .
" Our partners have talked about these devices retailing between $ 200 - 300 , and that could get subsidized down to zero , " he said .
There were n't any smartbooks displayed at the press conference , but Rayfield added that " I do believe smartbooks will come up as well , " just not this year .
Mobinnova , however , announced the Beam , a smartbook that runs on the Tegra 2 platform , but said that it was still looking into retail partners .
Connected cars and 3D Vision
Although tablets were the main attraction , Nvidia also announced a partnership with Audi , the German automobile company , to install in every one of its vehicles the Tegra platform in the upcoming years .
A vehicle cutout , with a working touch display mounted on the dashboard , was demoed with mapping software , running on Tegra 2 .
3D Vision will also a big part of Nvidia 's grand scheme , as the company announced that Asus , Clevo , and MSI will have laptops that support Nvidia 's 3D technology .
Desktop 3D displays from LG , Acer , and Samsung were also announced , each of them 3D Vision ready , with refresh rates of 120 Hz .
In bigger screens , Nvidia is partnering with the movie industry and announced Blu-ray in 3D .
Please stay tuned for our hands - on piece ( with pictures ) of the five tablets that were displayed .
Exclusive : ' Wellpoint would be a primary beneficiary ' if reform fails , investment firm says
" Of course , healthcare reform is a double - edged sword for Wellpoint shares .
Should reform fail , Wellpoint would be a primary beneficiary . "
That comes from the first page of the Cowen and Co. 's assessment of Wellpoint stock in 2010 and beyond .
The argument is simple : Wellpoint 's business model is uncommonly concentrated in the individual and small - group markets .
Those are the exact markets that health - care reform will drastically change .
Those are the markets where people get rejected for preexisting conditions , where insurers spend 30 cents of every premium dollar on administration and where rate hikes are volatile and constant .
Health - care reform wants to change all of that , and if it does , Wellpoint 's business model will be changed , too .
Wellpoint 's " 2.2 million individual members do leave it somewhat exposed to the 80 % individual [ Medical Loss Ration ] floor contemplated in the Senate bill and Federal oversight of rating action proposed by the President , " continues the analysis .
In English , that means the bill will force Wellpoint to spend at least 80 cents of every premium dollar on medical care for its customers , and it means that regulators are n't likely to let Wellpoint jack prices up by 25 percent with no warning or reason .
It also means that Wellpoint is not spending that much of premiums on medical care and is not keeping its rates under control now .
( It 's possible that " rating " is referring to regulations on things like age discrimination and preexisting conditions in this context .
It 's not clear from the writing , but it does n't change the point :
The bill regulates those practices , too . )
There are other insurers ( Aetna , for instance ) that have less to fear from reform because they are n't so highly concentrated in the marginal markets where the worst practices flourish .
But in recent weeks , Wellpoint has become to health - care reform what Sen. Jim Bunning is to Senate reform .
Day after day , they 're proving why we need reform , even if they stand the most to lose from these changes .
This is n't because they 're dumb .
It 's because their appalling practices are absolutely central to how they do their job .
Threats and scrutiny are n't nearly enough to get them to stop , because they are bound to the incentives of their system .
Only actual reform will change their behavior , because only reform can change the system , and thus their incentives .
Update : I 'd identified Cowen and Co. as a consultancy .
They 're an investment bank .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Four small banks across the United States were seized by regulators on Friday evening , ticking up the year bank failure tally to 41 .
The continued parade of bank collapses comes as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp is pulling back on loss - share agreements designed to lure bidders into taking on the assets of troubled banks .
Two of the banks that were seized were in Georgia , which has accounted for about one - sixth of all failures since the beginning of 2008 .
Unity National Bank of Cartersville , Georgia , had about $ 292.2 million in assets , and McIntosh Commercial Bank of Carrollton , Georgia , had about $ 362.9 million in assets , the FDIC said .
Georgia is paying the price for overly aggressive lending during the housing boom , particularly speculative commercial real estate loans .
The other two institutions that failed on Friday were Key West Bank of Key West , Florida , which had $ 88 million in assets , and Desert Hills Bank of Phoenix , Arizona , which had $ 496.6 million in assets .
The FDIC found buyers for the deposits of all four banks , and entered into loss share agreements with all of them .
The FDIC said on Friday that it has reduced the amount of losses it is willing to share with buyers of failed banks , indicating the agency ’s increased confidence in the market for these banks ’ assets and in the overall economy .
The agency said it will no longer take on 95 percent of the share of potential losses for certain assets of failed banks .
It will continue an 80/20 loss share in some transactions , the FDIC said .
“ As a result of better pricing , more competitive bidding and an improving economy the FDIC feels that it can explore this step , ” an agency spokesman said .
Through the end of 2009 , the FDIC entered into 94 loss sharing agreements , with $ 122 billion in assets under loss share .
The FDIC estimates it saved $ 29 billion through the loss shares , compared to an outright cash sale of those assets .

NASA 's best - recognized , longest - lived , and most prolific space observatory zooms past a threshold of 20 years of operation this month .
On April 24 , 1990 , the space shuttle and crew of STS - 31 were launched to deploy the Hubble Space Telescope into a low Earth orbit .
What followed was one of the most remarkable sagas of the space age .
Hubble 's unprecedented capabilities made it one of the most powerful science instruments ever conceived by humans , and certainly the one most embraced by the public .
Hubble discoveries revolutionized nearly all areas of current astronomical research , from planetary science to cosmology .
And , its pictures were unmistakably out of this world .
At times Hubble 's starry odyssey played out like a space soap opera , with broken equipment , a bleary - eyed primary mirror , and even a space shuttle rescue / repair mission cancellation .
But the ingenuity and dedication of Hubble scientists , engineers , and NASA astronauts have allowed the observatory to rebound time and time again .
Its crisp vision continues to challenge scientists with exciting new surprises and to enthrall the public with ever more evocative color images .
NASA , the European Space Agency ( ESA ) , and the Space Telescope Science Institute ( STScI ) are celebrating Hubble 's journey of exploration with a stunning new picture , online educational activities , an opportunity for people to explore galaxies as armchair scientists , and an opportunity for astronomy enthusiasts to send in their own personal greetings to Hubble for posterity .
NASA is releasing today a brand new Hubble photo of a small portion of one of the largest seen star - birth regions in the galaxy , the Carina Nebula .
Towers of cool hydrogen laced with dust rise from the wall of the nebula .
The scene is reminiscent of Hubble 's classic " Pillars of Creation " photo from 1995 , but is even more striking in appearance .
The image captures the top of a three - light - year - tall pillar of gas and dust that is being eaten away by the brilliant light from nearby bright stars .
The pillar is also being pushed apart from within , as infant stars buried inside it fire off jets of gas that can be seen streaming from towering peaks like arrows sailing through the air .
Hubble fans worldwide are being invited to share the ways the telescope has affected them .
They can send an e-mail , post a Facebook message , use the Twitter hashtag #hst20 , or send a cell phone text message .
Or , they can visit the " Messages to Hubble " page on http://hubblesite.org, type in their entry , and read selections from other messages that have been received .
Fan messages will be stored in the Hubble data archive along with the telescope 's many terabytes of science data .
Someday , future researchers will be able to read these messages and understand how Hubble had such an impact on the world .
The public will also have an opportunity to be at - home scientists by helping astronomers sort out the thousands of galaxies seen in a deep Hubble observation .
STScI is partnering with the Galaxy Zoo consortium of scientists to launch an Internet - based astronomy project ( http://hubble.galaxyzoo.org) where amateur astronomers can peruse and sort galaxies from Hubble 's deepest view of the universe into their classic shapes : spiral , elliptical , and irregular .
Dividing the galaxies into categories will allow astronomers to study how they relate to one another and provide clues that might help scientists understand how they formed .
For students , STScI is opening an education portal called " Celebrating Hubble 's 20th Anniversary " .
It offers links to " fun facts " and trivia about Hubble , a news story that chronicles the Earth - orbiting observatory 's life and discoveries , and the IMAX " Hubble 3D " educator guide .
An anniversary poster containing Hubble 's " hall - of - fame " images , including the Eagle Nebula and Saturn , is also being offered with downloadable classroom activity information .
To date , Hubble has looked at over 30,000 celestial objects and amassed over one - half million pictures in its archive .
The last heroic astronaut servicing mission to Hubble in May 2009 made it 100 times more powerful than when it was launched .
In addition to its irreplaceable scientific importance , Hubble brings cosmic wonders into millions of homes and schools every day .
For the past 20 years the public has become co-explorers with this wondrous observatory .
The Hubble Space Telescope is one of the most powerful and prolific science instruments ever made , earning a place as one of the technical wonders of the modern world .
From its lofty perch 350 miles above Earth , Hubble sees farther and sharper than any previous telescope , producing breathtaking images that have astounded astronomers and the public .
Its discoveries have revolutionized nearly all areas of astronomy , from planetary science to cosmology .
The telescope has imaged more than 30,000 celestial objects , snapping more than 570,000 pictures .
A series of heroic astronaut servicing missions to Hubble have made it the longest - operating space observatory ever built .
Thanks to routine maintenance and upgrades Hubble is 100 times more powerful than when it was launched .
In addition to its scientific importance , Hubble brings cosmic wonders into millions of homes and schools worldwide , allowing the public to be co-explorers with this wondrous observatory .
Here are some of Hubble 's top science discoveries .
An Accelerating Universe
By witnessing bursts of light from faraway exploding stars , Hubble helped astronomers discover dark energy , which pervades our universe .
This mysterious energy exerts a repulsive force that works against gravity .
The telescope also provided evidence that dark energy has been engaged in a tug of war with gravity for billions of years .
Hubble observations showed that the powerful energy is shoving galaxies away from each other at ever - increasing speeds , making the universe expand at an accelerating pace .
But dark energy was n't always in the driver 's seat .
By studying distant supernovas , Hubble traced dark energy all the way back to 9 billion years ago , when the universe was less than half its present size .
During that epoch , dark energy was struggling with gravity for control of the cosmos .
Dark energy finally won the struggle with gravity about 5 billion years ago .
By knowing more about how dark energy behaves over time , astronomers hope to gain a better understanding of what it is .
Astronomers still do not know what dark energy is , even though it appears to comprise about 70 percent of the universe 's energy .
How Old Is the Universe ?
Some people hate to reveal their age , and the universe , it seems , is no different .
Before Hubble was launched , astronomers had been trying for many years to pin down the universe 's age .
The method relied on determining the expansion rate of the universe , a value called the Hubble constant .
Their values for the Hubble constant were highly uncertain .
Consequently , their calculations for the universe's age ranged from 10 billion to 20 billion years .
One of Hubble 's key duties was to help astronomers determine a precise age for the universe .
The telescope 's keen vision helped astronomers accomplish that goal by measuring the brightness of dozens of pulsating stars called Cepheid variables , which are a thousand times brighter than the Sun .
By knowing their brightness , astronomers then calculated the stars ' distance from Earth .
From this study and other related analyses , astronomers determined the Hubble constant and the universe's age to an accuracy of about 5 percent .
By their calculations , the universe is about 13.75 billion years old .
Galaxies From the Ground Up
Hubble 's surveys of deep space showed that the universe was different long ago , providing evidence that galaxies grew over time through mergers with other galaxies to become the giant galaxies we see today .
The telescope snapped images of galaxies in the faraway universe in a series of unique observations , including the Hubble Deep Fields and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field .
In the most recent foray into the universe 's farthest regions , Hubble 's newly installed Wide Field Camera 3 produced the deepest photographs of the universe in visible and near - infrared light and uncovered galaxies that lived when the universe was only 600 million years old .
All of the " Deep Field " observations have shed light on galaxy evolution .
The galaxies spied by Hubble are smaller and more irregularly shaped than today 's grand spiral and elliptical galaxies , reinforcing the idea that large galaxies built up over time as smaller galaxies collided and merged .
By studying galaxies at different epochs , astronomers can see how galaxies change over time .
The process is analogous to a very large scrapbook of pictures documenting the lives of children from infancy to adulthood .
Hubble also probed the dense , central regions of galaxies and provided decisive evidence that supermassive black holes reside in the centers of almost all large galaxies .
Giant black holes are compact " monsters " weighing millions to billions the mass of our Sun .
Their gravity is so strong that they gobble up any material that ventures near them .
These elusive " eating machines " cannot be observed directly , because nothing , not even light , escapes their clutches .
The telescope provided indirect , yet compelling , evidence of their existence .
Hubble helped astronomers determine the masses of several black holes by measuring the velocities of material whirling around them .
Hubble 's census of more than 30 galaxies showed an intimate relationship between galaxies and their resident black holes .
The survey revealed that the black hole 's mass is dependent on the weight of its host galaxy 's central bulge of stars .
The bigger the bulge of stars , the more massive the black hole .
This close relationship means that black holes may have evolved with their host galaxies , feasting on a measured diet of gas and stars residing in the hearts of those galaxies .
Worlds Beyond Our Sun
At the time of Hubble 's launch in 1990 , astronomers had not found a single planet outside our solar system .
Now there are more than 400 extrasolar planets , most of them discovered by ground - based telescopes .
But Hubble has made some unique contributions to the planet hunt .
The telescope demonstrated that our Milky Way Galaxy is probably brimming with billions of planets .
Peering into the crowded bulge of our Milky Way Galaxy , Hubble observed 180,000 stars and nabbed 16 potential alien worlds orbiting a variety of stars .
Five of the candidates represent a new type of extreme planet .
Dubbed Ultra -Short - Period Planets , these objects whirl around their stars in less than an Earth day .
Astronomers made the discoveries by measuring the slight dimming of a star as a planet passed in front of it , an event called a transit .
The transit method was used again to make the first measurements of the atmospheric makeup of at least two extrasolar planets .
The Hubble observations showed that the atmosphere of a known extrasolar planet contains sodium , oxygen , carbon , and hydrogen .
A similar study of another alien world revealed probable signs of carbon dioxide , methane , and water .
These two Jupiter - sized planets are too hot for life .
The Hubble observations demonstrate , however , that the basic chemistry for life can be measured on planets orbiting other stars .
Finally , Hubble made the first visible - light image of an extrasolar planet circling the nearby , bright southern star Fomalhaut , located 25 light - years away in the constellation Piscis Australis .
An immense debris disk about 21.5 billion miles across surrounds the star .
The planet is orbiting 1.8 billion miles inside the disk 's sharp inner edge , about 10 times the distance of Saturn from the Sun .
Shining a Light on Dark Matter
Astronomers used Hubble to make the first three - dimensional map of dark matter , an invisible form of matter that makes up most of the universe 's mass and forms its underlying structure .
Dark matter 's gravity allows normal matter in the form of gas and dust to collect and build up into stars and galaxies .
Although astronomers cannot see dark matter , they can detect its influence in galaxy clusters by observing how its gravity bends and distorts the light of more distant background galaxies , a phenomenon called gravitational lensing .
Using Hubble 's sharp view , astronomers used the gravitational lensing technique to construct the three - dimensional map by studying the warped images of half a million faraway galaxies .
The new map provides the best evidence to date that normal matter , largely in the form of galaxies , accumulates along the densest concentrations of dark matter .
The map stretches halfway back to the beginning of the universe and reveals a loose network of dark - matter filaments .
Astronomers also used Hubble to observe dark matter 's distribution in the titanic collisions of clusters of galaxies .
In one case , a combination of Hubble and Chandra X - ray observations suggests that dark matter and normal matter in the form of hot gas were pulled apart by the smashup between two groupings of galaxies , known as the Bullet Cluster .
In a Hubble gravitational lensing study of another galaxy cluster , astronomers discovered a ghostly ring of dark matter that formed long ago during a clash between two groups of massive galaxies .
Astronomers have long suspected that such clusters would fly apart if they relied only on the gravity from their visible stars .
The ring is a ripple of dark matter that was pulled apart from normal matter during the collision .
Computer simulations of galaxy cluster collisions show that when two clusters smash together , the dark matter flows through the center of the combined cluster .
As the dark matter moves outward from the core , it begins to slow down under the pull of gravity and pile up .
Hubble does not travel to stars , planets , and galaxies .
It takes pictures of them as it whirls around Earth at 17,500 miles an hour .
In its 20 years of viewing the heavens , NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope has made more than 930,000 observations and snapped over 570,000 images of 30,000 celestial objects .
In its 20 - year lifetime the telescope has made more than 110,000 trips around our planet .
With those trips , Hubble has racked up plenty of frequent - flier miles , about 2.8 billion , which is Neptune 's average distance from the Sun .
The 20 years ' worth of observations has produced more than 45 terabytes of data , enough information to fill nearly 5,800 DVDs .
Each month the orbiting observatory generates more than 360 gigabytes of data , which could fill the storage space of an average home computer .
Astronomers using Hubble data have published more than 8,700 scientific papers , making it one of the most productive scientific instruments ever built .
In 2009 scientists published 648 journal articles on Hubble telescope data .

If the objective is to oppress and distress brown people --- to deny basic rights and freedoms to non-whites ---
I think the hypocrisy charge in unwarranted .
Giving Blackwater a pass in Iraq and Afghanistan , though not equivalent , is certainly consistent with giving James O’Keefe a pass in the United States .
It ’s simply what Breitbart does for a living .
Not only will Andrew Breitbart ignore the Blackwater story , but if he were to somehow obtain videos showing Blackwater mercenaries raping brown children , he would refuse to release the unedited videos and would instead produce heavily edited outtakes in hopes of demonizing the victims …
Just like he did when he somehow obtained videos showing James O’Keefe raping ACORN .
It ’s simply what Breitbart does for a living .

But Brad ...
All Blackwater did was steal millions ( no wait , sorry , that was BILLIONS ) of dollars , commit crimes , and ruin the reputation of the United States by killing innocent civilians in an illegal occupation .
ACRON , on the other hand , was committing the high crime of helping POOR people and registering poor voters .
The Corporate Powers that Be needed to put a stop to THAT kind of dangerous behaviour at all costs .

Well if that 's the measure for you it did n't stop you guys from commenting on ACORN .
Who was n't convicted as an organization and yet you guys went on and on about morals and integrity and corruption but meanwhile no peep about Blackwater .

DaleyRocks @ 8 asked : Bob Ross - Has Blackwater been convicted of anything outside your fevered brain ?
Bob spoke to this , so I 'll let him and you scrap it out , as it compares to ACORN .
But I 'll just toss in that Blackwater , though they were able to get off the hook in the U.S. , is likely to be brought up on charges for the murder of 17 civilians at Nissour Square in Iraq .
The killings earned them a ticket out of town from Iraq .
So , " convicted " there , yet ?
No. Believed to be responsible for the deaths of 17 civilians ?
Yes .
But , then again , they did n't have an employee fill out an extra voter registration form because they believed they needed to to keep their minimum wage job to feed their family .
Brad - Grade school post .

I 'll bite .
Though I 've spoken somewhat to this point already , when the NYTimes suggested the same thing ( apparently , you agree with that Liberal MSM outlet NYT ) , but what is my " agenda " and what is Andy's ?
Thanks in advance for your answers !

Dissillusioned @ 12 : That is Andy Breitbart 's AP feed .
He pays for , and posts whatever AP puts out , essentially .
That 's the site ( Breitbart.com ) that he used to get rich by linking to himself from DrudgeReport.com where he used to work .
That site funds all the political " Big " sites of his .
None of those sites give a damn about government corruption like Blackwater , etc .
They care only about their Republican political agenda .
Period .

Well , OF COURSE
Andy wont say anything about this ... he 'd loose to many of his pals and benefactors .
The fact is , the attack on ACORN had nothing to do with paper - thin concerns about corruption .
It was just a poor proxy for Obama , and Breitbart was hoping that by detonating ACORN he could blow up the administration .
Corruption is no real concern for Andy , James or Hoe -Bag Hannah .
If it were , they would have been all over the Jamie Lee Jones case ( which involved REAL kidanpping , rape , torture etc ... ) a LONG time ago .
For all that , Breitbart is still trying to save face after his shameless attempt to pass off false evidence of what happened during the period when Lewis etc ... were walking past the Tea Baggers .
He knows he 's been caught , yet again , in a calculated lie ...
I wonder if embarassment , or some other genuine human emotion , is finally working its way through his lumpy wide head .
But dont misunderstand ...
I am sure the boobs at BigGov are planning a new campaign of slander before the election ... and yes , it will be as false , pieced - together and totally misleading as anything else they put out - but I am sure they will try to pass of another slur of damaging lies again .

The scene is all too familiar to the modern moviegoer :
The theater is pin-drop quiet as Ben and Jen are about to declare undying love for each other .
Suddenly , the latest ring tone from Coldplay or 50 Cent blares from a teenager 's purse , filling the darkened movie house .
Not only is the moment lost , but so is the next , and the one after that , as patrons shush the naughty teen while she giggles her way through a phone chat with a friend .
" I 'm at a movie ... a movie !
Right , where do you want to meet ?
Oh , it 's really good , I 'll tell you all about it .
Later ! "
This could all change .
This past week the National Association of Theater Owners ( NATO ) pondered blocking cellphone signals as a way to improve the cinema experience .
The idea was a hot topic in the nation 's gambling capital this past week when theater owners from coast to coast met to preview the summer lineups from movie studios and trade tips on combating falling movie theater attendance .
The 6,000 - strong membership of NATO voted to authorize its board to look into changing federal laws that currently prevent them from using cellphone - jamming equipment in theaters .
" We have an issue with rude patron behavior , " says John Fithian , president of NATO .
" Cellphones going off in theaters is the most pronounced problem , " he says , adding that a recent NATO survey of theatergoers showed that nearly 80 percent favored some form of cellphone jamming .
" The overwhelming majority of our own members support the idea as well . "
For the moment , cellphone - jamming equipment is illegal in the US , even for agencies such as local police or fire departments .
However , other countries are beginning to crack down on rude cellphone users .
France recently changed its laws to allow movie theaters to use the jamming technology .
A number of Catholic churches in Mexico use Israeli military jamming gear to stop parishioners from interrupting services with their wireless chatting ( presumably with mere mortals ) .
Not surprisingly , the cellular industry 's national trade group , CTIA - The Wireless Association , is against the idea .
" We 're vehemently opposed for the simple reason that it 's no one 's right or prerogative to deny emergency communications to go through , " says John Walls , CTIA vice president of public affairs .
" That 's why jamming is illegal .
These are the public airwaves - they are for everyone , and everyone has a right to use them . "
Companies that manufacture jamming equipment are also opposed , on similar grounds .
" Jamming equipment should only be used by the government , such as the police and the bomb squads , not the general public , " says Howard Melamed of CellAntenna , one such company .
" Jamming is a weapon that should only be used against illegal activities . "
Mr. Melamed and others point out that there are less severe measures theater owners could take , such as paint that blocks signals and a new technology his own company will be offering by summertime , which he dubs " cell calming " technology .
It allows emergency calls to go through while stopping general - purpose calls without jamming the full spectrum of cell calls .
( Melamed is tight - lipped about the technology , saying only that it has a " patent pending . " )
However , others such as Bay Area moviegoer Peter Brown says the issue is one of basic manners .
Mr. Brown , a marketing consultant , says he and " a good friend " have found that a lightweight water pistol will work wonders with chatty cellphone users .
Though he does not recommend this technique to others , he notes with some satisfaction that they 've never been caught .
If the guilty party looks back to see who has nipped his neck with water , " we simply practice the quick whip - around and affronted look that insinuates that you , too , have been hit . "
