Each person who is facing the task of moving does so in a different way .
While there may be many things that work for you , it ’s also essential to ask for advice from others .
Tips from a moving company , in particular , can be incredibly helpful in getting things done more efficiently .
If you do n’t have a moving company in Seattle WA to work with just yet , then the information from Seattle moving companies that are shared below can help you get started .
1. Pack boxes properly .
If you ’re packing your boxes , then make sure to begin by using sturdy boxes .
From there , place heavy items on the bottom and lightweight items on the top .
Make sure to wrap delicate items carefully and avoid making boxes too heavy .
Once finished , it ’s crucial to label each box as detailed as possible .
It ’s also recommended to use one color of a sticker assigned for each room to easily group them .
2 . Know what you cannot pack .
Every moving company has rules about what they cannot place in the moving truck .
Make sure you read through these restrictions and get rid of anything that ’s non-movable .
The list will likely include paint , solvents , flammable liquids , aerosols , pets , food , and even some plants .
3. Leave a pathway .
After packing the boxes , do n’t place them in front of all the doors in the home .
Instead , put them to the side and leave them in the rooms where they belong .
It will make it easier for movers to come in , carry the boxes out , and place them into the moving truck .
By doing so can result in saving a lot of time while also minimizing frustration caused by not being able to maneuver around the house comfortably .
4 . Get rid of junk .
If you have junk lying around your house that has to go , take care of it before movers get there .
It can interrupt a smooth moving process because movers may find it inconvenient to navigate around the junk .
In addition to this , most movers will try to take everything in the house , which means they may accidentally take your trash into the moving truck .
5. Clean and organize .
Clean up the walkways , so they are easy to walk through without falling or tripping on things .
Movers need a safe space to get everything out , especially if they have to haul out large pieces of furniture .
It ’s also essential to organize boxes by room so the movers can decide where things will go inside of the moving truck .
6. Communicate with movers .
Keep in close contact with the movers that you hire to make sure you ’re both on the same page .
Talk about the contract , what they expect when they arrive , or if there are any extra fees , and what time you can expect them .
Clear communication is key to an efficient move .
Expert Advice for Less Stress
With the advice from Seattle moving companies above , you may be able to avoid some common mistakes that occur while relocating .
From knowing what to expect when movers arrive , to making sure you have everything properly packed , each step will ensure your move goes smoothly from start to finish .
Nintendo hit us with an update on a handful of Wii and Nintendo DS games today , including fresh details on the Wii version of Punch - Out !!.
Perhaps most exciting is unwavering confirmation of " classic " NES - style controls .

Sure , the company has to eat its own dog food and legions of Wii owners are clearly comfortable boxing with a Nunchuk and Wii Remote .
But that did n't stop us from nervously anticipating the new Punch - Out !! , which we understood to be motion control - only based on comments from Nintendo .
According to Nintendo of America 's press site , the alternate control scheme has the same button layout as the NES controller , using the D - pad to dodge , with the 1 and 2 buttons used to throw punches .
Big deal ?
Maybe we 're just excited for the upcoming blister possibilities .
So much better than perspiring while gaming .

Nintendo did n't reveal much more beyond that , merely reconfirming the appearances of boxers Little Mac , Glass Joe , King Hippo , Doc Louis , and Von Kaiser , plus " other unannounced favorites . "
The game hits in May , so we 'll probably know soon enough who those might be .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The number of Americans filing initial claims for unemployment insurance spiked , and those living on unemployment benefits hit a record high , according to a government report released Thursday .
For the week ended Feb. 21 , 667,000 Americans filed initial jobless claims , up 36,000 from a revised 631,000 the previous week .
That 's the highest figure since October 1982 .
Economists polled by Briefing.com were expecting claims to drop to 625,000 .
In a sign that more jobless Americans are having trouble finding work , 5,112,000 continued on unemployment for the week ended Feb. 14 , the most recent data available .
That 's the highest number since the Labor Department began keeping records since 1967 .
Initial claims are expected to sharply increase , and it's likely they will reach 750,000 per week in the upcoming months , according to Ian Shepherdson , economist at High Frequency Economics in New York .
He noted that weekly filings , adjusted for population growth , would have to exceed the 1 million mark in order to break the jobless claims reported from the mid-1970s and early 1980s .
" We fervently hope that does not happen but we are not confident .
Companies are throwing in the towel as they recognize that no sector is safe , " Shepherdson wrote in a note .
The 4 - week moving average of initial claims was 639,000 , an increase of 19,000 from the preceding week .
The average is used to smooth fluctuations in data .
The 4 - week moving average for people continuing on unemployment was 4,932,250 , an increase of 89,250 from 4,843,000 in the previous week .
The insured unemployment rate is 3.8 % , nearly double the 2.1 % rate from a year ago .
Stimulus :
The stimulus bill that President Obama signed into law has several provisions that help those living on unemployment benefits .
The weekly unemployment benefit will temporarily increase by $ 25 on top of the roughly $ 300 jobless workers currently receive .
In addition , the first $ 2,400 of benefits in 2009 would be exempt from federal income taxes .
The stimulus also provides jobless workers with an additional 20 weeks in unemployment benefits , and 13 weeks on top of that if they live in what 's deemed a high unemployment state .
( CNN ) --
A shootout in a border city that leaves five alleged drug traffickers sprawled dead on the street and seven police wounded .
A police chief and his bodyguards gunned down outside his house in another border city .
Four bridges into the United States shut down by protesters who want the military out of their towns and who officials say are backed by narcotraffickers .
Mexican police carry a body after a clash with gangs that left 21 dead in the state of Chihuahua on February 10 .
That was Mexico on Tuesday .
What is most remarkable is that it was not much different from Monday or Sunday or any day in the past few years .
Mexico , a country with a nearly 2,000 - mile border with the United States , is undergoing a horrifying wave of violence that some are likening to a civil war .
Drug traffickers battle fiercely with each other and Mexican authorities .
The homicide rate reached a record level in 2008 and indications are that the carnage could be exceeded this year .
Watch a reporter duck to avoid gunfire »
Every day , newspapers and the airwaves are filled with stories and images of beheadings and other gruesome killings .
Wednesday 's front page on Mexico City 's La Prensa carried a large banner headline that simply said " Hysteria ! "
The entire page was devoted to photos of bloody bodies and grim - faced soldiers .
One photo shows a man with two young children walking across a street with an army vehicle in the background , with a soldier standing at a turret machine gun .
Larry Birns , director of the Washington - based Council on Hemispheric Affairs , calls it " a sickening vertigo into chaos and plunder . "
By most accounts , that 's not hyperbole .
" The grisly portrait of the violence is unprecedented and horrific , " said Robert Pastor , a Latin America national security adviser for President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s .
" I do n't think there 's any question that Mexico is going through a very rough time .
Not only is there violence with the gangs , but the entire population is very scared , " said Peter Hakim , president of the Inter - American Dialogue , a Washington - based policy center .
Speaking on a news show a few weeks ago , former House Speaker Newt Gingrich called it a civil war .
Birns agrees .
" Of course it 's a civil war , but that only touches the violence of it , " he said Wednesday .
" It 's also a civic conflict , as an increasing number of people look upon the law and democratic values as something that can be violated . "
Hakim is not prepared to go that far .
" One has to be careful and not overdo it , " he said .
" Mexico is a long way from being a failed state .
Mexico has real institutions .
It paves roads and collects the garbage .
It holds regular elections . "
Enrique Bravo , an analyst with the Eurasia consulting group , points out that the violence so far is mostly affecting just drug gangs and is primarily localized along the U.S. border and Mexico 's western coast .
The violence along the border is particularly worrisome , analysts say .
" The spillover into the United States is bound to expand and bound to affect U.S. institutions , " Birns said .
Pastor and Hakim note that the United States helps fuel the violence , not only by providing a ready market for illegal drugs , but also by supplying the vast majority of weapons used by drug gangs .
Pastor says there are at least 6,600 U.S. gun shops within 100 miles of the Mexican border and more than 90 percent of weapons in Mexico come from the United States .
And it 's not just handguns .
Drug traffickers used a bazooka in Tuesday 's shootout with federal police and army soldiers in Reynosa , Mexico , across the border from McAllen , Texas .
" The drug gangs are better equipped than the army , " Hakim said .
Pervasive corruption among public officials is central to the drug cartels ' success .
" There is so much money involved in the drug trade , there is so much fear involved in the drug trade , that no institution can survive unaffected , " Birns said .
" This has really revealed just how corrupt Mexican officeholders are , " Hakim said .
In one recent instance , Noe Ramirez Mandujano , who was the nation 's top anti-drug official from 2006 until August 2008 , was arrested on charges that he accepted $ 450,000 a month in bribes from drug traffickers while in office .
Such dire problems call for a new way of looking at the situation , some say .
" The unthinkable is happening , " Birns said .
" People are beginning to discuss decriminalization and legalization .
...
There 's only one thing that can be done :
Take the profit out of it . "
Pastor calls the problem in Mexico " even worse than Chicago during the Prohibition era " and said a solution similar to what ended that violence is needed now .
" What worked in the U.S. was not Eliot Ness , " he said , referring to the federal agent famous for fighting gangsters in 1920s and ' 30s .
" It was the repeal of Prohibition . "
That viewpoint has picked up some high - level support in Latin America .
Last week , the former presidents of Mexico , Colombia and Brazil called for the decriminalization of marijuana for personal use and a change in strategy on the war on drugs at a meeting in Brazil of the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy .
" The problem is that current policies are based on prejudices and fears and not on results , " former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria said at a news conference , in which the 17 - member commission 's recommendations were presented .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon has taken the war on drugs to the cartels and some say it 's not working .
" It 's as if the burden of being the main arena of the anti-drug war has overwhelmed Mexican institutions , " Birns said .
" The occasional anti-drug battle is being won , but the war is being lost .
And there 's no prospect the war is going to be won . "
In the meantime , the killings will continue at a record pace .
On Wednesday , the Mexican cities of Torreon and Gomez Palacio reported at least eight shootouts involving heavily armed men .
The toll : seven dead , seven wounded .

This week , they 've highlighted a totally hideous Kwanzaa cake by Sandra Lee made with pre-made angel food cake , store - bought icing , and , obviously , corn nuts .
Well , Sandra calls them " acorns " but the recipe calls for corn nuts .
It also calls for popcorn and pumpkin seeds .
It would appear the hate mail about this cake was so numerous that Food Network pulled the recipe , but with a little digging you can still find it floating around .
In case you have always dreamed of a corn nut - cake hybrid , the recipe is at the bottom of the post .
The hate sites are pretty numerous , too .
Here are a couple :
And , the infamous recipe :
British soldiers are engaged in " a surreal mini civil war " with growing numbers of home - grown jihadists who have travelled to Afghanistan to support the Taliban , senior Army officers have told The Independent .
Interceptions of Taliban communications have shown that British jihadists – some " speaking with West Midlands accents " – are active in Helmand and other parts of southern Afghanistan , according to briefing papers prepared by an official security agency .
The document states that the numbers of young British Muslims , " seemingly committed jihadists " , travelling abroad to commit extremist violence has been rising , with Pakistan and Somalia the most frequent destinations .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
MI5 has estimated that up to 4,000 British Muslims had travelled to Pakistan and , before the fall of the Taliban , to Afghanistan for military training .
The main concern until now has been about the parts some of them had played in terrorist plots in the UK .
Now there are signs that they are mounting missions against British and Western targets abroad .
" We are now involved in a kind of surreal mini-British civil war a few thousand miles away , " said one Army officer .
Somalia is also becoming a destination for British Muslims of Somali extraction who have started fighting alongside al - Qa'ida - backed Islamist forces .
A 21 - year - old Briton of Somali extraction , who had been brought up in Ealing , west London , recently blew himself up in the town of Baidoa , killing 20 people .
The head of MI5 , Jonathan Evans , has raised the worrying issue of British citizens being indoctrinated in Somalia , and Michael Hayden , the outgoing head of the CIA , warned that the conflict in the Horn of Africa had " catalysed " expatriate Somalis in the West .
But it is in Afghanistan that British forces are now directly facing fellow Britons on the other side .
RAF
Nimrod aircraft flying over Afghanistan at up to 40,000 ft have been picking up Taliban electronic " chatter " in which voices can be heard in West Midlands and Yorkshire accents .
Worryingly for the military , this has increased in the past few months , with communications picked up by both ground and air surveillance , showing the presence of more British voices in the Taliban front line .
The men involved are said to try to hide their British connections but sometimes " fall back " into speaking English .
One senior military source said : " We have been hearing a lot more Punjabi , Urdu and Kashmiri Urdu rather than just Pashtu , so there appears to be more men from other parts of Pakistan fighting with the Taliban than just the Pashtuns who have tribal allegiances with the Afghan Pashtuns .
It is this second group , the Urdu , Punjabi speakers etc , who fall back into English in , for example , Brummie accents .
You get the impression that they have been told not to talk in English but sometimes simply can't help it . "
Some of the British Muslims had originally trained in Pakistan to commit attacks in Kashmir .
But security sources say the rising threat of Indian retribution , especially after the Mumbai attacks , had led to the Pakistani government curbing the activities of the Kashmiri separatist groups , so the fighters are being switched to Afghanistan .
The numbers involved in Afghanistan , the intelligence document shows , are relatively few , dozens rather than hundreds , but the pattern of involvement is described as a cause for concern .
Last week , during a visit to Helmand , the Foreign Secretary , David Milliband , was shown Taliban explosive devices containing British - made electronic components .
An explosives officer said the devices had either been sent from Britain , or brought over to the country .
They ranged from remote - control units used to fly model airplanes to advanced components which could detonates bombs at a range of more than a mile .
Evidence of British Muslims fighting inside Afghanistan and training in insurgent camps in Pakistan 's Federally Administered Tribal Areas has been provided to the UK authorities by the Americans .
The US has significantly stepped up its surveillance inside Pakistan as part of a more aggressive policy including cross - border raids by unmanned Predator aircraft .
The Americans are said to have raised the issue of the Pakistan connection , complaining that the UK is not doing enough to curb radical Muslims .
The US pointed out that this threatens their own security because UK passport holders can get into the US under the visa waiver programme .
The Conservative MP Patrick Mercer , the chairman of the Commons ' sub-committee on anti-terrorism , which has been examining the activities of British Muslim extremists , said : " We know the problem we have with UK - based jihadists .
We also know that a number of them have been arrested trying to leave the country .
With the UK intelligence services at full stretch , it is not surprising some of these jihadists had ended up in Afghanistan . "
Brigadier Ed Butler , the former commander of British forces in Afghanistan , said British Muslims were fighting his forces .
" There are British passport holders who live in the UK who are being found in places such as Kandahar , " he said .
" There is a link between Kandahar and urban conurbations in the UK .
This is something the military understands but the British public does not . "
Robert Emerson , a security analyst who has worked in South Asia , said : " There is ample evidence that British Muslims had trained in camps in Pakistan .
What is emerging now is a picture of them being more active in Afghanistan , either providing support and logistics or in active service .
The numbers are not particularly large , but it is worrying . "
Jonathan Evans , of MI5 , said the number of extremists wanting to travel to Iraq had " tailed off significantly " as Britain begins the drawdown of its troops in the country .
But there was " traffic " into Pakistan and Afghanistan .
" What happens in Afghanistan is extremely important because what happens there has a direct impact on domestic security in the UK , " he said .
" Pre -2001 , they were able to establish terrorist facilities and to draw hardened extremists and vulnerable recruits to indoctrinate and teach techniques .
If the Taliban is able to establish control over significant areas , there is a real danger that such facilities will be re-established . "
Last week , as Barack Obama ordered 17,000 extra US troops into Afghanistan , a confidential Nato report revealed that more than 30 per cent of the population believed the government of President Hamid Karzai had lost control of the areas in which they live and much of that has slipped back into Taliban control .
As the country contemplates a major reform and restructuring of the way we run our national health care system ( if it can even be called that ) , it needs to be pointed out that the mammoth health insurance industry is nothing but a parasite on that system .
Health insurance companies add zero value to the delivery of health care .
Indeed , they are a significant cost factor that sucks up , according to some estimates such as one by the organization Physicians for a National Health Program , as much as 31 percent of every dollar spent on medical services ( a percentage that has been rising steadily year after year ) .
Insurance companies are damaging in more ways than simply cost , though .
They also actively interfere in the delivery of quality medical care , as anyone who has had to battle with some " nurse " on the phone at an insurance company to get required pre-authorization for needed procedure can attest .
Just recently , the editor of a local weekly alternative paper in Philadelphia , Brian Hinkey , the victim of a near fatal hit - and - run accident last year who spent several days in a coma , and has been working hard to regain the use of all his limbs and faculties , reported in an opinion piece in the Philadelphia Inquirer on how his insurer after a few successful weeks of in - hospital rehab , denied him coverage for six critical weeks for out - patient rehab services , though every specialist on head injuries knows that early , consistent therapy is crucial to recovery of lost brain function .
This kind of human abuse is standard operating procedure for companies whose bottom lines are fattened the more services they can deny to insured clients .
My own father , once doomed by a metastasized cancer following prostate surgery , was saved by a procedure offered by a physician in Atlanta that his Blue Cross plan in Connecticut refused to pay for .
He had to finance the expensive treatment himself .
Now these medical system parasites are suddenly running scared , because it is clear that if everyone in America is to be guaranteed health insurance coverage -- a promised goal of the new administration of President Barack Obama , and , according to polls , the desire of a large majority of the American people -- they are going to stand exposed as a costly impediment to achieving that goal .
Insurance companies have managed to stay profitable and at least somewhat affordable to the private employers and workers who , together , have to pay for them , by denying care not just to policy holders , who are denied certain tests and treatments but especially to those who have known ailments , who are simply denied coverage altogether .
For decades , people with " pre-existing conditions " have been either barred from coverage , or have had to sign waivers that excluded them from getting coverage for treatment of those pre-existing conditions .
In the worst case , which is all too common , people have ended up dying because they could n't get treatment for common and easily treated ailments like high blood pressure or diabetes .
Now we hear that two big insurance trade groups , the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and America 's Health Insurance Plans , have offered to " phase out the practice of varying premiums based on health status in the individual market " in the event that all Americans are required to obtain health insurance .
Well sure they 're doing that .
If they did n't , the government would force them to !
The insurance industry , in saying that it would not price sick people out of coverage in a nationally - mandated health insurance scheme , is merely recognizing the political firestorm that would arise if it were not to do that , and were to force the sick and inform onto some government insurance plan , subsidized by taxpayers , while they just cherry - picked the healthy population , as they 've been doing now for decades .
The whole point is that if everyone is included in the insurance pool , instead of only the healthy population , then the overall cost of being chronically or critically ill to the individual is spread over the whole of society .
Premiums get adjusted accordingly .
Medicare is the model .
Here we already have a government plan that covers every single elderly and disabled person .
If we were to simply extend Medicare to cover everyone in America , we would essentially have the Canadian model of health care ( which , it should be pointed out , costs half what we pay in America for health care when private insurance and government programs are added together ) .
As with current Medicare , the government would pay for treatment , with private doctors and hospitals providing the care , and with the government negotiating the permissible charges .
That , in a nutshell , is what " single - payer " means -- the government is the single payer for all health care .
It does n't mean , as the right - wing critics claim in their scaremongering propaganda , that people would be forced to use certain doctors and certain hospitals .
Far from it .
That 's what private HMOs do .
Medicare is efficient ( only 3.6 % of Medicare 's budget goes to administrative costs , compared to 31 % for health care delivered through private insurance plans ) , its clients like it , and doctors and hospitals accept it .
We should not be tricked by this seeming sudden appearance of decency on the part of these corporate parasites .
There is simply no valid reason for preserving the private insurance industry 's role in any health care reform plan that is aimed at giving everyone access to health care in America .
The Obama administration needs to jettison its " free market " fetish when it comes to health care .
The financing of health care for all Americans can all be handled much better by the government .
Medicare has proven this .
Other countries -- Britain , Australia , France , Canada , Taiwan and most other modern nations have proven this .
Leave the insurance industry to handle our car insurance and our life insurance .
It has no more place in the delivery of health care than do tapeworms in the digestive process of our bowels .

I know why former Gov. Rod Blagojevich is continuing to speak out and insist to anyone who will listen that he ’s a victim rather than a perpetrator of sleazy politics in Illinois :
There ’s almost no downside for him .
As long as he stays on message – and he ’s been very disciplined about that – there ’s a chance he ’ll make a favorable impression on a potential employer or member of the federal jury that will hear his case if he is formally indicted on corruption charges .
Maybe a prominent attorney will see his side and volunteer to represent him for free .
But I do n’t know why national TV programs are still interested in hearing him speak out .
Driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol is never a good idea , and it can not only put your life in danger , but it can also harm other drivers on the road .
Recently , Dominique R. Taylor ( 33 years old ) , was convicted of killing six passengers while driving under the influence of alcohol and was [… ]
Four former servers at three upscale Washington D.C. restaurants blocks from the White House were arrested last week for allegedly using covert skimming devices to clone customer credit card data , in a year - long counterfeiting operation that 's put $ 750,000 in fraudulent charges on the plastic of Washington 's elite .
Servers at Clyde's of Gallery Place , M&S Grill , and 701 Restaurant , along with Maryland workers at Carrabba 's Italian Grill and the Gaylord Hotel , allegedly stole the card numbers .
According to the Secret Service , the data wound up in the hands of 28 - year - old Joseph Artemus Bush , III , a Maryland man who was repeatedly caught on surveillance video using counterfeit cards with the skimmed account numbers .
Bush 's alleged MO was to purchase American Express gift cards at area Target and Walmart stores , then redeem them at high - end shops like Barney 's of New York and Gucci .
Last week he was charged with credit card fraud , along with two alleged confederates , Erick V. Burton and Aaron Gilbert .
The four servers charged are Lavelle Denise Payne , Shannon Eileen McLaughlin , Jamaal Snowden and Simone Carrie Diane Folk .
With unobserved access to diner 's credit cards , restaurant wait staff have long been the source of a steady stream of stolen magstripe data .
It takes only a second to swipe a customer 's card through a tiny skimming device purchasable over the internet , which is easily concealed in pocket or apron .
Corrupt servers are typically recruited by a ringleader who encodes the data – like customer names and account numbers – onto blank cards , in some cases turning out full blown replicas , complete with holograms .
The servers often earn up to $ 50 per card if they work at an upscale eatery , down to just $ 10 each if , as in a recent Florida case , the cards were stolen from a Burger King .
The D.C. skimming ring was first spotted a year ago by Citibank , which noticed a froth of fraudulent transactions trailing legitimate card use at Clyde's , where cards skimmed by a single server wound up accounting for $ 107,000 in bogus charges .
The most prestigious , and recent , hot spot was 701 Restaurant , the clubby eatery where Hillary Clinton rang out her presidential campaign last June .
Restaurant owner Ashok Bajaj says the Secret Service told him about the skimming earlier this month .
According to court records , cash register logs tied $ 38,000 in fraudulent transactions to cards handled by server Lavelle Denise Payne from August 2008 until this month .
At the agency 's request , Bajaj kept Payne on for another week while the government firmed up its case .
" We watched her very carefully for that week , " says Bajaj .
" She was the nicest person .
I do n't know .
Maybe this is a sign of the economy . "
" It 's very sad when people do these things , " Bajaj adds .
" I mean , she was making excellent money working at the restaurant .
But I guess it 's never enough . "
__Update March 31 , 2009 | 12:30:00 : __A fifth server – Vasha Monique Carter – has been arrested in St. Augustine , Florida , and is scheduled for a preliminary hearing in Jacksonville on Wednesday .
Like defendants McLaughlin and Folk , Carter is a former waitress at M&S Grill in D.C .

WHAT do “ Guantanamera ” , “ Cwm Rhondda ” , Verdi's “ La donna è mobile ” , the Beatles ' “ Yellow Submarine ” and the Pet Shop Boys ' “ Go West ” have in common ?
They 're all part of the vocal repertoire of the modern football fan .
Not with their familiar words , of course , but as tunes to be chopped up , reworked and sent out again as newly minted battle cries .
I hear them all at a Saturday afternoon football match between Gillingham and Macclesfield .
The teams play in “ League Two ” of the English game .
It 's actually the fourth - highest division , but the names have lacked meaning for years .
Jon Baxter / Macclesfield Express
Outnumbered but not out - sung
For various reasons , I attend with my mother and two sisters .
And we 're all rather new at this .
One sister is a Macclesfield supporter by marriage , and has watched a few of their games .
We others know little of life in the lower ( or indeed any ) leagues and are here as chaperones .
An e-mail from the fan has briefed us well , warning us not to do anything so embarrassing as to bring an umbrella or a newspaper , and telling us that pie-eating at half - time will be compulsory .
The early part of the trip is tinged with fear thanks to easy stereotypes linking football and hooliganism .
As fans of the visiting team , we will be heavily outnumbered , chairs will be thrown at us , and we will have to fight shaven - headed men on our way back to the station .
But all fear dissipates as we enter Priestfield Road , Gillingham 's stadium .
It 's an impressive place , befitting a team that has enjoyed life in higher divisions .
The pitch is in good condition — no mean feat at this time of year .
The stands are clean .
Rock ‘ n ' roll blasts over the loudspeakers .
The mascot runs around with vim .
Players sign autographs .
The sun comes out , and God is in his heaven .
We 've missed the warm - up because my womenfolk were buying pre-match tea .
Most fans ' pre-match tipple is lager , drunk in the pub , but we were not brave enough to enter the drinking holes we saw around Gillingham station , and at least the PG Tips should ensure my mother does n't get too riotous .
Six minutes before kick - off there are still just 25 away fans in our stand .
Football is tribal and , unlike at a rugby match , home and away supporters do not mix .
A late surge pushes our numbers to the 60 mark .
We later learn that attendance is 4,620 , so Macclesfield supporters constitute 1.3 % of the gate .
It 's not the size of the crowd that really matters , though ; it 's how hard you sing .
What Macclesfield lacks in fan numbers and , as far as I can tell , football skills , is made up in singing .
Or to be accurate , the noises of a small but robust group of fans sitting at the back ( hereafter “ we ” ) , who chirrup for 90 minutes .
As the footballers set to work , so do we , with a song about identity —
“ Who are we ?
The Blue Army ” .
Then we chant “ Silkmen ” , the club 's nickname thanks to Macclesfield 's silk - making past .
Then it 's time to be rude , and we shout , “ You 're just a town of pikeys . ” “ Pikey ” is a pejorative term for Travellers , but often becomes a catch - all abuse for the white working class .
Perhaps the Macclesfield fans have noted that Gillingham is in a comparatively impoverished part of south - east England ; perhaps the song is always offered in southern grounds .
Macclesfield fans , supporting a team from the north of England , would usually expect “ dirty northern bastards ” in return , but Gillingham 's 4,500 - plus attendees are strangely quiet .
That may be because they 're busy watching the football pitch , where their team is outplaying Macclesfield .
After two minutes Gillingham score easily , a direct header from a corner , and we are silenced .
But the Gillingham choir is not what it should be .
It 's one thing not to sing when the score is 0 - 0 .
But up 1 - 0 , with the sun on your face , it 's a footballing crime to keep quiet .
And Macclesfield 's fans , noticing the monkish behaviour of their opposite numbers , are quick to point this out .
We offer “ 1 - 0 , and you still do n't sing ” ( tune : “ Go West ” ) , but the silence lingers .
“ Shall we sing a song for you ? ” ( tune : “ Cwm Rhondda ” ) and “ You 're just a town full of corpses ” ( tune : “ Guantanamera ” ) have no effect either , so we return to an earlier theme : “ Can you hear the pikeys sing ? ”
When not considering the other fans , we sing about affairs on the pitch .
“ Super Gareth Evans ” , “ Jonny , Jonny , Give us a wave ” ( and our goalkeeper obliges ) and some unprintables about the referee .
Later references are more historical .
“ We want our Cowell back ” ( tune : “ La donna è mobile ” ) is a paean to a linesman who officiated at a match a few weeks earlier , looked like the “ X - Factor ” supremo , and was constantly encouraged to “ vote off ” other players .
A song about a past Macclesfield hero , Stevie Burr , roared to the tune of “ Yellow Submarine ” , considers the wonder that would be a team made of 11 Mr Burrs .
But our choir 's vigour fails to work its magic .
Gillingham score again .
It 's 2 - 0 and Macclesfield become maudlin .
“ We 're shit and we know we are . ”
And then , from nowhere , comes a glimmer of hope .
Macclesfield are awarded a penalty on 79 minutes , which Super Gareth belts home .
With 11 minutes to go , we have a draw in sight and play with four men in attack .
The dawn proves false .
Gillingham score two minutes from the end , and it's 3 - 1 .
Or rather , because silence is not always golden , “ 3 - 1 and you still do n't sing . ”
At the final whistle the stadium announcer talks of a “ Code Red ” .
Nerves flutter as visions of fighting thugs briefly return .
But this seems to be an over - excited way to refer to the fact that fans in one stand have to leave by a different route from normal .
The mood of the Macclesfield fans , in the toilets after the match , is desultory .
The manager 's substitutions are questioned .
“ That was shit , ” say several .
Leaving the ground using the away fans ' exit , we manage one last chant about the pikeys .
But then our route takes us into the swell of Gillingham supporters and we decide it 's time to shut up .
( CNN ) -- A 93 - year - old World War II medic who froze to death last month in his Bay City , Michigan , home left his entire estate to a local hospital , an estate attorney told CNN Wednesday .
Martin Schur poses with his wife , Marian , in 1976 .
Local and state officials agree that Schur 's death was avoidable .
The attorney would not disclose the exact amount left behind by Martin Schur .
But his nephew said his uncle indicated to family members two years ago that he had saved up more than a half - million dollars over the years .
Schur and his wife , Marian , who died more than a year ago , did not have any children .
" I just know at one time he said he had over $ 600,000 in savings , " said William Walworth .
" That 's what he told me and my brother , and he was proud that he was able to save and build his estate up to that . "
Cathy Reder , an attorney negotiating on behalf of Bay Regional Medical Center and the Schur family , said she was filing paperwork in probate court Wednesday for the court to determine the validity of the will .
A hearing has been set for March 17 .
Reder would not specify the amount left to the hospital , other than to say it 's more than $ 1 .
" The will leaves everything to Bay Medical Center , " she said .
The hospital had no immediate comment .
Walworth said his uncle was a frugal man who had n't eaten at a restaurant for over 30 years .
" He was very tight , and he was very frugal .
But he did manage to save a lot of money . "
He said it 's possible his uncle 's estate could be less than $ 600,000 , but he believes it 's still " sizable . "
" Knowing my uncle , that 's him , " Walworth said .
" He loved his community .
He loved Bay City , Michigan . "
He added , " Hopefully his death is not in vain and we can learn from this , and he 's still able to save lives .
...
He was a very unique , special person in my life .
I 'm proud of what he was able to do in his life . "
He said he hopes his uncle 's message will spur others to " look out for their neighbor . "
The size of the estate -- if it's as large as the nephew believes -- adds another tragic twist to Schur 's death .
The power company limited his electricity because he owed about $ 1,000 .
Watch neighbor say the death is " unforgivable " »
Schur 's death last month shocked Bay City , a town of about 37,000 on Lake Huron 's Saginaw Bay .
The World War II veteran 's frozen body was found in his home January 17 , just four days after a device that regulates how much power he uses -- installed because of failure to pay -- shut off his power .
A medical examiner said the temperature was 32 degrees in the house when Schur 's body was found .
The medical examiner told The Bay City Times that Schur died a " slow , painful death . "
" It 's not easy to die from hypothermia without first realizing your fingers and toes feel like they 're burning , " Dr. Kanu Virani told the paper .
The Michigan State Police launched an investigation into Schur 's death for possible criminal violations .
" We have to do everything we can to make sure this does n't happen again , whether it 's Bay City or in any one of the cold weather states , " Bay City Mayor Charles Brunner said last week .
The death has prompted a review of Bay City Electric Light & Power 's rules and procedures for limiting or cutting off power .
It also resulted in Bay City residents protesting Monday to the city about its handling of the whole situation .
A neighbor who lives down the street called Schur 's death " unforgivable . "
" This ca n't be allowed to happen in this country , " said Jerome Anderson .
Walworth said he believes his uncle 's death was " preventable . "
" It should never have happened .
It 's a tragic loss , " he said .
" I had a lot of fond memories of my uncle , and that 's the type of memory I do n't want to have : Him freezing to death . "
Utility officials said Schur owed about $ 1,000 resulting in a " limiter " being put on his home .
Limiters are devices that cut power as a warning for people who have n't paid their bills .
Limiters can be reset to restore a lesser degree of power until a bill payment is worked out .
In Schur 's case , the limiter was never reset , and it 's unclear whether he knew how to do that .
Schur had been living alone since his wife died , Walworth said .
Unlike private utilities regulated by the state , Bay City runs and oversees its own utilities and therefore does n't fall under Michigan 's public service commission .
By law , Michigan requires private companies to prohibit cutting off service to senior citizens between November and April .
Seniors must register for the program .
The city has begun questioning whether its rules and procedures for limiting or cutting off power need a major overhaul .
The utility has stopped its practice of cutting power to customers who do n't pay their bills .
The utility also has removed all " limiters " on homes .
Walworth said someone should have looked at Schur 's payment history and made direct contact to see whether something was wrong .
He 's hoping the nation will learn from his uncle 's death .
" Hopefully , some good can come out of this .
I 'm still an optimist . "
CNN 's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report .

VICTORIA'S catastrophic bushfires sent AM radio listening figures rocketing in the first ratings survey of 2009 .
Victorians turned in huge numbers to 3AW and ABC 774 for information on the state 's worst natural disaster , according to the Nielsen survey , which covered the period between January 18 and February 14 .
The survey was also the first using a new method , in which each surveyed household is provided with only one diary to complete , rather than one per person .
As the official bushfire warning network , ABC 774's share of the audience soared from 11.4 to 14.8 per cent in the survey period , its highest ever .
Its main competitor , 3AW , increased its share from 14.4 to 15.9 per cent .
The increase in AM audience came mainly at the expense of Fox FM , which slumped 3.7 percentage points to 11.9 per cent .
All other FM stations except 3JJJ recorded falls .

Fox 's all - conquering duo Hamish and Andy lost 4.4 per cent of the drive - time audience , but still have the largest share at 19 per cent .
Peter Harvie , executive chairman of Fox 's owner Austereo , paid tribute to his AM competitors .
" It 's very good to see radio performing such an outstanding job under the extraordinary circumstances , " he said .

It seems to me much of the criticism about executive compensation has been misplaced .
What s supposed to be so horrible about CEOs getting big bonuses ?
 They just dont get it . 
 They re idiots . 
 They dont understand that people are hurting and angry . 
 They re insensitive to public perceptions . 
That might be true .
But is that really the problem ?
Is that whats important  whether or not CEOs know or care what we think ?
 They dont deserve it . 
 It s rewarding failure . 
OK , imagine this …
Suppose that certain executives at these companies had been working really hard , doing their best , etc. , etc .
And lets even suppose they re not the people who had made bad decisions , but they are doing their darnedest to repair the damage .
And suppose we had good evidence that , if it werent for their work , things would be much worse .
Given the circumstances , they might be described as moderately successful in their endeavors .
Even if this were the case , how would you feel if millions of taxpayer dollars that was intended to help save their companies was used to give them bonuses instead ?
Myself , personally , would still not be happy about it .
( I find it implausible that the bonuses , in the current environment , actually help the company be more profitable . )
On the other hand , suppose that a private company that has taken no bailout money decides to give a reckless and irresponsible executive a multi-million dollar bonus that he doesnt deserve .
This might be a bad idea for many reasons .
It will probably be bad for the company , and in turn , bad for everyone who depends on that company .
But , hey , if they want to shoot themselves in the foot , that s more or less their problem .
Investors and other people who depend on this company should be aware and take caution .
If such practices are harmful to companies , companies that are determined to engage in them should fail .
In sum :
Bonuses for well - meaning , deserving  executives for bailed out companies 
Grrr !
Bonuses for reckless , undeserving executives for private ( un - bailed - out ) companies 
Oh well .
Ergo :
The executives  being undeserving is irrelevant to how bad an idea the bonuses are !
So why are the bonuses so horrible ?
In my opinion , its because they constitute the transfer of vast sums of wealth from millions of Americans who cant afford it to a privileged few , which serves no other purpose than the interests of the few ( who also happen to have been a lot better off in the first place ) .
Who cares what they do or dont understand , what their motives are , or what they do or do not deserve ?
I dont .
This has got to be the biggest rip - off perpetrated against the American people in the history of our country .
And all people can complain about is that the beneficiaries of this scam are insensitive and undeserving ?!
But if we stop talking about the character flaws of CEOs , well have to start talking about the people who just handed them billions of dollars that we dont even have .
I mean , it s not as if they broke into Fort Knox and stole it .
 This is a red herring .
It s such a small percentage of the bailout ( or TARP or whatever ) money .
Complaining about it is great political theater , but in the big picture , the bonuses are irrelevant . 
OK .
Heres how to get away with wasting a billion dollars : First , spend a trillion dollars .
Then , when someone asks about how a billion of it was spent , point out that that is only 0.1 % of the total .
( Recall that the same kind of response was made in defense of various parts of the stimulus package .
It is so huge that to complain about multi-billion dollar expenditures looks like knit - picking . )
The sums of money here are just beyond my comprehension .
But Im not supposed to worry about amounts that are far more than I could earn in 10 lifetimes , because its a drop in the bucket of what the U.S. taxpayers are on the hook for .
And this is supposed to make me feel better why ?

A Swiss man has been jailed for six years for defrauding Germany 's richest woman out of millions of euros and attempting to blackmail her .
Helg Sgarbi , dubbed the Swiss Gigolo by the media , was also convicted at his trial in Munich of similar scams against three other , unnamed women .
He extracted 7 m euros ( $ 8.8 m ; £ 6.4 m ) from BMW heiress Susanne Klatten .
He then sought to blackmail her by claiming to possess a tape of her having sex with him in a hotel room .
Special Swiss representative in crisis zones
How Helg Sgarbi described himself to the women he defrauded Sgarbi , who apologised to his victims in court , has not said where the money he received is being kept or what happened to the alleged sex video .
He has also said nothing about Ernano Barreta , the man alleged to have been his accomplice , who is under investigation in Italy .
The BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Munich says there has been a huge amount of media attention on the trial , one of the most sensational in German judicial history .
Victim praised The Munich state court found Sgarbi guilty of fraud valued at 9 m euros and attempted blackmail .
HELG SGARBI Aged 44 , born in Zurich .
Originally had the surname Russak .
First reported to the police in 2001 by an 83 - year - old countess who had given him several million Euros .
Described by police as a smooth operator who knew how to win the trust of his victims .
Alleged to have connections with criminal gangs .
Described as a specialist in mergers and acquisitions in a glowing job reference from Credit Suisse , read out in court .
He is said to have not spoken about the cases since his arrest " out of respect to the ladies concerned " .
None of his victims were in court .
Sgarbi committed blackmail , telling his victims he had " compromising material " on them , prosecution spokesman Anton Winkler told reporters .
" In one case he said the material was stolen from him by the Mafia and now the Mafia was asking for money , but later he asked directly for money , " said Mr Winkler .
" In the second case he directly blackmailed his victim and told her that he had pictures .
He told her : ' You pay or I go public with the pictures and your privacy . ' "
Three of the women were referred to in the indictment by the initials H , S and R , to protect their identities , while Mrs Klatten gave permission for her name to be listed .
Prosecutor Thomas Steinkraus - Koch praised Mrs Klatten for her bravery in stepping forward .
" The only victim who came to us and gave a witness statement is Mrs Klatten , " he said .
" We had to find the others , with great difficulty . "
Photographers surrounded Sgarbi as he entered the courtroom , where he sat expressionless while the charges against him were read out .
Sgarbi's lawyer , Egon Geis , told the court the charges were " at their core , true " while Sgarbi himself said : " I deeply regret what has happened and apologise to the aggrieved ladies in this public hearing . "
' Your risk is high ' Prosecutors say Sgarbi met Mrs Klatten , a married business tycoon who owns a 12.5 % stake in BMW , in an Austrian spa resort in July 2007 .
Mrs Klatten was praised for her courage in testifying
In her witness statement , Mrs Klatten said he had been " charming , attentive and at the same time he seemed very sad " .
" That stirred a feeling in me that we had something in common , " she said .
They began an affair and in September that year , he persuaded Mrs Klatten to give him nearly 7 m euros by saying he needed to pay off the family of a girl he had injured in car accident in Florida .
The reclusive 46 - year - old mother - of - three handed the money to him in a cardboard box in the basement of a Holiday Inn hotel in Munich .
He later asked her to put a 290 m euros in a trust fund for him , which he said would enable them to start a new life together , but she refused to do so .
Mrs Klatten said he then threatened to make public a tape he had secretly made of them having sex in a Munich hotel room if he did not receive another 49 m euros , a figure he later reduced to 14 m .
In a blackmail letter , he is reported to have told Mrs Klatten : " While your risk is very high , my risks are irrelevant . "
Mrs Klatten was one of a string of Sgarbi 's alleged victims across Europe , who included the wealthy Countess Verena du Pasquier - Geubels , reported to be around 50 years his senior .
He told the women he targeted he was a " special Swiss representative in crisis zones " , which accounted for his sudden disappearances .
The countess reported him to the police in 2001 but later dropped the charges and died the following year .

First off , there were no new court filings today and relatively little occurred during the actual trial .
The Franken campaign called a number of voters to the stand and Mr. Mansky , the Ramsey County Elections Director , returned to testify about election judge training .
Secondly , and most importantly , I discovered an academic paper written in the year 1973 by a Harvard professor and a Columbia University professor ; I came across the document while searching for the court case Santucci v. Power [ 25 N.Y.2d 897 , 252 N.E.2d 128 , 304 N.Y.S.2d 593 ( 1969 ) . ] .
Prof. Micheal O. Finkelstein and Prof. Herbert E. Robbins coauthored this paper entitled Mathematical Probability in Election Challenges ; in spite of its age , the paper is surprisingly relevant to the Minnesota Election Contest at hand .
The first paragraph begins with a carbon copy of Coleman 's present position :
Defeated candidates in primary elections sometimes challenge the results in court and collect evidence of irregularities in support of their claims that the contests should be rerun .
Frequently , this evidence consists solely of proof that certain numbers of persons voted who were not qualified , with no evidence of fraud and no indication as to how such persons voted .
How large must this group be before a new election should be ordered ?
Source : Mathematical Probability in Election Challenges via JSTOR.org [ PDF ]
Let 's take a quick look at the current group of potentially erroneous and yet to be counted ballots within the realm of the Minnesota Senate Litigation :
804A + 4,458B + 1,391C = 6,653
A. Franken 's Amended List : Within Franken 's list of wrongfully rejected absentee ballots he presents 1,585 voters by name , but 781 are also found within Coleman 's list .
This leaves 804 new and unique voters presented by Franken .
B. More Extrapolations and Interventions :
The Coleman campaign listed 4,458 voters by name , on their website , whom they believe had their absentee ballots improperly rejected .
This number is realistically far less based upon the court 's constriction of eligible absentee ballots .
C. Coleman Futile Election Contest :
The 1,391 represents the number of votes above and beyond the number of voters recorded on Election Day within each precinct in Minnesota .
While the Harvard paper focuses strictly on New York law , it does present some interesting precedents as well as an excellent theoretical explanation of the probability involved .
I would highly recommend reading the entire paper as its only eight pages .
The next four paragraphs cover the aforementioned precedents as excerpted below :
The New York Election Law provides that a new primary election may be ordered when the " irregularities .. . render impossible a determination as to who rightfully was ... elected . "
Consider a two - candidate contest in which the winner prevails by one hundred votes out of ten thousand .
If there are 150 irregular voters , it is possible that more than 125 of them voted for the winner , so that their elimination would reverse the election .
Does this possibility mean that the rightful winner cannot be determined within the meaning of the statute ?
The courts have answered this question with intuitive assessments of the probability that the result would be reversed if the challenged votes were removed .
Thus , the Court of Appeals has articulated and applied the principle that the party attempting to impeach the results must show that the " irregularities are sufficiently large in number to establish the probability that the result would be changed by a shift in , or invalidation of , the questioned votes ?
Two polar assessments of the relevant probabilities may be illustrated by comparing Ippolito v. Power : with De Martini v. Power "
In Ippolito , the winner 's plurality was 17 votes out of 2,827 ; there were 101 suspect or invalid votes .
The court affirmed the lower court 's ordering of a new election .
Evidently relying on intuition , the court concluded that " it does not strain the probabilities to assume a likelihood that the questioned votes produced or could produce a change in the result . "
In De Martini , out of 5,250 votes , 136 were declared irregular and invalidated , no fraud being involved .
The winner 's plurality was 62 votes .
The lower courts and Court of Appeals differed in their estimates of the relevant probability .
The Supreme Court ordered a new election because " it is not beyond likelihood that the small difference of 62 votes could be altered in a new election ? "
The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed .
In reversing , the Court of Appeals observed that the majority of the winner would not evaporate unless at least 99 votes - i.e. , at least 72.8 % of the irregularities - had been cast in her favor .
The court found this unlikely : " It taxes credulity to assume that , in so close a contest , such an extreme percentage of invalid votes would be cast in one direction . "
It concluded that " a valid determination is not rendered impossible ... by the remote possibility of a changed result . . . . "
Subjective estimates of the relevant probabilities have thus varied .
There is , however , no reason to leave matters on a purely subjective basis .
Using an assumption about the character of invalid voting which will be defensible in many cases , the relevant probabilities can be readily computed .
Source : Mathematical Probability in Election Challenges via JSTOR.org [ PDF ]
Let 's assume for a moment , actually the rest of this article , that Minnesota has a provision similar to that of New York which provides for a new election in the event of prominent voting irregularities .
The Coleman campaign referenced the ruling established in Santucci v. Power yesterday in which " there were 101 suspect or invalid votes , " and this quantity , with respect to other factors , contributed to the Court 's decision to affirm the order for a new election .
The definition of " suspect " and " invalid " remains somewhat unclear in this context , so let 's just assume that the sum of all votes , either properly cast and not counted or improperly cast and counted , constitute the aforementioned definition of " suspect or invalid votes . "
Please note that this is likely not a valid legal definition , but this assumption will eventually allow me to make a mathematical point .
Let 's proceed with the math :
The variable d represents the margin by which the current leader , currently leads ; s is the number of votes cast for the second place candidate and k is the number of invalid or suspect votes .
A complete derivation of the above formula is available in the appendix of the paper .
The output of this function produces the probability of overturning the election result given the inputs , d , s and k .
Another formula is also presented in the appendix that allows for separate computations on the precinct level ; I may get ambitious and produce additional calculations for the 1,391 potentially double counted ballots at a later date .
For the purposes of this article , the formula above will be used .
Let 's do a sample calculation using the values defined within the image :
You 'll notice that Coleman has less than a 1 % change of overturning the election outcome if the already generous allotment of the 6,653 invalid votes are actually deemed to be invalid / illegal / suspect / etc .
While this number seems exorbitantly low , the New York case of Lowenstein v. Larkin [ 40 App. Div. 2d 604 , 335 N.Y.S.2d 799 ( 2d Dep't 1972 ) ] in 1972 contained a probability of overturning that was basically zero ( 8E - 85 ) .
The court however , still ordered a new election , although its widely accepted that the judges within this case possessed no intuitive probability skills and as such , they totally blew the ruling .
While we 've just illustrated that the < 1 % overturning probability is not a death sentence , he would need a little help in the form of a judicial blunder in order to receive a new election under out assumption of 6,653 invalid votes .
In order to obtain a legitimate overturning ratio , Coleman must increase the number of invalid votes , but that 's easier said than done as the graph below illustrates ; please note that the x-axis uses a logarithmic scale :
Here 's the big conclusion and it's littered with ifs :
If Minnesota Statute provided for a new election in the face of voting irregularities , Coleman would have less than a 1 % chance of overturning the current result .
If Coleman could somehow double the number of invalid votes , his overturning percentage would only reach 5 % which is still too low for an informed court capable of ordering a new election , to actually order a new election .
Using the principles from the 1973 paper , I think its fair to conclude that Coleman needs a massive anomaly , of one form or another , to emerge from this election contest with the lead , which is improbable but not impossible .
Update [ 5:08 PM CT 3/6/2009 ] : I used a mathematically incorrect equation to determine the probability of overturning .
The resulting correction did not materially affect the conclusion of the article ; the probability dropped from about .9 % to about .3 % .
One could however argue , as a commenter did below , that the conclusion is not particularly beneficial because the applied principles do not reflect the actual situation given the varying demographics of an entire state .
I 've since written a follow - up in which I re-calculated the overturning probability using county and precinct level data from various lists provided through the litigation process .
" It was decided and carried out : they washed her , cut her hair , raped her and killed her , " he wrote .
After that the case became one of the state 's earliest secrets , and no more than hearsay passed between soldiers .
Now the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz has used previously classified army documents to reveal the full story of what Mr Ben -Gurion called a " horrific atrocity " .
In August 1949 , an army unit stationed at Nirim in the Negev shot an Arab man and captured a Bedouin girl with him .
Her name and age remain unknown , but she was probably in her mid-teens .
In the following hours she was taken from the hut and forced to shower naked in full view of the soldiers .
Three of the men then raped her .
After the Sabbath meal the platoon commander , identified by Ha'aretz as a man called Moshe who had served in the British army during the second world war , proposed a vote on what should be done with her .
One option was to put her to work in the outpost 's kitchen .
Most of the 20 or so soldiers present voted for the alternative by chanting : " We want to fuck " .
The commander organised a rota for groups of his men to gang rape the girl over the next three days .
Moshe and one of his sergeants went first , leaving the girl unconscious .
Next morning , she complicated matters by protesting about her treatment .
Moshe told one of his sergeants to kill her .
She was forced into a patrol vehicle with several soldiers , two carrying shovels , and they drove off into the dunes .
When the girl realised what was about to happen she tried to run , but only made it a few paces before she was shot by a Sergeant Michael .
Her body was buried in a grave less than a foot deep .
A few days later the battalion commander , Yehuda Drexler , asked Moshe if he had carried out an order to return the girl to her village .
" They killed her , " replied Moshe .
" It was a shame to waste the petrol . "
He was ordered to write a report .
Ha'aretz has obtained a copy .
It said : " In my patrol on 12.8.49 I encountered Arabs in the territory under my command , one of them armed .
I killed the armed Arab on the spot and took his weapon .
I took the Arab female captive .
On the first night the soldiers abused her and the next day I saw fit to remove her from the world . "
He and most of the soldiers at the outpost were tried in secret .
Some said they were carrying out their commander 's orders .
The military judges rejected that line of defence .
Moshe denied rape .
" Morally speaking , it was impossible to sleep with such a dirty girl , " he told the court .
He was acquitted of rape but convicted of murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison .
The judges likened his stated willingness " to murder even women and children in cold blood " to " Hitler 's methods in France " .
Nineteen other soldiers received light sentences of between one and three years , mostly for " negligence in preventing a crime " .
The appeal court reduced their sentences , saying : " At the time there was a general feeling of contempt for the life of Arabs ... and sometimes wanton events occurred in this sphere .
All this helped create an atmosphere of ' anything goes ' .
" We are convinced that this atmosphere existed at the Nirim outpost , too . "
But the government and army understood the shame that would fall on the armed forces if the girl 's fate became known to wider Israeli society , so the murder and trial were classified as secret .
The case was briefly resurrected at the trial in 1956 of Israeli soldiers and police officers who murdered 43 Arab civilians in Kafr Qassem , to help establish the precedent that there is no defence in obeying illegal orders .
Then it disappeared from view again .
Several years later members of a kibbutz near the Nirim base noticed that the wind had uncovered a small hand .
Young women are more likely to suffer a fire - related death , research suggests
Young women in India are three times as likely to suffer a fire - related death as young men , according to a new study .
The study , published in the Lancet medical journal , looked at death statistics in India for the year 2001 .
Of an estimated 163,000 fire - related deaths , two - thirds of the victims were females , mostly aged between 15 and 34 .
These deaths are attributed to kitchen accidents , self - immolation and different forms of domestic violence , such as dowry disputes .
The study , conducted by Harvard University , Johns Hopkins University and independent researchers , looked at hospital records , death registries and verbal autopsy reports to find their results .
By combining several health data sets , the authors found that in 2001 there were 106,000 fire - related deaths among Indian women , mostly between 15 and 34 years of age - a number six times higher than the police recorded .
In all their research , there were " alarming " spikes in deaths by fire in the 15 to 34 age group of females in India , the authors said .
This could be attributed in part to " sudden exposure to the cooking environment " , though some believe that many homicides are covered up as accidents and are considered a cultural norm , so the police do little to investigate or intervene .
The relative youth of the demographic most affected also corresponds with the age distribution of fertility .
In addition , domestic violence is not unheard of in India .
Dowry deaths , in which a woman is doused with kerosene and then set on fire , are sometimes perpetrated by the family of the husband if the bride 's dowry does not meet expectations .
The Hindu practice of sati , the act of a widow 's suicide by jumping on to her husband 's funeral pyre , is illegal in India .
The study concluded that better research into fire - related deaths could produce policy measures that would prevent unintentional as well as intentional fire - related deaths among Indian women .

An alarming drop in tax revenues has blown a hole in the public finances , making it virtually impossible for the Chancellor , Alistair Darling , to hit the annual borrowing target he set out less than three months ago .
The steep fall in tax receipts in the crucial month of January pushed the budget deficit so far this year to a record high , even before a potential extra debt burden of £ 1.5 trillion caused by bank bailouts .
Public sector net borrowing was £ 67.2 bn between last April and January , Office of National Statistics ( ONS ) figures showed yesterday – its highest level on record .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The budget surplus shrank to £ 3.3 bn from £ 13.9 bn a year earlier in January , the month when the Government collects more than 10 per cent of annual tax revenues .
January 's figures are the most important for measuring the state of the public finances because they include self - assessment of income tax , financial sector profits and January bonuses paid to bankers .
The fall in revenues was partly down to the slashing of City bonuses , with most banks cutting annual payouts by about 50 per cent for 2008 .
The figures show how the Government , despite its attacks on banks and their lavish bonuses , has relied on the City for large chunks of its income .
They also illustrate the Government 's dilemma : by pandering to public opinion by clamping down on City bonuses , the public finances will suffer .
Howard Archer , UK economist at IHS Global Insight , said : " The public finances for January are terrible , coming in even worse than feared .
The alarmingly high Government deficit projections contained in November 's pre-Budget report are in fact significantly too low and will have to be revised up by Mr Darling in April 's budget . "
Total tax receipts for January fell to £ 53.8 bn from £ 60.5 bn a year earlier .
Company tax income dropped by 24 per cent , income tax was down 4.3 per cent and national insurance fell 2.9 per cent .
At the same time , spending surged 6.7 per cent as rising unemployment drove a 15 per cent jump in net spending on benefits .
For the first eight months of the financial year , tax receipts fell £ 10bn , far outstripping the Chancellor 's forecast of a £ 2bn slide for the whole year .
The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the shortfall sees the Government heading for an £ 87bn deficit for the fiscal year , £ 9bn more than Mr Darling forecast in November .
Public sector net debt was £ 703bn in January , or 47.8 per cent of gross domestic product and its highest level since the dark days of the late 1970s after Britain was forced to ask the International Monetary Fund for support .
The ONS said Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group , bailed out to the tune of £ 37bn in October , could add as much as £ 1.5 trn , the equivalent of 100 per cent of GDP , to the official debt burden because they will be classified as public - sector companies .
Economists say , however , that the figure vastly exaggerates the risk of absorbing the banks .
Kenneth Clarke , the shadow Business Secretary , condemned the borrowing figures as " staggering " and called on the Chancellor to cut public spending growth .

Mr Clarke told the BBC : " This is a problem now , it 's a problem paying interest on it , it is going to be difficult to sell gilts to finance it ... and it 's eventually going to slow down the recovery .
It is necessary to start setting out some medium - and long - term proposals to show how you are going to get back to normality and some sustainable levels of debt . "
The worsening public finances have marked out clear ground between the Labour Government and the Conservatives – who accuse Mr Darling of burdening the country with debt for a generation .
Angela Eagle , the Treasury minister , said : " What would be a disaster would be to cut public expenditure now . "
Markets predicting the future price of government bonds , or gilts , fell after the figures ' publication , on fears the Government will have to issue more debt to make up for the shortfall .
But a sale of 2012 gilts after the data came out met heavy demand , indicating appetite for government debt remains .
Brown invites Pope to UK
Gordon Brown has invited Pope Benedict to make his first official visit to Britain after the two men held talks at the Vatican .
The Prime Minister confirmed that he had made the offer during a private audience .
He said the Pope " was very welcoming of the invitation " , although no date had been set .
It would be the first papal visit since John Paul II came to the UK in 1982 .
Mr Brown said he suggested to the Pope that a visit could coincide with the beatification of Cardinal Newman , one of the most prominent members of the Church of England to convert to Catholicism .
No date has been set for the beatification but it was expected to take place either later this year or next .
Last month , Cardinal Jose Saraiva Martins , prefect of the Congregation for the Cause of the Saints , announced that the beatification of Cardinal Newman was " imminent " .
The Vatican said Mr Brown and the Pope had " cordial " talks .

This coming month will see that rare occasion - one every 28 years - when the Blessing Over the Sun is recited .
Though the sun is some 400 times larger than the moon , a blessing over the latter is made nearly 350 times more often than over the former .
This coming month will see that rare occasion when the Blessing Over the Sun is recited .
Jewish Law stipulates that a special blessing is to be recited when we see the sun at the same place , on the same day of the week , and the same time of day as when it was created .
The first chapter in Genesis , which tells the story of Creation , tells us that the sun was created on a Wednesday .
Precisely one solar year , or 365.25 days ( 52 weeks and 1.25 days ) later , the sun was in the same place – but not on the same day of the week , nor at the same time of day ; it was rather but rather a quarter of a day later .
The “ quarter - day ” problem is solved every four years , and the “ same day of the week ” issue is resolved every seven years – and both problems are solved simultaneously only once every 28 ( 4x7 ) years .
This year marks the culmination of a 28 - year - cycle since Creation ( 5769 - 1 = 5768 = 28x206 ) .
Thus , four weeks from now , on Wednesday , April .
8 , the vernal equinox , the sun will be in the same position , on the same day of the week and the same approximate hour , as it was when it was created .
This “ starting position ” actually occurs the previous evening , but we recite the blessing over the sun to mark this anniversary only when it is visible – that is , the next morning .
The special blessing - – “ Blessed are You … Who fashions the work of Creation ” - commemorates the vast greatness of G - d ’s Creation .
The last time this special blessing was recited , April 8,1981 , special gatherings were held in various locations for the public recital of the prayer – including atop one of the Twin Towers of the no-longer - extant World Trade Center in New York .
As with all prayers and commandments that must be performed in the morning hours , the ideal time to do it is as early as possible after sunrise .
The actual moment of sunrise is already “ occupied ” by the requirement to recite the daily Kriat Shma , which is immediately followed by the Amidah prayer and the conclusion of the morning Shacharit prayers – such that the Blessing Over the Sun should ideally be recited approximately a half - hour afterwards .
Sunrise in Jerusalem on April 8 will be at 6:19 .
In New York , it will be 6:28 ; 7:13 in Paris , 6:39 in Melbourne , 5:42 in Moscow , and 6:31 in Los Angeles .
After the blessing is recited – the same one said when seeing lightning , a falling star , an earthquake , and special works of nature – other prayers are recited as well , including chapters of Psalms .
Pamphlets with the appropriate selections are likely to be distributed wherever observant Jews gather , and the service is likely to be posted on many internet sites as well .
The Blessing Over the Sun is complicated this year by the fact that April 8 is also the day before Passover , already one of the busiest mornings in the Jewish calendar .
All chametz ( leaven ) must be burned or otherwise gotten rid of , first - born males must either fast or take part in a festive lesson concluding the study of a Talmudic tractate , and physical and spiritual preparations must be made for the upcoming Passover Seder meal .
Preparations for the once - every - 28 - years event are beginning to be made throughout the Jewish world .
Various publications on the topic are beginning to see light , including “ Birkat Hachamah - According to Chabad Custom ” ( Kehot Publication Society ) , an expanded Artscroll edition of “ Bircas HaChamah ” by Rabbi J. David Bleich , and more .
A children ’s book on the topic , entitled “ The Sun 's Special Blessing ” ( Pitspopany Press ) , has even been published this month .
It tells the story of a 3rd - grade class learning about the occasion – and digging up a time capsule buried in their schoolyard the last time the blessing was recited .

The Pennsylvania Association for Sustainable Agriculture ( PASA ) sent out information about HR 875 , which lists ' facts ' to counter ' myths ' and ' rumors ' on the internet .
It gives no specifics to back up its ' facts , ' so the following close up view of the bill and accompanying commentary offers readers a chance to decide for themselves what is myth and what is fact .
Sue Diederich heads the Illinois Independent Consumers and Farmers Association , an organization formed to protect the rights of farmers and consumers to deal directly with each other without government interference .
Neither of us are lawyers , but we both can read .
We invite progressive headliners to read the bills themselves and provide their own analysis .
The Left needs to understand what their conservative brothers and sisters in farming view as an alarming attempt to seize absolute control of all attempts at private ( non-corporate ) , healthy , organic food growing and sharing .
~LCC
People seem to expect HR 875 to be titled " The Criminalization of Organic Farming and the Take over of the US Food Supply . "
When they do n't see any words to that effect anywhere in the bill , they declare " this bill is fine " and those seeing dangers are " alarmists . "
Do they think the industrial side is composed of fools ?
These are the same people who make cheery cereals with cartoon characters on the box when , inside , high fructose corn syrup is all over the cereal which comes from Bt - corn associated with diabetes .
HFCS is , too , and there is an epidemic of diabetes here even among children .
They know how to package .
Why do people understand that industrial food inside a box can be a problem and yet are so innocent about looking at the bills , not realizing there is packaging there , too , or how much is at stake that the public and even legislators not see since this is about taking control .
The industrial side is n't stupid .
Understanding parts of the bill at times depends on smelling smoke as you read it .
Here in the US , we still have only smoke ... an Ohio state ag department SWAT team raid on an organic coop , Pennsylvania ag department raids on horse and buggy Mennonites , California setting coliform levels so low fresh milk dairy farmers would need cows that produced pasteurized milk right out the udder , arrest and handcuffing of a single mother in front of her children for selling goat milk , the USDA paying its agents bonuses for foreclosing on farms , ...
But in the EU where 60 % of the Polish farmers are now gone because of identical bills enacted into law there , and 60 UK farmers have committed suicide , there is fire .
And in Iraq , where they have been rendered helpless serfs by the theft of their country 's seeds and criminalization of farmers ' collection of their own seed , it is roaring .
And in India where 182,000 farmers have committed suicide since the WTO and IMF got hold of agriculture and our Big Ag firms went in there , and 8 million farmers have left the land , it is out of control .
The World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , run by the multinational meat packers and genetic engineering corporations , want HR 875 , here .
The bills are " harmonized " rules for globalization of food and lower food safety standards to allow for it .
Those corporations are members of NIAA , a corporate consortium that brought NAIS , created by Anne Veneman , to the USDA to be made into law .
We begin with PASA offering Food & Water Watch 's take on the bills to its members .
PASA 's assertions are in Times New Roman .

Levitt there 's a new study showing that it pays to be popular in high school .
Here 's his summation if the results :
" They find that each extra close friend in high school is associated with earnings that are 2 percent higher later in life after controlling for other factors .
While not a huge effect , it does suggest that either that A ) the same factors that make you popular in high school help you in a job setting , or B ) that high - school friends can do you favors later in life that will earn you higher wages . "
Come on , you 've gotta be kidding me .
I thought the geeks were supposed to inherit the earth .
What happened to Revenge of the Nerds ?
Is n't the whole darned point that all the uncool kids will get their revenge on the popular types by being , well , a lot wealthier when they grow up ?
We need some more evidence here .
I can't let this stand .
How can we live in a world where the losers in high school are , well , losers for life ?
Man , that 's depressing .
And the people with lots of close friends who were on the football team ?
They get to win ?
If " the same factors that make you popular in high school help you in a job setting , " it 's no wonder we 're headed for a repeat of the great depression .
We gave the jerks in the polo shirts the keys to the economy .

BEIJING , China ( CNN ) -- Zhao Jiuhe sweeps the floors at his dad 's restaurant , chats with customers and waitresses whom he calls " older sisters , " and clears the tables .
Jiuhe , who can speak some English , says he likes coming to the restaurant with his father .
But he is no ordinary 19 - year - old .
Jiuhe , who suffers from cerebral palsy , could not walk until he was four or talk until he was five .
His father started the Beijing eatery , " Hand in Hand , " to give his son a chance to improve his life after Jiuhe finished his education at a school for the disabled .
" It seems I am running a business , but I am actually taking care of him .
His growth at the restaurant and the business there are mixed together .
The survival of the restaurant is benefiting him , and is also a joy for our family , " Zhao Dongyue said .
" He is happy , we are happy . "
Zhao came up with the idea to open a restaurant while the family was out to dinner about 18 months ago .
Jiuhe had disappeared while they were eating , and Zhao later found him happily chatting to waitresses .
" They work so hard , " Zhao recalled his son as saying .
" They only make 500 yuan ! "
Zhao said he spoke with other parents of mentally disabled children who were stuck at home .
" We agreed that a restaurant can be a great place for them to improve , because this is a real world , a true world .
You can see all kinds of people here .
It will benefit them in the future , " said Zhao , who left his office job to start up and run the business .
A few other disabled young people joined Jiuhe as employees at the restaurant , which serves " Jiachang cai " or home - style Chinese food .
Two of them have already moved onto other jobs .
" After working here for a while , their parents realized that they were doing fairly well .
Then , they went out to hunt for jobs and started working , " he said .
As of April 1 , 2006 , a little more than 6 percent of China 's population -- or 83 million people -- were disabled , with some 5.5 million being mentally disabled , according to the China Disabled Persons Federation .
State - run options for the mentally disabled have been historically limited in China .
During the era of Chairman Mao , disabled people were referred to as " can fei " -- disabled and useless .
But attitudes are changing and opportunities are getting better , especially since Beijing recently hosted the Paralympics .
For example , the state now runs a project called " Sweet Home , " where disabled people aged between 18 and 42 make envelopes .
Before the restaurant , Jiuhe did not have many other options than to spend days with his grandparents while his parents worked .
Working has helped him improve his motor skills , such as limiting hand tremors , Zhao said .
" His skills got better very fast , and there are a lot of moments that we parents have observed .
He makes advancements each day , though very small . "
Jiuhe 's language skills have improved the most .
" In the past , I could not even understand his pronunciation , " Zhao said .
" Because he has more contact with people , some of whom like him very much and would like to play with him , as well as so many ' older sisters , ' waitresses and chefs , so many people talk to him every day .
" ... I see that after two days or three , he gets better -- he says a new word all of a sudden which he never learned before , and some day he just starts saying it when talking to people . "
Jiuhe , who can speak some English , said he likes coming to the restaurant : " I like collecting beer bottles and arranging napkins , and I watch TV , " he said .
Zhao is not sure how much longer he will run the restaurant , but he noted what it has already done for his son .
" This is a good transition , a bridge , for my kids and other kids like him .
After getting skills here , they can walk into society . "

Hazardous chemicals in bay sediment near San Francisco 's single remaining large power plant threaten the health of people and marine life , yet Pacific Gas and Electric Co. has been slow to investigate the problem , according to Port of San Francisco officials and city leaders .
The carcinogenic chemicals are byproducts of coal tar , a thick , dark , gooey substance left over from industrial uses at the eastern waterfront site .
Much of them came from the manufacturing of gas that lit the city 's homes and street lights in the 1800s and is not related to current power - generating operations .
The large coal tar deposits and other compounds pollute the soil onshore , and the tar has oozed from the shoreline into the bay over the years .
The company knew about the contamination for at least a decade and cleaned up some of the land and covered up other sections so it did n't pose an immediate health risk to people who work there , according to a Chronicle review of documents provided by PG&E and interviews with utility officials .
Yet independent toxic chemical experts say they have no doubt that the contaminants have been migrating from the soil to the bay sediment for years in concentrations that are unsafe for marine life and humans .
PG&E only now is starting to fully study that issue .
The area is not a popular swimming spot , but people have long fished from a nearby pier and the shoreline .
Among other potential problems , eating fish exposed to the chemicals could cause cancer in people , the experts say .
" All I can say is that I would n't eat any of the fish myself , " said John Fetzer , a former research chemist for Chevron and an expert in the coal tar contaminants called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or PAHs .
" Even if the fish do n't develop cancers , they accumulate them ( the chemicals ) in their fatty tissues . "
Delay alleged
Port of San Francisco officials want PG&E to move more quickly to analyze the sediment and remove it if necessary .
They are calling for state regulators to impose strict deadlines .
Sophie Maxwell , the San Francisco supervisor who represents the area , said PG&E has dragged its feet .
" When PG&E wants to do something faster , they manage , " Maxwell said .
" It 's always an excuse to say that you 're following the regulations , but when you want to move on something more quickly , you streamline the process . "
PG&E representatives say they are cooperating with the port and want to resolve any environmental problems .
Based on previous studies of the shoreline , the company does not believe that the coal tar - related chemicals are moving into the bay .
They acknowledge , however , that without more research , there is no way to know for sure .
" We 're trying to understand the source of the contaminants in the samples , " said PG&E spokesman Joe Molica .
" We 're trying to characterize where the contaminants came from so that we can come up with a cleanup plan ... and to understand what impact our previous operations created . "
The port owns property on and off the shore east of the Potrero Power Plant site and at Pier 70 , which abuts the property to the north .
The port has plans to eventually develop the long - dormant Pier 70 area with offices , restaurants , shops and parks .
Port officials say that coal tar - related chemicals were found on their side of the property line and believe that they traveled in groundwater from the power plant .
Toxics found in bay
While state regulators note that roughly 125 former manufactured - gas plants exist in the state , the San Francisco site is the only one located on a natural shoreline .
Some other old plants are on waterfronts , but they have bulkheads that act as barriers between the polluted upland soil and the water .
Fetzer was hired by the city to review reports completed by environmental consultants in 2000 and 2001 .
He said those reports showed extremely high levels of toxics in the offshore mud .
" The levels in the sediment were roughly 100 times what the Environmental Protection Agency suggests for soil and drinking water , " Fetzer said .
Contamination has likely increased over the years because the coal tar - related compounds continue to seep into the bay , he said .
" You have almost an infinite supply of stuff leeching out of there unless something gets done , " Fetzer said .
" What 's on the site will keep going out into the bay . "
The port argues that PG&E has tried to downplay the relationship between coal tar under the soil and similar contamination in the bay sediments .
" The connection between the onshore contamination and sediments seems like a logical conclusion , " said Jay Ach , manager of regulatory and environmental affairs for the port .
PG&E's Molica counters , however , that other industrial operations could be to blame for any chemicals found in the bay .
State water pollution regulators are satisfied that PG&E is making reasonable progress in addressing the problem , so they have not demanded timelines for studies and possible cleanup .
Port officials want specific deadlines .
PG&E responsible
Although PG&E is legally responsible for the coal - tar cleanup , it sold the land and power plant in the late 1990s .
The diesel - burning plant is now owned by Mirant Corp . and is the center of a long - standing dispute among city officials over whether it should be closed .
Some officials have pushed for cleaner , city - owned generators that would still run on fossil fuel .
Others have called for retrofitting the current power plant and keeping it open while alternative power options are explored .
In addition , Supervisor Maxwell joined then - Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin and City Attorney Dennis Herrera last month in writing to the San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board .
They threatened legal action if the board did not stop Mirant from using a cooling system that kills hundreds of thousands of fish larvae , discharges heated water into the bay and stirs up toxics in the sediment .
The water board has said that it has no immediate plans to do so .
Mirant has said it is working cooperatively with the regulators .
Stephen
Hill , the toxics cleanup division chief for the water board , said he believes that the stance taken by the port , Maxwell and other city leaders to PG&E 's cleanup efforts relates to the debate over closing the power plant .
" The back - and - forth between the city and PG&E is part of the adversarial issue , " Hill said .
" A lot of people in the city want the plant to be shut down . "

Identity theft is a growing problem in the United States , but a lot of the solutions that banks and other companies propose to stop identity thieves are n’t nearly as effective as a recently introduced process offered by the three major credit bureaus .
Monitoring services only let you know that your identity has been stolen after it ’s already happened , but the process of “ freezing your credit ” makes it almost impossible for identity thieves to open lines of credit in your name , even when they have full access to your personal information .
The term is called a “ credit freeze ” because your credit is literally frozen .
If your credit is frozen and a bank tries to query your credit report because someone applied for credit in your name , they wo n’t be able to access your credit report .
It will be as if your credit file did not exist .
Anyone who has your personal information will not be able to use your identity to establish new lines of credit in your name any more than they would of a newborn baby with zero credit history to speak of .
The initial cost to freeze your credit will be $ 10.00 per credit bureau , or $ 30.00 total .
Certain states allow customers to file for a credit freeze for free .
Victims of identity theft may also be able to freeze their credit for free .
You might want to research your state ’s laws with a simple Google search to see if there ’s a way for you to request a credit freeze at a better rate than what the three major Credit Bureaus are offering .
Equifax , TransUnion and Experian each have slightly different processes for getting your credit frozen , so you ’ll want to read their full instructions on their websites , which are TransUnion.com , Experian.com , and Equifax.com respectively .
If you are n’t technically savvy , you can also request to freeze your credit by Phone .
Experian ’s number is 1-888-397-3742 .
Equifax ’s phone number is call 1-800-685-1111 and TransUnion ’s phone number is 1-888-909-8872 .
If you freeze your credit , you will need to remember to “ thaw ” your credit and temporarily make it accessible to potential creditors in the event that you want to apply for any kind of loan or rent an apartment .
Fortunately the process of thawing and freezing your credit is relatively simple and can be done online .
Today reportedly it ’s Pasta Milano ’s turn to be expropriated .
Yesterday President Hugo Chavez ordered the immediate expropriation of Cargill ’s Santa Ana rice plant in Portuguesa , though some local news media reported that all of Cargill ’s Venezuelan assets had been nationalized .
Cargill has only a two percent share of Venezuela ’s rice sector .
But if all of Cargill ’s Venezuelan assets are expropriated , the measure would affect 13 processing plants in 10 cities , and two main offices in Caracas , which together employ over 2,000 workers .
Cargill products in Venezuela include El Rey , Vatel , Deleite and Branca cooking oil ; Los Tres Cochinitos lard ; Mi Mesa , Santa Ana Santa Ana Parboiled rice ; Blancaflor , Gold Medal and Mi Mesa flour ; Fiorentina , Milani , Mi Mesa and Ronco pasta ; Ronco sauces ; Dogui , Gati , Robustin and Perrovita per foods .
Chavez also threatened yesterday to expropriate 100 % of the Polar food and beverage group and “ compensate ” the owners with Bolivarian regime debt bonds ( i.e. worth nothing in the real world ) if they dare to challenge in court last week ’s seizure of Polar ’s Primor rice plant .
But Cargill was n’t violating the Agriculture & Food Security Law or any other government rules / regulations ; 100 % of the Santa Ana plant ’s production was rice which is not subject to government price controls – and the law and related rules state explicitly .
However , Chavez ordered the plant ’s expropriation anyway .
Polar has n’t broken any laws or rules either , though immediately after Primor was intervened company officials indicated they would challenge the takeover in court .
“ You ’d better not get comical with me , ” Chavez warned Polar ’s management .
The president also ordered immediate government inspections of all food processing plants in Venezuela , which means it ’s very likely that more food processors will be intervened in coming weeks .
Meanwhile , reports from plants already intervened confirm that government “ inspectors ” and “ supervisors ” wearing red vests are on site to ensure producers comply with government rules requiring that 70 - 90 % of their output ( depending on the commodity ) is price - controlled goods .
These Bolivarian supervisors have not tried yet to interfere directly with production operations at these plants .
But this could change at any moment , depending on the president ’s mood , which since 15 February has been growing visibly more aggressive , menacing and confiscatory .
It ’s unclear if President Chavez believes intervening private food companies will prevent massive food shortages in coming months .
It ’s more likely Chavez does n’t care , since his priorities are political – complete centralization of all political , military and economic power in the hands of the Boliavrian revolution ’s president for life .
Chavez was very clear about his goals during a speech today to some 300 soldiers , young men and women holding new AK - 103 ’s ( without ammunition clips inserted ) at El Pao in Cojedes , where the new dual status of Vice President / Defense Minister Ramón Carrizales was reaffirmed .
At the end of a longwinded speech to the soldiers sitting on the packed - dirt parade ground in the blistering heat of Cojedes , Chavez referred to the armed forces as “ … mi ejercito , mi armada , mi fuerza aerea y milicia nacional … Hasta la Victoria siempre … Patria , socialismo o muerte … Firmes … Venceremos … ”
Note the president ’s use of the word “ Mine , mine , mine , mine … ”
If the armed forces are the president ’s personal property , so is everything and everyone else in Venezuela .
This is visibly evident in the intervened / expropriated food processing plants where Bolivarian supervisors in red vests are now making sure the producers obey the government ’s production controls .
The state has n’t seized these plants completely yet .
However , putting the equivalent of political commissars in each plant to make sure producers do exactly what Chavez says is only a step removed from physically and illegally stealing the plants from their owners .
Chavez knows his actions wo n’t prevent massive food shortages in a few months .
The reserves Chavez claims he has stashed in places other than the Central Bank , Fonden and Pdvsa simply do n’t exist .
Seizing the food industry ’s processing plants wo n’t solve the regime ’s main problem : it has run out of money .
What happens if there is n’t enough raw rice to process because rice farming has collapsed thanks to the Chavez regime ’s agriculture policies ?
What happens if the owners of these food processing plants are unable to continue producing at an ever - greater loss in coming months ?
Will the Bolivarian supervisors in red vests call in National Guard troops or armed civilian thugs to force the plants to continue operating ?
Or will the regime bring in its own “ gerentes ” and “ tecnicos ” to keep the plants going , with the new government owner eating the losses and guaranteeing the ( increasingly ) imported rice supplies to process ?
Short answer : Chavez does n’t care .
His goal is total consolidation / centralization .
The food industry will be nationalized , and then Chavez likely will move against the automotive , pharmaceuticals and other industries still in private hands .
This is consistent with his Bolivarian model , which is a lethal mix of socialist , fascist , communist and populist currents oriented at perpetuating Chavez in power for life .
We all know that $ 1 is equal to 100 cents .
But a new study suggests that , in some situations , people may behave as if 100 cents actually has more value .
That ’s because people may pay more attention to the size of the numbers involved than the actual economic value , according to the research .
“ In some cases , money may just serve as a score – the higher number wins , regardless of the actual value , ” said John Opfer , co-author of the study and assistant professor of psychology at Ohio State University .
One important implication of this is that economic rewards do n't necessarily affect behavior because of their economic value , Opfer said .
Sometimes , it ’s the numeric value of economic rewards that makes the difference .
So people are more impressed by 100 cents than they are with $ 1 , because 100 is larger than 1 .
Opfer conducted the study with Ellen Furlong , a graduate student in psychology at Ohio State .
Their study appears in the January 2009 issue of the journal Psychological Science .
The study involved testing subjects using a version of an often - used game in psychology , called the prisoner ’s dilemma .
In this version , two players had to decide separately and privately whether they were going to cooperate with each other or defect against their partner in exchange for a monetary reward .

If they both privately said they would cooperate , they both earned $ 3 .
If just one decided to defect , he earned $ 5 while the other person earned nothing .
If they both chose to defect , they both earned only $ 1 .
The game is designed to see under which conditions people will decide to cooperate with each other .
Previous studies have shown that people are more likely to cooperate when the stakes are higher .
In other words , players would be more likely to cooperate when they could both earn $ 300 for cooperating versus when they could only earn $ 3 for cooperating .
But Opfer said he wanted to find out whether it was really the economic value that predicted people ’s decisions -- or simply the number value .
So in one study , the researchers had 48 college students play the prisoner ’s dilemma game .
Half of them played for dollars , and half played for the equivalent amount in cents .
For example , some pairs could earn $ 3 for mutual cooperation , while others would earn 300 cents .
They played the game 80 times in a row .
The study showed that the students who played for 300 cents cooperated more often than those who played for 3 dollars – even though both groups were playing for the same economic reward .

That means that those students playing for 300 cents acted as if they had more at stake than did those who were playing for 3 dollars .
“ People were keeping track of the numbers , and not necessarily the values that were at stake , ” Opfer said .
In a second study , the researchers tested to make sure that the findings from the first study did n’t result from a preference for dollars or cents , rather than a preference for higher numeric rewards .
Results of this study showed that players cooperated a similar number of times whether they were playing for $ 300 or 300 cents , even though the economic values are obviously extremely different .
They also cooperated a similar amount of times for $ 3 as they would for 3 cents – but there were fewer instances of cooperation here than there were for $ 300 or 300 cents .
“ It shows that the effects of dollars or cents is minimal when people are deciding whether to cooperate– all that matters is whether you ’re playing for a “ 3 ” or a “ 300 , ” Opfer said .
“ The incentive to cooperate is n’t really an economic incentive .
It is a confusability about numbers . ”
The fact that people are easily impressed by large numbers has many real - world implications .
For instance , while the economic difference between $ 3 and $ 5 is identical to the economic difference between $ 103 and $ 105 ( $ 2 in both cases ) , the difference between 3 and 5 feels more important to us than the difference between 103 and 105 .
“ The differences between big numbers do n’t seem as important to us as the differences between small numbers , ” he said .
“ We think about the numbers differently . ”
These findings challenge some basic assumptions about how people make decisions .
For one thing , political parties or large corporations may be willing to cooperate when dealing with large amounts of money , such as in the recent $ 700 billion bailout of the financial industry , simply because they are awed by the large numbers , Opfer said .
For smaller amounts , like the proposed $ 15 billion bailout of the auto industry , people would be expected to be less cooperative .
“ We ’re not alone in our tendency to treat differences between small numbers as more important than differences among large numbers -- pigeons , rats , monkeys and human infants all do the same thing , ” Opfer said .
Political parties and large corporations aside , when an individual decides whether to save for the future , or evaluates the risk of an investment , their decisions may also be influenced by the size of the numbers involved , according to Opfer .
“ For better or worse , reframing our choices in terms of smaller numbers allow us to better see the relative risks and benefits of our decisions , ” he said .

Please put " Letters From Men " in the headline .
NVIDIA has jumped into the mobile Internet device game with both feet , with the announcement of a $ 99 hardware platform centered on its ARM - based Tegra APX2600 processor .
The Tegra APX2600 , which is pictured to the right , pairs a mobile GeForce GPU ( OpenGL ES 2.0 ) with an ARM11 core ; this latter core is n't the latest and greatest ARM design but , when combined with NVIDIA 's GPU core , it should be sufficient for most media and Internet workloads .
It will definitely handle the 1080 p video decoding and Web browsing that NVIDIA is pitching as its main uses .
The Tegra part could actually be squeezed into a relatively small smartphone form factor and , in the MID form factor , it can be backed by enough battery capacity to easily make good on NVIDIA 's promises of " days of use " on a single charge .
Ultimately , the big power draw for a Tegra - based MID will be the wireless .
The MID form factor may or may not have a future , but that may not matter to NVIDIA .
By building relationships with wireless carriers and establishing a hardware presence in the ultramobile space , NVIDIA can move down into smartphones and up into netbooks , regardless of what happens with the MID .
Even more importantly , the company can attack all three markets with the same software stack — I'm talking about Android , of course , and about NVIDIA 's announcement that the company has worked closely with Google to bring Android to Tegra .
" NVIDIA will be working within the Open Handset Alliance to continually strengthen the ability of Android to tap into advanced mobile graphics and media acceleration to make interaction with handheld technology more intuitive and instinctive , " NVIDIA said in its announcement of the collaboration .
The new Tegra chip is due out sometime in the second half of this year , and the company already has a few design wins under its belt .
However , these are for Asian ODMs and markets — no high - profile design wins for Western markets have yet been announced , either in the MID space or the smartphone space .
As for NVIDIA 's netbook prospects , the main thing that will keep Tegra out of netbooks is the processor core .
The ARM11 core just can't compete with Atom ; to play in the netbook space , NVIDIA will need to upgrade to Cortex A8 , or ideally A9 .
A Cortex A9 SoC with a mobile GeForce GPU would be a killer part for an ARM - based netbook , but it also may not work as a $ 99 hardware platform ( depending on the fab process and cost per chip ) .
ARM 's Cortex A9 will rock , but will it rock 4X ?
Speaking of Cortex A9 and netbooks , ARM has been talking up its forthcoming quad - core A9 at MWC .
Codenamed " Sparrow , " it wo n't be available until sometime next year .
A quad - core A9 part will make for an extremely capable netbook CPU whenever Sparrow is set to take flight .
A quad - core ARM chip based on A9
Recall that the A9 core is a fully modern superpipelined , superscalar , out - of - order processor on par with Intel 's Core architecture .
I expect that it will compare extremely well against Intel 's offerings at the core level on a performance / watt basis , but I do want to sound one note of caution about a quad - core A9's prospects : AMD has amply demonstrated that it 's possible to completely blow an integrated quad - core design by messing up the cache hierarchy ( in AMD 's case , the L3 was too slow ) .
My point is not to pick on AMD , but to say that the performance of integrated MPUs with four cores and more is extremely sensitive to larger system and memory hierarchy design issues .
So A9 could be the greatest single - core design possible , and ARM or its licensees could still ruin the overall product .
ARM also demonstrated its first 32nm ARM chip at MWC , fabbed on IBM 's high -k Common Platform process .

When Bernard L. Madoff entered a federal courtroom in Manhattan on Thursday to admit that he had run a vast Ponzi scheme that robbed thousands of investors of their life savings , he was as elegantly dressed as ever .
But , preparing for jail , he wore no wedding ring  only the shadowy imprint remained of one he has worn for nearly 50 years .
He admitted his guilt for the first time in public , and apologized to his victims , dozens of whom were squeezed into the courtroom benches behind him , before being handcuffed and led away to jail to await sentencing .
“ I knew what I was doing was wrong , indeed criminal , ” he said .
“ When I began the Ponzi scheme , I believed it would end shortly and I would be able to extricate myself and my clients . ”
But finding an exit “ proved difficult , and ultimately impossible , ” he continued , stumbling slightly in his prepared remarks .
“ As the years went by I realized this day , and my arrest , would inevitably come . ”
Part 1 of this three - part series examined startup companies offering open source software solutions on the enterprise market .
Part 2 focuses on consumer - oriented products .
The expansion of open source into new markets is prompting consumers to notice alternatives to traditional computing habits .
Personal computing power now puts so much opportunity into the hands of consumers that previously impossible activities are possible without exposure to proprietary software .
Open source projects are finding their way into full - service business offerings at cost - saving levels for consumers and enterprise alike .
Consumers can select from a growing inventory of software in a wide variety of genres .
Open source is feeding afrenzy in two key areas like never before .
Game - playing aficionadosare joining home entertainment fans in using more than justoff - the - shelf proprietary solutions .
Game developers themselves are relying more prominently on open sourcecomponents to drive their creations .
Just as developers ofenterprise products now must decide among marketing strategies thatinclude open source models , so too do game makers and videoservice providers .
Some very successful start - ups in the consumermarketplace got their businesses launched with the lower entry coststhat open source provides .
“ I think consumer acceptance of open source in the gaming market willbe big .
With any open source technology , there is always a niche .
Aswith anything in the software realm , you are always going to have anemergence of the open source model , ” Scott Testa , professor ofmarketing at Philadelphia ’s St. Joseph ’s University , toldLinuxInsider .
In this second installment of a three - part series on open sourcestart - ups to watch , LinuxInsider spotlights three relative newcomersto the consumer sector .
We spotlight independent video game makerWolfire , digital home and connected small businessenvironment developer Prodea Systems and videocollaboration platform developer Kaltura .
Unaware Users
Perhaps more consumer education will be needed to push betterawareness of open source as a viable alternative to commercialproducts .
The open source movement was fostered in part by the creatorof the Linux operating system , who started out looking for a cheaperversion of Unix , noted Testa .
Some of the greatest ideas started in some of those out - of - the - wayplaces by programmers , he explained .
Testa views open sourceprogrammers by nature as artists who work outside the box trying tosolve problems .
“ The typical consumer does n’t understand the strength of open source .
They are so inundated with brands like Microsoft and Apple .
Thatdoes n’t make them bad products .
The typical consumer is almostprogrammed to turn to products from these manufacturers .
There is apreconceived notion that open source is not good or is unprofessionalor is built by people who do n’t know what they are doing , ” Testa said .
Sometimes that perception of consumer - grade products may be true .
Someopen source products do not have as good an interface or do not offerwell - defined support , he explained .
Testa is no naysayer about open source , however .
As a consumer , heprobably uses more open source products than proprietary ones , hesaid .
Birth of a Game Plan
Wolfire in many ways depicts the traditional route independentsoftware makers used for years .
The company was started in 2003 byDavid Rosen .
A high school student at the time who had been writing codesince he was 6 , David created a Web site to display his sharewarevideo game contest entries .
His twin brother , Jeff , and three friends came on board some fiveyears later to grow the company into an open source entity .
The firstgame to carry the company logo was “ Lugaru . ”
Its sequel , called ” Overgrowth , ” is now being nurtured through various alpha stages vividlytracked and distributed from the Web site .
“ ‘ Lugaru ’ was made in a matter of months .
‘ Overgrowth ’ has a professionalartist and several programmers developing the code , ” Jeff Rosen , cofounder and president of Wolfire , told LinuxInsider .
Open Source Intro
The Rosen brothers made the leap from shareware game writers to opensource developers quickly out of necessity .
A hardcore Mac OS 9 user , they found few games for that platform .
To make it more marketable , the game had to attract a wider base of players .
“ I support open source because it ’s good business .
We did n’t have todo anything to get the games ported to Linux .
Volunteer coders did itfor us , ” Rosen said .
He turned into what he describes as a hardcore entrepreneur afterbeing involved in several other small startups .
Thinking about seekingangel financiers down the road , he is concentrating now making headwaywith his “ bootstrap model ” for growing the businesses .
So far he has very low expenses .
The only real cost for now is rent .
He pays for other company needs by working out deals for futureroyalties on the company ’s games and relying on community volunteers .
Joining In
“ Another cool thing we do with open source is using Google Chrome forthe UI ( user interface ) of ‘ Overgrowth . ’
We contributed to itsdevelopment from within the community , ” Rosen said .
Some of the functions in ‘ Overgrowth ’ performed by open standards are theinventory screen , a cool widgets display and the main menu .
“ My ideal scenario is to finish ‘ Overgrowth ’ this year and enter it inthe Independent Games Festival .
That will open more doors for us .
Iwant to catapult from a small indie company to a national brand , ” Rosen said about his plans to grow Wolfire .
He also plans to start a major open source project and will issue acall to arms for volunteers to form a support community around theproject .
Joining Forces
Open source is also gathering the attention of movie - viewing consumers .
Part of the drum - beating for this growing acceptance might well be theresult of Prodea Systems and its success with the Digital Life CommandCenter platform .
The company offers an innovative approach to dealing with complexdigital home and connected small - business environments .
Its videoplatform creates a foundation for a video network in the home with aCommunity Engine , which allows users to share content , experiences andapplications among peer subscribers .
Prodea Systems earlier this month announced a partnership with CinemaNow to bring premium digital entertainment to Prodea ’s platform .
The partnership gives the company the ability to deliver services tothe three - screen ecosystem formed by the TV , the PC and mobile devices andprovide management infrastructure for transparency into the digitalhome environment .
What It Does
Prodea ’s system is based on the notion that if they build it , consumers will come .
It provides users with a carrier - grade experiencein a variety of services delivered to a range of fixed appliances inthe home or automobile , as well as mobile lifestyle devices includingsmartphones , portable media players and laptops .
Part of this delivery system comes from a partnership Prodea announcedin early January with Pandora Internet Radio .
The arrangement bringspersonalized music services to the Digital Life Command Center .
Pandora is a personalized Internet radio and musicdiscovery service available anytime and anywhere on the PC , in thehome , and on mobile devices via partnerships with AT&T , Apple and Sprint .
Pandora ’s service is based on the Music Genome Project begun in 2000 .
Each song in this massivecollection is analyzed by more than 30 trained musicians and assessedagainst nearly 400 distinct musical attributes such as melody , harmonyand rhythm to capture its unique musical identity .
Using this information to build playlists based on musical similarity , listeners can simply enter a favorite song or artist and instantlylaunch a personalized listening experience , which includes discovery ofnew bands , artists and songs .
Another Delivery Approach
Kaltura offers one of the first open source platforms for videocreation , management , interaction and collaboration .
The companypublicly launched in September 2007 .
Kaltura ’s open source platform enables any site to seamlessly andcost–effectively integrate advanced interactive rich - mediafunctionalities , including video searching , uploading , importing , editing , annotating , remixing and sharing .
The company inked a partnership recently with the WikimediaFoundation .
This expanded Kaltura ’s reach to Wikipedia ’s 207 millionvisitors .
Other customers integrating the platform include mediacompanies , social networks , UGC sites , video sharing sites , majorbrands , non-profits , bloggers and enterprises .
How It Works
Much like a meshing of the Wiki technology with YouTube concept , Kaltura ’s approach includes collaboration features that allow users tocreate and consume rich media together .
It adds a social element tothe online video experience and creates enhanced monetization andadvertising opportunities for authors and publishers .
The company ’s network gathers content from its member sites into arepository of sharable and remixable rich - media content .
Publishersbig and small can use the network for new syndication opportunitiesand gain access to third - party Web services that include DVD burning , professional video editing and advertising opportunities .
Kaltura ’s video platform is based on a modular combination ofcustomizable building blocks called “ Kaltura Widgets . ”
These Widgets canbe customized , skinned and combined using simple workflows to formKaltura applications .

Venus 's thick clouds may be able to support life , scientists think
The existence of life on the planet 's oven - hot surface is unimaginable .
But microbes could survive and reproduce , experts say , floating in the thick , cloudy atmosphere , protected by a sunscreen of sulphur compounds .
Scientists have even submitted a proposal for a Nasa space mission to sample the clouds and attempt to return any presumed Venusians to Earth .
One lifeform 's deadly radiation may be another lifeform 's lunch
David Grinspoon , South West Research Institute in Colorado
" If you could get through the sulphuric acid clouds down to the surface of Venus you 'd find it was hotter than an oven .
You could melt lead at the surface of Venus and there 'd be no water . "
But it was not always like that .
Earth and Venus are in many ways sister planets .
" Current theories suggest that Venus and the Earth may have started out alike .
There might have been a lot of water on Venus and there might have been a lot of carbon dioxide on Earth , " Professor Ingersoll explained .
But all that was to change .
On Earth , life in the oceans took in carbon dioxide and turned it into limestone .
On Venus , 30 % closer to the Sun , any oceans boiled away and the water vapour added to the runaway greenhouse effect .
Venus became our planet 's ugly sister .
Its make - over , which occurred billions of years ago , has left a surface where the pressure is crushing .
Arrested development
But , according to Louis Irwin of the University of Texas at El Paso , the changes on Venus may have been slow .
" It may well have been Earth - like long enough for life to either emerge or be transported there , " he said .
Once established , life would have adapted to every environment , just as it did on Earth .
Two years ago , Austrian scientists discovered bacteria living and reproducing within clouds on Earth .
The same could have been true on Venus .
Then , as the surface became hot and dry , the clouds might have become life 's only refuge .
Venus may once have been Earth - like but now surface temperatures can melt lead
But we now know of organisms that thrive in very acidic environments on Earth .
" If you think about what life needs in a broad sense then the clouds of Venus might actually be a habitat where something could live , " explained David Grinspoon , of the South West Research Institute in Colorado .
Another problem could be UV radiation from the Sun. But Dirk Shulze - Makuch , also at El Paso , thinks Venusian bacteria could make use of a natural chemical sunscreen there .
" When we looked at the composition of the atmosphere , we thought that sulphur compounds are actually an ideal sun block for microbes . "
David Grinspoon speculates that the organisms might even have evolved ways of making use of the UV , much like Earth plants use visible light for photosynthesis .
" One lifeform 's deadly radiation may be another lifeform 's lunch , " he added .
But will we ever know if there is truth behind the speculation ?
Louis Irwin and his colleagues have a proposal in with the US space agency , Nasa .
" We would send a probe to Venus that would drop probably a collector tethered to a balloon - like floating spacecraft , it would collect samples of the cloud droplets and then blast off from the Venusian atmosphere for return eventually to Earth . "
And what are the chances of finding live Venusians ?
David Grinspoon is in no doubt : " If they 're there , I think we will find them eventually . "

Ben Bernanke made the following statement as he attempted to justify bailing out bad borrowers :
“ … from a policy point of view , the large amount of foreclosures are detrimental not just to the borrower and lender but to the broader system .
In many of these situations we have to trade off the moral hazard issue against the greater good . ”
– Ben Bernanke , February 25 , 2009
I think he is wrong on this , and the moral hazard issue is only a small part of my objections .
One of the fundamental problems we have right now is that too many people own homes .
It sounds harsh , but please bear with me a few sentences .
I think we can agree that 100 percent home ownership is not possible , or even desirable .
Most of us can remember a time when our income and our jobs were such that home ownership was a bad idea .
Home ownership is a commitment that requires a significant amount of stability and discipline .
Not everyone is so stable or has the discipline to keep up with the payments .
What is an appropriate national homeownership rate ?
Theory gives us no answer .
We look to the data for a clue .
Here ’s a chart of home ownership rates since 1968 :
It seems pretty clear that a homeownership rate between 63 percent and 65 percent works pretty well .
When we get above that range , problems seem to crop up .
This was true in 1980 – the worst recession of the past 30 years – and it is true now .
In light of these data , let ’s think about what Bernanke is saying .
He ’s arguing that to execute the foreclosures required to move the rate back to that 63 percent to 65 percent range are bad for the economy .
So bad in fact , that we ’re better off not going there .
The problem with that argument lies in a lack of historic understanding of the proper levels of homeownership .
Financial and real estate markets can’t stabilize until we get closer to that equilibrium .
Until we lower the home ownership rate , financial institutions will have a cloud around them , and residential real estate markets will be lifeless .
It may not be politically popular , but those are the realities .
This is a critical issue .
For years , economists have believed that the failure of banks to recognize and remove bad assets contributed to Japan ’s long period of economic malaise .
I agree .
Forbearance on bad real estate loans here in the states constitutes much the same thing .
Our financial institutions are holding a bunch of bad assets ; these are homes that are owned by people who can not afford them – never did , and likely never will .
Until the financial institutions recognize those bad assets and get them off their books , our financial institutions wo n’t have the resources to fund , stabilize and then drive a broader economic recovery .
What we need is not more mindless beneficence to everyone from Wall Street to Detroit and Main Street .
The more we bailout failed financial institutions , automobile manufactures , or any business , the longer we postpone our recovery .
Recessions are periods when assets are reallocated from less productive to more productive uses .
That requires processes like repossession , foreclosure , mergers , and bankruptcy .
These processes have been developed over centuries .
They are the most efficient methods to restore an economy .
Why are we suddenly abandoning these processes that have proved themselves in many business cycles ?
I suppose part of it is the desire to eliminate the business cycle .
This is the same thinking that had many – including conservatives – arguing that stocks could not fall during the dot.com bubble or that housing prices would also move up .
In reality the business cycle can not be eliminated .
It ca n’t be done and it is pure hubris to try .
One of the fundamental insights to come out of Real Business Cycle research is that recessions constitute the most efficient response to a negative shock .
We need to stop wasting resources trying to stem the tide .
Instead , let us allow the recession to work for us .
In the meantime we can provide a backstop through unemployment benefits and some reasonable fiscal stimulus .
But we have to experience some pain and let our processes and institutions work for us .
The sooner we get these foreclosures , repossessions , mergers , and bankruptcies behind us , the sooner we will see a return to the only sure cure for a sick economy : real economic growth .

DEFENCE FORCES :MEMBERS
OF the Defence Forces should be given an assurance that they will not be ordered to break strikes if disquiet in the public sector leads to industrial action , Pdforra , the representative association of soldiers , sailors and aircrew , has said .
Pdforra general secretary Gerry Rooney said Defence Forces personnel had been used in the past to break a number of strikes , including those by ambulance and bus workers .
He called on Minister for Defence Willie O’Dea to assure his members they would not be used in the same way again .
“ It will be morally wrong for soldiers to be ordered to break strikes arising from the imposition of the pensions levy , ” Mr Rooney said .
Mr O’Dea described as a “ hypothetical situation ” the suggestion that soldiers would be used to break strikes .
He said he did not comment on such situations .
However , in reply to a written Dáil question yesterday related to the issue , Mr O’Dea said : “ As has been done in the past , the Defence Forces may be called on to contribute to maintaining vital services in times of industrial action . ”
Mr Rooney said soldiers supported the opposition to the pension levy being expressed across the public sector .
The pension levy was unfair and bitterly disappointing for soldiers , sailors and aircrew of the Defence Forces .
“ These personnel , many of whom have given long and dedicated service both at home and overseas , are now being unfairly used to address mistakes made in the management of the national economy in which they had no role , ” Mr Rooney said .
On a fall afternoon in 2002 , the New York City police broke up a protest in front of Gov. George E. Pataki ’s office in Midtown Manhattan and hauled a dozen demonstrators away .
The protesters were demanding that Mr. Pataki repeal the state ’s 30 - year - old drug sentencing laws , widely regarded as the nation ’s most unforgiving .
One of those placed in plastic handcuffs and carted off to a police station was a state senator named David A. Paterson .
Now , with Mr. Paterson in the governor ’s mansion and Democrats in control of both houses of the State Legislature , an aggressive effort is under way to finally dismantle what remains of the stringent 1970s - era drug laws , which imposed stiff mandatory sentences as a way to combat the heroin epidemic then gripping New York City .
The Assembly is expected to pass legislation on Tuesday that would once again give judges the discretion to send those found guilty of having smaller amounts of illegal drugs to substance - abuse treatment instead of prison and allow thousands of inmates convicted of nonviolent drug offenses to apply to have their sentences reduced or commuted .
Japan has begun moving Patriot guided missiles to the country 's north - east to possibly shoot down a North Korean rocket .
Spy satellite images have confirmed the hardline communist state has placed the rocket on the launch pad .
Pyongyang insists the rocket is carrying a communications satellite into space and has said it could fire it as early as this weekend .
The United States and Japan says it is a cover for a ballistic missile test .
Spy satellites have photographed the nose cone of the rocket on the launch pad in North Korea , but it is unclear if it is carrying a satellite or a warhead .
Tokyo is threatening to shoot the North Korean rocket down if it threatens Japanese territory .
Meanwhile the US Defence Secretary Robert Gates says the US has no plans to shoot down the missile if the test goes ahead .
Here is the full memo to employees from Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer ( pictured here ) about the 5,000 layoffs and other cost cuts just announced , due to economic slowdown , which also resulted in weak financial results for the second quarter .
It is not a happy missive , obviously .
But tough times have also hit Microsoft ( MSFT ) .
“ … We believe these job eliminations are crucial to our ability to adjust the company ’s cost structure so that we have the resources to drive future profitable growth , ” wrote Ballmer , in part .
But read it for yourself below in its entirety :
From : Steve Ballmer
To : All Microsoft FTE
Subject : Realigning Resources and Reducing Costs
In response to the realities of a deteriorating economy , we ’re taking important steps to realign Microsoft ’s business .
I want to tell you about what we ’re doing and why .
Today we announced second quarter revenue of $ 16.6 billion .
This number is an increase of just 2 percent compared with the second quarter of last year and it is approximately $ 900 million below our earlier expectations .
The fact that we are growing at all during the worst recession in two generations reflects our strong business fundamentals and is a testament to your hard work .
Our products provide great value to our customers .
Our financial position is solid .
We have made long - term investments that continue to pay off .
But it is also clear that we are not immune to the effects of the economy .
Consumers and businesses have reined in spending , which is affecting PC shipments and IT expenditures .
Our response to this environment must combine a commitment to long - term investments in innovation with prompt action to reduce our costs .
During the second quarter we started down the right path .
As the economy deteriorated , we acted quickly .
As a result , we reduced operating expenses during the quarter by $ 600 million .
I appreciate the agility you have shown in enabling us to achieve this result .
Now we need to do more .
We must make adjustments to ensure that our investments are tightly aligned with current and future revenue opportunities .
The current environment requires that we continue to increase our efficiency .
As part of the process of adjustments , we will eliminate up to 5,000 positions in R&D , marketing , sales , finance , LCA , HR , and IT over the next 18 months , of which 1,400 will occur today .
We ’ll also open new positions to support key investment areas during this same period of time .
Our net headcount in these functions will decline by 2,000 to 3,000 over the next 18 months .
In addition , our workforce in support , consulting , operations , billing , manufacturing , and data center operations will continue to change in direct response to customer needs .
Our leaders all have specific goals to manage costs prudently and thoughtfully .
They have the flexibility to adjust the size of their teams so they are appropriately matched to revenue potential , to add headcount where they need to increase investments in order to ensure future success , and to drive efficiency .
To increase efficiency , we ’re taking a series of aggressive steps .
We ’ll cut travel expenditures 20 percent and make significant reductions in spending on vendors and contingent staff .
We ’ve scaled back Puget Sound campus expansion and reduced marketing budgets .
We ’ll also reduce costs by eliminating merit increases for FY10 that would have taken effect in September of this calendar year .
Each of these steps will be difficult .
Our priority remains doing right by our customers and our employees .
For employees who are directly affected , I know this will be a difficult time for you and I want to assure you that we will provide help and support during this transition .
We have established an outplacement center in the Puget Sound region and we ’ll provide outplacement services in many other locations to help you find new jobs .
Some of you may find jobs internally .
For those who do n’t , we will also offer severance pay and other benefits .
The decision to eliminate jobs is a very difficult one .
Our people are the foundation of everything we have achieved and we place the highest value on the commitment and hard work that you have dedicated to building this company .

One of my most memorable conversations , from when I was an articling student working for the late Harry Rankin , involved a client concerned about the cost of litigation .
She was n't concerned about Harry 's fee .
He was always more than fair and would work on a contingency fee basis whenever the client requested .
But it was the potential court costs — such as court filing fees , trial hearing day fees , and jury fees — that worried her .
" This is not the way a justice system should be run , " she said .
Harry 's response was quick and to the point : " We have a legal system , not a justice system . "
As expensive as the court system was then , it has become even worse over the last number of years .
Just recently , in a well - publicized case , victims of the Queen of the North ferry sinking had to abandon their lawsuit on the eve of the trial because they could not afford the exorbitant jury fees .
Their lawyer , to his credit , held a press conference to publicize this fact .
All of the above is not just to complain about the current state of affairs — that is , that it is costly to go to court .
I have written this article because — believe it or not — Gordon Campbell and the B.C. Liberal government are about to make it far far worse .
A full new set of court rules are under consideration and appear to be on the verge of being approved by the provincial government without even bringing the matter before the legislature for a vote .
These new rules will significantly increase the cost of going to court .
Even more disturbing is a proposal to prevent any case from going to court when you do not have the proof in advance .
Let me explain .
While in many cases you have the evidence you need — proof such as a broken arm as a result of an assault or a damaged fender as a result of a motor vehicle accident — there are many cases in which you do not have the evidence to prove your case when you start your lawsuit .
A perfect example would be the case referred to above — the sinking of the Queen of the North .
The fact that the ferry had sunk was without dispute .
But why it sank was open to question .
For example , was there negligence on the part of B.C. Ferries either in the navigation of the ferry or in proper mechanical maintenance ?
The question of why certainly could not be established prior to the lawsuit being commenced .
What you had was deceased and injured passengers and a " sunk boat " ' .
What you did n't have was proof that explained the sinking .
In our present system , you can start your lawsuit , even though you do n't have the proof .
After you start the lawsuit , you have the right to examine the defendant under oath to get to the truth and proof .
In this case , the defendants would have been B.C. Ferries employees .
The new rules no longer will allow you to do this .
You will be stopped from even starting a lawsuit unless you have the proof first .
For more information about the proposed new rules , I highly recommend you visit protectingjusticeforbc.org .

Google has announced the Google PowerMeter , a program that displays real - time information about home energy consumption on your computer
The program is in closed beta right now , but Google hopes that it will eventually be distributed to anyone who has a smart meter .
From the Google web page :
How much does it cost to leave your TV on all day ?
What about turning your air conditioning 1 degree cooler ?
Which uses more power every month — your fridge or your dishwasher ?
Is your household more or less energy efficient than similar homes in your neighborhood ?
Our lack of knowledge about our own energy usage is a huge problem , but also a huge opportunity for us all to save money and fight global warming by reducing our power usage .
Studies show that access to your household ’s personal energy information is likely to save you between 5 – 15 % on your monthly bill , and the potential impact of large numbers of people achieving similar efficiencies is even more exciting .
For every six households that save 10 % on electricity , for instance , we reduce carbon emissions as much as taking one conventional car off the road .

BBC environment correspondent
The report 's authors say power stations may need to be moved A new report says treaties aimed at reducing CO2 emissions are useless .
The Institution of Mechanical Engineers report says we have to accept the world could change dramatically .
It also says we should start planning our major infrastructure now to accommodate more extreme weather events and sea level rises .
While not against attempts to reduce emissions , the report 's authors say we should be realistic about what can be achieved with this approach .
Realism International diplomats and environment campaigners have , for years , been pursuing an international agreement to reduce carbon emissions .
In its present incarnation it is called the Kyoto Protocol .
The existing Kyoto Protocol has , to date , been a near total failure
Institution of Mechanical Engineers report
This treaty runs out in 2012 , and negotiations are carrying on at the moment to replace it - negotiations which will culminate in a meeting in Copenhagen later this year .
The authors of the report are not optimistic about the outcome : " The new agreement 's most basic premise will be to try and limit the negative man-made effects on our climate system for future generations .
" In other words , the agreement will aim to reduce global CO2 emissions by mitigation .
" However , the existing Kyoto Protocol has , to date , been a near total failure , with emissions levels continuing to rise substantially . "
While the report 's authors point out that the Institution , like many scientific bodies , has a strong belief that we need " to reduce CO2 to secure long - term human survival " , they also say that we should be realistic about what we can achieve .
And " even with vigorous mitigation effort , we will continue to use fossil fuel reserves until they are exhausted . "
Climate proofing
If climate change scientists ' predictions are correct , the world will look very different if we are unable or unwilling to stop using fossil fuels to the extent we are doing today .
Sea level rises could be seven metres in the UK by 2250 , which , unchecked , could inundate much of London , East Anglia and other coastal areas .
We may have to accept , they say , that we will need to abandon some parts of the country , and spend significant amounts of money defending others .
Our climate is changing so unless we adapt , we are likely to face a difficult future
Institution of Mechanical Engineers report 2250 may seem like an unimaginably long time away , but the report 's authors point out that parts of the London Underground system that are still in use were built in the 1860s , and today 's engineers are facing projects the lifetime of which will extend into 2100 .
The majority of existing infrastructure , they say , will continue to be operational for at least another 100 - 200 years .
The " climate proofing " the institution recommends extends into almost every construction .
For example , towns and cities , they say , should be planned to adjust street layouts to correspond with the prevailing winds , maximising ventilation and cooling .
The location of many power stations may have to be reconsidered , as they are often in coastal areas .
And railways were often placed in river valleys to make the most of low gradients .
The report 's authors say that while they support efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , they are " realistic enough to recognise that global CO2 emissions are not reducing and our climate is changing so unless we adapt , we are likely to face a difficult future . "

IF ONE policy sealed the tie between George Bush 's administration and conservative religious voters it was his ban on federal funding for human embryonic stem - cell research .
On Monday March 9th Barack Obama overturned the controversial policy by signing an order lifting the ban on federal funding introduced in August 2001 .
The first veto of Mr Bush 's presidency , in July 2006 , was used to reject a bill from a Republican - controlled Congress that would have loosened the restrictions .
At that time Mr Bush said that harvesting embryonic stem cells crossed a moral boundary that “ would support the taking of innocent human life in the hope of finding medical benefits for others ” .
Scientists and a few Republicans ( Nancy Reagan among them ) fought vigorously against the federal - funding ban .
The scientists argued that America would lose the edge in biomedical research to Europe ; Mrs Reagan compassionately pleaded that stem - cell research could help to find a cure for Alzheimer 's disease , which afflicted Ronald Reagan in his later years .
Mr Obama 's order was not unexpected .
While running for president he said he would lift the funding ban , and shortly after his inauguration the Food and Drug Administration approved a request from Geron , a Californian biotechnology company , to use embryonic stem - cells in clinical trials on patients with severe spinal injuries .
Opinion polls show general support for overturning the ban , though support for stem - cell research weakens if a question is phrased in such a way as to determine that the practise can “ destroy ” embryonic human life .
The president 's decision , however , is deeply unpopular with religious conservatives .
The Family Research Council , a conservative pressure group , immediately responded that research on adult stem cells was adequate and has “ been proven to treat every single disease ” that Mr Obama mentioned in the signing ceremony , such as Parkinson 's disease .
It argued that the order allows scientists to “ create their own guidelines without proper moral constraints ” .
Mr Obama reminded everyone of his religious leanings by saying that “ as a person of faith , I believe we are called to care for each other and work to ease human suffering ” .
But he maintained that a false choice had been presented between religion and science .
Despite his image as a sensible moderate , conservatives increasingly claim that this is a sham and that Mr Obama is bent on ideological war .
Since entering office Mr Obama has overturned a number of policies that religious conservatives hold dear , such as a ban on government aid for family - planning groups that promote abortion in poor countries .
Plans are also in the works to rescind a regulation enacted in the dying days of the Bush administration that gives health workers a “ right of conscience ” , protecting them from the sack if they refused to co-operate in certain medical procedures ( mainly abortions ) .
Social conservatives are also upset with Eric Holder , the new attorney - general , for confirming that the federal government will no longer take action against medical - marijuana clubs , which are legal in some states .
None of these reversals is a surprise , but conservatives have been taken aback at the unflinching speed of the changes .
Mr Obama may be emboldened by his solid victory — he does not need the support of religious conservatives to govern .
And for all the talk of bipartisanship and Mr Obama 's courting of religious voters during his campaign , their voting patterns did not change much at all , so he owes them little .
John Green , an expert in religion and politics at the University of Akron in Ohio , recently published a survey that found Mr Obama 's share of the vote among white evangelical Protestants was virtually unchanged from that of John Kerry 's in 2004 .
Mr Obama actually lost some ground among white mainline Protestant and white Catholic voters .
He did win over the majority of the “ modernist ” wings of both groups , but by smaller margins than did Mr Kerry .
The “ values debate ” will not end soon ; if anything it is seeping from social to economic policy .
Some conservative commentators claim that the White House budget is “ socialist ” , and bail - outs for banks and distressed homeowners betray American values of rugged individualism and self - determination .
The moderate centre may eventually feel the sense of “ betrayal ” expressed by conservatives .
If it hits this vital part of Mr Obama 's support , then he may have to take note .
I program in Python , Javascript and Factor on a roughly daily basis .
My experience is that I can write functions / methods quicker in Python and Javascript than I can in Factor , but that my Factor code ends up being of considerably higher quality .
By higher quality I mean that it 's better factored and easier to pull apart and change .
In this post I 'm making the claim that factor forces me to write better code , and I 'm going to illustrate this with an example .
( I also use perl , ruby , scheme and java , but not nearly as often )
I 've recently been writing a trading simulator in my spare time so that I can test my trading ideas on historical data .
As part of this project I 've written some of the same functionality in both javascript and factor and this experience gave me a good basis from which to compare the languages .
The example I 'm going to use to illustrate the comparison is : Coding a simple moving average ( SMA ) function .
A simple moving average involves stepping along an array of numbers , generating at each step the average ( mean ) of the last p elements of the sequence ( where p is the period ) .
The output of the function is the sequence / array of averages .
E.g. an sma with period 4 on a six element array :
sma ( [ 0,1,2,3,4,5],4 ) => [ 0,0,0,1.5,2.5,3.5 ]
( I padded the start of the array with zeros in the javascript version )
For the javascript implementation I built SMA as two nested ' for ' loops , with the inner loop summing the last n elements at each turn .
This is n't the most efficient way of computing a moving average , but it is what I thought of and implemented first :
function sma ( arr , period ) { var out = [ ] ; // fill initial space with zeros for ( var i=0 ; i< period - 1 ;i++ ) { out.push ( 0 ) ; } // fill rest with averages for ( var i=period - 1 ; i< arr.length ; i++ ) { var sum = 0 ; for ( var j=i -( period - 1 ) ; j<=i ; j++ ) { sum += arr[j ] ; } out .
push ( sum / period ) ; } return out ; }
When I went to code the Factor version the idea of coding up nested loops made my head hurt .
Factor 's stack based approach effectively means serial access to state - you have to shuffle the right variables into the right order at the right time .
This makes it is very hard to write functions that manage more than ~ 3 - 4 variables at a time .
Javascript by comparison has random access to local variables * and my javascript version uses : ' arr ' , ' out ' , 'i ' , 'j ' , ' period ' , ' sum ' , not to mention a bunch of unnamed temporaries like ' length ' arr[j ] , ' period - 1 ' etc ...
Shuffling all these variables manually on a stack while mentally keeping tabs on the order and position of each variable is a pretty tough challenge .
I suspect the resultant code would be the sort of thing only a compiler could love .
So faced with this problem I used my traditional factor problem - hammer , which is to step away from the screen , walk around a bit and ask myself the question : ' What abstraction could there be that would make this easier ? '.
I came up with ' map - window ' which implements a sliding window across the input sequence and applies a block of code to each subset in turn .
The code to implement the moving average is then :
[ mean ] map - window
Which is clearly a much cleaner implementation of SMA .
Before I continue I should mention that I could also have written the map - window abstraction in javascript ( javascript has good higher order function facilities ) , but the point of this post is that factor forced me to come up with the approach .
Once I 'd had the ' map - window ' idea I could easily see how to compute the moving average .
I also had an idea of how I could build map - window using ' head ' and ' tail ' , or at least I had enough of an idea to motivate my trying it .
Ok , so here 's my full implementation for comparison with the javascript :
: window ( seq start window - width -- subseq ) [ 1 + head ] dip short tail * ; : map -i ( seq quot : ( seq i -- elt ) -- seq ' ) [ dup length ] dip with map ; inline : map - window ( seq window - width quot -- seq ) '[ _ window @ ] map - i ; inline : sma ( seq period -- seq ' ) [ mean ] map - window ;
To my eyes the factor implementation is quite a bit more complex than the javascript one , at least consumed in its entirety .
This might be because the concept of a for - loop is deeply engrained in my brain whereas the Factor implementation invents both map - i and map - window to build sma .
However the individual parts of the factor implementation are both generic and composable , and once you know what each bit does the whole thing pretty elegantly describes itself .
A big advantage to all this abstraction is that when you discover an implementation pattern occuring more than once , the chances are that the pattern is already factored out to some extent and is ripe for reuse with very little modification .
I find this makes refactoring quicker and easier than with python and keeps the codebase relatively lean .
This in turn means that the codebase does n't drag as much as it gets bigger .
The tradeoff is that I spend more time upfront finding and creating abstractions in the first place .
Of course if the right abstractions already exist then coding performance is improved dramatically .
e.g. if map - window had already existied then sma would have been a slam dunk .
I 'd assume that as the factor library improves the likelyhood of this happening will increase , maybe at the expense of more time required to learn the core vocabularies .
Programming in factor is already more about the libraries than the native language and I 'd imagine this trend will continue , especially when you consider that in a lot of cases the libraries implement the core language .
Aside : I was surprised to discover last year that genuinely new and important stack language abstractions like ' fry ' and the cleave / spread combinators were only just being conceived , despite Factor being quite a few years old and stack languages in general being many decades old .
When you consider that very few languages actually ' invent ' new features this makes Factor quite an interesting language in itself .
Also interesting is that apart from a small bootstrapping core , the factor language is actually implemented in libraries meaning that anybody can build and experiment with new language constructs .
Anyway I 'm diverging from the subject so I ought to sum up .
The takeaway is : Whereas other languages provide the ability to create good abstractions , Factor pretty much forces you to create good abstractions because it is so bloody difficult to write any code without them .
--
Update : During writing this post I realised that what I 'm doing with map - window is actually very similar to an abstraction in the factor library called < clumps > which constructs a virtual array of overlapping subsequences .
That 's the nature of factor programming : you keep finding that somebody else has built a similar abstraction to yours and it would have saved you a ton of time if only you 'd realised !

Even for that small price , I doubt anyone would buy it .
I still appluad the artist who took the time to draw out the whole outside world map of the original Zelda game on the car .
But it is just way too tacky .
The original owner is selling it because she got a new Prius .
It only has 110 k miles on it , which is really good for a car of that age .

A Future Interstate Rail Network - Redux
This is the second , revised , piece on a national rail network .
The first is here .
Reconsideration
After quite a response to The Transport Politic ’s original post on envisioning a new intercity rail network , I ’d like to offer up some revisions to the proposal .
Most of the alterations have been made to the high - speed network , though there were some minor changes to the standard - speed network as well .
In this post , I ’ve also delved a bit deeper into how such a rail network could be implemented , described how the routes were chosen and judged , and listed other routes that were considered and rejected because of poor cost - effectiveness .
— Proposed National Rail Route Network – Standard and HSR Routes HSR Route Network – Phasing HSR Route Network – Corridors — Implementing the National Intercity Rail Network
The method by which the United States currently funds intercity railroad lines is skewed towards state and region - centric projects without consideration for how the national rail network works as a whole .
For instance , states like North Carolina and Michigan pay Amtrak to subsidize routes in their states , and the result is that both states have somewhat better service than many states that do n’t spend to join the national system .
The problem , however , is that travel on railways is not confined to states – passengers from North Carolina may want to get to Atlanta , but if South Carolina and Georgia do n’t put up the funds to participate , passengers in North Carolina lose out .
Similarly , the state of Michigan may improve its tracks , but if Illinois and Indiana do n’t do the same , passengers traveling from Detroit to Chicago wo n’t benefit as much as they could .
It is for this reason that a railway system must be planned , financed , and built at the national scale .
Our existing dysfunctional national policy suggests that states will be able to coordinate their decision - making , but considering the lack of high - speed rail development since 1991 , when federal policy first addressed the issue , I ca n’t help but be skeptical .
The federal government must use an empirical system such as the one presented here to prioritize corridors throughout the nation – without considering state borders – and then designate funds to sponsor them .
Relying on states to plan the systems and then provide the majority of funds is simply unrealistic .
the transport politic ’s suggestion is that the most appropriate way to get the ball rolling is to separate train operations – Amtrak – from track possession and maintenance by setting up a national infrastructure owner – let ’s call it NatTrack .
This agency would take hold of the Amtrak - owned Northeast Corridor and begin acquiring and assembling land for future high - speed rail corridors .
Through eminent domain , it would also take possession of a large number of the nation ’s freight lines , most of which are currently under - maintained and poorly managed , and begin converting them to standard - speed rail operations .
NatTrack would manage route creation , not only in buying land and constructing track , but in prioritizing corridors to build new lines , deciding which to implement , and when .
Our suggestion for such an implementation order is presented in the table below .
NatTrack would pay for tracks through grants and bonds – similar to the financial model being proposed for the California High - Speed Rail project .
The federal government would contribute 50 to 90 % of each project ’s cost in grants ( it currently pays for 80 to 90 % of the nation ’s roadways ) .
Since the rail system is an interstate one and its creation would provide numerous economic benefits , such as transit - oriented development and decreased travel times , this seems appropriate .
The rest of each project ’s cost would come from debt - financed bonds released by the private market but backed by Washington .
Considering the profitability of high - speed rail lines in countries all over the world ( as well as that of the Northeast Corridor ) , it seems reasonable to suggest that service along American HSR lines would be profitable enough to cover operating costs and some of the debt from the original construction .
Upgrades to standard - speed corridors , which would likely not be as profitable , could be sponsored with 80 - 90 % grants from the federal government and from small ( 10 - 20 % ) contributions from affected states .
The creation of NatTrack need not mean the privatization of Amtrak , which would continue to operate the nation ’s intercity train service .
In fact , in France , for instance , rails are owned by the RFF and trains are run by the SNCF ; both organizations are nationalized .
We ’ve made the argument in the past that national ownership of both tracks and train operation makes sense .
Amtrak ’s role would be to buy trains and run them ; it would pay NatTrack to run trains along the tracks , and NatTrack would use that revenue to pay for maintenance costs along those corridors as well as to pay for debt service on corridor construction .
Existing intercity rail lines and freight lines would be slowly converted to the standard - speed operation ( 70 - 120 mph ) that we present in the maps above .
These corridors would also be absorbed by NatTrack , which , after double - tracking and potentially electrifying them , would then lease back operation rights to both freight services and Amtrak .
Allowing freight companies to own the tracks makes little sense and has resulted in Amtrak being treated as the secondary operator ; a national owner would weigh the needs of both passenger and freight operations and be fairer and more efficient in scheduling trains .
High - speed rail lines would not be shared with freight trains , but the right - of - way could be shared .
In other words , if the corridor were wide enough , NatTrack could allow for the operation of freight trains along parallel tracks .
The fundamental jump that the U.S. government must take is the creation of an organization such as NatTrack .
Public ownership of our railways and federal government leadership in the creation of new corridors are rational first steps towards a unified national system that provides competitive and valuable train service throughout the country .

How Routes
Were Chosen and Judged the transport politic ’s proposal was informed by an analysis of potential travel between metro regions of populations greater than 100,000 and between 50 and 500 miles apart .
The system proposed here would represent a massive change from the service provided by Amtrak today .
It would emphasize train travel that ’s competitive with airlines in time , rather than the day or days - long travel that is the hallmark of Amtrak today .
The vast majority of train travel would occur on trains running at 150 mph or above on routes of 500 miles or less .
Roads and airports along these corridors would be significantly decongested as more people choose to take the train instead of a car for short to medium distances ( 50 - 200 miles ) and the train instead of the airplane for long distance ( 300 - 500 miles ) travel .
There is no transcontinental high - speed railroad proposed here because high - speed rail simply does n’t attract particularly high ridership above the 500 mile travel distance ; the best way to get from the East Coast to the West Coast will – and should , barring some unforeseen technological advance – remain via airplane .
Though we ’ve separated the routes described here into a set of named corridors , users , being able to travel from one to another seamlessly , would n’t necessarily perceive where one corridor ends and another begins .
Train operations would be scheduled by Amtrak depending on ridership ; the corridor scores in the table below provide a basic estimate for travel demand along each of the lines .
Some standard - speed corridors would act as extensions of the high - speed services and allow for trains to run on both types of track ; this would allow people living in an area without direct access to high - speed lines to still be able to travel on high - speed trains to other destinations .
Other standard - speed corridors with lower ridership would operate with their own train sets and require passengers to transfer at high - speed stations to get onto high - speed lines .
The system does not emphasize airport connections , because the high - speed system is meant to serve as an economic generator for the nation ’s inner cities , as well as provide for regional inter-connectivity .
Cities and states would have an incentive to prop up their local transit systems if there were a well - used rail hub at the center of each metropolitan area .
There could be some service to airports , of course , especially to those that happen to be well positioned along the rail lines , such as SFO , Newark , BWI , and DFW .
But most airports should be connected to city centers via local transit and commuter rail .
In order to calculate the cost effectiveness of each route on the high - speed system , the transport politic used a relatively simple methodology based on travel between city pairs 50 to 500 miles apart .
The calculations assume the following : that a big city to big city route attracts more passengers than a small city to small city route ; that a big city to small city route attracts more passengers than a small city to small city route ; that as distances increase , ridership decreases , though not proportionately .
I recognize that these assumptions may be incorrect in many cases , but they provide a reasonable start for further research on this subject .
These calculations do not take into account regional economic integration nor current air or road corridor travel – adding this information to the metric in the future would be a useful improvement .
The assumption that as distances increase , ridership decreases is based on the obvious truth that there is simply more overall travel between cities that are close to one another than cities that are far apart .
A commenter suggested that in fact high - speed rail market share increases as distance increases – this is true , because people are less likely to drive as a journey ’s distance increases .
However , the overall travel market does decrease as the distance increases , meaning that even with a higher market share , there will be fewer high - speed rail journeys .
The metric recognizes that .
But I recognize that the proposal presented here is no magic bullet , and the calculations used to support it are certainly not exhaustive .
That said , this is simply the beginning of what should be a years - long process to establish a national track owner , to plan a series of national rail corridors , to build them , and , finally , to operate them .
Starting with a big vision , just as we did with the Interstate highways system fifty years ago , is an important first step .
Alterations in the High - Speed Rail Network from the First Proposal
The Crescent Route would now run from Birmingham south to Montgomery and Pensacola , then west to New Orleans , before continuing on to Houston .
This change would , according to our calculations , increase travel about two - fold by serving the Gulf Coast ’s relatively populated areas .

The SouthEastern Route would now end in Macon , rather than continuing on to Jacksonville – the route from Macon to Savannah was extremely low - performing .
A new route , however , from Charlotte through Columbia , Charleston , and Savannah to Jacksonville , would be better - performing and improve access to South Carolina ’s biggest cities .

The Texas CrossState Route , which was rightfully criticized before , has been reconsidered along the lines of the Texas T - Bone proposal , with a line from Dallas directly to San Antonio and another from Temple to Houston .
This would be more cost effective per mile and decrease travel times for more routes .

The CrossCanada Lines were changed slightly – Toronto has been added to CC1 and Hamilton removed from CC2 ; this improves the performance of the CC1 line and Toronto serves as a more logical terminus than relatively small Hamilton ;
Lines were changed slightly – Toronto has been added to CC1 and Hamilton removed from CC2 ; this improves the performance of the CC1 line and Toronto serves as a more logical terminus than relatively small Hamilton ; I ’ve also included two possible connections to Mexico : south from San Diego to Tijuana and south from San Antonio , through Corpus Christi , Brownsville , and McAllen , to Monterrey .
These would make sense in the future if and when U.S. / Mexico border relations improve significantly .
Total high - speed rail system mileage increased to 10,669 miles .
( New rankings , based on the changes presented above , are at the bottom of the post . )
Other Routes Evaluated and Rejected
Alternative routings for high - speed rail were considered , but rejected because of lower scores than the final routes chosen : LA - Phoenix - Tucson scored higher than the rejected LA - Flagstaff - Prescott - Phoenix ;
Extensions of the Colorado CrossState proposal south from Pueblo scored too low to be included ; a connection from Santa Fe to El Paso via Albuquerque also scored too low ;
An extension of the NorthWestern south from Porland to Eugene is not cost - effective ;
Connections from Vancouver east to Calgary and from Calgary north to Edmonton scored too low to be included ;
The Lakes 2 routing from Chicago to Cleveland was chosen over a routing through Michigan ( Ann Arbor , Kalamazoo , etc ) ; the former had a higher Overall Score ;
A route from Oklahoma City to Kansas City through Wichita scored lower than the route through Tulsa presented here ;
The original alignment through Texas , from Dallas to Austin to Houston , was rejected in favor of the T - Bone Corridor shown here ;
The original Crescent 4 and 5 alignments , from Birmingham to Dallas , via Jackson , and with a spur to New Orleans , scored significantly lower than the new alignment from Birmingham south to Mobile and then west to New Orleans and Houston ;
A shorter line directly from Raleigh to Charlotte in North Carolina was rejected in favor of the more populated routing through Durham , Burlington , and Greensboro ;
Various routings from Knoxville to Little Rock , via Nashville and Memphis , scored too low to be included ;
A routing from St. Louis south to New Orleans through Memphis and Jackson scored too low to be included ;
The Macon - Savannah - Jacksonville alignment scored considerably lower than the Charlotte - Columbia - Charleston - Savannah - Jacksonville alignment presented here .

Note : the order presented above does not always correspond to the scores presented , notably in the case of California CrossState 1 .
That corridor is emphasized because it is further ahead in planning than any other of the nation ’s high - speed lines .
Other corridors are rearranged depending on the needs of the overall system .
For instance , CrossCanada 1 is placed ahead of New York CrossState 1 because of the value it would bring to Midwest - to - Northeast travel .
High - speed lines to Mexico ( from San Diego to Tijuana and from San Antonio to Monterrey via Corpus Christi , Brownsville , McAllen , and Juarez ) are not calculated because of the currently tenuous border situation .

SAN FRANCISCO --
Wind power developers have long relied on complex tax - equity financing to bring most of their projects to market , but that system , once hailed as innovative , has collapsed over the last year , leaving the wind sector flailing for the cash it needs to make generation projects a reality .
This is how it worked : Large financial institutions like AIG , Wachovia , J.P. Morgan , Wells Fargo , Lehman Brothers and others would buy federal tax benefits from renewable energy startups that did not have enough taxable income to use the credits on their own .
In other words , big financial firms traded financing to offset tax liability .
So - called tax - equity investors would bankroll a solar or wind project in exchange for a tax shelter , which was effectively pinned to profits .
The system worked as long as Congress renewed the federal investment and production tax credits that granted developers a range of incentives , and it was widely viewed as a essential avenue within the renewable energy development community .
No more .
The system , like other schemes crafted by insiders , has crumbled as AIG , Lehman and others have collapsed .
The big boys no longer have cash to bankroll projects or the means to pull the profits to get credits , so the tax - equity space has turned into a financial dead zone .
According to figures from Hudson Clean Energy Partners , about 25 of the largest financial firms were active in tax equity for alternative energy in 2007 .
But at least 16 of them left the field last year ( Greenwire , March 20 ) .
That means an industry that had consolidated behind a handful of major players was left vulnerable to their demise .
Wind in particular had banked on tax equity , financing 95 percent of its projects through this system in 2007 and following the same track in 2008 until the crash , according to numbers from J.P. Morgan .
So what now ?
Experts at a cleantech conference last week offered a simple fix : Figure out how to tap the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act , the economic stimulus law .
Adding finance options
Like their solar counterparts , wind companies sense opportunity in a stimulus provision that provides cash grants in lieu of tax credits for renewable energy .
The program has solar companies breathing a sigh of relief , a feeling that appears to have spread to wind developers ( Greenwire , March 26 ) .
Under the previous investment tax credit , renewable energy developers could apply a 30 percent credit only to profits as a deduction .
But the stimulus , for a period of two years , has made it possible to get back the 30 percent as cash , under a grant program to be administered by the Treasury Department .
Wind power is now eligible for the grant program , the plans for which are still being finalized by Treasury 's understaffed tax department .
Once the program gets going , one analyst said , the system should thaw frozen credit markets over the next few months -- a little bit at a time .
" It adds a number of options for how to finance a project , " said Tyler Tringas , a wind energy analyst at New Energy Finance .
" It gives [ the developers ] a new sort of very large decision tree to finance a wind project . "
Standing to benefit , Tringas explained , are smaller projects that were often ignored by large tax - equity investors who were inclined to back bigger installations .
Before the meltdown , a small community developer " would be very hard pressed to get an elite group of tax - equity investors , " he said .
" You 're going to be able to access a much broader base of capital at a lower rate , " Tringas said .
" This is going to be pretty good for a lot of those marginal projects . "
And the policy may have come along just in time .
Warren Byrne , founder and CEO of Foresight Wind Energy , and Tom Carbone , CEO of Nordic Windpower , both said the previous system had set up a top - heavy dynamic that may ultimately have hurt the fledgling sector .
" You could count on two hands the companies responsible for financing , " Carbone said .
" That was a dangerous landscape to have . "
Temporary fix ?
But others took issue with this maze of tax incentives , so - called partnership swaps and cash grants .
To Yaron Brook , president and executive director of the Ayn Rand Institute , the stimulus is the latest example of government meddling in free markets to subsidize uncompetitive energy sources .
Brook said the government , in setting up the grants , would distort energy markets by favoring wind , solar and other renewable sources .
He compared the policy shift under the Obama administration to lawmakers ' subsidizing of mortgages , which led to " enormous unintended consequences . "
" We should learn from the financial crisis , " Brook said .
" Using tax policy to get us all into a home was probably not a good idea . "
The same could be said of renewable energy , in Brook 's view , because the tax policies could divert public dollars away from scalable power plants that do not rely on intermittent energy .
" It is going to be disruptive , and it is going to ultimately be destructive -- particularly to entrepreneurs , " he said .
Tringas countered that he regards the stimulus as a temporary solution until Congress passes a national renewable portfolio standard , which would send much simpler signals to the market , or a cap - and - trade system to regulate carbon emissions from power plants .
He added that he does not believe in government meddling , but he does think lawmakers need to account somehow for the cost of carbon .
" This is enough to keep the wind industry moving forward , " Tringas said of the stimulus .
" It 's enough to prevent the catastrophic collapse that might have happened . "
He added , " There was a big problem with the primary source of capital essentially evaporating . "
That is just fine for Brook , who said he doubts the science behind climate change and views carbon policy as a giant waste of money .
" I do n't believe there 's an externality cost to CO2 , " he told Tringas .
' Dead as hell '
So how badly is the sector hurting ?
Oil tycoon turned wind speculator T. Boone Pickens recently described the wind market as " dead as hell " to the Wall Street Journal .
Richard Saunders , director of project development at GreenHunter Renewable Power , said Pickens was not far off .
Saunders estimates that in 2009 , about 4,000 megawatts in new wind capacity will come online .
That would be down significantly from the 8,400 MW built last year .
And much of the new capacity is " really just things that are carrying over " from permits already issued in 2008 .
" They 've slowed down their activities tremendously , " Saunders said .
" They can't get the money . "
While Saunders is optimistic that activity will pick up by the end of the year , Geoff Sharples , principal of renewable energy at Google Inc. , is not so sure .
" The stimulus is intended to make 2009 not a terrible year , " Sharples told attendees at the cleantech conference .
" But it 's pretty hard to tell how many banks are looking at this and thinking , ' How are we going to come in and make this play ? ' "
Gregory Jenner , a former tax specialist at Treasury and a partner at Stoel Rives LLP , said Treasury staff members are writing rules for the cash grant program as fast as they can .
Jenner said he has talked to staff and expects " something coming out of Treasury very very quickly . "
" The bad news is they 've never done anything like this before , " Jenner added , in a note of warning .
" They 're trying to figure out how it works . "

I ’m going to let you in on a little secret .
Come closer now …come closer .
Lean in .
Are you ready ?
I ’m going to whisper .
( I like soup . )
Do n’t tell anyone !
Okay , so I just made a big deal out of nothing .
But the fact remains that I love soup , especially at this chilly ( chilly ? try frigid ) time of year .
And out of all the soups in my repertoire ( have you tried this one yet ?
Your heart will rejoice ) , the one that most says “ Comfort Food ” to me is my mom ’s time - tested Cauliflower Soup .
It ’s brothy .
Savory .
Creamy .
Filled with tender chunks of cauliflower and all the comforts of home .
I ’ve made it in my own household for years … and today I share it with you .
Keep in mind that while this soup may appear to have a lot of steps , there ’s nothing difficult about it .
Just get your ingredients ready and it ’ll be a cinch .
Here ’s what you ’ll need :
The Cast of Characters : Cauliflower , Carrot , Onion , Celery , Chicken Broth or Stock , Milk , Half & Half , Butter , Flour , Salt , Pepper , Sour Cream , and Parsley ( fresh or dried ) .
Wash 1 to 2 heads of cauliflower , depending on how chunky you ’d like the soup to be .
I use about a head and 1/3 of another head .
Just whack the head in half and get rid of the hard inner core and green parts .
Then just roughly chop the cauliflower .
You could be meticulous and cut the cauliflower into neat little florets … but why ?
Next , finely dice one carrot .
I just cut strips in the carrot , then rotate the strips 90 degrees and finely dice .
I do the same to the celery : just cut it into strips , then dice .
Same goes with the onion : first cut lines / strips …
<
Then dice away !
Then say the following word : Mirepoix , pronounced “ mi-reh - pwah . ”
That ’s what this is .
Place a stock pot or dutch oven over medium high heat and melt 4 tablespoons butter in the pan .
When the butter ’s melted , throw in the onions .
Stir them around for 2 to 3 minutes , or until they get a little color .
Throw in the carrots and celery …
And stir it around for a minute or so .
Now just throw in the cauliflower .
If it ’s finely diced , it should measure to about 2 quarts .
If it ’s large and weird like mine , more like 3 quarts .
Stir it around to combine …
Next , and please do n’t hate me , add 2 tablespoons fresh parsley , if you have it .
PLEASE , IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT IS GOOD IN THE WORLD AND YOU FIND YOURSELF LUCKY ENOUGH TO LIVE NEAR A SUPERMARKET THAT CARRIES FRESH PARSLEY , add it in .
If you do n’t , however , use dried parsley flakes .
In the end , you wo n’t even be able to tell .
Give it a good stir , reduce the heat to low …
And cover the pot .
Simmer on low heat for 15 minutes , stirring once or twice during the process .
When 15 minutes is over , pour in 2 quarts of chicken broth .
If you have homemade stock in your freezer , go for it .
If you do n’t , but it in the store .
Just be sure to buy the low sodium variety so you ’ll be able to control the salt content of the soup .
It ’s all about control , people .
Cauliflower and control .
Bring to a boil over medium heat , then reduce heat and let the soup simmer .
While it ’s simmering , melt 4 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan over medium - low heat .
In a separate bowl , pour 2 cups whole milk .
I always use whole milk in soups because … well , because .
Add 6 tablespons flour to the milk …
Mix together with a whisk .
As soon as the butter in melted …
Pour the milk / flour mixture into the saucepan .
Stir to combine .
Almost immediately , it ’ll thicken into a nice white sauce .
Did you know you just made a white sauce ?
It ’s true !
Well , I made it for you , but still .
Your heart was in it .
Next , because the world is a crazy place , add 1 cup of half & half to the white sauce .
And now for the fun part :
Pour the white sauce into the simmering soup mixture .
Yum .
This SHORE smells good .
Now , just throw in a bay leaf or two .
And a little bit of salt .
We ’ll want to taste the soup before adding much salt .
Now just let the soup simmer for 15 to 20 minutes .
It ’ll fill your house with fanciful aromas and feelings .
Here ’s my soup tureen .
My old friend , Sissy , gave it to me when I got married and it made my heart go pitter - pat .
I love you , Sissy .
Thank you for my soup tureen .
It always make me think of you .
China check : Spode “ Blue Italian ”
Now , here ’s the kicker : just before serving , throw 1 generous cup of sour cream into the serving bowl or tureen .
Add 2 to 3 ladles of hot soup into the serving bowl …
Give it a good stir , just to get the sour cream used to the soup .
Pour the rest of the soup into the serving bowl .
And let me tell you , if you do n’t think this stuff is beyond yummy , you ’ve got another thing comin ’ .
It makes me tingle .
In a really , really good way .
And YOU can tingle , TOO !
Just make this soup today .
Oh !
And one more thing :
Have a wonderful day !

MIT ’s latest solar race car might look like a funky Ikea table with a hump , but do n’t laugh .
It ’ll do 90 mph and is packed with technology that may end up in the hybrids and EVs the rest of us will soon be driving .
The university ’s Solar Electric Vehicle Team , the oldest such team in the country , unveiled the $ 243,000 carbon - fiber racer dubbed Eleanor on Friday and is shaking the car down to prepare for its inaugural race later this year .
" It drives beautifully , " said George Hansel , a freshman physics major at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a member of the team .
" It ’s fun to drive and quite a spectacle . "
Eleanor is slated to compete in the tenth World Solar Challenge , a seven - day race across nearly 2,000 miles of Australian outback .
Vehicles competing in the endurance race may look hopelessly impractical , but the competition is a test bed for batteries , motor technology and power - management systems that may eventually appear in hybrids and electric vehicles .
Like Formula 1 and other big - budget motor sports , the solar challenge helps develop some of the vehicles we see in showrooms .
" It pushes the technology from the books to real life , " said Spencer Quong , senior vehicles analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists .
" It opens the industry ’s eyes to how to build a more efficient vehicle . "
Like , say , the Chevrolet Volt range - extended EV , the forthcoming electric car that General Motors has all but bet its future on .
The Volt is a direct descendant of the Sunraycer solar car General Motors developed with AeroVironment and Hughes Aircraft in 1987 .
Sunraycer smoked the rest of the grid in the inaugural World Solar Challenge , raising quite a few eyebrows back in Detroit .
" The unexpected success of the Sunraycer made GM leadership take notice as to what might be technologically possible , " said Jon Bereisa , a longtime member of GM ’s advanced - propulsion team who is now working on the Volt .
" It finished the race across Australia a full three days ahead of its competitors , powered by an electric motor that consumed as much power as a hair dryer , at speeds up to 45 mph , and the solar - powered batteries were still fully charged . "
GM execs were impressed enough to greenlight the Impact concept car , which became the groundbreaking EV1 electric car .
GM famously killed the EV1 in 2003 , but the car lives on in the Volt , which is slated for production by the end of next year .
" One might say sunlight and solar started a bright idea after all , " Bereisa said .
MIT ’s solar team entered its first race in 1987 , and Eleanor is its 10th car .
A change in the rules requiring drivers to sit upright instead of stretching out makes Eleanor taller than earlier cars but no less aerodynamic .
The team spent six months designing the body before fine - tuning it in Ford Motor Company ’s wind tunnel .
The result is a super - slippery drag coefficient of 0.11 , making Eleanor more aerodynamic than a Toyota Prius , the EV1 or even the super - slick Aptera 2e electric car .
Aerodynamic efficiency is paramount to extending battery range , especially when you ’re dealing with batteries charged by the sun .
Eleanor features 580 silicon solar cells manufactured by Sun Power .
They cover six square meters ( about 64.5 square feet ) and generate 1,200 watts — enough to run a hair dryer or a pair of desktop computers .
The juice is stored in a 6 - kilowatt - hour Genasun battery pack comprising 693 lithium - ion cells .
The battery weighs 32 kilograms ( about 71 pounds ) and provides sufficient range — even without sunlight — to get the car from Boston to New York .
Propulsion comes from a 10 - horsepower hub - mounted motor driving the lone rear wheel .
" A three - wheel vehicle simplifies suspension design , " Hansel said .
" It ’s also traditional . "
Everything is packaged in a chrome - moly steel frame wrapped in carbon - fiber - and - Kevlar bodywork .
The car weighs just under 500 pounds , and the top half of the body weighs just 40 pounds — with the solar cells .
Racing across Australia will require more than getting in , buckling up and mashing the accelerator pedal .
There ’s a tremendous amount of strategy involved , with careful consideration of everything from road conditions and terrain to the weather forecast .
Maximizing efficiency and range is the name of the game .
" You ’ve got to go 2,000 miles , you ’ve got specific hours you can drive and you ’ve got a fixed amount of energy in the battery , " said Spencer Quong , the Union of Concerned Scientists expert who is a member of the Team New England solar race team .
That ’s not to say Eleanor ca n’t get up and go .
She ’ll run all day at 55 mph , and although no one ’s put the pedal to the metal yet , Hansel says the math suggests Eleanor is capable of 90 mph .
Not that anyone will push her that hard .
With their stiff suspensions and hollow bodies , solar race cars tend to resonate like drums at high speeds , creating a rumble that can be disconcerting in the driver ’s seat .
" Our previous car , Tesseract , was very fast .
It was taken up to 85 mph before the driver got terrified , " he said .
" You reach the driver limit before you reach the motor limit . "

The most challenging problems of social policy in the modern world are never merely technical .
In order properly to decide how we should govern ourselves , we must take up questions of social ethics and human values .
What manner of people are we Americans ?
What vision would we affirm , and what example would we set , before the rest of the world ?
What kind of society would we bequeath to our children ?
How shall we live ?
Inevitably , queries such as these lurk just beneath the surface of the great policy debates of the day .
So , those who would enter into public argument about what ails our common life need make no apology for speaking in such terms .
It is precisely in these terms that I wish to discuss a preeminent moral challenge for our time — that imprisonment on a massive scale has become one of the central aspects of our nation ’s social policy toward the poor , powerfully impairing the lives of some of the most marginal of our fellow citizens , especially the poorly educated black and Hispanic men who reside in large numbers in our great urban centers .
The bare facts of this matter — concerning both the scale of incarceration and its racial disparity — have been much remarked upon of late .
Simply put , we have become a nation of jailers and , arguably , racist jailers at that .
The past four decades have witnessed a truly historic expansion , and transformation , of penal institutions in the United States — at every level of government , and in all regions of the country .
We have , by any measure , become a vastly more punitive society .
Measured in constant dollars and taking account of all levels of government , spending on corrections and law enforcement in the United States has more than quadrupled over the last quarter century .
As a result , the American prison system has grown into a leviathan unmatched in human history .
This development should be deeply troubling to anyone who professes to love liberty .
Here , as in other areas of social policy , the United States is a stark international outlier , sitting at the most rightward end of the political spectrum :
We imprison at a far higher rate than the other industrial democracies — higher , indeed , than either Russia or China , and vastly higher than any of the countries of Western Europe .
According to the International Centre for Prison Studies in London , there were in 2005 some 9 million prisoners in the world ; more than 2 million were being held in the United States .
With approximately one twentieth of the world ’s population , America had nearly one fourth of the world ’s inmates .
At more than 700 per 100,000 residents , the U.S. incarceration rate was far greater than our nearest competitors ( the Bahamas , Belarus , and Russia , which each have a rate of about 500 per 100,000 . )
Other industrial societies , some of them with big crime problems of their own , were less punitive than we by an order of magnitude : the United States incarcerated at 6.2 times the rate of Canada , 7.8 times the rate of France , and 12.3 times the rate of Japan .
The demographic profile of the inmate population has also been much discussed .
In this , too , the U.S. is an international outlier .
African Americans and Hispanics , who taken together are about one fourth of the population , account for about two thirds of state prison inmates .
Roughly one third of state prisoners were locked up for committing violent offenses , with the remainder being property and drug offenders .
Nine in ten are male , and most are impoverished .
Inmates in state institutions average fewer than eleven years of schooling .
The extent of racial disparity in imprisonment rates exceeds that to be found in any other arena of American social life : at eight to one , the black to white ratio of male incarceration rates dwarfs the two to one ratio of unemployment rates , the three to one non-marital child bearing ratio , the two to one ratio of infant mortality rates and the one to five ratio of net worth .
More black male high school dropouts are in prison than belong to unions or are enrolled in any state or federal social welfare programs .
The brute fact of the matter is that the primary contact between black American young adult men and their government is via the police and the penal apparatus .
Coercion is the most salient feature of their encounters with the state .
According to estimates compiled by sociologist Bruce Western , nearly 60 % of black male dropouts born between 1965 and 1969 had spent at least one year in prison before reaching the age of 35 .
For these men , and the families and communities with which they are associated , the adverse effects of incarceration will extend beyond their stays behind bars .
My point is that this is not merely law enforcement policy .
It is social policy writ large .
And no other country in the world does it quite like we do .
This is far more than a technical issue — entailing more , that is , than the task of finding the most efficient crime control policies .
Consider , for instance , that it is not possible to conduct a cost - benefit analysis of our nation ’s world - historic prison buildup over the past 35 years without implicitly specifying how the costs imposed on the persons imprisoned , and their families , are to be reckoned .
Of course , this has not stopped analysts from pronouncing on the purported net benefits to “ society ” of greater incarceration without addressing that question !
Still , how — or , indeed , whether — to weigh the costs born by law - breakers — that is , how ( or whether ) to acknowledge their humanity — remains a fundamental and difficult question of social ethics .
Political discourses in the United States have given insufficient weight to the collateral damage imposed by punishment policies on the offenders themselves , and on those who are knitted together with offenders in networks of social and psychic affiliation .
Whether or not one agrees , two things should be clear : social scientists can have no answers for the question of what weight to put on a “ thug ’s , ” or his family ’s , well - being ; and a morally defensible public policy to deal with criminal offenders cannot be promulgated without addressing that question .
To know whether or not our criminal justice policies comport with our deepest values , we must ask how much additional cost borne by the offending class is justifiable per marginal unit of security , or of peace of mind , for the rest of us .
This question is barely being asked , let alone answered , in the contemporary debate .
Nor is it merely the scope of the mass imprisonment state that has expanded so impressively in the United States .
The ideas underlying the doing of criminal justice — the superstructure of justifications and rationalizations — have also undergone a sea change .
Rehabilitation is a dead letter ; retribution is the thing .
The function of imprisonment is not to reform or redirect offenders .
Rather , it is to keep them away from us .
“ The prison , ” writes sociologist David Garland , “ is used today as a kind of reservation , a quarantine zone in which purportedly dangerous individuals are segregated in the name of public safety . ”
We have elaborated what are , in effect , a “ string of work camps and prisons strung across a vast country housing millions of people drawn mainly from classes and racial groups that are seen as politically and economically problematic . ”
We have , in other words , marched quite a long way down the punitive road , in the name of securing public safety and meting out to criminals their just deserts .
And we should be ashamed of ourselves for having done so .
Consider a striking feature of this policy development , one that is crucial to this moral assessment : the ways in which we now deal with criminal offenders in the United States have evolved in recent decades in order to serve expressive and not only instrumental ends .
We have wanted to “ send a message , ” and have done so with a vengeance .
Yet in the process we have also , in effect , provided an answer for the question : who is to blame for the maladies that beset our troubled civilization ?
That is , we have constructed a narrative , created scapegoats , assuaged our fears , and indulged our need to feel virtuous about ourselves .
We have met the enemy and the enemy , in the now familiar caricature , is them — a bunch of anomic , menacing , morally deviant “ thugs . ”
In the midst of this dramaturgy — unavoidably so in America — lurks a potent racial subplot .
This issue is personal for me .
As a black American male , a baby - boomer born and raised on Chicago ’s South Side , I can identify with the plight of the urban poor because I have lived among them .
I am related to them by the bonds of social and psychic affiliation .
As it happens , I have myself passed through the courtroom , and the jailhouse , on my way along life ’s journey .
I have sat in the visitor ’s room at a state prison ; I have known , personally and intimately , men and women who lived their entire lives with one foot to either side of the law .
Whenever I step to a lectern to speak about the growth of imprisonment in our society , I envision voiceless and despairing people who would have me speak on their behalf .
Of course , personal biography can carry no authority to compel agreement about public policy .
Still , I prefer candor to the false pretense of clinical detachment and scientific objectivity .
I am not running for high office ; I need not pretend to a cool neutrality that I do not possess .
While I recognize that these revelations will discredit me in some quarters , this is a fate I can live with .
So , my racial identity is not irrelevant to my discussion of the subject at hand .
But , then , neither is it irrelevant that among the millions now in custody and under state supervision are to be found a vastly disproportionate number of the black and the brown .
There is no need to justify injecting race into this discourse , for prisons are the most race - conscious public institutions that we have .
No big city police officer is “ colorblind ” nor , arguably , can any afford to be .
Crime and punishment in America have a color — just turn on a television , or open a magazine , or listen carefully to the rhetoric of a political campaign — and you will see what I mean .
The fact is that , in this society as in any other , order is maintained by the threat and the use of force .
We enjoy our good lives because we are shielded by the forces of law and order upon which we rely to keep the unruly at bay .
Yet , in this society to an extent unlike virtually any other , those bearing the heavy burden of order - enforcement belong , in numbers far exceeding their presence in the population at large , to racially defined and historically marginalized groups .
Why should this be so ?
And how can those charged with the supervision of our penal apparatus sleep well at night knowing that it is so ?
This punitive turn in the nation ’s social policy is intimately connected , I would maintain , with public rhetoric about responsibility , dependency , social hygiene , and the reclamation of public order .
And such rhetoric , in turn , can be fully grasped only when viewed against the backdrop of America ’s often ugly and violent racial history :
There is a reason why our inclination toward forgiveness and the extension of a second chance to those who have violated our behavioral strictures is so stunted , and why our mainstream political discourses are so bereft of self - examination and searching social criticism .
An historical resonance between the stigma of race and the stigma of prison has served to keep alive in our public culture the subordinating social meanings that have always been associated with blackness .
Many historians and political scientists — though , of course , not all — agree that the shifting character of race relations over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries helps to explain why the United States is exceptional among democratic industrial societies in the severity of its punitive policy and the paucity of its social - welfare institutions .
Put directly and without benefit of euphemism , the racially disparate incidence of punishment in the United States is a morally troubling residual effect of the nation ’s history of enslavement , disenfranchisement , segregation , and discrimination .
It is not merely the accidental accretion of neutral state action , applied to a racially divergent social flux .
It is an abhorrent expression of who we Americans are as a people , even now , at the dawn of the twenty - first century .
My recitation of the brutal facts about punishment in today ’s America may sound to some like a primal scream at this monstrous social machine that is grinding poor black communities to dust .
And I confess that these facts do at times leave me inclined to cry out in despair .
But my argument is intended to be moral , not existential , and its principal thesis is this : we law - abiding , middle - class Americans have made collective decisions on social and incarceration policy questions , and we benefit from those decisions .
That is , we benefit from a system of suffering , rooted in state violence , meted out at our behest .
Put differently our society — the society we together have made — first tolerates crime - promoting conditions in our sprawling urban ghettos , and then goes on to act out rituals of punishment against them as some awful form of human sacrifice .
It is a central reality of our time that a wide racial gap has opened up in cognitive skills , the extent of law - abidingness , stability of family relations , and attachment to the work force .
This is the basis , many would hold , for the racial gap in imprisonment .
Yet I maintain that this gap in human development is , as a historical matter , rooted in political , economic , social , and cultural factors peculiar to this society and reflective of its unlovely racial history .
That is to say , it is a societal , not communal or personal , achievement .
At the level of the individual case we must , of course , act as if this were not so .
There could be no law , and so no civilization , absent the imputation to persons of responsibility for their wrongful acts .
But the sum of a million cases , each one rightly judged fairly on its individual merits , may nevertheless constitute a great historic wrong .
This is , in my view , now the case in regards to the race and social class disparities that characterize the very punitive policy that we have directed at lawbreakers .
And yet , the state does not only deal with individual cases .
It also makes policies in the aggregate , and the consequences of these policies are more or less knowable .
It is in the making of such aggregate policy judgments that questions of social responsibility arise .
This situation raises a moral problem that we cannot avoid .
We cannot pretend that there are more important problems in our society , or that this circumstance is the necessary solution to other , more pressing problems — unless we are also prepared to say that we have turned our backs on the ideal of equality for all citizens and abandoned the principles of justice .
We ought to be asking ourselves two questions : Just what manner of people are we Americans ?
And in light of this , what are our obligations to our fellow citizens — even those who break our laws ?
Without trying to make a full - fledged philosophical argument here , I nevertheless wish to gesture — in the spirit of the philosopher John Rawls — toward some answers to these questions .
I will not set forth a policy manifesto at this time .
What I aim to do is suggest , in a general way , how we ought to be thinking differently about this problem .
Specifically , given our nation ’s history and political culture , I think that there are severe limits to the applicability in this circumstance of a pure ethic of personal responsibility , as the basis for distributing the negative good of punishment in contemporary America .
I urge that we shift the boundary toward greater acknowledgment of social responsibility in our punishment policy discourse — even for wrongful acts freely chosen by individual persons .
In suggesting this , I am not so much making a “ root causes ” argument — he did the crime , but only because he had no choice — as I am arguing that the society at large is implicated in his choices because we have acquiesced in structural arrangements which work to our benefit and his detriment , and yet which shape his consciousness and sense of identity in such a way that the choices he makes .
We condemn those choices , but they are nevertheless compelling to him .
I am interested in the moral implications of what the sociologist Loïc Wacquant has called the “ double - sided production of urban marginality . ”
I approach this problem of moral judgment by emphasizing that closed and bounded social structures — like racially homogeneous urban ghettos — create contexts where “ pathological ” and “ dysfunctional ” cultural forms emerge , but these forms are not intrinsic to the people caught in these structures .
Neither are they independent of the behavior of the people who stand outside of them .
Several years ago , I took time to read some of the nonfiction writings of the great nineteenth century Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy .
Toward the end of his life he had become an eccentric pacifist and radical Christian social critic .
I was stunned at the force of his arguments .
What struck me most was Tolstoy ’s provocative claim that the core of Christianity lies in Jesus ’ Sermon on the Mount :
You see that fellow over there committing some terrible sin ?
Well , if you have ever lusted , or allowed jealousy , or envy or hatred to enter your own heart , then you are to be equally condemned !
This , Tolstoy claims , is the central teaching of the Christian faith : we ’re all in the same fix .
Now , without invoking any religious authority , I nevertheless want to suggest that there is a grain of truth in this religious sentiment that is relevant to the problem at hand :
That is , while the behavioral pathologies and cultural threats that we see in society — the moral erosions “ out there ” — the crime , drug addiction , sexually transmitted disease , idleness , violence and all manner of deviance — while these are worrisome , nevertheless , our moral crusade against these evils can take on a pathological dimension of its own .
We can become self - righteous , legalistic , ungenerous , stiff - necked , and hypocritical .
We can fail to see the beam in our own eye .
We can neglect to raise questions of social justice .
We can blind ourselves to the close relationship that actually exists between , on the one hand , behavioral pathology in the so - called urban underclass of our country and , on the other hand , society - wide factors — like our greed - driven economy , our worship of the self , our endemic culture of materialism , our vacuous political discourses , our declining civic engagement , and our aversion to sacrificing private gain on behalf of much needed social investments .
We can fail to see , in other words , that the problems of the so - called underclass — to which we have reacted with a massive , coercive mobilization — are but an expression , at the bottom of the social hierarchy , of a more profound and widespread moral deviance — one involving all of us .
Taking this position does not make me a moral relativist .
I merely hold that , when thinking about the lives of the disadvantaged in our society , the fundamental premise that should guide us is that we are all in this together .
Those people languishing in the corners of our society are our people — they are us – whatever may be their race , creed , or country of origin , whether they be the crack - addicted , the HIV - infected , the mentally ill homeless , the juvenile drug sellers , or worse .
Whatever the malady , and whatever the offense , we ’re all in the same fix .
We ’re all in this thing together .
Just look at what we have wrought .
We Americans have established what , to many an outside observer , looks like a system of racial caste in the center of our great cities .
I refer here to millions of stigmatized , feared , and invisible people .
The extent of disparity in the opportunity to achieve their full human potential , as between the children of the middle class and the children of the disadvantaged — a disparity that one takes for granted in America — is virtually unrivaled elsewhere in the industrial , advanced , civilized , free world .
Yet too many Americans have concluded , in effect , that those languishing at the margins of our society are simply reaping what they have sown .
Their suffering is seen as having nothing to do with us — as not being evidence of systemic failures that can be corrected through collective action .
Thus , as I noted , we have given up on the ideal of rehabilitating criminals , and have settled for simply warehousing them .
Thus we accept — despite much rhetoric to the contrary — that it is virtually impossible effectively to educate the children of the poor .
Despite the best efforts of good people and progressive institutions — despite the encouraging signs of moral engagement with these issues that I have seen in my students over the years , and that give me hope — despite these things , it remains the case that , speaking of the country as a whole , there is no broadly based demand for reform , no sense of moral outrage , no anguished self - criticism , no public reflection in the face of this massive , collective failure .
The core of the problem is that the socially marginal are not seen as belonging to the same general public body as the rest of us .
It therefore becomes impossible to do just about anything with them .
At least implicitly , our political community acts as though some are different from the rest and , because of their culture — because of their bad values , their self - destructive behavior , their malfeasance , their criminality , their lack of responsibility , their unwillingness to engage in hard work — they deserve their fate .
But this is quite wrongheaded .
What we Americans fail to recognize — not merely as individuals , I stress , but as a political community — is that these ghetto enclaves and marginal spaces of our cities , which are the source of most prison inmates , are products of our own making : Precisely because we do not want those people near us , we have structured the space in our urban environment so as to keep them away from us .
Then , when they fester in their isolation and their marginality , we hypocritically point a finger , saying in effect : “ Look at those people .
They threaten to the civilized body .
They must therefore be expelled , imprisoned , controlled . ”
It is not we who must take social responsibility to reform our institutions but , rather , it is they who need to take personal responsibility for their wrongful acts .
It is not we who must set our collective affairs aright , but they who must get their individual acts together .
This posture , I suggest , is inconsistent with the attainment of a just distribution of benefits and burdens in society .
Civic inclusion has been the historical imperative in Western political life for 150 years .
And yet — despite our self - declared status as a light unto the nations , as a beacon of hope to freedom - loving peoples everywhere — despite these lofty proclamations , which were belied by images from the rooftops in flooded New Orleans in September 2005 , and are contradicted by our overcrowded prisons — the fact is that this historical project of civic inclusion is woefully incomplete in these United States .
At every step of the way , reactionary political forces have declared the futility of pursuing civic inclusion .
Yet , in every instance , these forces have been proven wrong .
At one time or another , they have derided the inclusion of women , landless peasants , former serfs and slaves , or immigrants more fully in the civic body .
Extending to them the franchise , educating their children , providing health and social welfare to them has always been controversial .
But this has been the direction in which the self - declared “ civilized ” and wealthy nations have been steadily moving since Bismarck , since the revolutions of 1848 and 1870 , since the American Civil War with its Reconstruction Amendments , since the Progressive Era and through the New Deal on to the Great Society .
This is why we have a progressive federal income tax and an estate tax in this country , why we feed , clothe and house the needy , why we ( used to ) worry about investing in our cities ’ infrastructure , and in the human capital of our people .
What the brutal facts about punishment in today ’s America show is that this American project of civic inclusion remains incomplete .
Nowhere is that incompleteness more evident than in the prisons and jails of America .
And this as yet unfulfilled promise of American democracy reveals a yawning chasm between an ugly and uniquely American reality , and our nation ’s exalted image of herself .

Glenn C. Loury is the Merton P. Stoltz Professor of the Social Sciences at Brown University
Two centuries after Charles Darwin 's birth , the argument he started over evolution is going strong -- perhaps even stronger as more churches join the fray .
Nearly two dozen Minnesota congregations are supporting Darwin 's case as part of Evolution Weekend , a mobilization effort involving 984 congregations nationwide .
Events surround his birthday , Feb. 12 .
Members of First Universalist Church in Minneapolis held a birthday party for him .
At Mount Zion Temple in St. Paul , Rabbi Adam Spilker will devote Friday 's sermon to " the intersections of religion and science . "
At Southcross Community Church in Burnsville on Sunday , the Rev. Casey VanderBert will pose the question :
Do believers have to choose between science and religion ?
( Sorry -- we promised not to give away the answer . )
Not to be left out , the Minnesota Atheists are holding a panel discussion at 2 p.m. Sunday at Rondo Library in St. Paul .
Do n't expect the debate to end any time soon , said David Rhees , executive director of the Bakken Museum .
" I do n't know if we 're ever going to be finished with this evolution business , " he predicted at the " Darwin Day " conference sponsored by First Universalist Church .
" There 's still a lot of work to be done grappling with the questions :
What does evolution mean to us as individuals ?
What does it mean to us as a society ?
And what does it mean to our concept of God ? "
Evolutionists ' upped the ante '
Evolution supporters " have become more assertive " after years of battling over the teaching of evolution vs. the Bible 's version of creation , said David Masci , a senior research fellow at the Pew Research Center 's Forum on Religion & Public Life .
" They 've upped the ante . "
At a cost of $ 3.5 billion and more than a decade of work , the 192 laser beams are billed as the most powerful in the world .
Scientists working at the National Ignition Facility of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California , have built the most powerful laser in the world , capable of simulating the energy force of a hydrogen bomb and the sun itself .
“ The system already has produced 25 times more energy than any other laser system , ” said NIF Director Ed Moses .
The Energy Department is expected to announce Tuesday that it has officially certified the National Ignition Facility , which would clear the way for a series of experiments which scientists hope will eventually will mimic the heat and pressure found at the center of the sun .
The successful completion of the laser is the culmination of more than a decade of work at a cost of $ 3.5 billion .
“ NIF is well on its way to achieving breakthroughs in science never imagined .
Through our readiness testing we will see glimpses of what that future will bring , ” said Moses .
NIF ’s 192 laser beams , housed in a ten - story building the size of three football fields , travel a long path , about 1,000 feet , from their birth at one of the two master oscillators to the center of the target chamber .
As the beams move through NIF ’s amplifiers , their energy increases exponentially .
From beginning to end , the beams ’ total energy grows from one - billionth of a joule ( a joule is the energy needed to lift a small apple one meter against the Earth ’s gravity ) to four million joules , a factor of more than a quadrillion – and it all happens in less than 25 billionths of a second .
Each master oscillator generates a very small , low - energy laser pulse .
The pulse may range from 100 trillionths to 25 billionths of a second long , and has a specific temporal shape as requested by NIF experimenters .
The laser is expected to be used for a wide range of high - energy and high - density physics experiments , but its primary purpose is to assist government physicists in ensuring the reliability of the nation ’s nuclear weapons as they become older .
The Lawrence Livermore lab will be taking order of the world ’s most powerful supercomputer –capable of performing at 20 petaflops ( 1 petaflop equals 1 thousand trillion floating - point operations per second ) , twenty times faster than the current record holder , and more powerful than all of the systems on the top 500 supercomputer list combined– currently being constructed by IBM under contract by the U.S. government , which will also be utilized to ensure the safety of the country ’s nuclear weapons .
“ We are well on our way to achieving what we set out to do – controlled , sustained nuclear fusion and energy gain for the first time ever in a laboratory setting , ” said Director Moses .
“ This laser technology has the potential to revolutionize our energy future , ” California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said during a tour last year of the stadium - sized NIF facility .
“ If successful , this new endeavor could generate thousands of megawatts of carbon - free nuclear power but without the drawbacks of conventional nuclear plants .
This type of innovation is why we are a world leader in science , technology and clean energy , and I could not be prouder that this work is happening right here in California . ”
The project is a national collaboration among government , industry and academia and many industrial partners throughout the nation .
The NIF ’s 192 laser beams are 60 to 70 times more powerful than the world ’s second strongest – a 60 - beam system located at the University of Rochester .

With RNC chairman Michael Steele already a laughingstock inside the Beltway , he seems determined to cement that reputation nationwide .
Techies will roll their eyes over a proposal Steele sent out for a new GOP website .
It 's understandable that the Republicans want to get hip to this Internet thing .
It 's universally acknowledged that Barack Obama 's social - network - savvy Web effort first steamrollered Hillary Clinton 's formidable but old - school political operation , then sledgehammered late Twitter adopter John McCain in the general election .
Even now , anyone even tangentially involved in the campaign is claiming to be the Web guru who got Obama elected .
The GOP's web aspirations are as ludicrously ambitious as they are maddeningly vague .
Chairman Steele made his tech priorities clear ... " bottom line is if we have n't done it — let 's do it .
If we have n't thought of it — think of it .
If it has n't been tried — why not ?
If it 's going to be ' outside the box ' — then not only keep it outside the box , but take it to someplace the box has n't even reached yet .
In fairness , someone probably once told Steele that people who live in urban - surburban hip - hop settings talk crap like that .
But if Steele wants to catch up to the Democrats ' online efforts , he 'll have to do better than the risible request for proposal he sent out .
Some highlights from the document 's hopelessly vague and self - contradictory requirements :
Integrate outside products through common API 's , widgets , or iframes ( examples : Kimbia fundraising , Voter Vault , Widgetbox , Ning ) .
Flash interfaces can often make mundane tasks exciting , and having Flash developers who understand user behavior will make the site more user - friendly .
No limitations on design ; the RNC will be in on the entire process and will ensure everything is to our exact specifications .
Oh , and did the RNC mention they want the website within 45 days , on a fixed budget ?
Dale Franks at The Next Right calls the GOP operatives who put the proposal out " clueless losers . "
That 's being kind .
The last thing any designer wants is a client who 's " in on the entire process , " throwing out buzzwords they read in some two - year - old article about the Web clipped from a newspaper .
The full proposal :
The Big Apple has just become even bigger for Apple users .
Pastiche allows Mac users to recreate New York through keywords on NY - centric blog searches .
The result is disorientatingly stunning .
See it in action below .

Pastiche was created by software designer Ivan Safrin and visual artist Christian Marc Schmidt , who explain that it is much more than an animated version of concrete poetry :
Conceptually , Pastiche is a parallel experience of the city , a map that not only documents , but also suggests action .
It is a public counterpart to the private physical architecture of the city .
Its source an aggregate of individual blogs , Pastiche is a system that anyone has the ability to contribute to .
It defines a new kind of public space , while both proposing an experience and inviting comparison - in the process of relating one 's own perspective to a larger collective subjectivity , one situates oneself in relation to an impromptu community , formed around the idea of New York .

The red marker at the left and center of this display shows the hypocenter of the blast .

Force India have released the first images of their 2009 Formula
One contender ahead of its track debut at Jerez tomorrow .
The VJM02 marks the start of Force India 's new technical partnership with McLaren and Mercedes , who have provided the car 's engine , gearbox and Kinetic Energy Recovery System .
The car features a significantly different livery , with the green , white and orange Indian national colours taking precedence .
It was shaken down in a private test at Silverstone earlier this week .
After a frustrating 2008 season in which they failed to score a point , Force India hope that their collaboration with McLaren - Mercedes will result in huge progress over the next two years .
" At least from my perspective , winning races I think I can certainly aspire for maybe in 2010 , but for 2009 I would be happy if we are regularly in the points , " said team co-owner Vijay Mallya at the announcement of the McLaren - Mercedes deal last November .
" That would be already a major step forward . "
Mallya has taken greater control of the team over the winter , with both former chief technical officer Mike Gascoyne and team principal Colin Kolles being released from their contracts at the end of the 2008 season .
Mark Smith and James Key are now in charge of car design , while Simon Roberts has moved across from McLaren to become chief operating officer .
However Force India have retained their 2008 driver line - up , with Giancarlo Fisichella and Adrian Sutil continuing in the race seats and Vitantonio Liuzzi staying on as reserve .
I recently took another look at boost : : python .
It was a much better experience than when I first tried boost :: python for Glom in 2005 , probably because my use of the Python C API in the meantime has helped me understand what boost : : python is doing .
I have a mostly - done patch to use it in Glom 1.12 ( Glom 1.10 will be released soon ) .
This should make the code simpler and much more robust , allowing me to add more Python API to Glom , allowing people to drive more of the Glom UI via scripts .
As a side - effect this will force us to enable C++ exceptions in the Maemo build for Glom 1.12 , increasing code size , but that might be less of an issue by then .
I do find the boost : : python documentation fragmented and unfocused , spending too much time congratulating itself about its use of various design patterns and generic programming techniques in the implementation , instead of just telling me how to achieve common tasks .
It often assumes knowledge of the Python C API , as if it is based on original proposals or internal documentation .
Many companies are using boost :: python so I ’m surprised that none have arranged for more useful documentation to be written .
I ’d be happy to do it if someone wants to pay for my time .
In fact , boost : : python ’s API maps closely to the C API , so you probably need to know both , though I hoped that boost : : python would make it clearer and more explicit .
However , the people on the boost : : python mailing list have been very helpful when the documentation has not been clear or where I have made silly mistakes .
Boost should install pkg-config .pc files
Getting the CFLAGS and LIBS for boost python in your configure.ac is insanely difficult and fragile .
There are some .m4 scripts out there , but I ca n’t get any of them to work .
Why on earth do n’t they install a .pc file ?
They ca n’t all be Windows programmers .
And despite using unstable APIs , they do n’t seem to allow parallel installs .
For instance , on my Ubuntu Linux system , the headers are directly under /usr / include / rather than /usr / include / boost - python - 1.0 / .
GNOME gets this stuff right .
The need for parallel installs is even greater for boost :: python because there are various possible incompatible configurations , any of which you are likely to find on your system .
At the moment you will just get compiler or linker errors ( which distro packagers do n’t understand ) instead of being able to explicitly depend on a specific version with a specific build ( which distro packagers could understand ) .
This will make life difficult for Glom distro packagers , but I think it ’s still worth it .

The German teenager who used his father 's pistol to kill 15 people and then himself was a reclusive figure obsessed with ­violent video games , horror films and airguns , police said yesterday as they sought to find a motive for the shootings .
Officials are focusing on Tim ­Kretschmer 's state of mind after saying he had struggled with depression and had failed to complete a series of psychiatric sessions last year .
The 17 - year - old who shot dead nine pupils , three teachers and three passers - by in an attack on his former school in Winnenden , had become fixated with so - called " shoot 'em up " video games in recent months , spending hours playing one called Counter Strike in which ­players must carry out assassinations to win , police said .
He had also developed a taste for violent films , with a personal collection including Rambo First Blood , while his computer contained some mild pornography .
As flags were flown at half - mast throughout Germany and a one - minute silence was held in schools , investigators tried to sum up the " highly sensitive " teenager who had wreaked terror on Winnenden .
" He was quiet , somewhat reserved , " said ­Siegfried Mahler , the Stuttgart state prosecutor .
" He had some but not many friends .
He was interested in girls but had had no serious relationships . "
Investigators said one girl Kretschmer had feelings for had not returned them , fuelling speculation that misogynistic resentment may have prompted him to have targeted female victims in his rampage .
All except one of the 12 dead at Albertsville secondary school were women or girls .
Police would not confirm their identities .
Last night police said they had " doubts " about the veracity of an internet " warning " apparently written by Kretschmer hours before his rampage .
The existence of the note , which appeared to have him promising " a real barbecue " at his old school , was denied by the chat forum in which it supposedly featured .
While the motive for the school shooting – Germany 's worst since the Erfurt massacre of 2002 – remained unclear , investigators were definite on how the killer had managed to procure a weapon .
The Beretta pistol was taken from his father 's collection at home , Mahler said , meaning that Jörg Kretschmer , a member of the local Leutenbach gun club , could potentially face legal action if it was found he had broken laws governing gun storage .
He could even be prosecuted for involuntary manslaughter if evidence was found that his son had warned him of his plans .
" Everything here points to negligence on the part of the father as far as the ­storage of this weapon is concerned , " said police spokesman Ralf Michelfelder .
On Wednesday morning Kretschmer entered Albertsville brandishing the pistol and more than 250 rounds of ammunition , police said .
He is thought to have fired " at least " 60 bullets inside the school , nine in the area of the local psychiatric clinic and a further 44 on the industrial estate where he was eventually caught .
He was found to have 109 unused rounds still on him after he turned the gun on himself .
Voting ended late last week on the President - Elect ’s website Change.gov .
As was the case in December , questions regarding marijuana law reform proved to be extremely popular .
Of the more than 76,000 questions posed to Obama by the general public , the fourth most popular question overall called on the incoming administration to cease arresting and prosecuting adults who use cannabis .
And in the sub- category “ National Security , ” the most popular question posed by the public pertained to amending U.S. drug policies .
But you would n’t know it by listening to the administration ’s latest video response ( posted online here ) — as neither issue received even a passing mention from incoming White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs .
( The Obama administration ’s woefully inadequate response to last month ’s top- rated marijuana law reform question appears at the bottom of the Change. gov page here . )
Am I surprised to learn that the Obama team has decided to hide their collective heads in the sand ?
Not at all .
But by doing so , they ’re missing the bigger picture .
The latest round of Change.gov online poll results illustrate two important points .
One : there is a significant , vocal , and identifiable segment of our society that wants to see an end to America ’s archaic and overly punitive marijuana laws .
Two : the American public is ready and willing to engage in a serious and objective political debate regarding the merits of legalizing the use of cannabis by adults .
The Obama administration should heed these poll results and understand that marijuana law reform is not a political liability ; rather , it is a political opportunity .
Fortunately for the public , there will be other “ opportunities ” for the Obama administration to address marijuana law reform .
This Friday , the social networking website Change.org , in concert with the Case Foundation , will hold a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington , DC to announce the top 10 ideas — as voted on by the public — for the new administration .
At the event , the two organizations will also announce the launch of a national advocacy campaign behind each idea in collaboration with nonprofit partners to turn each idea into actual policy .
The top issue , as determined by the public ?
You guessed it : “ Legalize the medicinal and recreational use of marijuana . ”
Friday ’s press conference will no doubt be covered by the mainstream media .
Imagine the splash we will make when the public ’s call to legalize marijuana is presented as the # 1 idea for the new administration .
Perhaps then the incoming administration will finally be forced to answer the question on the minds of millions of Americans :
“ Is President Obama going to continue to define himself and tens of millions of otherwise law - abiding Americans as criminals , or is he ready to publicly acknowledging that prohibition causes far more harm than the responsible use of marijuana itself ? ”
Change.org voting ends at 5 pm eastern time on Thursday , January 15 , so if you have n’t yet voted , please do so now .

Protests over economic crisis topple Icelandic government
By Barry Grey
28 January 2009
The Icelandic government fell on Monday , becoming the first regime to collapse as a direct result of the global economic crisis and resulting popular opposition .
Months of street protests over the devastating social impact of the collapse of the country 's currency and banking system reached a crescendo last week , when thousands of demonstrators rallying outside the parliament building pelted right - wing Independence Party Prime Minister Geir Haarde with eggs , paint and rolls of toilet paper , and police responded by firing tear gas , the first time tear gas was used against the public in Iceland since 1949 .
On Friday , Haarde announced that he would step down as prime minister , citing a recent diagnosis of throat cancer , and agreed to hold early elections , which he set for May 9 .
His coalition government with the Social Democratic Alliance Party had been scheduled to remain in power until elections in 2011 .
However , Haarde insisted that his government would not resign , arguing that political instability would compound the worsening economic crisis , which has seen prices and unemployment soar and the savings of many of the country 's 320,000 residents vanish .
A fresh anti-government demonstration on Saturday , involving some 5,000 people , led to a fracturing of the ruling coalition and forced Haarde to reverse course .
On Monday he formally announced the resignation of the government .
On Tuesday , the president , Olafur Ragnar Grimsson , asked the Social Democratic Alliance to form a new interim government , to rule until elections are held in May , or perhaps even earlier .
It is expected that the Social Democrats will form a minority government in coalition with the Left - Green Movement Party , which had supported the anti-government demonstrations .
There is little prospect that a new center - left government will stabilize the economy or silence the mounting opposition of workers , youth and middle - class people who are being impoverished by the collapse of the heavily indebted economy .
The Social Democrats are fully implicated in the " free market " speculative policies that brought the country to economic ruin , and the Left - Green Movement demonstrated its loyalty to the state and the capitalist ruling elite by offering to join a national government when the country 's three major banks collapsed last October .
There are also unresolved policy differences between the two parties .
The Social Democrats favor closer ties to the European Union , including a possible application to join , and have endorsed the severe austerity terms of a bailout organized by the International Monetary Fund in October .
The Left - Greens have called for renegotiation of the $ 2.1 billion IMF loan and opposed entry into the EU .
However , the head of the Left - Greens , Steingrimur Sigfusson , indicated that he would be willing to alter these positions in return for entry into government .
The collapse of the right - wing Haarde government is the sharpest expression to date of the growing social and political turmoil across Europe arising from the economic crisis .
Iceland was hit hardest by the financial meltdown that followed the collapse of the Wall Street investment bank Lehman Brothers last September because nearly two decades of " free market " policies and financial speculation that transformed the country into a center for " hot money " from international investors had left its banking system highly leveraged and entirely dependent on foreign capital .
However , similar conditions prevail in many European economies and recent weeks have seen a wave of sometimes violent protests fueled by the impact of the economic breakdown .
Earlier this month Greek students and youth held daily mass protests for several weeks following the police killing of a 15 - year - old youth .
The Greek protests were sustained by anger over conditions of mass unemployment and poverty , especially among young people , that have been intensified by the economic crisis .
Mass demonstrations and riots have shaken a number of Eastern European countries that have been devastated by the financial crisis , including Latvia , Lithuania , the Czech Republic , Hungary and Bulgaria .
Hungary and Ukraine have both resorted to IMF loans in an attempt to stave off national bankruptcy .
In all of these countries , the governments have imposed austerity policies in an attempt to slash expenditures so as to meet debt payments to international banks and creditors .
In Latvia , for example , the government this month announced wage cuts and reductions in social spending combined with tax increases .
Other European countries have also seen mass protests .
In Spain , which was heavily invested in the housing and credit bubbles that have now imploded , tens of thousands of workers and youth demonstrated last week in the city of Zaragoza to demand relief from soaring unemployment resulting from the collapse of the country 's construction and retail industries .
Other European economies with outsized banking systems that are immediately at risk include Austria and Ireland .
Even in Britain , whose currency has fallen by 30 percent in recent months , public speculation is growing over the prospect of state bankruptcy .
Simon Johnson , former chief economist at the IMF and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington , commenting on the collapse of the Icelandic government , told the Washington Post , " I think it 's going to spread .
We 're in a phase now we 're beginning to see the political fallout . "
A worried New York Times in its account of the Iceland crisis characterized the demonstrations that have broken out in Europe " in all cases " as being " anti-capitalist . "
The global economic crisis has broadly discredited the ideology of the capitalist market , but perhaps nowhere more suddenly and explosively than in Iceland .
The Independence Party has ruled since 1991 , with David Oddsson , now the governor of the central bank , heading the government until 2004 .
Under Oddsson , the international operations of the major banks grew massively , building up liabilities many times the size of the country 's economic output .
The country 's big banks borrowed $ 120 billion on international markets early this decade , six times the size of Iceland 's gross domestic product .
The country 's foreign debt peaked at ten times GDP .
The speculative policies of the government and the banks fueled an economic boom that lifted Iceland 's per capita GDP to one of the highest in the world .
Iceland topped the most recent United Nations Human Development Index .
But when the credit crisis erupted , the banks could not make their payments and the central bank lacked the foreign currency to bail them out .
The collapse of the banks sent the currency , the krona , into free fall .
Since most consumer goods are imported , prices soared .
Unemployment shot up .
Government statistics show the jobless rate up by 45 percent in December from the previous month .
The finance ministry forecasts a contraction of 9.6 percent in GDP for this year and 2010 and an unemployment rate of 8.6 percent next year , although this figure is widely believed to be an underestimation .
A recent survey indicated that 70 percent of Icelandic companies are technically bankrupt , raising the likelihood of an explosive growth of unemployment .
The same survey put the rate of personal bankruptcies at 40 percent of the population .
About a third of the population is believed to have lost all or part of their savings .
In a commentary published Monday , the Guardian characterized Iceland as " the world 's biggest hedge fund " and noted :
" Iceland had relatively high interest rates , so investors borrowed heavily in Japanese yen and bought Icelandic bonds .
Money flowed into Iceland ...
The financial crash has put paid to Iceland 's get rich quick scheme — known as the yen carry trade — and left Iceland saddled with debts it has no hope of paying without impoverishing its people for decades to come . "
Unlike many other media , like print , television , and radio , the Internet is largely uncontrolled .
Despite the fact that the majority of critical Internet infrastructure is based in the United States , and is therefore subject to the influence of the U.S. government , things remain quite open .
The current system of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers , which regulates top - level domains , and Tier 1 networks providing backbone infrastructure has worked well , and the Internet has flourished .
But , according to experts , a push by many Internet and content providers for increased monetization of connectivity threatens to upset the balance and hamper further development .
Network neutrality is a term being tossed around a lot these days .
In its most basic form it describes a network that is indifferent to the traffic that ’s sent over it .
Whether you ’re using Skype to chat with your grandparents in Hong Kong , downloading porn , or watching a child crash repeatedly on YouTube , all traffic gets the same priority .
You may be surprised to learn that this is n’t the case for the majority of Internet users .
Most Internet service providers , including Canada ’s , currently employ a technology known as “ packet shaping ” .
This allows the ISPs to give priority to certain traffic like e-mail or Web browsing while slowing ( sometimes significantly ) peer - to - peer download services like BitTorrent to try and provide more service on less infrastructure .
This means that if you ’re paying for a 10 - megabyte Internet connection , you ’re not free to use that speed for whatever you want .
Prioritizing certain kinds of Internet traffic is just the tip of the iceberg .
On a larger scale , technologies like packet shaping could lead to tiered Internet access .
This would look a lot like the TV - channel packages that you order .
A basic package could include Google , Yahoo , and MSN , but if you wanted to make use of a bandwidth - intensive Web site like YouTube that would cost extra .
The reverse of this concept has also been tossed around .
Instead of you paying to access YouTube , the content provider could pay the network to allow the content to reach you .
A costing regime like this would make it very difficult , if not virtually impossible , for startups to provide a new and innovative service .
Companies like Twitter , which recently had to drop SMS capability in Canada , might never get out of the starting gate if this barrier is put in place .
With the importance and prevalence of a service as important as the Internet , it has n’t taken long for government and regulatory bodies to chime in .
In the U.S. , ISPs are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission , which last year upheld a complaint against Comcast , deciding that it had illegally inhibited users from using file - sharing software through packet shaping .
This victory for Net neutrality was recently threatened by a failed amendment to U.S. President Barack Obama ’s stimulus package .
The amendment aimed to augment a portion of the legislation meant for broadband network expansion with language that “ allows for reasonable network management practices such as deterring unlawful activity , including child pornography and copyright infringement ” .
In one fell swoop this amendment would have undone the FCC judgment , restoring the power of the ISPs to prioritize traffic as they see fit .
Beyond traffic management , this amendment would have opened the door to content control , not only regulating the speeds at which services are delivered , but what services you have access to .
In Canada , ISPs are regulated by the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission , which has been involved in the debate only recently despite the government being aware of the issue for years .
The most significant ruling of late was in regards to a complaint by the Canadian Association of Internet Providers against Bell Canada complaining that their Internet users ( on leased Bell lines ) had their access unfairly throttled .
Bell argued that it treats all Internet traffic the same , and the CRTC sided with them as Bell ’s direct customers were subject to the same traffic prioritization regime as CAIP members ’ resale accounts .
Although this appears to be a decision against network neutrality , the CRTC has opened the door to public discussion and is set to hold a hearing on the issue this July .
The deadline for submitting public comments is February 23 .
( For more information , see Neutrality.ca . )
The Internet remains largely free and open , but service providers in Canada are already taking the first steps to limit that freedom with traffic prioritization .
As corporations , they have an economic incentive to continue down this path and seek out other sources of revenue through increased control over your Internet access .
Net neutrality has been one of the primary drivers for innovation , and the rapid expansion and development of the Internet .
Without an open and free World Wide Web , its future is anyone ’s guess .
Who right now , on this planet are willing to listen to any former Bush Advisers ?
Any hands up ?
The Republican Party could not WAIT for Bush to exit , he was the albatross on their necks since 2006 , and now Rove , Card and company got something to say ?
After they helped 'eff up this country and put us in the predicament we are in ?
Each day in the philanthropy blogosphere , somebody spills some digital ink covering the emergence of new platforms for social action .
Online communities such as Facebook Causes , DonorsChoose , Kiva , Change.org , and SixDegrees are the most frequently cited harbingers of change in the way philanthropy happens .
The attention lavished on these platforms is a net gain for micro-philanthropy .
With each blog post , more people find innovative ways to support grassroots initiatives .
Recently , even mainstream media outlets such as MSNBC ( Facebook Causes ) , Oprah ( Kiva ) , Steven Colbert ( DonorsChoose ) , The Wall Street Journal ( Change.org ) , and CNN ( SixDegrees ) are covering micro-philanthropy .
It ’s easy to get caught up in the excitement that surrounds these initiatives .
But maintaining a critical lens is equally important .
I am concerned that few , if any , social action platforms are currently leveraging the self - organizing potential of social media to address the root causes that make online social activism necessary in the first place .
As food for thought , here are two excerpts from Wikipedia ’s entry for “ root causes ” :
“ Solving a problem by addressing root causes is ultimately more effective than merely addressing symptoms or direct causes . ”
“ An issue closely related to solving an existing problem is [ how ] to foster learning that will embed knowledge ( within a person , group , or organization ) that may help prevent similar problems from occurring in the future . ”
As legions of digital natives start to self - identify as citizen philanthropists , they should be given online tools that permit them to do more than donate to an existing organization or recruit friends to a cause .
Instead , micro-philanthropists should be as respected as large - scale philanthropists .
They should be treated in a way that implies that they can address the root causes of a problem and spread the knowledge required to resolve similar problems .
The following exemplify deeper level corrective actions that social action platforms could facilitate :
Creating feedback mechanisms where individuals and beneficiaries of nonprofit programs can immediately inform the program staff whether a service is having the desired effect ;
Pioneering innovative models for philanthropy where individuals can coalesce into collective grant - making bodies that fund community - level social change projects ;
Building a tax - deductable open marketplace for funding outstanding individuals and informal projects ;
Using constituent and donor pressure to bring about new forms of collaboration among nonprofit groups and foundations .
Will platforms like Facebook Causes , DonorsChoose , Kiva , Change.org , and SixDegrees render top - down organizations obsolete ?
Do they bypass old - school methods of fundraising and grant - making ?
Have they planted the seeds for a society composed of highly motivated micro-philanthropists ?
When the millions of active users on these platforms are busy addressing root causes instead of symptoms , then my answer to these questions will most certainly be , “ yes , yes , and yes . ”
Peter Deitz is a micro-philanthropy consultant and the founder of Social Actions , a website that helps individuals and organizations use social media to plan , implement , and support peer - to - peer social change campaigns so that grassroots solutions to local and global problems can flourish .
He also writes a blog about micro-philanthropy .
That no government , so called , can reasonably be trusted , or reasonably be supposed to have honest purposes in view , any longer than it depends wholly upon voluntary support .
~ Lysander Spooner
This essay is an incendiary device .
My muse is Wilberforce and the subject is the abolition of the last existing institution of slavery in America — taxation .
Like Wilberforce , we may be generations from satisfaction of the dream of the end of the coercive state but if the seed is not planted , the goal will never be realized .
I despise the income tax .
I loathe the property , excise , gasoline , sin , estate , capital gains and every other tax .
I think the colonists got it backwards , I want representation without taxation .
These are often derided as utopian but I would suggest they are dystopian notions .
I see no possibility of perfection in this mortal coil , but risk and possible failure are the engines of progress and capitalism invigorates the most powerful economic engine of all — self - interest to serve others .
Mises claims " [t ] he member of a contractual society is free because he serves others only in serving himself .
What restrains him is only the inevitable natural phenomenon of scarcity . "
I think it is loathsome for one man to own another and the involuntary tribute demanded by government is simply another form of owning another man ’s wealth and labor .
Taxation is the way collectivists practice their compassion by taking their neighbor ’s money at gunpoint .
It also violates the zero- aggression principle shared by many libertarians .
Taxation and slavery have some very close confluences in definition .
According to www.investorwords.com, a tax is :
A fee charged ( “ levied ” ) by a government on a product , income , or activity .
If tax is levied directly on personal or corporate income , then it is a direct tax .
If tax is levied on the price of a good or service , then it is called an indirect tax .
The purpose of taxation is to finance government expenditure .
One of the most important uses of taxes is to finance public goods and services , such as street lighting and street cleaning .
Since public goods and services do not allow a non-payer to be excluded , or allow exclusion by a consumer , there cannot be a market in the good or service , and so they need to be provided by the government or a quasi - government agency , which tend to finance themselves largely through taxes .
These words are illustrative but couched in polite terms .
Taxes are monies forcibly taken from individuals and whatever other entity they can be drained from by governments or organizations ( tax farmers ) chartered by governments to extract whatever wealth they can through force and threat of violence .
Taxation is theft .
James Bovard writes :
“ The U.S. Treasury Department defines a tax as ‘ a compulsory payment for which no specific benefit it received in return . ’
No matter how many taxes a person pays , or what politicians promise , the taxpayer is not irrevocably entitled to a single benefit from the government .
The level of taxation is thus a stark measure of government ’s financial power over the individual — a precise gauge of the subjugation of the citizen to the financial demands of the state . ”
The government has monopolized this enterprise because if you or I go to our neighbor and steal his funds or mug him at gunpoint , we go to jail .
If you doubt the power of compulsion , notify the IRS personally that you will no longer pay any more of your income taxes … for life .
It is , frankly , un-American .
We are a nation birthed in secession and tax revolt :
" We can now put in historical context Jefferson ’s comment that it was good medicine for government to have a rebellion every twenty years or so .
In the course of his lifetime there had been almost a dozen rebellions he was acutely aware of .
Six were in the United States , starting with the Stamp Act Rebellion and ending with the Fries Rebellion .
All of these rebellions , including the American Revolution , were tax revolts of varying degrees of intensity .
In Europe , there were a number of tax revolts in the seventeenth century , from the excise revolts in Britain , to the tax - farmer revolts in the Netherlands , to the innumerable revolts and the revolution in France .
Again , all were tax revolts .
So when Jefferson tells us rebellions are good tonic for government , in his frame of reference he was talking about tax rebellions . "
One of my favorite Presidents ( a Democrat , no less ) , Grover Cleveland , came close to the truth when he said :
" When more of the people ’s sustenance is exacted through the form of taxation than is necessary to meet the just obligations of government and expenses of its economical administration , such exaction becomes ruthless extortion and a violation of the fundamental principles of a free government . "
Mine is a more radical notion .
I do n’t call for less taxation ; I call for zero taxation because every time the government is given any capability to collect taxes , the institution is abused to the point of tyranny and despotism .
In 1944 — 45 under RedDR , we had an effective marginal tax rate of 94 % on all income over 200k dollars .
Ninety - four percent !
You ’ll notice Eisenhower was so incensed by this that he immediately reduced it to 92 % and graciously doubled the exemption to 400k .
Now we have one of our esteemed members of Congress calling for a 90 % tax on the wealthy in America .
The Mafia could only dream of this magnitude of criminal behavior and subsequent benefit .
Now let ’s examine what slavery is : A condition of subjection or submission characterized by lack of freedom of action or of will .
It is the choice between submission and threats , fines , jail , maiming or death .
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted in 1948 reads the following definition in Article 4 :
" No one shall be held in slavery or servitude ; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms .
Of course , our imperious betters at the United Nations would not deign to conflate this with taxation because they are a nest of interventionists and Marxoid government supremacists .
Do n’t expect relief from that august body of worthies .
I think even the eminent Frederick Douglass dismissed the allegations of Constitutional marriage to the wretched enterprise of slavery :
" Now , take the constitution according to its plain reading , and I defy the presentation of a single pro-slavery clause in it .
On the other hand it will be found to contain principles and purposes , entirely hostile to the existence of slavery . "
I think we have established that the institutions of slavery and taxation are ideological twins harnessed to the central idea of power , control and ill - earned profit at another ’s expense .
So how high is the domestic tax burden in America ?
The Tax Foundation places Tax Freedom Day at April 23rd when the tax burden is complete .
The problem with their calculation is that it is at 30.8 percent effective 2008 .
My personal estimate is closer to 60 % + of American incomes are consumed by government tribute when all the various and sundry taxes and excises across the nation are counted .
It gets worse : James L. Payne , from my hometown of Sandpoint , Idaho , authored a brilliant book called " Costly Returns . "
The thesis is simple : we all pay corporate income taxes as an additional cost of doing business as consumers and we all pay for the tax accountancy and regulatory compliance businesses are forced by law to obey .
We then pay indirectly for the enormous dislocation of rational resource investment and return dictated through government fiat through this economically illiterate statist interference .
Acres and acres and tens of stories of every corporate building devoted to the hidden tax of indirect extraction and compliance with all manner of government absurdity in the Federal Register and its loyal subsidiaries at the state and local level .
What some refer to as the " Vampire Economy . "
Henry Hazlitt brilliantly elucidates this misallocation in the " Broken Window Fallacy , " to wit :
" The glazier ’s gain of business , in short , is merely the tailor ’s loss of business .
No new “ employment ” has been added .
The people in the crowd were thinking only of two parties to the transaction , the baker and the glazier .
They had forgotten the potential third party involved , the tailor .
They forgot him precisely because he will not now enter the scene .
They will see the new window in the next day or two .
They will never see the extra suit , precisely because it will never be made .
They see only what is immediately visible to the eye . "
Economics at its most basic fundamentals is the study of the effective use of finite time and resources , and money is merely a medium and a visible signal of allocation .
As Mises pointed out in the seminal book , Socialism , in 1920 : the state simply cannot take these monies and allocate them rationally absent price signals of end users .
Period .
Worse still is the sure knowledge of the futility and waste of the stolen funds directed to wasteful , illegitimate or immoral spending through political fiat and favoritism .
So we have discovered that taxes and slavery seek the same end — the involuntary extraction of tribute or labor through the institutional threat or use of violence .
Tax slavery is far more insidious than chattel slavery because the illusion of freedom is entertained throughout the entire sordid process and you are to be grateful to the highwayman and pleased with the conduct of the thief .
This is not a recent phenomenon in America .
Within two years of the adoption of the Constitution under the unfairly maligned Articles of Confederation , state troops were hither and yon on the American frontier to chase after tax cheats and evaders during Shay ’s Rebellion .
Tax revolts and disfavor have peppered American history from the founding to the 1930 ’s Depression Era to the modern day iterations that will soon emerge with a vengeance .
There is no history of a government respecting the rights of citizens to retain the fruits of their labors .
These tax rebellions have been going on worldwide every year for the past few centuries .
So I am sounding the call not to reduce taxes but to abolish the last vestige of slavery in America .
Do n’t employ the language of the rulers , call it for what it really is .
Slavery .
" When faced with this circumstance , does the State abdicate ?
It does not .
The general lack of interest in production threatens its own existence , but it still cannot divest itself of its inner urge for power .
It turns to the use of force to stimulate the production from which it derives taxes .
It confiscates and tries to run the entire economy by rules , regulations , controls , and compulsion ; the nation becomes a slave - labor camp .
But the output of an economy that rests on force rather than on self - interest is meager .
More important than lack of production is the slave psychology that such an environment induces .
Men lose their capacity for self - improvement along with their sense of individual dignity .
Thus civilization disintegrates and becomes an historical or archaeological curio .
The State , of course , collapses with the civilization . "

The Best of William Buppert
Rush Limbaugh 's chief excuse for the inexcusable -- publicly hoping for the failure of President Obama 's economic - recovery efforts -- is that those mean , nasty Democrats did it to Bush :
Limbaugh : Did the Democrats want the war in Iraq to fail ?
[ Crowd shouts : ]
Yeah !
Limbaugh : Well , they certainly did .
And they not only wanted the war in Iraq to fail , they proclaimed it a failure !
There 's Dingy Harry Reid , waving a white flag , ' This war is lost .
This war -- '
They called General Petraeus a liar before he even testified !
[ Boos . ]
Mrs. Clinton -- [ Loud boos ] ...
Said she had to suspend , willingly suspend disbelief for whenever one had to listen to Petraeus .
We were in the process of winning the war and the last thing they wanted was to win .
They hoped George Bush failed .
Later , he amplified a bit more :
Ladies and gentlemen , the Democrat Party has actively not just sought the failure of Republican presidents and policies and now wars , for the first time .
The Democrat Party does n't stop at failure .
Talk to Judge Robert Bork , talk to Justice Clarence Thomas , about how they try to destroy lives , reputations , and character .
And I 'm supposed to say , I do n't want the president to fail ?
And it 's been picked up by every other right - winger out there -- including Michael Steele , in the same back - and - forth that produced his now - infamous rip on Limbaugh , which was followed in short order by Steele 's abject butt - kissing :
Steele :
How is that any different than what was said about George Bush during his presidency ?
Sean Hannity trotted it out last night on his show too :
Hannity :
He 's not a senator , he 's not a congressman .
Senators , congressmen , repeatedly called George Bush every name in the book .
And I did n't hear anyone complaining .
They did n't want George Bush to succeed in Iraq .
They said the surge would fail , the war was lost .
They called our troops terrorists .
On all of which we call : bullshit .
I 'd like to challenge Hannity , or Steele , or Limbaugh , to search the public record to find any leading Democrat -- congressman , senator , talking head , or otherwise -- who ever said : " I hope George Bush fails in Iraq . "
Particularly not in the months leading up to , or after , the invasion .
Indeed , the congressional authorization of the invasion passed the House 297 - 133- 3 ( 82 Democrats voted yes ) and the Senate 77 - 23 ( 29 Democrats voted yes ) .
Moreover , it was n't until many months had passed and it became clear the Bush Administration had no exit strategy in Iraq -- and indeed intended an indefinite occupation -- that Democrats began openly criticizing Bush 's war policies .
But even then , there were no open expressions of a desire to see the U.S. " fail " in Iraq -- only the open recognition that we were headed for failure , which is quite a different creature .
There was even greater unanimity in the days after the 9/11 attacks , which was the last time the nation faced a grave crisis and came together accordingly .
The Authorization to Use Military Force Against Terrorists passed the Congress with the full backing of Democrats as well as Republicans .
It passed the House 420 - 1 - 10 , and the Senate 98 - 0 - 2 .
The nation now faces another serious crisis in the economy , one at least as grave as the one we faced after 9/11 :
Our entire way of life is at risk if we do not get the economy moving again .
Republicans seem to be positively rejoicing in the ongoing decline on Wall Street -- one for whom they share the lion 's share of the blame -- because they think it proves them right .
What they seem not to be considering is the effect their constant badmouthing of the Obama recovery program might be having on the Wall Street psychology as well .
It would be one thing if Republicans were simply warning that Obama 's stimulus plans were doomed to failure .
We 'd understand that .
It certainly would mirror how we felt about the Iraq war : we believed it was a doomed enterprise that would not only cost far more in human lives than anything that might possibly be gained from it , but would actually worsen the conditions for terrorism it purportedly meant to combat .
We recognized that Bush 's rosy scenarios might come to pass , but we doubted it deeply -- and said so , and rightly .
But it 's another thing altogether to openly hope for failure -- in the case of the Iraq war , because it meant American soldiers would die needlessly , an outcome no one who loves America would want ; and in the case of the economy , because it means that America is doomed to slide into a Depression .
It will mean that millions of Americans will lose their jobs , millions will slide into poverty , and misery will be rampant .
Wishing for that outcome means that ideas are more important than people -- which is the mark of the blinkered ideologue .
It is monstrous , it is perverse , and it is un-American .
And we wo n't apologize for saying that , either , Rush .
With bass - thumping techno music blasting away and a naked woman on stage , three city councillors walked into a dark Etobicoke strip club yesterday , took a tour and sat near the stage for lunch .
On a break from a community council meeting , Councillors Frank Di Giorgio , Giorgio Mammoliti and Cesar Palacio took an " industry facility tour " at the invitation of the Adult Entertainment Association of Canada , a group representing many of the city 's 21 strip clubs .
" I think we made constructive use of our lunchtime , " Di Giorgio said .
" We basically came over to see what the facility was like – what kind of facilities they have for the girls that work in there , whether everything was clean , whether they had space to store their materials .
" And everything was okay in my estimation , " he added .
A steady contingent of tall women performed while they were there , but the councillors said they did n't watch .
" Absolutely not .
We just took a tour of the facility , " said Di Giorgio , when cornered by the Star outside the House of Lancaster on The Queensway .
Mammoliti , who co-chairs the West Toronto crime task force along with Palacio , defended the visit .
" We had lunch , which we paid for .
We spent about 20 minutes in here , " he said .
It was closer to half an hour by a reporter 's watch .
It 's unclear what they ate , but the menu features " finger me foods " and a " seafood sex platter . "
Tim Lambrinos , executive director of the association , said the community council had been invited to visit – free transport and food offered , but apparently not accepted – so they could better understand issues involving strip clubs when they come up at city council .
Lambrinos said he was properly registered as a lobbyist at city hall .
" It 's open and transparent , " he said , noting his group has organized similar visits for politicians in Ottawa and Mississauga .
" I thought it was very productive .
I thought it was essential . "
He compared it to other site visits a councillor might make to better understand an issue , such as to a sewage treatment plant or a manufacturing plant .
" You ca n't draft it in a report , " he said .
The visit was no surprise to a senior employee , who had been peering out the front door before the councillors arrived , as " Ride On " – vintage AC / DC – played in the background .
" Apparently we have special guests , " said the bartender .
While the invitation promised transportation to and from the Etobicoke Civic Centre , where community council was meeting , the councillors said they paid for a minivan taxi that waited for them .
They were late returning for council 's 1:30 p.m. start , causing a delay .
The other eight community councillors who had been sent an invitation turned it down .
Councillor Gloria Lindsay Luby immediately rejected the invitation , she said .
" I have no interest in that particular business .
I do n't want to go . "
Councillor Doug Holyday said he quickly declined the offer .
" I can't think going to a strip club is appropriate , " he said .
" I do n't need to go .
I have a fairly good idea what goes on there . "
Holyday added that if officials had wanted to discuss issues , he would have welcomed a meeting at the civic centre .
But Palacio defended the visit .
" It 's truly important to understand within the adult entertainment facilities whether they are complying with regulations , " he said , adding that if something was not in order , inspectors could be called in .
" We were invited to come and check the conditions .
There is nothing wrong with that . "
And to emphasize their argument , Mammoliti moved a request at the end of the community council meeting to ask city staff and police to report back on the number of illicit activities in a wide range of establishments including strip clubs , massage parlours and holistic centres as well as bars , restaurants and nightclubs in the Etobicoke York district within the past two years .
No other facility tours are planned for councillors because most of the city 's 21 strip clubs are clustered in Toronto 's west end .
Researchers think they are close to solving a problem that has slowed progress in meeting America ’s future electricity needs -
The giant wind turbines that constitute one of the most promising alternative energy technologies also cause bats to explode .
The problem is troubling to nature lovers , who have complained bitterly and delayed projects .
The small , airborne creatures help maintain an ecological balance and make neighborhoods more livable by eating large numbers of insects .
But when the creatures fly too close to the football - field - sized windmills that are springing up in wind farms from California to Massachusetts , they enter an area of reduced air pressure that causes their lungs to explode - a phenomenon known as barotrauma .
Now a solution is in sight .
Researchers are testing a technique that they hope will prevent millions of bat deaths a year .
They intend to start turning off the turbines when wind speeds are low and , coincidently , when bats are most likely to be nearby .
The method , if successful , would give a major boost to the wind industry and allow President Obama to get closer to the renewable energy future he wants .
“ We are all really excited about this , ” said Laurie Jodziewicz of the American Wind Energy Association .
“ The industry takes this issue very seriously . ”
Wind turbines have long been known to mangle birds that collide with their massive rotor blades , but a bigger problem is the turbines´ devastating effect on bats .
Bats get caught in a vortex of low pressure created by the turbine blades , which can spin at more than 125 mph at the tip .
The sudden pressure change causes internal hemorrhaging in the bats similar to the human affliction known as the bends .
“ You can´t see very much on the outside , ” said Tom Kunz , a bat researcher at Boston University describing the carcasses .
But once you cut them open , you can see “ hemorrhages on the lungs .
They simply burst open . ”
This is especially worrisome , researchers said , because bats have slow reproductive rates , so even small numbers of fatalities can cause lasting impacts on the bat population .
“ Bats take a very important role in limiting insect populations , including pests , ” Mr. Kunz said .
“ Once you remove a top predator , it creates a cascade effect on the rest of the organisms . ”
A soon - to - be - released study conducted last year at two wind facilities owned by Iberdrola Renewables in Pennsylvania and West Virginia finds that shutting down the turbines during low wind periods can reduce fatalities by more than 90 percent .
Ed Arnett , the study´s coordinator , said the deaths occur almost exclusively when turbines are operating at night at low wind speeds .
That is when bats are active and feeding because the wind is light enough for insects to fly .
One theory is that the bats think the turbines are large trees and inspect them as potential roosting places .
Researchers also think insects are attracted to the white towers at night and may draw bats to the turbines as a feeding ground .
Environmentalists and industrial officials say there is a cost to cutting off the turbines at night .
Andy Linehan , a bat specialist at Iberdrola Renewables , said that shutting down the turbines during last year´s experiment resulted in a 2 percent reduction in electricity generation .
Ms. Jodziewicz said , “ Any kilowatts created are money in the pocket .
“ Anything that reduces kilowatt hours from our projects is a concern .
It is something that affects the bottom line of these companies . ”
Industry officials said more testing is needed before any industrywide policy is introduced .
Ms. Jodziewicz said she is optimistic about using Mr. Arnett´s technique to keep bat explosions to a minimum .

Days after sending aircraft to strike Hamas militants in Gaza , the Israeli government is launching a campaign to dominate the blogosphere .
Among other things , the Israeli military has started its own YouTube channel to distribute footage of precision airstrikes .
And as I type , the Israeli consulate in New York is hosting a press conference on microblogging site Twitter .
It 's pretty interesting to see the Israeli - Palestinian conflict reduced to tweets of 140 characters or less ( " We hav 2 prtct R ctzens 2 , only way fwd through neogtiations , & left Gaza in 05 .
y Hamas launch missiles not peace ? " ; " we 're not at war with the PAL people .
we 're at war with a group declared by the EU& US a terrorist org " ) .
The Jerusalem Post quotes Maj. Avital Leibovich , the head of the Israeli Defense Forces ' foreign press branch on the digital media campaign .
" The blogosphere and new media are another war zone , " she says .
" We have to be relevant there . "
It appears , however , that some of the YouTube posts have already been scrubbed .
A note on the page of the pro-Israel YouTube channel reads :
" We are saddened that YouTube has taken down some of our exclusive footage showing the IDF 's operational success in operation Cast Lead against Hamas extremists in the Gaza Strip .
...
It is also worth noting that one of the videos removed had the highest number of hits ( over 10,000 ) at the time of its removal . "

Jim Cramer knows how easy CNBC is to fool .
He used to play the network himself .
Here are five episodes from the stock speculator 's past that could use some dusting off .
Cramer avoided any career - ending gaffes on the Daily Show last night — like say , " when a performing monkey pundit does it that means that it is not illegal ! " — but the extended drubbing and his squishy apologetic demeanor is a reminder that his 30 - year - long career — as a trader , as a dot - com entrepreneur , and now as a screaming cable personality — has been little more than a running series of scandals and contretemps , rife with evidence that the TV personality has long made a habit of using his media profile for personal enrichment .
The Stewart dust - up is far from the first time Cramer has run up against allegations of ethical misconduct .
Here 's the tangled history :
1. Stock - Picking at SmartMoney
In 1995 , Cramer mentioned four stocks as good buys in his SmartMoney column , mentioning that he had a stake in one of them .
In fact , his firm Cramer & Co. owned shares in all four , including 10 percent stakes in two of them .
All four stocks shot up in value after the column ran .
The SEC launched an informal investigation , and Dow Jones , which owned SmartMoney , announced a new ethics policy to prevent columnists from writing about securities they own .
The magazine eventually took the blame for leaving out the disclosure .
Two years later , Cramer told CNN that the episode " turned my life upside down ...
I now mention to everybody in the press because it could happen again ; I do n't want it to ...
It was a horrible incident .
I live with it every day . "
Lesson learned !
2. Shorting WavePhone
In 1998 , while co-hosting Squawk Box , Cramer said out loud on television that , prior to interviewing the CEO of a company called WavePhone that morning , he had shorted 25,000 shares of the company because he thought it was overvalued .
Later in the same show , he went after the CEO , and WavePhone 's stock dropped 38 percent , making Cramer slightly richer .
He later claimed that it had been " a terrible choice of words " to say , " I called my stock - loan department and said , ' Listen , I want to short 25,000 Wave Phore because I think this thing is a big speculative bubble . "
In fact , he said , he was just curious if anyone else was shorting the company .
CNBC suspended him and the SEC investigated , but found no wrongdoing .
3. Trading With the Enemy
In 2002 , Nicholas Maier , who worked as a Cramer & Co. trader for five years , published a tell - all detailing Cramer 's manipulation of his pals in the financial media for fast profit : Acquire exclusive intelligence on a stock , take a position on that stock , and then leak the intel to CNBC .
" Jim 's strategy was to put in an order to buy a stock ... and then dial Maria [ Bartiromo ] , " Maier wrote .
" As soon as she announced the news on television , the stock would often jump ....
We were n't just using the news , but making it .
No sooner would Maria be thanking us for the help than we'd be getting a payback — a quick hit thanks to our friends at CNBC . "
4. SEC Subpoeanas
In 2006 , both Cramer and TheStreet.com were served with subpoenas by the SEC in an investigation into collusion between stock analysts and short - sellers .
According to , um , TheStreet.com , the SEC was looking into allegations that " Gradient Analytics , an Arizona stock - research firm , published bearish research reports at the behest of a group of short - sellers , including Rocker Partners , a minority owner of TheStreet.com . "
The subpoenas were never enforced after the SEC backed down , but such a scheme might involve Rocker Partners ordering up some negative intel on a stock , shorting that stock , and then leaking the negative intel to their friends over at TheStreet.com , profiting nicely when the news breaks .
5. Short - Selling
Oddly enough , Cramer outlined just such a scheme in the 2006 interview with TheStreet.com cited frequently by Stewart last night .
If his hedge fund was short on a stock ( he used Research in Motion as an example ) and needed it to go down , he said , " it 's really important to get the Pisani's of the world " — that would be CNBC's Bob Pisani — " talking about it as if there 's something wrong with RIM .
Then you call the bozo at the Journal who 's a reporter on Research in Motion and you would feed that Palm 's got a killer that it 's going to give away . "
It works with Apple , too : " Apple , it 's very important to spread the rumor that both Verizon and AT&T have decided do n't like the phone , and that it 's not going to be ready for MacWorld .
And this is a very easy one to do because the people who write about Apple want that story , and you can claim that it 's credible because you spoke to someone at Apple , because Apple does n't talk . "

AmEx cancelled my card .
Now what should I do ?
A week ago today I reported on the announcement by American Express of new terms effective 2 April 2009 for personal AmEx cards issued in the USA , under which , in order to obtain or retain an AmEx card , you will have to " agree " that AmEx has your " consent " to send a lifetime of robocalls and SMS text message spam to any phone number you ever use to contact AmEx : hotel phone numbers , pay phones , phones at the homes or offices of friends or family members or business associates , borrowed phones , cell phones , you name it .
That 's not a risk I can afford to take , or that you should take .
My article was published on Sunday .
By Thursday morning , after a couple of exchanges of e-mail ( posted in full in the comments to my original article ) with AmEx's V.P. for Public Relations , AmEx had cancelled my card and closed the account I 've had with them for the last 20 years .
( When I called them and specifically asked for it , they said they would send me a refund check for the annual fee I had already paid .
I do n't yet know what , if anything , they 'll tell the credit bureaus about their reasons for closing my account . )
I 'm not alone : AmEx and other credit card issuers have been cancelling lots of cards lately , for lots of reasons -- or no reason at all .
Under their standard terms , they do n't need to have , or disclose , any reason to cancel your card or close your account at any time .
( Yes , even if you 've paid all your bills on time , and even if you are in the middle of a long trip abroad .
This guy had his AmEx card cancelled in the middle of his honeymoon , for example . )
So what happened to me ?
What should you do if you have an AmEx card ?
What should you do if your AmEx or other card is cancelled ?
And , most important , which are the best cards , and what 's the best strategy for using them , for an international traveller ?
Here 's my advice :
If you have an AmEx personal charge card issued in the USA , I strongly recommend that you cancel it and close your account immediately , before these new terms go into effect .
Not because they cancelled my card -- I had n't used it in more than a year , only retained it as a backup for emergencies , and had debated whether it was still worth the annual fee -- but because these new terms place AmEx cardholders in serious danger of privacy invasion , identity theft , and liability to third parties who might get harassed by AmEx after you 've called AmEx from their phones .
More on what AmEx has done , what it means , and what other card choices are best for international travellers :
For what it 's worth , mine was a traditional green personal AmEx charge card , not one of their newer credit cards .
I do n't know if AmEx has tried , or will try , to impose similar terms on corporate cards , other types of cards , or cardholders in other countries .
In Canada and the European Union these terms probably would n't be legal .
I 've heard from one corporate AmEx cardholder who was told by their corporation that no such terms applied to their corporate card .
But terms may vary from corporation to corporation -- big companies can actually negotiate with AmEx , unlike individuals -- so I recommend that you check on the terms applicable to your specific corporate AmEx card .
I 'd be interested to know what you find out .
Despite specifically asking that my report be forwarded to AmEx's Chief Privacy Officer and the person (s ) responsible for reports of privacy and security vulnerabilities and potential breaches , the only response I got ( other than a message from AmEx customer service that they had cancelled my card ) was from the p.r. department .
And they never seemed to treat the issues I raised as anything more than a p.r. problem .
That 's AmEx 's standard operating procedure , apparently : last December , AmEx told another reporter that , " Security researchers who discover vulnerabilities on Amex 's site may report them by contacting a member of the company 's PR team . "
It 's particularly ironic that AmEx would n't take me seriously , since some of AmEx 's own lawyers have previously cited me in their filings with government regulators ( see page 7 , numbered as 6 , in the PDF document ) as an authority on risks and protections for travellers who use credit or charge cards .
And it 's indicative of the gap between reputation and reality that the first card - issuing company I know of to try to impose such terms on cardholders is the one that for the last three years in a row has been found in annual surveys to be the " Most Trusted Company for Privacy " in the USA .
What AmEx has done in this case highlights two common problems people face , as individual consumers , in dealing with travel and other companies :
First , the law imagines that you have an " agreement " with a company like AmEx , whose terms and conditions are the result of " negotiations " between equals in the open market .
In reality , you have only a handful of choices of companies to deal with for many products or services .
AmEx , Visa , Mastercard , and who else , really , in this case ?
How many times have you been in a place while travelling where there was only one ATM in town ?
Their terms and conditions are n't subject to negotiation , but are offered on a " take it or leave it " basis .
Unless , perhaps , you are a large organization with tens of thousands of employees , your only alternative is to take your business elsewhere , if there is an elsewhere , or not to buy that type of product or service at all .
That 's not a truly free choice , and in such cases of monopoly or oligopoly should be treated by the courts as an " agreement " entered into and " accepted " under a sort of commercial duress .
Second , privacy policies are almost never , in the USA , part of the actual terms of the contract .
Typical terms and conditions contain a clause that they contain " the entirety of the agreement between the parties " , while the privacy policy is a separate document .
I 've never seen a separate privacy policy that explicitly provided that it took precedence over contrary terms in other parts of the terms and conditions ( which is what AmEx's p.r. director seemed to be trying to claim in some of her comments to me ) .
In some cases , you might make a claim that announcing a privacy policy that one does n't follow amounts to fraud , and is actionable under truth - in - advertising statutes .
But that is fundamentally different from terms enforceable as part of the contract .
The first test of a meaningful privacy policy is that it either be included directly in , or be explicitly incorporated by reference into , the contract terms .
A privacy policy not part of a contract should be dismissed out of hand as mere propaganda .
" If you mean it , put it in the contract " , should be a basic , non-negotiable consumer demand of any company that wants its privacy promises to be credible .
That said , AmEx can , and does , cancel cards and close accounts at will , as do other card issuers .
They do n't have to tell you when they cancel your card ( unless they specifically promised to do so in their terms ) , and even if they try to notify you , there 's a good chance you wo n't get the notice if you are travelling .
Most likely , you 'll find out your card has been cancelled only when you try to use it and the charge is declined .
None of this used to be common , but now it is , with the transformation of lenders ' attitudes toward credit .
Tens of milions of credit and charge cards of all types have been cancelled by issuers in recent months .
Your Visa , AmEx , or Mastercard can be cancelled because you have n't used it enough , or because you 've used it too much , or because you 've used it in what the card issuer has decided are the " wrong " places or to buy things from what the card issuer has decided are the " wrong " merchants .
Your cards probably will be cancelled ( or may already have been cancelled ) if you have n't used them for a year or more -- which can be a problem if you had a particular card set aside as an emergency backup .
So what can you do ?
Carry several cards , of different types .
In particular , try to have at least one Visa and one Mastercard with you on an international trip , as it's fairly common to find a hotel or other business abroad that accepts one or the other , but not both , or accepts the other only with high fees .
Have a separate ATM / debit card for getting cash from ATM's , and charge card for making purchases .
If you use a credit card at an ATM , it 's considered a cash advance , and you 'll typically be charged a minimum of 3 % or 1 month 's interest .
On the other hand , if you make purchases with a debit card ( rather than a credit card ) , the money is taken out of your bank account immediately , and you lose the right you have with a credit card purchase to dispute the charge if you do n't get what you pay for or the amount of the charge is wrong .
" chargebacks " are your most important credit card consumer protection , and sometimes necessary in cases of either fraud or innocent but large mistake .
Do n't forfeit that right by using a debit card for purchases .
Use a debit card only for ATM withdrawals .
Use each of your cards every few months for at least a small purchase .
It 's hard to know what usage pattern is least likely to get your cards cancelled , but complete non-use for many months will almost certainly get your card revoked by the issuer .
If you have n't used some of your cards in a while , call the issuing bank before you take them on a trip , to make sure they are still valid .
After my AmEx card was cancelled , I checked and found that one of my other cards had been cancelled for non-use a few months ago , without notice .
Expect to use your ATM card as your primary means of access to local currency abroad , but always have a backup .
Especially in an out - of - the - way place with only one bank or ATM ( or only one that accepts cards issued outside the country ) , all kinds of unexpected complications can make it impossible to rely on an ATM card for all your expenses .
Most ATM 's only dispense local currency , and some tourist businesses ( hotels , tour operators , airlines , consulates and embassies for visa fees , admissions to some museums and national parks , even railroads in some countries if you have a foriegn passport ) wo n't accept local currency , but require payment in " hard " currency like dollars or Euros .
I was in two countries in Africa last year where , so far as I could tell , there were no ATM 's anywhere .
And what if you lose your ATM card , have it stolen , or ruin it by leaving it in your clothes when you put them a washing machine and dryer ?
How long would it take to get a replacement card , and what would you do in the meantime ?
Some card issuers will only send a replacement to your address in the USA , which could delay things even longer while you arrange for someone to forward your new card to you abroad .
Keep a cushion of cash .
I always try to have enough , divided up and well hidden , for a week 's expenses .
Always have some hard currency , for expenses that might require it , as well as local currency .
U.S. dollars will almost always do , although occasionally Euros will be more useful even outside the Euro zone .
( No other currency is generally worth bothering to carry on a world tour , unless you are spending a lot of time in a particular country where you will need it .
No , not even Pounds Sterling -- sorry , Brits . )
Keep a larger emergency reserve of travellers ' checks sufficient for a couple of weeks .
Depite my other issues with AmEx , I continue to recommend AmEx travellers ' checks as by far the most widely accepted brand worldwide .
( Thomas Cook checks are the next best , while Visa brand checks are much less widely accepted . )
There are big problems with forged AmEx travellers ' checks , so expect yours to be scrutinized closely when you cash them .
All travellers ' checks have gotten harder and harder to cash , even at banks , and are typically subject to substantial encashment fees .
But they remain the safest way to carry a large amount of emergency money .
And because they can be replaced ( eventually ) if lost or stolen , you do n't have to carry them on your person with your other valuables .
Carry your travellers ' checks separately , so you 'll still have them if everything else including your ATM and credit cards are stolen from your money belt or hidden pouch or secret pocket .
In an emergency , what counts is a high enough credit limit that after an accident or road collision you can charge your treatment at a private hospital and a business - class ticket home if your injuries wo n't let you bend your leg .
( I 've known several people to need this , including my travelling companion once . )
But for day - to - day use , which cards are best for international travellers ?
Cards that earn frequent flyer mileage are n't necessarily best , especially if they have an annual fee .
You have to do the math to figure out the real value of the points .
For example , if you charge $ 25,000 a year on your card , earn 25,000 points , and use them for a ticket that would otherwise cost you $ 300 , and the card has a $ 50 annual fee , that works out to the equivalent of a 1 % cash rebate .
If you use the same 25,000 points a year for a ticket that would otherwise have cost you $ 550 , with a $ 50 annual fee , it amounts to a 2 % rebate .
Unfortunately , most airline mileage - plan credit cards have foreign currency fees of 3 % or more , and annual fees .
For travel in the USA , where currency exchange fees are n't a factor , one of the best mileage deals is the Amtrak Guest Rewards Mastercard .
It has no annual fee , and the value of the points works out to about a 2.5 - 3 % rebate if you use them for Amtrak travel on the Northeast Corridor , the California Corridors , or certain Midwest routes .
But it 's issued by Chase , with Chase 's typical 3 % fee for foreign transactions .
For use abroad , the most significant factor in credit card choice is probably the card issuer 's fees for foreign currency transactions .
Visa and Mastercard charge issuing banks 1 % above the wholesale ( " interbank " ) exchange rate , but most banks add an additional percentage fee ( for which , it should be noted , they do no work and provide no services -- Visa or Mastercard does the currency conversion for their fixed 1 % ) .
Some of the largest Visa and Mastercard issuers have the highest fees for foreign currency transactions .
Bank of America , Chase , and Wells Fargo , for example , charge most cardholders an additional 3 % .
That 's enough to override any advantages of most rebate or mileage - points cards .
The good news about the ongoing class action lawsuit about hidden foreign currency fees for card usage is that , while cardholders still have n't seen any money from the proposed ( and in my opinion inadequate ) settlement , most card issuers have gotten more honest -- if you ask them specifically -- about their foreign currency transaction fees .
But you have to ask , or read all the fine print .
A few credit cards have no fee from the card issuer for foreign currency transactions .
( It 's unclear , in most such cases , whether that still means you pay the 1 % above wholesale to Visa or Mastercard . )
Capital
One is the only major standalone credit card issuer I know of that does n't charge an additional fee for foreign transactions .
[ Update : But I 've since discovered to my chagrin that Capital One now has even more outrageous terms and conditions than AmEx . ]
You may be able to get a no - fee card from another issuer in conjunction with an integrated money management account with a company like Schwab , Fidelity , or HSBC where you also have a sufficiently large brokerage or retirement account .
Despite the problems I had as a result of Schwab Bank 's undisclosed corporate sanctions program , they are currently offering Schwab investment accountholders one of the best deals on credit cards , with no foreign currency charges , no annual fee , and a 2 % cash rebate .
On top of that , they reimburse other banks ' fees for using their ATM's .
They 'll send a replacement card to you , if necessary , by international Fedex at their expense .
And they 'll call you back , at a number overseas , if you need customer service while you 're abroad .
[ Update : Schwab Bank is now trying to impose similar terms on their credit cards !
Before you activate or use any new card , read all of the fine print in the agreement , which typically is n't sent to you until after your application for a card is approved . ]
As AmEx 's recent actions make clear , terms and conditions can change at any time .
There 's a useful Flyertalk wiki page that tries to compile reports of current credit card offerings , but do n't act on it without verifying the details directly with the card issuer .
Good deals go bad , bad deals can get better , and new ones can appear .

Most people ( even many who work on the brain ) assume that what you see is pretty much what your eye sees and reports to your brain .
In fact , your brain adds very substantially to the report it gets from your eye , so that a lot of what you see is actually " made up " by the brain .
Some special features of the anatomy of the eyeball make it possible to demonstrate this to yourself .
The front of the eye acts like a camera lens , differently directing light rays from each point in space so as to create on the back of the eye a picture of the world .
The picture falls on a sheet of photoreceptors ( red in the diagram ) , specialized brain cells ( neurons ) which are excited by light .
The sheet of photoreceptors is much like a sheet of film at the back of a camera .
But it has a hole in it .
At one location , called the optic nerve head , processes of neurons collect together and pass as a bundle through the photoreceptor sheet to form the optic nerve ( the thick black line extending up and to the left in the diagram ) , which carries information from the eye to the rest of the brain .
At this location , there are no photoreceptors , and hence the brain gets no information from the eye about this particular part of the picture of the world .
Because of this , you should have a " blind spot " ( actually two , one for each eye ) , a place pretty much in the middle of what you can see where you can't see .
.
Do you see a blind spot anywhere ?
Maybe the blind spot for one eye is at a different place than the blind spot for the other ( this is actually true ) , so you do n't notice it because each eye sees what the other does n't .
Now do you see a blind spot ?
Hmm .
Maybe its just a little TINY blind spot , so small that you ( and your brain ) just ignore it .
Nope , its actually a pretty BIG blind spot , as you 'll see if you look at the diagram below and follow the instructions .
Close your left eye and stare at the cross mark in the diagram with your right eye .
Off to the right you should be able to see the spot .
Do n't LOOK at it ; just notice that it is there off to the right ( if its not , move farther away from the computer screen ; you should be able to see the dot if you 're a couple of feet away ) .
Now slowly move toward the computer screen .
Keep looking at the cross mark while you move .
At a particular distance ( probably a foot or so ) , the spot will disappear ( it will reappear again if you move even closer ) .
The spot disappears because it falls on the optic nerve head , the hole in the photoreceptor sheet .
So , as you can see , you have a pretty big blind spot , at least as big as the spot in the diagram .
What 's particularly interesting though is that you do n't SEE it .
When the spot disappears you still do n't SEE a hole .
What you see instead is a continuous white field ( remember not to LOOK at it ; if you do you 'll see the spot instead ) .
What you see is something the brain is making up , since the eye is n't actually telling the brain anything at all about that particular part of the picture .
The " celebrations " came amid high tensions over Pyongyang 's reported moves to test - fire a long - range missile .
The state propaganda agency , KCNA , which hailed its ' heaven - made commander ' on his birthday , said that the North will press ahead with a launch .
But it portrayed it as part of a space programme amid growing calls to drop the plan and the arrival in Japan of Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , on the first leg of a tour of the region , which will include a visit to South Korea .
So the fact that nothing is ever " edited " or " fact - checked " anymore because of " the internet " is so great because of citizen journalism and no gatekeepers etc !
But the down side is all the bullshit .
The LA Times , which now has an editorial staff of like , ten people ?
maybe ?
met some shady " political operatives " who love this wonderful new media landscape , because it allows them to plant whatever bullshit they want and watch it grow into cable news stories and " serious " analysis pieces .
Well , Times , some of us have been on this beat for a while !
But hey , you got some neat quotes from your unnamed political hack sources .
One operative told me this week about planting attacks on opponents in partisan blogs , knowing the stories could bleed into mainstream news outlets , without leaving any incriminating fingerprints .
Another described how he got green reporters to write stories ( no campaign cash wasted ! ) on ads that the candidate had no intention of ever paying to put on TV .
By " green reporters " do you by chance mean , say , the entire staff of The Politico ?
They sure did a lot of that this last campaign season !
( Hell , everyone did .
They are just the most transparent about their symbiotic relationship with the venal hacks they allow to use them to " drive the stories " or whatever they call getting a Drudge link and a segment on Hardball . )
Here is a sad bit :
The consultants cited a few recently departed veteran journalists who would n't fall for such funny business :
Time magazine 's Jay Carney , the Chicago Tribune 's Jill Zuckman ( the Tribune , like the L.A. Times , is owned by Tribune Co. ) and our paper 's Dan Morain , who took a buyout last month and went to work for a lawyers ' lobbying association .
Anyway , breaking : there is a lot of bullshit out there and everyone just repeats it , all the time , unquestioningly , because all the smart people were laid off .
Cyberattacks on federal computer data soar Agence France - Presse
Published : Tuesday February 17 , 2009

The number of reported cyberattacks on US government computer networks rose by more than 40 percent last year , USA Today reported on Tuesday .
The newspaper , citing data obtained from the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team ( US - CERT ) , said there were 5,488 tracked incidents of unauthorized access to US government computers and installations of hostile programs in 2008 .
There were a combined 3,928 such incidents in 2007 , USA Today said , and 2,172 in 2006 .
" Government systems are under constant attack , " the newspaper quoted Joel Brenner , counterintelligence chief in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , as saying .
" We 're seeing ... a dramatic , consistent increase in cyber crime ( and ) intelligence activities , " Brenner added .
USA Today said more infiltrators were trying to plant malicious software on US government computer systems in a bid to control or steal sensitive data .
The newspaper also said the data obtained from US - CERT may represent only a " small sampling " of the total number of incidents because " just one percent of federal agencies have fully developed tracking systems . "
At the same time , some of the increase may reflect better reporting , it quoted Mischel Kwon , who heads US - CERT at the Department of Homeland Security , as saying .
US President Barack Obama last week ordered a sweeping review of US cybersecurity to protect the government 's information technology systems from security and economic threats .
The 60 - day review is to be overseen by Melissa Hathaway , a former official in George W. Bush 's administration who coordinated cyber monitoring for the director of national intelligence .
During the election campaign , Obama equated cyber risks to the threat of nuclear or biological attack and promised a high - level review if he became president .
A congressional panel warned in November that China had developed a sophisticated cyber warfare program and stepped up its capacity to penetrate US computer networks to extract sensitive information .
And a December report by the Commission on Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency told the new leader that cybersecurity was " among the most serious economic and national security challenges we will face in the 21st century . "

Jessica Wanda Judith Cirio ( born March 21 , 1985 in Lanús , Buenos Aires Province ) is an Argentine model and dancer of Italian descent .
She has appeared on the Argentine reality show Cámara en Mano as well as pictorial spreads in Revista Hombre .
She is the host of ' Kubik ' , a TV programme broadcast in La Plata 's America 2 .
She also took part in two popular Argentine - version contests ' Dancing with the stars ' and ' Dancing on Ice ' .

Just like ten years ago , telecom companies are starting to subsidize computer purchases in exchange for long - term Internet service contracts .
But this time , it looks like it 'll end up better for the carriers and for consumers .
The latest : More cheap , subsidized 3G netbooks are on the way .
Verizon ( VZ ) Wireless confirms that it will start selling netbooks this year , meaning it 's probably going to match the enticing $ 99 price that other retailers are selling at .
This is a smart move by the carriers .
For a roughly $ 300 subsidy on the netbook -- about the same amount they subsidize smartphones -- they get someone locked into a 2 - year 3G data contract at around $ 45 - $ 60 per month .
Over the course of two years , that 's $ 1100 to $ 1400 in revenue they would n't have necessarily seen .
And they get another subscriber to put in their quarterly report to Wall Street , showing that the wireless growth boom still has some steam .
But we can't help but think back to the last time the computer industry got telecom companies to subsidize their sales .
That was during the late 1990s and early 2000s , when dialup ISPs like Microsoft 's MSN offered $ 400 rebates on new PCs if you signed up for three years of dialup service .
Microsoft eventually had to cancel the campaign because it was costing too much money .
( And boy were those consumers screwed , stuck on $ 250 - per - year MSN dialup contracts . )
The difference this time : Subsidizing netbooks is n't likely to put wireless carriers under financial strain -- that 's the business model they 've successfully used for years with cellphones .
And anyway , the volume will probably be relatively low .
The market for a $ 600 - per - year wireless netbook with a small screen and cramped keyboard is probably not huge right now .
Gartner expects 21 million netbook sales worldwide this year ; only a small subset will be subsidized by wireless carriers in the U.S .
And consumers ?
Unlike last time , when broadband came up and crushed dialup , it 'll be about 1.5 to 2 years -- pretty much the duration of that 3G contract -- before there 's a much - faster , widespread mobile Internet access option for most people .
Clearwire ( CLWR ) is building out a super - fast 4G network using a technology called WiMax , which it hopes will cover up to 120 million Americans by the end of 2010 .
But there 's no guarantee that will actually happen .
Clearwire , if you recall , merged with Sprint 's 4G business last year .
Sprint vowed in 2006 to build out its 4G network to reach 100 million people by the end of 2008 .
It 's not even 10 % there yet .
( Even once that happens , Sprint will need to acquire custom netbooks to sell . )
Meanwhile , Verizon and AT&T -- the two biggest U.S. wireless providers -- are also both rolling out 4G networks .
They wo n't be compatible with the 3G card in today 's netbooks .
But by the time the networks are rolled out in enough markets to be useful for most people , you 'll be ready to get a new $ 99 netbook .
( Or whatever else is on the market by then . )

A simple grilled cheese sandwich .
Something that can be procured anywhere at any time .
Nothing too exciting , right ?
But what if I put a little butter on the bread before I grilled that sandwich ?
That would add a little extra zing , right ?
And what if instead of using plain old American cheese I opted for something a tad more exotic , like Camembert , Stilton or Roquefort ?
Now we 're talking , right ?
And what if instead of using bread for my grilled cheese sandwich I used two large blocks of pure platinum ?
And what if instead of eating the platinum I sold it and then used that small fortune as venture capital for a Beijing - based conglomerate that could take advantage of Chinese local business incentives , cheap labor , lax environmental laws and surging global interest in the fastest - growing economy in the world , thereby ensuring returns in the billions of dollars even in the face of a collapsing U.S. dollar and a massive industrial shift from the technical to service business sector ?
Would n't that be nice ?
That 's exactly what Francesco Explains It All is .
In an endless buffet of indistinguishable tastes , it 's the grilled platinum Stilton cheese sandwich that could forever destabilize geoeconomics .

The history of the academy is sprinkled with geniuses who have worked painstakingly on whatever nook and cranny of their research area piqued their curiosity .
Bob Horvitz , Nobel laureate in physiology , is said to have spent 30 years studying the 22 cells of a worm 's vulva .
Arguably less usefully , the Victorian eugenicist and polymath Sir Francis Galton was addicted to classifying , using strict criteria , the attractiveness of young women whom he passed on the street .
For some , universities are " places where people with Asperger 's get asylum " ; for others , their classes are " padded cells for obsessives " , for whom writing books stops them from " assaulting strangers and being the biggest bores that ever existed " .
Whatever the truth , in recent times it seems that " stratospherically intelligent semi-crazies " have been made less welcome in academia as speculative and risky projects have been shunned and the safe and compliant recruited , the " moderately intelligent dullards " .
So is it the case that , as Anthony Seldon , master of Wellington College and biographer of Tony Blair , said this week in his inaugural lecture as professor of education at the College of Teachers : " We have embraced dullness and so close are we to it , we do not even see what has happened " ?
It is this dullness of mind and purpose that Alan Ryan , warden of New College , Oxford , alluded to in his submission to the Innovation , Universities , Science and Skills Select Committee on students and universities .
He blames a process that amounts " not to dumbing down but to dumbing into the middle " , where the bright student " is forced to turn her intelligence to handing examiners what she knows they want " .
Bureaucracy places more value on being " clear and predictable " about course content than on stretching students ' minds .
In a place such as the University of Oxford , he says , where any alert and organised student can get a 2:1 , the effect is that " lots of students get firsts " because " they have put in a methodical , well - organised , high 2:1 performance ; but it would be absurd to cut the number , since we have asked them to do a particular job and they have done it impeccably .
The problem is that we have n't asked them to do something more interesting . "
It is the relentless pursuit of that " something interesting " that many scholars find appealing .
Unfortunately for students , the genes for that academic tunnel vision are apparently the same as for Asperger 's syndrome .
So you often get the intense focus and persistence , but not the skills to relate the passion and inspire others .
Sir Isaac Newton would work obsessively on a problem for days until he had found the solution .
But he dropped out of academic life in middle age to become a civil servant because he did not like teaching or students .
Happily , today 's academy has many teachers who do like students , so why assume that they should not also want to give them something interesting to delight in ?
They may now arrive at university with an imagination stultified by the national curriculum and an intellect blunted by a battery of examinations .
They may turn up with demands because they pay tuition fees , but at that age can the customer always be right ?
If we accept Seldon 's warning that " a soulless , loveless , desiccated education damages children for a lifetime " , university is the last chance to stop that happening .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC , both drowning in debt as car sales continue to spiral downward , submitted requests to the U.S. Treasury late Tuesday that , if granted , could provide up to $ 39 billion in emergency loans to keep the automakers from falling into bankruptcy .
Separately , the United Auto Workers union said it has agreed to a tentative deal to modify labor contracts hammered out in 2007 due to the " extraordinarily difficult economic climate . "
The union said terms of the modifications will be made available after working out details of the employees ' health - care benefits plan and ratification of the agreement by the union .
Ford Motor Co. , F , - 1.34 % , the other member of Detroit 's Big Three , also has been hit hard by the economic downturn but so far has said it does not need federal assistance to survive .
The company is shedding jobs and assembly lines to bring its production closer in line with the shrinking market .
GM GM , - 2.37 % , in a blueprint aimed at convincing legislators it has a plan to survive the current economic crisis , said it could need up to $ 30 billion in emergency federal loans by 2011 in a worst - case scenario .
The Detroit giant said it also plans to tap funding from other governments , including Canada , Germany , Britain and Sweden , where it has extensive operations and plenty of jobs are at risk .
" GM 's plan is comprehensive , responsive and achievable , " GM Chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner said in a conference call following the release .
" It is based on conservative assumptions , and it is flexible enough to adapt to changing circumstances such as those we 've seen since Dec. 2 . "
GM said it is looking to start paying back the loans by 2012 and have them fully paid off by 2017 .
The plan also calls for further cuts in production to match a weaker sales outlook and includes phasing out the Saturn product line by 2011 .
Meanwhile , the company said it will concentrate its restructuring effort on its strongest brands : Chevrolet , Cadillac , Buick and GMC trucks .
GM shares closed down 12.8 % at $ 2.18 ahead of the release and have now lost 92 % of their value in the past year .
The Dow component hit a 71 - year low of $ 1.70 in November .
Chrysler wants an extra $ 2 billion
Chrysler bumped its request for an additional $ 3 billion in federal loans to $ 5 billion , which would bring the total of federal emergency funds received by the third - biggest U.S. automaker to $ 9 billion .
" We believe the requested working capital loan is the least - costly alternative and will help provide an important stimulus to the U.S. economy and deliver positive results for American taxpayers , " Chrysler Chairman and CEO Robert Nardelli said in a statement .
Chrysler slashed its 2009 overall industry sales target to 10.1 million cars and trucks in the U.S. , which would mark a 40 - year low for the industry , and also cut its annual targets through 2012 to an average of 10.8 million vehicles .
If that prediction holds true , Chrysler said it will result in $ 18 billion in lost revenue and a $ 3.6 billion decline in cash flows during the four years .
In addition to the stiff measures already taken in 2008 , Chrysler said it plans to cut fixed costs by $ 700 million this year , while reducing one manufacturing shift , slashing 3,000 jobs and discontinuing three vehicles .
Chrysler also said it has reached an agreement for concessions from the United Auto Workers and expects to reach a deal with bondholders .
Chrysler said it anticipates second lien debt holders will agree to convert 100 % of their debt to equity and that it is looking to further reduce outstanding debt by $ 5 billion .
Chrysler said it has suspended the 401 ( k ) retirement plan match , incentive bonuses and merit increases and has also eliminated retiree life - insurance benefits .

Windows 7 apparently wo n’t resuscitate the market for hybrid hard drives , which flickered out around the end of 2007 .
At the end of a meeting with Jon van Bronkhorst , executive director of product marketing for the consumer solutions business at Seagate , I asked whether or not hybrid hard drives stood a chance of coming back .
The short answer ?
No .
Hybrid hard drives , as you may know , merge the solid - state - disc ( SSD ) and the rotating hard drive together , with a bit of flash serving as a cache .
In concept , it ’s not a bad idea : while the performance gains have been on the order of 10 percent or more , the real bonus was supposed to be in the battery life , which would reduce the need to spin the disk , and “ squirt ” the data to the disk in one big spurt once the flash cache was full .
In reality , however , the first hybrid hard drives required even more power than a conventional drive , to power both the flash memory as well as rotate the disk .
According to van Bronkhorst , Microsoft was supposed to assist with some of these problems .
Remember that flash memory ( known as “ ReadyBoost ” ) was also seen as a way to assist Vista with reducing boot and shutdown times , as well .
Windows 7 , however , is supposed to be the version of Vista that works .
So does that mean hybrid hard drives will work , too ?
Does n’t look that way .
I did n’t nail down why , exactly , but the bottom line is that Microsoft just is n’t interested in supporting the technology .
And if Microsoft is n’t backing it , there ’s no reason for Seagate to develop products based on the technology .
QED : RIP .
Key Bush advisers on Guantánamo have kept their positions , the AP reports .
Among those “ still overseeing how the Pentagon deals with terror captives ” is a “ senior judge who has not followed President Barack Obama ’s order to halt military trials at Guantanamo Bay . ”
A new president and a new stated policy do not mean the personnel has changed .
“ Two other senior Pentagon officials have been shunted into civil service jobs .
As a result , they cannot be summarily fired because of the change in presidential administrations . ”
If Obama really wants to effect change here , he will have to make it a priority and force the issue , as I discuss in my recent op - ed , “ Obama ’s Guantánamo Opportunity . ”
However , I have my doubts the issue is a top priority for the new administration , which is busy trying to fleece the taxpayers of another trillion dollars of their hard - earned wealth .
If the administration was instead focused on restoring some of our constitutional safeguards weakened under Bush , it could surely find a legal way to circumvent judicial obstruction of its efforts to reassess Guantánamo .
As it now stands , the “ Army judge who is defying a White House request to freeze the Pentagon ’s war court ruled Thursday that he has the authority to decide whether the military ’s security measures at Guantanamo impair a captive ’s ability to defend himself . ”
Interestingly , judges often ruled to curb executive detention power under Bush too , although here the upshot is to preserve the policy as is .
Certainly Obama would have as much presidential power to question an executive detention as Bush had to order it in the first place .
Since Obama does not have a bold or principled agenda on detention policy , even the victories for civil liberties we might win under his term will be compromised by the inertia of the permanent bureaucracy .
This fact , Obama ’s CIA appointee who appears open to rough interrogation techniques , and hints that he might rely even more on extraordinary renditioning all give little comfort to those who hoped that on this one issue , Obama ’s government might prove qualitatively less hostile to liberty and the rule of law than the last administration .
Rarely ( maybe twice a month ? ) , my left testicle will fall out of my scrotum and sort of travel back up my body , creating an obvious bulge on its merry way ( presumably along the inguinal canal ) .
The highest it 's gotten is approximately aligned with the top of my pubic hair .
It 's a bit uncomfortable , but I can just push the bulge back in to place and all is well again for a while .
Putting very mild pressure to the left of the penis keeps it from falling back in , which is what I usually do when it does happen .
Common factors when this happens are being somewhat cold , being on my back , and having some sort of sexual activity going on down there .
I 'm not sure that it 's ever happened without an erection .
It 's definitely never happened to the right testicle .
This has probably been going on for two years ; I have n't experienced any other problems , discomfort , or pain as a result or independently in that region .
Is this normal ?
Is this a hernia ( I have n't had a physical in about 9 years ) or a hernia waiting to happen ?
Is some terrible fate awaiting lefty if I do n't get this looked at right away ?
Sometimes my left testicle " falls in " to my abdomen .
Is this bad / dangerous ?
Here it is , all in one post .
Please digg it .
Do it for Japan .
Every misinformed Japanophile needs to learn the truth once and for all .
1 . This is NOT a photo of a used panty vending machine : http://www.photomann.com/japan/machines/bizarrex.jpg
I ca n’t read all the text because of the low resolution of the photo and the big scratch on the face of the machine , but what I can read is , “ ladies & mens brand new lingerie ” in the center and “ imported from USA ” on the right .
My guess is the machine was either in or near a love hotel .
2009/12/15 Update : Someone just pointed out to me that the vending machine reads , “ 米国直輸入実証済みのスゴイ商 品 ” ( Imported directly from America , tried and true amazing products . )
2. Snopes is WRONG . ( gasp ! )
The page reads ,
We ’d read that this practice ended in 1993 and reported as much in the original of this article ( which was penned in 2001 ) , but since that time numerous readers living in Japan have written to say that not only have n’t the machines gone away , but that they ’ve themselves seen them .
How many of those eyewitnesses could read enough Japanese to tell if a vending machine was selling new knickers or used ones ?
3 . It is illegal in many prefectures to sell schoolgirls ’ used panties .
This Google search retrieves page after page of the laws in many prefectures that forbid the sale or purchase of used schoolgirl panties ( even fake ones ) anywhere , including in vending machines .
Almost all of them use exactly the same wording .
The average fine for breaking the law is 300,000 yen .
So how did this rumor first get started ?
This page sums it up best .
Apparently , in 1993 someone in Chiba City put used panties in one or more vending machines .
Subsequently , skanky underpants were classified under the law as second hand goods , which require a license to sell .
This law is actually to prevent the sale of stolen goods , as explained on this page , which answers the question from a concerned mother whose daughter and friends were making a killing by peddling their skid - marked skivvies over the internet .
Are we all clear on this now ?
Just this second I thought of the easiest way to get proof on video , if there ’s anyone out there who ’s still not convinced : I ’ll go to a police box with my camcorder and ask a policeman .
P.S. In Japan , there are n’t any convenience stores staffed by robots either .
DryadLINQ is a simple , powerful , and elegant programming environment for writing large - scale data parallel applications running on large PC clusters .
Overview
The goal of DryadLINQ is to make distributed computing on large compute cluster simple enough for every programmer .
DryadLINQ combines two important pieces of Microsoft technology : the Dryad distributed execution engine and the .NET Language Integrated Query ( LINQ ) .
Dryad provides reliable , distributed computing on thousands of servers for large - scale data parallel applications .
LINQ enables developers to write and debug their applications in a SQL - like query language , relying on the entire .NET library and using Visual Studio .
DryadLINQ translates LINQ programs into distributed Dryad computations :
C# and LINQ data objects become distributed partitioned files .
LINQ queries become distributed Dryad jobs .
C# methods become code running on the vertices of a Dryad job .
DryadLINQ has the following features :
Declarative programming : computations are expressed in a high - level language containing a superset of the best features of SQL , functional programming and .
Net .

Mind if I steal that idea to make a chocolate mold for novelties ( just for my family ) ?
It woild have to wait until my shop is set up but ...
Very imaginative .
A new study in Psychological Science reveals that nonverbal cues can give away a person 's socioeconomic status ( SES ) .
Volunteers whose parents were from upper SES backgrounds displayed more disengagement - related behaviors compared to participants from lower SES backgrounds .
In addition , when a separate group of observers were shown 60 second clips of the videos , they were able to correctly guess the participants '
SES background , based on their body language .
Socioeconomic status ( SES ) is determined by a number of factors such as wealth , occupation and schools attended .
SES influences the food we eat , hobbies we participate in and can even have an impact on our health .
People with an upper SES background can often be accused of flaunting their status , such as by the types of cars they drive or how many pairs of Manolo Blahniks they have in their closet .
It is easy to guess someone 's SES based on their clothing and the size of their home , but what about more subtle clues ?
Psychologists Michael W. Kraus and Dacher Keltner of the University of California , Berkeley wanted to see if non-verbal cues ( that is , body language ) can indicate our SES .
To test this idea , the researchers videotaped participants as they got to know one another in one - on - one interview sessions .
During these taped sessions , the researchers looked for two types of behaviors : disengagement behaviors ( including fidgeting with personal objects and doodling ) and engagement behaviors ( including head nodding , laughing and eye contact ) .
The results , reported in Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science , reveal that nonverbal cues can give away a person 's SES .
Volunteers whose parents were from upper SES backgrounds displayed more disengagement - related behaviors compared to participants from lower SES backgrounds .
In addition , when a separate group of observers were shown 60 second clips of the videos , they were able to correctly guess the participants '
SES background , based on their body language .
The researchers note that this is the first study to show a relation between SES and social engagement behavior .
They surmise that people from upper SES backgrounds who are wealthy and have access to prestigious institutions tend to be less dependent on others .
" This lack of dependence among upper SES people is displayed in their nonverbal behaviors during social interactions , " the psychologists conclude .

FEBRUARY 10 -- A
Fox
News producer who covered Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign for the cable network is facing child porn charges after federal agents discovered photos and videos on his computer depicting ' children under the age of ten being sexually abused by adult men and women . '
Aaron Bruns , 29 , was apparently nabbed after a Pennsylvania state police investigator conducting ' pro-active undercover investigations ' on an unnamed peer - to - peer network determined that Bruns 's computer contained llicit images .
According to an arrest warrant affidavit filed in U.S. District Court , an FBI search of a Dell laptop in Bruns 's Washington , D.C. home turned up several photos and videos showing the sexual abuse of children as young as five years old .
A copy of the February 6 affidavit can be found at here .
The day before his P Street apartment was raided , Bruns , pictured at left , filed a Foxnews.com story about Clinton and Joseph Biden delivering farewell speeches on the Senate floor .
This is the second time Bruns has been arrested for possessing vile images .
In July 1999 , Bruns , then 19 , pleaded guilty in Michigan ( where he was enrolled in college ) to distributing child pornography over the Internet .
He was sentenced to three years probation .
Bruns was collared in the earlier case after a Florida law enforcement official discovered his illicit online activities .
When police raided Bruns 's University of Michigan dorm room , they discovered about 6000 pornographic images of children on his computer 's hard drive .

Last October , asteroid monitors at the Catalina Sky Survey at the University of Arizona in Tucson picked up a small object on an immediate collision course with Earth .
The asteroid was too small to present a real threat — just a few meters across , it stood little chance of penetrating the atmosphere intact .
Indeed , it exploded in a stratospheric fireball over northern Sudan less than 24 hours later — an event witnessed by people on the ground as well as the pilots of a KLM airliner — conforming well to astronomers ' predictions for its trajectory .
But the asteroid , dubbed 2008 TC3 , was nonetheless a momentous discovery : Among the countless small objects that strike Earth 's atmosphere every year , none had ever been detected and tracked before it impacted .
Now the Sudan bolide has yielded yet another first : Researchers report in Nature today that they have recovered 47 meteorites from the object in the Nubian Desert .
And lead author Peter Jenniskens , a meteor astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View , Calif. , says that another search completed earlier this month , after the paper was submitted , has upped the meteorite count to about 280 .
Astronomer Donald Yeomans , manager of NASA 's Near - Earth Object Program office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , calls 2008 TC3 " a perfect asteroid trifecta , " referring to " pre-impact discovery , successful impact prediction , and successful sample return . "
( Yeomans did not contribute to the recovery research , but his office played a leading role in tracking the asteroid 's entry . )
The find allows astronomers to connect the chemical composition of the meteorite to its orbit and reflectance in the sky during tracking .
" The holy grail of asteroid science is to uniquely link a specific meteorite and its detailed composition to a specific asteroid type , " Yeomans says .
" And that has now been done without an expensive sample - return mission . "
This object , which the study 's authors call Almahata Sitta ( Arabic for Station Six , a train station in the desert where eyewitnesses saw the fireball and that served as the researchers ' base camp ) , appears to belong to a rare class of bodies called F - class asteroids , which constitute just 1.3 percent of all asteroids .
Chemically speaking , Almahata Sitta is a meteorite whose specific composition is unique among meteorite collections .
It is a fragile , porous ureilite ( a relatively rare kind of olivine - and pyroxene - bearing meteorite ) containing graphite and nanodiamonds , among other materials .
Its fragility , Jenniskens says , helps explain why it broke apart so high in the atmosphere .
With the benefit of the object 's rarity as an F - class body and its orbit , tracked backward through time , the researchers established a possible link to a larger F - class asteroid , the 1.6 - mile - ( 2.6 - kilometer - ) diameter 1998 KU2 , which may have originated from the same parent body as Almahata Sitta .
" The orbit of the asteroid , by just tracking it for 20 hours , is 10,000 times better than anything you can get from just observing a fireball , " Jenniskens says .
" What 's neat about this is that the big asteroid allows you to extend back in time the evolutionary history . "
He notes that scientists might be able to pinpoint the specific region of the asteroid belt that 2008 TC3 came from with more F - class asteroids from the same parent body .
Even the brief amount of time 2008 TC3 was tracked provided an excellent lead on where to look — and the desert surface provided an ideal surface for turning up the dark fragments .
" The entry trajectory was very precisely known , " Jenniskens says .
The first samples were found in early December by a 45 - person search team from the University of Khartoum .
( Three scientists from that university and one from the University of Juba in Sudan are among the co-authors of the study . )
" We had many eyes and hands , " Jenniskens says , trying " to find these . "
Sometimes the best picture sets are n't the most complicated ones .
I love this collection of photos taken in a corn field by podakuni .
All the elements seem to be aligned – the model seems really comfortable with the lens and the scenery really enhances her beauty .
Does n't it make you want to play in corn fields ?

Unregulated Capitalism Harms The Country These Six Ways
By Rev. Bill McGinnis , Director - LoveAllPeople.org
Search our pages =>
http://loveallpeople.org/searchallpages.html
BACKGROUND
Unregulated profit - seeking corporations cannot be trusted to protect the Public , because their main objective is to make profits , not to be a do - gooder for the Public .
Whenever profit - making conflicts with the Public interest , profit - making wins !
Thus they become Predators on the Public , not Protectors of the Public .
This is not a radical idea , but an obvious fact , if you think about it .
Profit - seeking corporations exist to make a profit , and the more profit , the better .
Anything which increases profits is good for them ; and anything which decreases profits is bad .
So they try to do whatever is necessary to make profits .
This is the essence of Laissez - faire Capitalism : that profit - seeking corporations should be left alone to do whatever they choose to do in order to make profits .
Employees get paid to help the company make a profit , not to be a do - gooder for the general Public .
Just suppose a local manager decided to give away $ 1,000,000 of the company 's money to build a playground for the neighborhood children .
" The kids need the playground ! , " he says .
Unless this playgound were part of some co-ordinated Public Relations effort , intended ultimately to produce greater profit , the employee would probably be fired , and replaced by someone with a better profit - making attitude .
Suppose an auto manufacturer had some kind of a safety problem , perhaps gas tanks that sometimes exploded on impact .
And suppose it would cost a hundred million dollars to fix the problem , but it would only cost ten million to let the problem continue , and pay off the victims who sued and won .
What do you suppose the company would do ?
It would let the problem continue , of course !
Deny that a problem exists , claim it was the user 's fault , and pay off damages only when forced to do so .
These kinds of decisions happen all the time .
Why do you suppose the corporations are so eager to get " Tort Reform ? "
To limit their payoffs for damages , of course !
So their profits are n't hurt so much !
" To hell with the Public , " they think .
" They should be more careful ! "
And if the Management of a profit - seeking corporation ever did choose the Public interest over a higher profit ( unless it were forced to do so by some kind of government regulation ) , then that corporation would be violating its financial duty to its stockholders .
And the stockholders would be entitled to replace the do - gooder Management with a profit - oriented Management .
UNREGULATED CAPITALISM
HARMS THE COUNTRY THESE SIX WAYS
We are talking mainly about the larger , publicly - traded , profit - seeking corporations like those whose stocks are traded on the stock exchanges .
But the same ideas can apply to any unregulated profit - seeking corporation , even the smaller ones and the private ones .
We recognize that profit - seeking corporations can be a great force for good in the world , creating and providing wonderful goods and services that would be unavailable by any other means .
But we also recognize that if they are unregulated , they harm the public these six ways .
An unregulated corporation is like a loose elephant in your neighborhood .
Who can stop it from trampling over whatever it chooses ?
1. NOT PAY TAXES - In order to maximize profits , they always seek to avoid or minimize their taxes .
2. ELIMINATE COMPETITION
- In order to maximize profits , they always seek to eliminate or control their competition .
3. CUT WAGES AND SALARIES -
In order to maximize profits , they always seek to reduce their labor costs .
4. DISREGARD THE ENVIRONMENT -
In order to maximize profits , they always seek to avoid all environmental restraints .

Two groups that oppose mountaintop removal coal mining have been told they are not welcome to hold their upcoming meetings at a former Boy Scout camp deep in the coal fields of eastern Kentucky — despite both having held events there without incident in the past .
[ social_buttons ]
Jim Scheff of Kentucky Heartwood said his group called last May to reserve Camp Blanton for a gathering called the Heartwood Forest Council , to be held Memorial Day weekend .
Another group , Mountain Justice , booked the camp for the days leading up to the holiday weekend .
Both groups found out just two weeks ago that their reservations were suddenly canceled .
Board member and attorney for the trust that operates the camp , Sidney Douglass told the Lexington Herald - Tribune that several board members have ties to the coal industry and “ board members did n’t want to get the camp involved in the kind of controversies that they ’re involved in . ”
“ Nationally there ’s a lot of pressure on coal , and the coal industry is really worried about it , ” he said .
“ The fact that Mountain Justice was going to be there camping for a week and then Heartwood was going to be there … also working to end mountaintop removal coal mining , that might have been more than they wanted to deal with . ”
The family of one board member in particular , C.V. Bennett , III , owns Cumberland Elkhorn Coal & Coke , a company that is in hot water with state regulators for keeping a toxic mine dump near Louisville that is putting off a foul odor into a neighboring trailer park .
Regulators say Bennett ’s dump accepts chemical wastewater and flyash , and lacks necessary stormwater management and erosion controls .
No problems with environmental groups in the past
Both groups said they had rented the camp before and had received no complaints .
Both said they received no explanation .
“ It would have been one thing if earlier in the year they had said , ‘ We just do n’t want you here , ' ” Scheff said .
“ We had put in hundreds of hours of volunteer work on planning , a lot of it dealing specifically with this place . ”
Mountain Justice had about 200 people at their gathering last May and since the site was so popular last year they had decided to return .
The annual Heartwood Forest Council had also met at Camp Blanton in 2000 and 2003 , without any incident .
Douglass said the camp still is accepting reservations from other groups .

The cost of developing and carrying the weapon , Dr. Emlen inferred , was outweighed by the greater access to females gained by owning some prized possession like a food source or tunnel where females could lay eggs .
Dr. Emlen noticed a tendency for weapons to start out small , like mere bumps of bone , and then to evolve to more ornate form .
The small weapons are actually quite destructive since their only role is to attack other males .
But the more baroque weapons , even though they look more fearsome , seem to cause lesser loss of life .
The reason is that the more menacing weapons have often acquired a signaling role .
Instead of risking their lives in mortal combat , males can assess each other ’s strengths by sizing up a rival ’s weapons , and decline combat if they seem outclassed .
The ornate weapons also lend themselves to ritualized combat in which males may lock horns and assess each other ’s strength without wounding each other .
“ The most elaborate weapons rarely inflict real damage to opponents , but these structures are very effective at revealing even subtle differences among males in their size , status or physical condition , ” Dr. Emlen writes in the current Annual Review of Ecology , Evolution and Systematics .
Since the weapons still have to be used from time to time , they are realistic signals of a male ’s fitness .
This information is of greatest interest to females , which are always looking for true , unfakeable signals of a male ’s quality .
Geerat Vermeij , an evolutionary biologist at the University of California , Davis , and an expert on the arms race between mollusks and their predators , said he agreed with Dr. Emlen that weapons began as soon as there was something to be defended .
But Dr. Vermeij said he was “ skeptical of the conclusion that initially harmful weapons turn into display weapons . ”
Crabs , for instance , lose claws a quarter of the time in combat , he said .
Scott Sampson , a dinosaur expert at the Utah Museum of Natural History , said that among hoofed animals , weapons often became less dangerous when the animals started to live in larger herds and males would cooperate in defending females against predators .
The Gaza appeal which the BBC is refusing to broadcast raised £ 600,000 before it was shown .
Donations flooded in to the Disasters Emergency Committee website before the initial transmission of the two - minute appeal on ITV1 last night .
On previous occasions the DEC has not accepted donations until an appeal has gone out live but members of the public have been able to donate to the Gaza appeal since Thursday .
Charity chiefs will be hoping that the controversy over the broadcast has increased public awareness that a way of donating to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is available .
Yesterday , Sky News sided with its main newsgathering rival in refusing to broadcast the appeal for aid for Gaza as the head of the BBC ruled out any last - minute policy change over its own decision .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The BBC director general , Mark Thompson , said the public broadcaster had a duty to cover the Middle East in a " balanced , objective way " and reiterated the corporation 's belief that broadcasting the appeal could undermine its journalistic impartiality .
The BBC has received more than 15,000 complaints since the weekend and has been publicly criticised by more than 50 MPs and two archbishops .
Dame Suzi Leather , head of the Charity Commission , adding her voice to the criticism yesterday , said she was " disappointed " that Sky had joined the BBC in not broadcasting the appeal .
Along with ITV , Channel 4 and Five also agreed to show the two - minute appeal by the Disasters Emergency Committee , a group of 13 charities including the Red Cross , Oxfam , Save the Children and Islamic Relief , before their main evening news bulletins .
Yesterday , the DEC described the £ 600,000 pledged through the website prior to the broadcasts as an " unprecedented " response .
Ian Bray , a senior officer at Oxfam , said the media coverage had generated a huge amount of interest among the general public and added : " We hope that level of interest continues . "
Previous appeals to aid victims of war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and cyclone victims in Burma raised £ 9.7 m and £ 18 m respectively .
There was a time in recent American history when certain Soviet jokes did n’t work in translation — not so much because of the language differences , but because of the lack of common sociopolitical context .
But that is changing .
As President Obama is preparing us for a great leap towards collectivism , I find myself recollecting forgotten political jokes I shared with comrades while living in the old country under Brezhnev , Andropov , and Gorbachev .
( I was too young to remember the Khrushchev times , but I still remember the Khrushchev jokes . )
I also noticed that the further America “ advances ” back to the Soviet model , the more translatable the old Soviet jokes become .
Not all Soviet advancements have metastasized here yet , but we have four more glorious years to make it happen .
One of my favorite political jokes is this :
The six dialectical contradictions of socialism in the USSR :
There is full employment — yet no one is working .
No one is working — yet the factory quotas are fulfilled .
The factory quotas are fulfilled — yet the stores have nothing to sell .
The stores have nothing to sell — yet people got all the stuff at home .
People got all the stuff at home — yet everyone is complaining .
Everyone is complaining — yet the voting is always unanimous .
It reads like a poem — only instead of the rhythm of syllables and rhyming sounds , it ’s the rhythm of logic and rhyming meanings .
If I could replicate it , I might start a whole new genre of “ contradictory six - liners . ”
It would be extremely difficult to keep it real and funny at the same time , but I ’ll try anyway .
Dialectical contradictions are one of the pillars in Marxist philosophy , which states that contradictions eventually lead to a unity of opposites as the result of a struggle .
This gave a convenient “ scientific ” excuse for the existence of contradictions in a socialist society , where opposites were nice and agreeable — unlike the wild and crazy opposites of capitalism that could never be reconciled .
Hence the joke .
Then I moved to America , where wild and crazy opposites of capitalism were supposedly at their worst .
Until recently , however , the only contradictions that struck me as irreconcilable were these :
Economic justice :
America is capitalist and greedy — yet half of the population is subsidized .
Half of the population is subsidized — yet they think they are victims .
They think they are victims — yet their representatives run the government .
Their representatives run the government — yet the poor keep getting poorer .
The poor keep getting poorer — yet they have things that people in other countries only dream about .
They have things that people in other countries only dream about — yet they want America to be more like those other countries .
Hollywood cliches :
Without capitalism there ’d be no Hollywood — yet filmmakers hate capitalism .
Filmmakers hate capitalism — yet they sue for unauthorized copying of their movies .
They sue for unauthorized copying — yet on screen they teach us to share .
On screen they teach us to share — yet they keep their millions to themselves .
They keep their millions to themselves — yet they revel in stories of American misery and depravity .
They revel in stories of American misery and depravity — yet they blame the resulting anti-American sentiment on conservatism .
They blame the anti-American sentiment on conservatism — yet conservatism ensures the continuation of a system that makes Hollywood possible .
I never thought I would see socialist contradictions in America , let alone write about them .
But somehow all attempts to organize life according to “ progressive ” principles always result in such contradictions .
And in the areas where “ progressives ” have assumed positions of leadership — education , news media , or the entertainment industry — contradictions become “ historically inevitable . ”
If one were accidentally to open his eyes and compare the “ progressive ” narrative with facts on the ground , one might start asking questions .
Why , for instance , if the war on terror breeds more terrorists , have n’t there been attacks on the U.S. soil since 2001 ?
Why , if George W. Bush had removed our freedom of speech , was nobody ever arrested for saying anything ?
And if Obama has returned us our freedoms , why was a man harassed by police in Oklahoma for having an anti-Obama sign in his car ?
Why would anyone who supports free speech want to silence talk radio ?
And why is silencing the opposition called the “ Fairness Doctrine ” ?
After the number of “ caring , ” bleeding - heart politicians in Washington reached a critical mass , it was only a matter of time before the government started ordering banks to help the poor by giving them risky home loans through community organizers .
Which resulted in a bigger demand , which resulted in rising prices , which resulted in slimmer chances of repaying the loans , which resulted in more pressure on the banks , which resulted in repackaging of bad loans , which resulted in a collapse of the banks , which resulted in a recession , which resulted in many borrowers losing their jobs , which resulted in no further mortgage payments , which resulted in a financial disaster , which resulted in a worldwide crisis , with billions of poor people overseas — who had never seen a community organizer , nor applied for a bad loan — becoming even poorer than they had been before the “ progressives ” in the U.S. government decided to help the poor .
As if that were not enough , the same bleeding hearts are now trying to fix this by nationalizing the banks so that they can keep issuing risky loans through community organizers .
In other words , to prevent the toast from landing buttered side down , they ’re planning to butter the toast on both sides and hope that it will hover in mid-air .
Which also seems like a sensible alternative energy initiative .
If that does n’t fix the problem , there ’s always the last resort of a liberal : blame capitalism .
It ’s always a win-win .
Today government regulators may be blaming capitalism for the crisis caused by their dilettantish tampering with the economy , but who do you think they will credit after market forces resuscitate the economy ?
Years ago , living in America made me feel as though I had traveled in a time machine from the past .
But after the recent “ revolutionary ” changes have turned reality on its head — which is what “ revolution ” literally means —
I ’m getting an uneasy feeling I had come from your future .
As your comrade from the future , I also feel a social obligation to help my less advanced comrades in the American community , and prepare them for the transition to the glorious world of underground literature , half - whispered jokes , and the useful habit of looking over your shoulder .
Do n’t become a nation of cowards — but watch who might be listening .
Let ’s start with these few .
People ’s power :
Liberals believe they ’re advancing people ’s power — yet they do n’t believe people can do anything right without their guidance .
People ca n’t do anything right — yet the government bureaucracy can do everything .
The government bureaucracy can do everything — yet liberals do n’t like it when the government takes control of their lives .
Liberals do n’t like it when the government takes control of their lives — yet they vote for programs that increase people ’s dependency on the government .
They vote for programs that increase people ’s dependency on the government — yet they believe they ’re advancing people ’s power .
Bush and the media :
The media said Bush was dumb — yet he won over two intelligent Democrats .
He won over two intelligent Democrats — yet the media said his ratings were hopeless .
The media said his ratings were hopeless — yet the 2004 electoral map was red .
The 2004 electoral map was red — yet the media said his policies failed .
The media said his policies failed — yet the economy grew and the war was won .
The economy grew and the war was won — yet the media said we needed “ change . ”
Public education :
Liberals have been in charge of education for 50 years — yet education is out of control .

First , the EU banned incandescent light bulbs .
Now , the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power ( LADWP ) is distributing compact fluorescent light bulbs ( CFLs ) to its 1.2 million households , citywide .
Oh , and for free !
What ’s next ?
As we all know , CFLs come with many energy - saving advantages compared to traditional incandescent bulbs .
A CFL last 10 - times longer when compared to an incandescent .
Also , CFLs operate at lower temperatures , which can reduce air conditioning use .
A big plus for a city like LA !
Go Into The Light , Carol Anne
The program projects a savings of up to 240 GWh of energy and 131,000 metric tons of CO 2 each year — the equivalent of taking approximately 24,000 cars off the road or enough energy to power 40,000 homes for a year .
The savings will equate to about $ 61.3 million in fuel costs for generating electricity .
LADWP sponsored teams will distribute the two free bulbs door - to - door over several months .
Included with the two CFLs are other energy saving materials .
Nobody Walks In LA
Now , this part I have to say I have a major issue with .
CFLs good .
Driving bad !
Yes , CFLs are great .
Sure , the light quality is a bit fugly and they kinda buzz a bit .
But the reduction in energy use is major .
Though , I admit I am a bigger fan of LED bulbs .
But why do LADWP reps need to drive to each resident to deliver the bulbs ?
First off , Los Angeles is not really a car - friendly kinda city .
California ’s largest city , and spanning 500 square miles , it seems all the energy savings would be negated by that useless driving .
Am I missing something ?
Hey , LA !
You know what already goes door to door daily – the postman !
Green With Envy
This initiative all falls under the recently announced GREEN LA .
“ Today , the city of Los Angeles is leading again , bringing simple , effective energy - efficient tools door to door ( for ) every Angeleno .
The Department of Water and Power is doing its part , and we want Angelenos to do theirs , ” said Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa .
To account for the fact that CFLs cannot be thrown in the trash due to the mercury they contain , disposal centers are being setup across the city .

ちょっと釣りっぽいタイトルを付けてしまったけれども、id:hyoshiokさんの「わたしがprintf()デバッグをしない理由」について、ちょっと前から思っていたことを書こうかと。半分ネタ、半分本気です。本気と書いてマジと読む。
まず前置きだけど、ボクは吉岡さんほど経験も技術力も知識もないし、OSのカーネルという特殊な領域のプログラミングもしたことがない、ぺーぺーの学生に毛が生えた程度のプログラマであるので、そこのところは含んでお読みいただきたい。特に、OSのカーネルという特殊性については完全に無視しているので悪しからず。
吉岡さんの記事の はてブ コメントでも指摘があったけれども、まず前提としてログ用と デバッグ 用の printf ( )
は違う。ログ用の出力はきちんと構造化された手法で行うべきであって、それができていなければ デバッグ がどうのという以前のレベルであろう。それに対し、 デバッグ 用 printfはソースツリーにコミットしてはいけない。
そもそも、デバッガを利用したデバッグと、printf()デバッグは、バグの原因究明という作業に対するアプローチが根本的に違う。
デバッガ利用デバッグは、問題の周辺にブレークポイントを置き、周辺の変数を見たりして問題の原因を探る方法だ。変数の内容が明らかにおかしい場合や、原因がソース上で直近にある場合は発見が容易だ。しかし一方で、「一見して」間違ってはいない場合や原因が遠方にある場合は問題解決が難しくなる場合がある。つまり、デバッガ利用デバッグはパッと見て分かるかどうかに頼った「発見的な原因究明プロセス」なのだ。
それに対して、printf ( ) デバッグは、いわば 「洞察的の原因究明プロセス」である。まず、問題に対して仮説を設定し、その仮説にしたがって実験を立案し、実験を行い、その結果を考察する。そして、単純に変数の値を見ただけではわからないバグをどのように表面化させるのか、が知恵の見せ所なのである。
発見的デバッグは、仮説を立てない物理実験のようなものである。なんとなくそれっぽい実験をして、とりあえず取れるだけデータを取って、それで何かが発見できればラッキーという感じだ。
よって、発見的デバッグと洞察的デバッグには、それぞれ一長一短がある。上にも書いたように、前者は明らかにわかる単純なバグを手早く直すのに向いているのに対し、後者は「複雑・巨大なデータ構造がどこかで矛盾している」とか、「計算の中のどこかでオーバーフローしている」とか複雑な問題をじっくり解決するのに向いている。適宜使い分ければよいのである。
だが、僕はもっぱらprintf ( ) デバッグを使う。それは、洞察的デバッグが「 楽しい」からだ。
ちょっと大げさだが、複雑な現象を目に見えるように視覚化するというのは楽しいのだ。
ちょっと科学史をたどれば、先人たちが自然現象を測定するために知恵を絞って見事な実験を考えだした例はたくさんある。エラトステネスは地域によって夏至の日の太陽の南中高度が違うことを利用して地球の大きさを測定したし、フーコーは回転する鏡を使って光の速度を測定した。
この手の話を聞いたのはたぶん小学生か中学生の理科の授業だったと思うが、かなりワクワクしたのを覚えている。デバッグは、毎日がちょっとしたサイエンスなのだ。
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Microsoft
Corp outlined plans to offset revenue declines as the PC market shifts to low - cost netbooks , but it failed to announce more cost cuts , sending its shares to an 11 - year low .

Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told an analysts ’ meeting in New York on Tuesday that Microsoft will offer robust versions of its yet - to - be- released Windows 7 operating software for netbooks , as the company looks to boost revenue from these hot - selling , low - cost computers .
But Microsoft shares fell more than 3 percent after Ballmer quashed the hopes of some investors for accelerated cost cuts .
Microsoft had announced plans to lay off 5,000 workers on January 22 as part of a plan to save $ 1.5 billion in annual costs .
“ I do n’t think it makes sense for us to come back and say , ‘ Could we take out another $ 2 billion in costs ? ’ ” Ballmer said at the analysts ’ meeting .
Avian Securities Jeff Gaggin said investors were disappointed with Ballmer ’s decision to hold off on further cost cutting measures , and that he chose not to reassure them that the board will maintain the company ’s current dividend .
“ There was a lot left to interpretation , ” Gaggin said .
Microsoft , which a month ago blamed netbooks for weaker - than - expected quarterly profits , said it is planning to ship a low - end version of Windows 7 for netbooks , and make it easy for users to upgrade to more expensive editions .
“ We will have high market share on netbooks , ” Ballmer said as he painted a grim outlook for the economy .
“ I often think of this as an economic reset .
It ’s not a recession from which you recover , ” he added .
Ballmer also said he still wants to team up with Yahoo Inc to compete against Internet search giant Google Inc , though he is not interested in buying Yahoo .
He said he hopes to discuss a possible search partnership with Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz , and added that he expects Google to start competing with the Windows operating system by offering a version of its Android operating system for laptop computers .
Google launched Android last year as an operating system for smart phones .
NETBOOK TREND
Microsoft had partly blamed last quarter ’s profit shortfall on a shift in personal computer sales to netbooks from full - featured machines .
Analysts say the low pricing of netbook software is hurting Windows profits , and estimate that Microsoft only reaps about half the revenue from PC makers for each netbook sold , compared to what it earns on sales of more expensive laptops .
Still , Ballmer said he disagreed that growing netbook sales represent “ downside ” for his company .
Microsoft ’s goal is to boost its average revenue per netbook by persuading users to pay to upgrade low - end versions of the software to gain features included with more expensive ones in full - featured PCs .
The software maker will encourage that by limiting the functionality of low - end versions of the new Windows 7 .
As an example , Ballmer said Microsoft will restrict the number of programs that a user can run at once .
Netbook sales took off last year as the economy weakened , making their low pricing of $ 200 to $ 400 more attractive to consumers .
Ballmer said he expects netbook sales to continue to grow as cash - strapped buyers avoid big - ticket , discretionary purchases .
“ There is certainly going to be an economic effect on PC sales , ” he said .
“ We can not control it .
It will affect our revenue . ”
Most netbooks are now shipped with a stripped down copy of an older generation of Microsoft ’s operating system , Windows XP , because those machines do n’t have the computing resources needed to run Windows Vista , the latest version .
Cross Research analyst Richard Williams estimates that Microsoft gets about $ 35 for each netbook sold with Windows .
Analysts expect Windows 7 to be released before this year ’s holiday shopping season .
Microsoft has declined to give a specific release date , only saying it will be out by January 2010 .
Microsoft shares fell 33 cents to $ 16.88 , after hitting an 11 - year low of $ 16.36 .
France : Sarkozy moves to control public television
By Olivier Laurent
7 January 2009
President Nicolas Sarkozy is pressing his reform of French public TV ( France Télévisions ) through parliament .
The reform aims to strengthen governmental control over France Télévisions by eliminating advertising , thus making public TV completely dependent on state funding , while also allowing the government — effectively , the president — to name its CEO .
The bill passed in the National Assembly on December 17 , 293 to 242 , after nearly a month of often - rowdy debates .
It is expected to be debated in the Senate for two weeks beginning Wednesday , January 7 .
The ruling Union for a Popular Movement ( UMP ) does not have a majority in the upper house and the passing of the law is not a forgone conclusion .
The government faces dissent from its own members and centrist senators over the financing of the reform .
Delaying tactics in the National Assembly by the opposition Socialist Party and its Green and Communist Party allies meant that the government could not get the law onto the statute books in time for the reform ’s scheduled launch January 5 .
Under the Audio - Visual Law for the Reform of Public Television , all commercials are to be phased out by the end of 2011 .
The loss of €450 million from advertising in 2009 will be replaced with state revenue from TV licence fees and two new taxes : a 1.5 to 3 percent levy on the advertising revenue of the private channels , and a tax on telephone companies and Internet access providers .
This constitutes an attack on the independence of the public TV companies , as the cash from the tax will not come to them directly as a guaranteed income ( contrary to the present funding ) but be paid into the national budget .
The government will decide each year what it will then allocate to public TV .
By the government ’s own admission , the income expected from these taxes totals only €450 million .
It will not make up , therefore , for the ultimate loss of all of public TV ’s advertising revenues — € 833 million , or 36 percent of the operating budget — once the reform goes into full effect in 2011 .
The reform will result in cuts to jobs , salaries , and programme quality .
The CEO of France Télévisions will be nominated effectively by the president , and no longer by the broadcast regulatory body , the Superior Audiovisual Council ( CSA ) .
The appointment is for five years , but the president may withdraw it at any time , with the agreement of the CSA .
At present , the CEOs are appointed by the CSA alone and can be dismissed only for serious infractions .
In its haste to enact the reform , the government has partially bypassed parliament .
It asked France Télévisions CEO Patrick de Carolis to carry out the reform ’s first stage by January 5 — removing commercials between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m .
After initially threatening to resign , Carolis agreed and also proposed to increase the spending cuts from the merging of the group ’s 49 enterprises — which employ 11,000 workers — from € 140 million to €200 million .
Like many of Sarkozy ’s initiatives , the reform is presented as a somewhat “ left ” measure : the suppression of public TV advertising has been an occasional demand of the French bourgeois left , who noted that it subjected public TV stations to private influence .
What such arguments ignore is that , under capitalism , the elimination of advertising revenue will make public TV ’s financing directly dependent on the state , whose leading personnel is intimately connected to major corporate leaders .
Sarkozy ’s reform has been widely referred to as a “ Berlusconization ” of France ’s media — a reference to Italian Prime Minister and business magnate Silvio Berlusconi , who owns much of Italy ’s private media and controls its public media as head of state .
If the reform passes , Sarkozy will combine control over public TV with close links to France ’s main private media CEOs .
The reform is a financial godsend to private television stations — who will now have a monopoly on TV advertising — and particularly to the largest private station , TF1 , owned by Martin Bouygues , a billionaire construction magnate and close friend of Sarkozy .
After the presidential elections , Bouygues appointed Sarkozy ’s campaign manager , Laurent Solly , to the post of deputy director of TF1 .
Sarkozy is further increasing private TV stations ’ advertising revenues by decreeing increases in the airtime they may devote to advertising .
The decrees permit two commercial breaks during films broadcast on the private channels — at present restricted to only one — and also lengthen permitted advertising time on the main private stations to nine minutes per hour , from the present six minutes .
Nor is TF1 the only private station whose CEO is closely tied to Sarkozy .
In 1985 , as mayor of the exclusive Paris suburb of Neuilly , Sarkozy created the Neuilly Communication Club , an association where media executives rubbed shoulders , including among them Arnaud de Puyfontaine ( CEO of the Mondadori - France press conglomerate ) , Nicolas de Tavernost ( boss of the M6 private TV channel ) , Guy Verrecchia and Alain Sussfeld ( the heads of the cinema chain UGC ) , Philippe Gaumont ( FCB advertising agency ) and Jean - Loup Tournier , the head of Sacem ( the company which collects authors ’ royalties ) .
There are substantial indications that Sarkozy worked out the TV reform with his corporate backers .
During the 2007 presidential election campaign , Sarkozy told L’Express , “ I would prefer a little more advertising on the public channels rather than their lacking the resources for the production of quality programmes . ”
However , in the autumn of 2007 , TF1 presented a white paper to the government suggesting similar measures to the reform .
By January 2008 , Sarkozy made a complete about - face , saying , “ I propose … a veritable cultural revolution in public television …
I want thought to be given about the suppression of advertising on the public stations . ”
The bitterly unpopular reform — a July opinion poll showed that 71 percent of the French people oppose it — has already given rise to one of the more famous Internet videos of Sarkozy .
This summer , the Internet site Rue89 posted unofficial footage , recorded by a camera of the public channel France 3 TV when the president was waiting to be interviewed in the channel ’s studio .
Sarkozy had had to make his way to the studio through a protest demonstration of several hundred workers .
Once Sarkozy sat down , he complained about the bad manners of a technician who had not responded to his greeting .
The president complained , “ We are not in the public service here , we ’re with the demonstrators …
Incredible …
And serious ! ”
After a journalist replied “ It ’s France , ” Sarkozy said , “ There ’s going to be a change now . ”
Then he joked about putting a journalist , Gérard Leclerc , “ on the shelf . ”
Leclerc had signed a statement opposing the proposed public media reform .
France 3 management initially requested the destruction of the video sequence and demanded that the Rue89 journalists reveal their source .
Faced with public controversy and the popularity of the Rue89 video , France 3 was ultimately forced to back down .
Will Pakistan 's break - up bode well for India ?
T
Although it has a per capita GDP similar to India , he points out that it scores low on political rights , ranks fifth in the world for group grievances , scores low on the State 's legitimacy to represent the people , and has the army as a State within a State ( " If the army is the State , the Inter Services Intelligence is its cabinet " ) , and is among the countries with the most factionalised elites at the highest levels of government .
Speaking to Rediff India Abroad 's P Rajendran , Mabry , a former reporter for The Wall Street Journal and a producer for CNN , argued that ethnic differences are more likely to result in conflict than economic divisions , and that India remains undivided because it gave some authority to ethnic and linguistic groups , among other things by drawing state boundaries around them .
Given that Pakistan has not been able to address the needs of the various groups within it , he believes it would be better off as three of four stable countries than one unstable one .
How is it that you see Pakistan as a failed State ?
For a State to be successful , you would assume , as a necessary condition , that it is legitimate .
And for a State to be legitimate , it has got to follow the principle of popular sovereignty .
It is pretty hard to find a country that says it does n't represent the will of the people .
The central problem for Pakistan is that there 's a great disagreement among the people about what Pakistan should look like .
In the same way , there was a time .
at least in the US when we looked at Iraq , where we would think , ' How do I make a better country for the Iraqis ? '
It took a few years but , eventually , people figured out that there was n't anything called an Iraqi .
There was a Sunni Arab , a Shia Arab , and a Kurd , and they all have very different ideas about what the country should look like .
In Pakistan , the complexities of the internal ethnic divisions are difficult for policy - makers to appreciate .
My experience , certainly interviewing Sindhi separatists , was that the sentiment for their own country is very deep , very sincere , and not likely to disappear anytime soon .

One of the reasons Windows 7 runs faster ( faster start up , resume , shut down , less churn during user sessions ) is due to the re-engineering of how Windows maintains and activates services running in the background .
Microsoft ’s Channel 9 has an interesting video with a Windows kernel developer whose team designed a new trigger - based service controller that enables service developers to mark services as needing to run only when certain conditions are met .
This means Windows 7 can more intelligently manage when to make resources avaiable for services that employ this trigger pattern for starting and stopping .
Less code that runs at any given time means Windows 7 has more resources available for foreground processes that impact users interacting with the OS .
The net effect of this for users is a snappier OS .
Arthur Miller questioned society and authority
Arthur Miller was America 's foremost post - war playwright .
His works , intricate musings on the darkness at the heart of the American Dream , struck a chord with a whole generation of theatre - goers throughout the world .
Miller 's best - known character , Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman , the little man , destroyed by the pressures of modern life , stunned the audience at the play 's Philadelphia premiere in 1949 .
Some wept .
Arthur Miller became famous overnight .
He was born in New York in 1915 .
His father owned a garment factory but faced financial ruin after the Great Crash of 1929 .
The young Arthur Miller
His first stage play , All My Sons , portrayed the impact on a family of American participation in World War II .
Miller was attacked as unpatriotic .
He said that he was just telling the truth .
In due course his liberal views caught him in the McCarthy anti-communist witch - hunt .
He testified before a congressional committee , refusing to name friends and colleagues who might have been communists and was held in contempt .
Surprising marriage
" I feel the same as I ever did , " he said at the time , " which is that I do n't believe that a man has to become an informer in order to practice his profession freely in the United States . "
Miller refused to name suspected Communists
Years later , Miller also wrote the screenplay for The Crucible , a film starring his son- in - law , Daniel Day - Lewis , and Winona Ryder .
Many were astonished when he married Marilyn Monroe in 1956 .
The bookish intellectual and the doomed screen goddess made an unlikely couple .
Out of fashion
He admired her courage , he said , but it did not last .
Following their breakup in 1961 , Miller married the renowned photographer Inge Morath , whom he met on the set of the film The Misfits , which he wrote and which starred Monroe .
Most human enterprise disappoints
Arthur Miller
In later years Arthur Miller went out of fashion in America .
He complained that writers there were treated as entertainers , not moralists , and railed against what he regarded the hollow commercialism of Broadway .
The rejection exaggerated the gloom from which he fashioned his plays and which he freely admitted .
" I do think that most things end badly , " he said .
" Most human enterprise disappoints . "
Sought to provoke
His work continued to be loved and admired in the UK and in 1995 his Broken Glass won the prestigious Olivier Award for best play .
The odd couple : With Marilyn Monroe
Arthur Miller 's legacy is such that , on any one day , his work is being performed somewhere in the world .
Beyond the glare of stardom and the Pulitzer Prize which he won for Salesman , he sought to provoke his audience into questioning society and authority .
After the events of 11 September 2001 , Miller said the attacks had been part of a " war against humanity " .
" Ever since Stalin and the Nazis , reality has transcended fiction , " he said .
He also expressed some doubts about President George W Bush 's ability to tackle the crisis , and warned that emergency measures introduced by the US government might have a negative impact on liberty .
A man of the highest integrity , both in his work and in his personal life , Arthur Miller was an old - fashioned liberal , who never accepted the American dream at face value .
Maine Senator Susan Collins , one of the few Republicans to support President Obama ’s stimulus package , said she could not back his budget plan , which she said would bring debt to an unprecedented level .
“ It poses a threat to the basic health of our economy , ” she said on ABC ’s “ This Week . ”
Ms. Romer challenged the estimates , calling the figures unrealistically pessimistic .
“ There is a question whether the C.B.O. is right , ” Ms. Romer said .
“ So we know that forecasts , both of what the economy is going to do and of what the budget deficit are going to do , are highly uncertain .
And especially when you get further out in the C.B.O. numbers , we think they really are too pessimistic in thinking about how fast the U.S. economy can grow . ”
Kent Conrad , chairman of the Senate Budget Committee , said the different estimates could be explained .
“ In fairness to this administration , they locked down their forecasts three months ago , ” said Mr. Conrad , a Democrat of North Dakota .
“ There ’s been a lot of bad news since . ”
But he added : “ We have got to get back to a more sustainable fiscal circumstance .
We can not have debt pile on top of debt .
We can not run budget deficits in the out - years of over $ 1 trillion a year .
“ I will present a budget that I think begins to move in that direction , ” Mr. Conrad said .
“ It acknowledges in the short term , yes , we have got to have added deficits and debt to give lift to this economy , but longer term , we have got to pivot . ”
The back and forth over the economy came the day before the administration plans to unveil its toxic - asset plan .
The plan , which will likely offer generous subsidies to coax investors to buy as much as $ 1 trillion in troubled mortgages and related assets from financial institutions , is core to President Obama ’s effort to rescue the nation ’s banking system .
Industry analysts estimate that the nation ’s banks are holding at least $ 2 trillion in so - called “ toxic assets , ” mostly residential and commercial mortgages that are weighing down bank balance sheets , crippling their ability to make new loans and deepening the recession .
Ms. Romer stressed that the private investors entering a partnership with the government to buy assets of trouble companies would not be subject to the same scrutiny now being leveled at American International Group .
In response to the $ 165 million in bonuses that A.I.G. dispensed to the business unit that caused its near - collapse , the House moved to impose a 90 percent tax on bonuses given out at companies receiving more than $ 5 billion in bailout money .
As generation followed generation , the 100 or so outstanding notes with a combined face value of $ 66,000 have all but been forgotten , aside from an occasional newspaper account .
But the Bank of New York Mellon , which administers the bonds for the city , has a record of the 39 bondholders who own them and has been mailing them interest checks twice a year .
Two of the active bonds are in the Museum of the City of New York , which has held them since 2001 .
They were a gift from Mr. Lebenthal , who had held them for 30 years after buying them through a broker from the Poughkeepsie Rural Cemetery .
The cemetery had gotten them from Martha B. Jones in 1914 .
She took possession of them in 1881 .
City officials declined to identify the other bondholders , citing privacy concerns , so it is hard to say how they have kept track of a flimsy piece of paper that would not pay off for several lifetimes .
But the difficulty of the task can be seen in the fact that city officials can no longer locate the heavy bound ledger in which , in neat Victorian script , their predecessors kept track of the bonds by serial number and purchaser name .
The ledger , which the city displayed as recently as 1980 , became superfluous when record keeping for the bonds was transferred to computers .
Not all the ledgers are missing : “ We do have some dating back to the early 1900s , ” Regina Fleszar , the director of investor relations for the city comptroller , wrote in an e-mail message .
“ But at the moment cannot find the one containing the 1868 bonds . ”

What is known about the bonds is that they were the handiwork of a wily 19th - century financier and a couple of cash - strapped towns that schemed to implement a public work at the expense of their wealthy , gleaming neighbor .
Gianfranco Zola and Steve Clarke are favourites to become the dream managerial duo at Chelsea after the club announced the sacking of coach Luiz Felipe Scolari .
The Brazilian coach was dismissed by the Blues today after just seven months in the Stamford Bridge hot- seat .
Scolari paid the price for a season in which Chelsea have dropped 16 home points , were bundled out of the Carling Cup by Coca - Cola championship side Burnley and slipped to fourth in the Barclays Premier League .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A statement issued by Chelsea confirmed his departure : " Luiz Felipe Scolari has been dismissed as manager of Chelsea Football Club today ( Monday ) with immediate effect .
" The Chelsea board would like to place on record our gratitude for his time as manager .
Felipe has brought many positives to the club since he joined and we all feel a sense of sadness that our relationship has ended so soon .
" Unfortunately the results and performances of the team appeared to be deteriorating at a key time in the season .
" In order to maintain a challenge for the trophies we are still competing for we felt the only option was to make the change now .
" The search for a new manager has already started and we hope to have someone in place as soon as possible .
" While that continues Assistant Coach Ray Wilkins will take charge of the team on a temporary basis . "
Scolari , looked increasingly like a man out of his depth in the Premier League and Saturday 's goalless draw with Hull only highlighted the Brazilian 's inability to get the best out of his squad .
' Big Phil ' was taunted with chants of ' You do n't know what you 're doing ' by fans who also booed the players off the pitch at the final whistle .
Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson had pointed to Chelsea 's ageing squad at the start of the campaign but the problems ran deeper than that .
After a flying start to their league season under Scolari , including nine straight away wins , the team 's confidence evaporated to such an extent that they only just overcame Southend in the FA Cup .
The Brazilian 's pedigree was undeniable at international level - but the consensus of opinion was that the 60 - year - old had been out of league football too long and found himself unable to cope with the English game .
Scolari generally under - achieved when it came to tactics and his insistence on a 4 - 3 - 3 formation was ultimately responsible for his downfall .
His treatment of a clearly demotivated Didier Drogba was also baffling during a period when the Ivorian 's pace and power would surely have been preferable to the languid efforts of the league 's top scorer Nicolas Anelka .
But perhaps the biggest clanger dropped by Chelsea this season was the decision to allow assistant coach Clarke to leave for West Ham last September .
No wonder that much of the talk among Chelsea fans already revolves around the dream ticket of Zola and Clarke .
The message on banners unfurled at Stamford Bridge on Saturday demanded the end of Scolari 's reign and the appointment of Zola and Clarke .
Chelsea have now met one half of the request , but prising the duo from West Ham will be difficult .
Zola , whose side narrowly lost to Manchester United on Sunday , insists he has no intention of walking out on the club that has provided him with a chance to manage in the English top flight .
But Chelsea may well test that resolve in the coming days as they look to appoint what will be their third manager since Jose Mourinho was axed in September 2007 .
Ahead of West Ham 's match against Manchester United , Zola maintained he was committed to his role at Upton Park .
The Italian 's lawyer , Fulvio Marrucco , released a statement insisting no approach had been made from Chelsea .
" At the moment we know nothing about the link between Gianfranco Zola and the vacant position at Chelsea , " Marrucco said in a statement reported on Sky Sports .
" Gianfranco is very happy at West Ham and still thanks them for giving him the opportunity to be a coach in the Premier League .
" It is very difficult to say if anything will happen , but Chelsea is a special place for Gianfranco Zola . "
The best league in the world is back .

He even went as far as to state that condoms " can actually increase the problem of AIDS " .
And he said all this on a trip this week to AIDS - ravaged sub-Saharan Africa .
Seriously .
If you missed it , check it out here : Pope tells Africa ' condoms wrong '
Or here : Pope wrong on condoms say Catholic groups
No Sex , No Problem
Yeah , yeah , sexual abstinence would be a great way to end the AIDS pandemic , but the reality is it has nothing to do with how actual human beings live in the real world .
Great in a pamphlet or a medieval Vatican document , not so great in the world of the living .
In fact , the Pope 's advice is a lot like Sarah Palin 's sex ed advice to her daughter : " Wait till you 're married . "
And we all know how well that worked out .
It 's also somewhat reminiscent of that great plan to defeat malaria : " Everyone stay under your malaria nets 24/7 . "
Of course , marital fidelity is obviously a good thing to preach , but the moronic , nonsensical anti-condom stance of the Catholic Church , based on its asinine doctrine against all forms of birth control , is not just ridiculous , it 's criminal .
Far from being " just his opinion " , these " lessons " actually cause real people 's real deaths in the real world , leaving real children as all - too - real orphans .
Ok , I can feel myself about to go off on a full - length rant about this buffoon , but I 've already done that recently , so I do n't need to do that again here .
Right now I just want to ask one question , which is this :
We 've sent a mission to Mars , we 've landed people on the moon , we 've cloned sheep and cows and other animals , do n't you think that we could have come up with some sort of full body - size condom to put over this guy by now ?
I mean , something to once and for all stop the awful discharges from his mind and mouth .
It 'd not only protect the people of Africa from his mindless , dangerous ramblings , but it 'd actually - like regular - size condoms - save lives .
That 's right people , how do you solve a problem like the pontiff , how do you take a conservative ideologue and quiet him down ?
Well , it 's simple really :
The man -sized condom , that 's how .
Four Solemn Questions
Now , at the end of the day , I can hear people saying , who really gives a fuck what Pope Benedict XVI thinks ?
I mean , who is this guy anyway ?
Seriously , did Jesus ever give a sermon condemning condom use as one of the great sins against God ?
I think not .
But , for those of you with a more sensitive disposition , perhaps the question is , why do I pick on poor Benny so , what with all those other equally ridiculous religious leaders spewing equally ridiculous nonsense ?
Well , the difference , clearly , is sheer influence and ability to cause harm .
The Catholic Church has over one billion members .
That 's one billion people who are supposed to obey this Benny guy 's every whim .
And that 's why he obviously deserves more attention than others when he goes off on yet another homophobic , sexist or mindless anti-condom rant .
Hope
But surely no one actually follows any of the Church 's archaic rules in the modern world , do they ?
Well , let 's just hope that Alain Fogue , an AIDS campaigner in Cameroon , is right when he says that : " The people will not follow what the Pope is saying .
He lives in heaven and we are on earth .
To claim that condoms ' aggravate ' the problem of Aids goes totally against all the efforts made by the Cameroonian government and other actors involved in the struggle against Aids in Cameroon . "
It 'd be wonderful if he were right about this .
And it'd make things so much easier if most people were , in fact , smart enough to simply ignore whatever Benny had to say as irrelevant to life in the modern world .
But , sadly , we all know that some people , ludicrous as it may seem , still think of the Pope as infallible .
You know , God 's gift to humans and all that .
But , then again , perhaps this Alain Fogue guy is n't all that far off .
According to a recent poll commissioned by Catholics for Choice : Ninety percent of Catholics in Mexico , 86 percent in Ireland , 79 percent in the United States , 77 percent in the Philippines and 59 percent in Ghana agreed with a statement in the poll that " using condoms is pro-life because it helps save lives by preventing the spread of AIDS . "
However , one noticeable thing about that poll is that the country where the fewest people agreed with the statement , Ghana , is right there in Africa .
And the 41 % who did n't agree are a very large group indeed .
There 's also a whole lot of people in those other countries surveyed that did n't agree either .
Superstition
Enough about condoms and AIDS already , but before I go I do have one last thing to say on the Benny front .
Aside from attempting to scare people off of condoms on his current trip to Africa , " His Holiness " also warned Africa 's Catholics that even though the Catholic Church in Africa is the fastest growing church in the world , it does face competition from increasingly popular evangelical movements and " the growing influence of superstitious forms of religion . "
" Superstitious forms of religion " ?
What exactly is your form of religion , Benny ?
Scientific ?
It reminds me of ( devout Christian ) Stevie Wonder 's smash ' 72 hit " Superstition " , in which he chastises everyone else for their silly superstitious beliefs , all the while never questioning his own :
" When you believe in things
That you do n't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ai n't the way "
But at least Stevie could write a killer hook .
What , I ask , has Benny got to offer anyone ?
Well , besides a quicker route to heaven , or at least death , after their AIDS - infected husbands come home and give them some good ol ' fashioned condomless loving .
Oh Benny , if you were simply a character in a comedy skit you'd be so much more useful and so totally hilarious .
Adorable even .
But as a leader - with great influence over masses of impoverished , uneducated followers - preaching impractical and unrealistic solutions that will unquestionably end up costing many more lives in AIDS - ravaged sub -Saharan Africa ( and elsewhere ) , you 're really not all that funny .
Not even slightly amusing .
Stephen Lewis : An Actual Authority
Finally , let me just say that anyone who truly cares about the fight against AIDS in Africa and wants to hear from a real authority on the issue should definitely check out Stephen Lewis and his foundation .
Now there 's a real hero for you .

Barack Obama supports a provision in the spending bill before Congress that would allow Cuban - Americans to visit relatives on the island once a year and end limits on the sale of American food and medicines in Cuba .
New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez ( D–Lunaticville ) is so outraged by this that he ’s threatening to oppose the entire bill .
And he ’s holding up two of Obama ’s science nominations ( John Holdren and Jane Lubchenco ) .
And he ’s threatening to hold his breath until his face turns blue .

What is it about Cuba that drives people into decades - long fits of insanity ?
Even JFK , the guy who instituted the Cuba embargo in the first place , thought we were all kind of crazy on the subject .
But 50 years later ?
Crazy does n’t begin to describe it .
What ’s more , it ’s a different kind of crazy from most exile communities .
What accounts for it ?
A Cuban -American congressional candidate told me last year that the difference was simple : most Cuban exiles , when they fled the island after Castro ’s takeover , left with their entire families .
So for a lot of them , there ’s literally nothing remaining there that they care about .
You could drop a nuke on Havana and they ’d be OK with that .
This promotes a different brand of insanity than in most exile communities , which might hate the current regime in their home country but still have deep personal ties to it .
I do n’t know if that ’s really the explanation or not .
Comments welcome on this score .
But there ’s got to be something that explains this .
It ’s just nuts , and Menendez should be ashamed of himself .

Scheme and Lisp force you * think * from the get - go .

Starting a program in Java or C is easy .
There ’s a pile of boilerplate you can type without thinking about it , and it `feels ’ like you ’re programming .
Then you have to haul out the bag of tools like the compiler and the linker and makefiles or ant .
There ’s a lot of busy work needed just to get going , and you feel like you ’ve accomplished something .
In Scheme or Lisp , you start it up and there you are at the REPL .
You have to decide what your program is going to do .
You ca n’t waste time writing boilerplate ( it ’s unnecessary ) , designing data structures ( just cons one and specialize it later ) , figuring out how to build complex inheritance hierarchies ( do that once you know what you are doing ) , you have to dive into the problem right away .
If you are willing to make mistakes and learn from them , then the REPL is a great place to play .
If you prefer to plan ahead so you do n’t make mistakes , a REPL is a very uncomfortable place to be .

THE Chinese government has closed Tibet to outside observers , poured security forces into the region and vowed to " crush " supporters of the Dalai Lama .
The move came before the 50th anniversary of the Dalai Lama 's flight into exile in March 1959 , triggering worries of a heavy - handed reaction to any dissent .
The local government has ordered security forces to " mobilise and fully deploy " in order to " firmly crush the savage aggression of the Dalai Lama clique , defeat separatism and maintain stability " , according to the Tibet Daily , a state newspaper .
Witnesses in Tibet reported shop closures and a heavy security presence on the streets .
China has also banned all foreigners from the region until further notice .
Tourist agencies were contacted on Tuesday by officials and told to cancel all trips for the foreseeable future .
Foreigners require a permit to enter Tibet , but Youth Travel Service , one of the largest travel agencies , said few , if any , permits were being issued .
The ban extends into some parts of the three provinces surrounding Tibet where ethnic Tibetans live .
Officials in Gansu confirmed that tourists were being turned away from Tibetan areas , and officials in Sichuan said tourists on the road to Tibet were being stopped .
In Qinghai , officials said foreigners had always been banned from areas where Tibetans live .
Last year , a peaceful demonstration to mark the date spiralled into violent riots in Tibet and the surrounding provinces .
According to the Chinese Government , 22 people were killed , but human rights groups believe the true figure is far higher .
This year , the authorities are taking no chances .
The Tibet Daily carried an editorial insisting that China " must maintain heavy pressure on criminal violators from start to finish " .

Voices of Hampshire , Voices of Divestment
The Administration at Hampshire College has issued a statement distancing itself from the movement to divest from the Israeli Occupation of Palestine , organized and led on this campus by Students for Justice in Palestine .
They claim that this move to divest has nothing to do with the Occupation of Palestine , and perhaps for them , it does not .
However , for the more than 800 students , staff , faculty , alumni and parents who have signed SJP ’s call for divestment , it has everything to do with our collective desire to see the end of the Occupation and the restoration of justice to the Palestinian people .
For us who are at the heart and forefront of this movement , we have divested specifically because of Israel ’s human rights violations and war crimes .
This is our movement , this is our divestment .
We have taken a stand against occupation , by forcing the Administration to take our money out of the offending corporations .
Regardless of whether or not they were happy to do so , regardless of whether or not they side with our stance on the Occupation .
This has been a demonstration of student power , of the power of people to organize where they are to dismantle systems of oppression .
This has been a demonstration of people ’s power , not the power of some institution or some passing administration .
This is a space to share some of the faces and voices behind the campaign to divest , the voices of the divestment , the true voices of the movement that the Administration cannot account for publicly .
We will be uploading videos of these voices periodically over the coming week .
For SJP ’s official response to the administration ’s claims , proceed here ::

The music industry 's struggle with piracy and DRM might be considered a case study in how to alienate your users and annoy your business partners .
With DRM dead and the music business still struggling to reach a stable level of income in the digital world , the big question is who 's next to experience a case of digital growing pains .
The fact that Amazon 's Kindle has produced a patent suit and DMCA takedowns in recent days might be viewed as an indication that the book publishing industry is a prime candidate , but at least some publishers appear to be taking a progressive approach to digital content .
The latest of possible progress is a series of agreements announced by online content sharing site Scribd .
Scribd offers written content through a flash - based viewing system .
Users can upload content in a variety of forms , and the site will convert it into a portable document that can be viewed in any Flash - enabled browser .
Content can also be downloaded as a PDF , and the documents can be embedded into third - party web sites — Scribd provides the code for doing so as part of the Flash interface for its content .
The company claims it handles over 50,000 new documents every day , and sees visits from over 50 million users every month .
Those numbers make it an appealing target for publishers looking to attract new readers , and Scribd recently announced that it has reached agreements with several , including Random House , Simon & Schuster , and Workman Publishing Co .
The terms of the agreements were n't disclosed , but the plan is that a variety of book material will be made available through Scribd at no cost to readers .
This material may be anything from excerpts to entire novels .
It was n't stated explicitly , but some of the accompanying literature suggests that the excerpts are likely to come from books that are selling well on their own , while full novels will be made available if they 're part of a larger series that has n't yet found an audience .
The fact that Scribd is offering the publishers this level of control over their content is part of the appeal .
In a statement announcing its participation , Simon & Schuster 's Ellie Hirschhorn said , " its unique approach provides us with the desired flexibility to determine how our content is viewed and used on a case by case basis , and is proving to be an effective tool for creating excitement for our books . "
Another part of the appeal is undoubtedly the fact that Scribd takes its potential use for copyright infringement seriously .
The company hosts a copy of a legally valid DMCA takedown notice in its support section , and it provides a mechanism for users to contest these claims .
Any text that is removed as a response to the takedown notice gets processed into a digital fingerprint that is then used for comparison whenever any new content is uploaded .
Clearly , publishers are more likely to look more favorably on Scribd than the music labels did on Napster .
But it appears that the book publishers are also recognizing that online sharing and its social aspects can be a valuable marketing tool .
" Word - of - mouth , recommendations , and ' hand - selling ' are tried and true ways to increase sales , and Scribd makes all those things possible in an extremely cost - effective , online environment , " said Matt Schwartzof Random House Publishing Group .
" Scribd offers publishers an amazing new marketing platform that will surely generate book sales . "
That 's a lesson that some in the music industry still have n't embraced .
None of this is to say that taking book publishing digital will be without its problems , as Amazon 's example demonstrates .
However , the deals with Scribd are part of what appears to be a larger effort to embrace a e-book filled future .
A spokesperson for technical publisher Springer recently told Ars that it had amassed an e-book library of 40,000 titles over the last three years , and was on pace to add over 5,000 more annually going forward .
Publishers are also experimenting with other modes of distribution .
Shortcovers seems to provide the similar features to Scribd , but is focused on mobile reading ‐at launch , dedicated applications were available for the iPhone , Blackberry , and Android platforms .
All of this suggests that book publishers are not anxious to find themselves with the same list of problems faced by their peers in the music business .
Mr Trump has resisted plans to force the firm into Chapter 11 bankruptcy
Trump Entertainment Resorts , the casino group founded by Donald Trump , has filed for bankruptcy protection in the face of multi-billion dollar debts .
Also hit by falling revenues , the petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection said the firm had debts of $ 1.7bn ( £ 1.2bn ) as of 31 December 2008 .
Trump Entertainment missed a $ 53 m interest payment due on 1 December .
Donald Trump announced his resignation from the firm 's board last week , due to disagreement with bondholders .
Mr Trump said in a statement that he was leaving amid " internal turmoil " that was being " compounded by dramatically deteriorating revenues " .
He said that the company represented less than 1 % of his net worth , and that " my investment in it is worthless to me now " .
According to reports , Mr Trump had resisted bondholders ' plans to force the firm into Chapter 11 .
Previous bankruptcies
Chapter 11 protection gives US businesses time to rearrange their finances while continuing to trade , protected from their creditors .
Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts , the predecessor of Trump Entertainment Resorts , filed for bankruptcy in November 2004 , trying to restructure $ 1.8 bn in debt .
A month earlier , Mr Trump struck a deal with bondholders to cut his stake in the firm , but preserve his role as chairman and chief executive .
The company emerged from bankruptcy in 2005 .
In 1992 , Trump 's Atlantic City casinos filed for Chapter 11 after buckling under the weight of $ 1bn in debt .
He later regained control of those properties .
Moq is a popular mocking library for .
NET .
Version 3.0 RTM has been released and is available for download .
Moq 's popularity has grown as mocking has become mainstream in .NET , in part because Moq is designed for developers who are new to mocking or may be writing their own custom mock objects .
Moq does not use the classic record / reply idiom and instead lets testers set behavioral expectations , often through lambda expressions , and intercepts mock object calls by utilizing Castle DynamicProxy .
Moq 3.0 represents a major new release , with the following notable changes :
Silverlight Support
A separate binary is available that is fully compatible with Silverlight .
New simplified event raising syntax
Example : mock .
Raise ( foo => foo .
MyEvent += null , new MyArgs ( ... ) ) ;
Support for custom event signatures ( not compatible with EventHandler )
Example : mock .
Raise ( foo => foo .
MyEvent += null , arg1 , arg2 , arg3 ) ; Improved property setter behavior
Example : mock .VerifySet ( foo => foo .
Value = " foo " ) ; Additional sample application code
ASP .NET MVC application also updated to work with latest version Better integration with Pex Previously , Pex would spend effort analyzing the Moq library code , trying to understand the internals of Moq framework .
In 3.0 release , Pex attributes have used to shut down the Pex monitoring for certain areas of Moq which are n't relevant to the code under test .
To help get started with Moq , browse the convenient API documentation or find one of the many getting started guides , like Justin Etheredge 's ( C# MVP ) recent series on Beginning Mocking with Moq 3 .
honest question
We got stuck going to a church for some wedding and this priest Guy took my son somewhere without telling me , Now hes got a stain of jesus juice ( my son says the priest inserted some straw thing he had in his pocket in his mouth and told him to suck )
Question is , what will get this Jesus Juice stain out ?
It seems as though every year , around the time of hotel registration for Comic - Con International , people start clamoring for the con to move from San Diego to Las Vegas .
More hotel rooms !
A bigger convention center !
Gambling !
Strippers !
It makes me want to headdesk .
Now , I do n’t hate Vegas .
I ’m not ZOMG in love with it , but I ’ve been there more than once and I do n’t think it should be removed from the face of the earth .
What I believe about Vegas is that it is a law and a destination unto itself , and that everyone should be able to choose whether they go based on the merits of the place , not on the merits of what else might be going on there that is n’t a usual part of the location .
Please keep this in mind as I present my list of Reasons Not to Move CCI to Las Vegas :
1. Weather .
San Diego may be incredibly hot some years , but it ’s coastal .
There are breezes a lot of the time , and it ’s often quite bearable .
Vegas is inland desert and is 99 % guaranteed to be nasty hot in July / August .
Part of the crazy fun of CCI is seeing costumes on the street , which would become darn near impossible for a lot of people given the temperature .
2. Distance .
I ’m not talking about the distance for people to get there ( though I will in a bit ) , but the distance between things .
It can take over half an hour to get from the front door of one hotel to the front door of the next one over .
In San Diego , it ’s pretty easy to leave the convention center , go find food that ’s not jacked up in price for an inferior product , and come back .
In Vegas , unless you take the monorail , that ’s a pipe dream , especially given that the convention center is off the Strip and not really near a lot of hotels .
Keep reading for more .
3 . No public transportation .
Well , not NO transportation .
There ’s the monorail , and there are buses .
But the monorail only goes down one side of the Strip , and the traffic on the Strip itself , where the buses run , is a nightmare 24 / 7 .
The monorail is not convenient to get to ; it runs down the backs of the hotels , and getting to the stations from the street , or vice versa , can take 20 minutes just by itself .
( We timed . )
Lots of hotels do have shuttle service , but it ’s not huge , it ’s not universal , and it ’s not fantastic .
Based on the masses of humanity I ’ve seen at the SD Old Town trolley station , I doubt the monorail has enough cars to pack the schedule as full as they ’d need to , and I doubt the shuttles will satisfy fans wanting to get to places at specific times .
There would need to be charter buses , the way SD does it , but because this is Vegas , they would want either tickets or tips … probably both .
Which brings me to :
4. Pay For Play .
In Vegas , the dollar is still almighty .
You can get a hotel room for $ 50 a night if you play it right , sure , but you do n’t get the perks that identify you to the hotel ’s amenities providers as a Good Customer .
In some places , if you just want people to be polite to you , you have to pay them .
In others , you just get dirty looks if you do n’t tip .
It ’s been said that CCI would n’t make a dent in the normal daily Vegas people - traffic ; if that ’s true , then we ’d all be running into this .
Think it ’s maddening to get slow service because a restaurant in the Gaslamp is full , or because you think you ’ve been pegged as a low tipper ?
Try being in Vegas where they know whether you have spare change .
Does n’t matter if the place has only two parties in the section ; if one of them is a Vegas regular and has paid to be part of their Premier Club , he ’ll always get better service than the other party .
I ’m imagining the cheaper hotel restaurants being overrun with congoers who do n’t understand the ethos ( if you can even call it that ) ; the saddest part is that if they voice any displeasure , they simply wo n’t be heard because all that ’s happened is that they ’ve run into how Vegas deals with those they perceive as cheapskates .
They discourage you from coming back until you ’re ready to spend .
And ,
5. Everything costs more .
More accurately , it ’s a case of the substandard being cheaper and the quality merchandise being more expensive .
You can get a lot of pure crap for very little money , but you have to be willing to accept really crappy crap .
Most stores are either souvenir dives or designer boutiques .
I ’d bet even the toothbrushes in most of the dives are emblazoned with “ LAS VEGAS . ”
And the food .
Every megahotel in the vicinity of the Strip has a restaurant hierarchy .
There is at least one posh place , one just a bit below it , one just a bit below that , a buffet , a theme bar , and a taco / burger / coffee stand .
Most of the “ nice ” restaurants in SD are comparable in price to the lowest - price nice places in Vegas , and there are n’t nearly as many tony upscale spots .
Not only that , but the cheap places are much greater in number in SD , and easier to get to ( see # 2 and 3 above ) .
If there are more restaurants in a megahotel , there is usually a theme place that may be either very posh or very casual , followed by a doubling of one of the lower - priced ranks .
They ’ll also have bars around the casino floor (s ) , and occasionally a cookie or ice - cream shop .
If the hotel is not a new “ mega ” type , they ’ll have a coffee shop and a nice place , and some coffee / ice cream / burgers .
The Stratosphere is the best for cheap eats , but it ’s not close to anything .
( The biggest souvenir shop in the city does n’t count . )
And at the other end of the Strip , the MGM Grand is n’t bad for it either , though their counter service is tucked away into the winding halls at the back of the place .
Sure , there ’s fast food dotted around here and there , but chances are that you ’re not going to want to make the 45 - minute trek to the McDonald ’s when you can go a monorail stop away and find the cheap food in the hotels on the monorail line .
Which will be mobbed , because nobody ’s going to want to take the time to hike across the street and hunt through a megahotel for something they can afford .
Actually , there is one thing that does n’t cost more : alcohol .
Three guesses why .
6 . No commuting .
To those who come in from , say , Virginia , this may not sound like a big deal .
But it ’s just plain fact : there are fewer people living within 2 hours ’ drive of Vegas than within 2 hours ’ drive of SD .
With the con in SD , people can even stay with friends ( or in cheaper hotels ) in LA , OC , or even Riverside , and take a train or other mass conveyance into town for the con .
Not so easy in Vegas .
Which means that a lot more people would be staying in town , filling up services and probably driving up hotel prices out of sheer demand .
Another consideration : Hollywood is not close enough to Vegas for big - name stars to come out by bus for just one day .
There ’d have to be planes involved , or hotel stays ; and with the way insurance works , the cost might be too great for the perceived benefit … especially considering how many lowlifes decide it ’s their right and privilege to post exclusive footage to YouTube five minutes after it ’s been aired .
Dragon * Con suggests that there would still be plenty of star power , but such things as bringing in large portions of new movies ’ casts might become much less feasible .
In the interest of fairness , there are a few reasons Vegas would be superior to SD for a giant con of any type :
1A . Parking .
Vegas has parking .
Acres of it , all over the place , for a lot less than you pay in SD .
Anyone driving in would be able to park , for as long as they wanted , probably even wherever they wanted .
Then again , # 6 above might mean fewer people wanting to park in the first place .
2A . More floor space .
The LVCC has nearly four times the floor space of the SD facility .
To someone who ’s been stuck in foot traffic on the floor at least once every year , this sounds like absolute heaven .
Even if the con used only half the floor space available , prospects might be a little brighter for those of us slogging through the whole thing .
On the flip side , they do n’t have much more in the way of meeting room space ; chances are , there ’d be a bunch of exhibit space being used as the equivalent of Ballroom 20 and the 6A - F rooms .
I ’m not sure from the floor plan whether any of the large floor divisions is set up to be the equivalent of Hall H ; I may need Meeting Matrix to find out .
( Because only a meeting planner could ever possibly have a legitimate desire to know the details of the center . )
Also , there are multiple small convention / event centers in Vegas ; one of these could easily be used for , say , an exclusive screening of something at night .
Ticket sales for 12,000 seats in the Mandalay Bay center would probably cover the rental cost and the rights , with some left over for the Cause of the Day .
3A . More hotel rooms .
The Vegas visitor site boasts “ over 140,000 hotel rooms , ” which sounds fantastic .
Throw in the fact that many congoers share rooms , and you have a recipe for much easier reservations than can be had in SD .
Downside : the same room can vary in price by as much as $ 300 from Tuesday to Friday night , so you can bet they ’ll be picking a more middling point on their scale for con-block reservations .
And this is Vegas , so see # 5 above .
They ’re going to do everything in their power to be sure their Premier Club regulars are able to get rooms if they want them .
If Las Vegas wants CCI , it ’s in the way Irvine wants a university : they want the benefits without having the necessary people around .
Congoers for CCI , by and large , are not well - heeled yuppies with expense accounts , and we are not there to spend our money at the blackjack tables .
The Vegas I know is not enthusiastic about our kind of congoer overrunning its streets and its bars , and it has a much higher threshold for good financial behavior than San Diego — where we already fall short .
Let ’s do ourselves a favor and start looking for better solutions to the crunch .

After hearing some fairly positive reviews of the new version of the Amazon Kindle , I decided to “ bite the bullet ” and pay the $ 359.00 fee for the Amazon Kindle 2 .
The new version of the Kindle does n’t come with a protective case , so that will easily add $ 29.99 to your total .
If you want the device to ship in a reasonable amount of time and have it sometime within the next couple of weeks , you ’ll probably want to opt for two day shipping .
When all was said and done , my total bill was $ 411.96 , ouch !
That seems like a bit of a hefty price tag for a product that Amazon bills as a “ money saving ” device .
Will Amazon ’s Kindle actually pay for itself ?
The Kindle is priced at a whopping $ 359.00 primarily because it includes lifetime access to its “ WhisperNet ” wireless network ( which actually piggyback ’s off Sprint ’s cellular network ) .
This is a very high up - front fee , but the average cost per book is lower on the Kindle than comparing to a new paperback or hardcover book .
Typically , you can get a new book on the Amazon Kindle for $ 9.99 , whereas a new paper - back will likely go for $ 14.99 whereas a new hardcover book will run for $ 24.99 .
I would argue that the real figure that people typically pay for a new book is probably a lot less than the $ 20.00 average between a hard - cover and paperback book because many people tend to buy books used , get them from friends , or from a local library .
With the Amazon Kindle , that ’s simply not an option .
For argument ’s sake let ’s say that the average new book does cost $ 19.99 , that means you ’ll save $ 10.00 per book that you buy on the Kindle that you did n’t buy in paperback or hardcover form .
That means you ’ll have to buy 36 books before the Kindle becomes “ worth it . ”
The typical American reads less than two books per year and one in four Americans do n’t read a single book in any given year .
For the “ average ” reader , it would take decades for the Kindle to pay for itself , however most people who but an Amazon Kindle will read much more than what an average reader will consume .
A reasonable number would be more on the lines of 10 to 15 books a year for a casual to a moderate reader .
This means that the Kindle would pay for itself in 2.5 to 3 years .
The “ return on investment ” for a Kindle is n’t particularly stunning , but it ’s still a fun gadget to get , just do n’t persuade yourself that you ’re going to be saving a “ ton of money ” by getting more affordable books .
The mathematics really do n’t work out , especially if you tend to buy used books or get them for free from friends , family and the local library .
It has been said that politics is the second oldest profession .
I have learned that it bears a striking resemblance to the first .

WASHINGTON -
The unmanned bombers that frequently cause unintended civilian casualties in Pakistan are a step toward an even more lethal generation of robotic hunters - killers that operate with limited , if any , human control .
The Defense Department is financing studies of autonomous , or self - governing , armed robots that could find and destroy targets on their own .
On - board computer programs , not flesh - and - blood people , would decide whether to fire their weapons .
" The trend is clear : Warfare will continue and autonomous robots will ultimately be deployed in its conduct , " Ronald Arkin , a robotics expert at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta , wrote in a study ( . pdf ) commissioned by the Army .
" The pressure of an increasing battlefield tempo is forcing autonomy further and further toward the point of robots making that final , lethal decision , " he predicted .
" The time available to make the decision to shoot or not to shoot is becoming too short for remote humans to make intelligent informed decisions . "
Autonomous armed robotic systems probably will be operating by 2020 , according to John Pike , an expert on defense and intelligence matters and the director of the security Web site GlobalSecurity.org in Washington .
This prospect alarms experts , who fear that machines will be unable to distinguish between legitimate targets and civilians in a war zone .
" We are sleepwalking into a brave new world where robots decide who , where and when to kill , " said Noel Sharkey , an expert on robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield , England .
Human operators thousands of miles away in Nevada , using satellite communications , control the current generation of missile - firing robotic aircraft , known as Predators and Reapers .
Armed ground robots , such as the Army 's Modular Advanced Armed Robotic System , also require a human decision - maker before they shoot .
As of now , about 5,000 lethal and nonlethal robots are deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Besides targeting Taliban and al Qaida leaders , they perform surveillance , disarm roadside bombs , ferry supplies and carry out other military tasks .
So far , none of these machines is autonomous ; all are under human control .
The Pentagon 's plans for its Future Combat System envision increasing levels of independence for its robots .
" Fully autonomous engagement without human intervention should also be considered , under user - defined conditions , " said a 2007 Army request for proposals to design future robots .

For example , the Pentagon says that air - to - air combat may happen too fast to allow a remote controller to fire an unmanned aircraft 's weapons .
" There is really no way that a system that is remotely controlled can effectively operate in an offensive or defensive air - combat environment , " Dyke Weatherington , the deputy director of the Pentagon 's unmanned aerial systems task force , told a news conference on Dec. 18 , 2007 .
" The requirement for that is a fully autonomous system , " he said .
" That will take many years to get to . "
Many Navy warships carry the autonomous , rapid - fire Phalanx system , which is designed to shoot down enemy missiles or aircraft that have penetrated outer defenses without waiting for a human decision - maker .
At Georgia Tech , Arkin is finishing a three - year Army contract to find ways to ensure that robots are used in appropriate ways .
His idea is an " ethical governor " computer system that would require robots to obey the internationally recognized laws of war and the U.S. military 's rules of engagement .
" Robots must be constrained to adhere to the same laws as humans or they should not be permitted on the battlefield , " Arkin wrote .
For example , a robot 's computer " brain " would block it from aiming a missile at a hospital , church , cemetery or cultural landmark , even if enemy forces were clustered nearby .
The presence of women or children also would spark a robotic no -no .
Arkin contends that a properly designed robot could behave with greater restraint than human soldiers in the heat of battle and cause fewer casualties .
" Robots can be built that do not exhibit fear , anger , frustration or revenge , and that ultimately behave in a more humane manner than even human beings in these harsh circumstances , " he wrote .
Sharkey , the British critic of autonomous armed robots , said that Arkin 's ethical governor was " a good idea in principle .
Unfortunately , it 's doomed to failure at present because no robots or AI ( artificial intelligence ) systems could discriminate between a combatant and an innocent .
That sensing ability just does not exist . "
Selmer Bringsjord , an artificial intelligence expert at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , N.Y. , is worried , too .
" I 'm concerned .
The stakes are very high , " Bringsjord said .
" If we give robots the power to do nasty things , we have to use logic to teach them not to do unethical things .
If we can't figure this out , we should n't build any of these robots . "
When gunmen attacked the Sri Lankan cricket team in broad daylight , they struck in the heart of the most cosmopolitan city in Pakistan .
Now the residents of Lahore fear that the religious violence that blights other regions has taken root on their own doorstep .
Their bleak mood is the latest sign of the times in a troubled country .
Jason Burke , Isaam Ahmed and Saeed Shah in Lahore report
There are old pistols and bulls ' heads on the walls , live country and western music , waiters dressed as cowboys .
The Gun Smoke restaurant could be anywhere in the world - but this is the exclusive Gulberg district in Lahore .
The whisky bottles are filled with tea .
In the Islamic republic of Pakistan , there are only " mocktails " to wash the burgers down .
Hassan " Jimmy " Khan is singing Johnny Cash .
A 22 - year - old economics student with a hippy beard and floppy hair , he has always lived in Lahore : " I love it , I would n't live anywhere else . "
Here , amid the drinkers and diners in jeans and shirts , last week 's terrorist attack on the visiting Sri Lankan cricket team , even though it took place less than a mile away , is forgotten .
Asher Mian , a 31 - year - old accountant had brought his wife and toddler daughter to Gun Smoke .
" That 's the beauty of Lahore .
People carry on , " he said .
The attack , in which six policemen and a driver died , has provoked scenes unprecedented in Pakistan .
Even after bloodier previous attacks , no one lit candles on the scarred bomb sites .
The mundane roundabout where the Lahore killings occurred has been converted into a makeshift shrine - both to the dead and to the end of the idea that somehow this city of 10 million would be spared the violence racking the rest of the Pakistan .
This weekend , hundreds of bunches of flowers lay piled up before a poster , issued by the police , that reads : " We are in pain : no more bloodshed . "
Lahore has never been like the rest of Pakistan .
It has always been known as the most cultural , tolerant , and cosmopolitan of the nation 's major cities .
Karachi , the vast port in the south , faces the Gulf , Peshawar is turned towards central Asia .
But Lahore , with its Mughal architecture , teeming bazaars and canals , remains very much part of the subcontinent .
The city is home both to vast slums and the headquarters of the Pakistan 's biggest political Islamist movement , and to lively cafés , galleries , cultural centres , fashion shows , interior designers ' studios and even a thriving gay scene .
Parties thrown by the young Lahori elite have a reputation for daring even among blasé Karachi socialites .
Gastronomy is part of life , as is cinema .
Lahore is home to the Pakistani film industry : Lollywood .
Kamiar Rokni , one of Pakistan 's leading clothes designers , is a fixture in the city high - life .
The 32 - year - old told the Observer last week that Lahore is the " cultural hub " of Pakistan .
" Lahore has always been a city where individuality has been embraced .
It 's been a safe city for such a long time , people have always gone about their business and not felt afraid ...
So the attack on the cricketers is unfathomable . '
Others spoke of the shame of such a breach of traditions of hospitality .
" In Pakistan , you do everything for your guests .
Your guests are first priority .
Even if you go hungry , they must eat , " Ghulam Ali , a student , said .
" Now we wo n't see any more cricket teams for the next 10 to 15 years .
Forget cricket teams : no foreigners will visit . "
And that , all agree , would be an immense blow to the spirit of the city .
Sonnu Rahman , an 82 - year - old history teacher and life - long Lahore resident , said that over centuries " all the different creeds and religions ... the Hindus , the Sikhs , Muslims , Christians ... got absorbed in this wonderful soil of ours " .
" Even now , left to themselves , the people of Lahore are tolerant , " she said .
" It 's just that they are used by these blasted politicians . "
It is not as if Lahore has never suffered before .
There have been a series of attacks over recent years .
More than 20 were killed when a police building was bombed a year ago .
A series of explosions at the city 's theatres , juice bars ( targeted for being " dating spots " ) and threats to DVD markets to stop selling supposedly " pornographic " movies revealed a rising tide of local religious vigilantism .
But this most recent attack has brought home to the city - and the country as a whole - how bad things have got .
" After Benazir Bhutto was assassinated [ in December 2007 ] we thought it could not get any worse , ' said Dr Farzana Shaikh , an analyst at London 's Chatham House think tank .
" But it has .
We wo n't see a dramatic explosion or implosion .
We will just see bits of the country drifting out of government control . "
Though Pakistan has repeatedly shown a resilience that has astonished those who repeatedly predict its imminent failure as a state - few other nations could have absorbed an economic crash , the assassination of its best - known political leader , a secessionist insurgency and a wave of religious militant violence in the space of 18 months without disintegrating - the international community is now deeply concerned for the future .
Last week , an American diplomat said openly what government analysts around the world have long said privately : Pakistan , with its crashing economy , nuclear arms and raging Islamic militant insurgency , is of greater concern than Afghanistan .
The logic is simple : you can lose Afghanistan and still keep Pakistan , but the reverse is not true .
When the violence stays far away in the North West Frontier Province - seven policemen died in a car bomb yesterday , a local mayor was killed on Friday - the impact is less .
On the Afghan border , though some areas are being clawed back from their hands , vast areas are still under the de facto rule of the " Pakistani Taliban " .
Last month , the NWFP government agreed a truce with Islamic militants that will see a rigorous version of sharia law imposed in the Swat valley , just three hours drive from Islamabad , the capital .
But it is the major attacks on high - profile targets close to the centres of cultural or political power that strike home - such as that on the Marriott hotel in Islamabad last year or this week 's spectacular daylight raid on the cricketers - that shock and stun .
Sehr , who recently left New York to return to Lahore , says the sense of danger is now more imminent than before .
" Now that I 've come back , everyone is talking about how they want to leave , " she said .
" My parents say things are n't that bad , that there 's always been instability .
They hark back to the war in 1971 or General Zia 's era , and say things are n't so bad .
Pakistan has survived for 61 years so it'll keep on surviving , they say . [ But ] I feel anxious , to be honest . "
The international community is equally worried about the economy and internal political stability .
The recent $ 7.6 bn International Monetary Fund bail - out has provided some temporary relief , but grave structural problems remain unaddressed .
" The IMF agreement is first aid , but not a solution , " said Dr Kaiser Bengali , a respected Pakistani economist .
" The coming 12 months will be particularly bad .
Our banks are barely integrated into the global system , so the crisis has n't hit us yet .
But half our exports go to the European Union or America , and we are looking at mass lay - offs .
The textile industry is already devastated . "
Pakistan 's economic development over recent decades has been uneven , with the Punjab , with Lahore as its capital , far outstripping the rest of the country .
The economic downturn will have massive political and social consequences .
" The central Punjab now has a developed industrial base and a strong middle class .
A huge divide has emerged , which is reflected in current political battle lines , " Bengali said .
Last week saw the first major skirmishes in what is likely to be a vicious , long and destabilising contest between opposition leader Nawaz Sharif , whose Pakistan Muslim League faction 's power base is the industrial and commercial middle classes of the Punjab , and the ruling Pakistan People 's Party and president Asif Ali Zardari , the husband of slain leader Benazir Bhutto , whose support is drawn from poorer and more rural provinces .
A truce that started before the relatively free and fair elections of 2008 has long broken down and senior Sharif loyalists now believe the time is right to capitalise on their leader 's popularity , proved in repeated polls .
The first shots in this new struggle came when the highly politicised supreme court barred Sharif and his brother from office , in effect imposing direct administrative rule on the Punjab .
Sharif is to use scheduled massive demonstrations by lawyers this week to pressure the government as negotiations between the rivals get under way .
Many expect street violence and huge disruption .
Lawyers have long been demanding that Zardari rescind the draconian orders firing senior judges issued by former president General Pervez Musharaf .
" This so - called democratic government has n't lived up to its promises .
The government is afraid of what an independent supreme court might do , " said Munir Malik , a senior lawyer and leader of the movement .
" We will march on the capital to demand the rule of law and the constitution . "
The international community is also disappointed by the apparent inefficiency of Zardari 's government .
The alternatives , however , are unappealing .
Sharif 's popularity is in part based on his social and religious conservatism , a far more authentic expression of the views and identity of most Pakistanis than the views and lifestyle of the much more Westernised , secular Zardari .
Sharif is increasingly viewed as the man most likely to be able to bring a measure of stability to the country 's chaotic politics .
American and British diplomats have thus made explicit efforts to build links to the Sharif camp .
" Pragmatism is the order of the day , " said one UK diplomat .
Even the recent violence in Lahore has become politicised .
As a small band of flag - waving , slogan chanting PML - N supporters drove round the memorial at the attack site on Friday , many locals waved in support .
Hadayatullah , a juice - shop owner , blames Zardari and embattled Punjab governor Salman Taseer , running the province now that the Sharif brothers have been barred from power .
There are charges that the chaos following the ouster of the local provincial government led to security lapses .
The hunt for the killers is still going on .
Early clues point to outlawed militant groups such as Laskhar - e - Toiba ( LeT ) and Lashkar - e - Jhangvi , both of which have links to security services and have carried out such " raids " in the past .
LeT members are prime suspects for November 's spectacular assault in Mumbai .
However a spokesman denied involvement in last week 's attack .
Yesterday investigators in Lahore said that the most likely thesis was " one of our home - grown groups with a possible al - Qaida link " .
Though authorities say they have now identified the attackers , they have released scant details beyond sketches .
All that is currently known is that militants melted into the huge and sprawling city after the attack .
It may be some time before they are caught - if ever .
At midnight , the last remaining stragglers are saying good - bye to their friends outside Lahore 's Al - Hamra
Theatre complex , a local landmark , having enjoyed a local Punjabi latnguage commercial drama , A Nest of Sparrows
The theatre is known for plays ranging from high - brow Urdu classics such as Toba Tek Singh and Hotel Mohenjedaro to Punjabi stage dramas full of raucous humour and suggestive dance moves popular with the working class .
Recently , female dancers were ordered to cover up and theatre timings were shifted to earlier in the evening in an effort to encourage more families to attend and to pre-empt criticism from religious extremists .
The measures did not prevent bombs going off at two theatres last month .
Irfan , a parking attendant at the theatre , says the violence is bad for business .
" We do n't get paid our salaries on time any more ; it 's hard to pay the rent now , " he says .
His monthly wages come to Rs6000 ( £ 55 ) , a quarter of which goes toward renting a cramped apartment .
Irfan says that , since Lahore 's theatres changed their timings , the number of customers has declined to almost a third .
" Earlier , at 2 am we'd have 200 bikes and cars parked here .
Now , we have 40 people on a good night . "
Down on Gawal Mandi , known popularly as " Food Street " , bright lights illuminate the hawkers ' stalls and the cafés .
It is a popular venue for rich and poor to indulge the locals ' love affair with food .
" In Lahore , the families make their lunch plans while having breakfast , and their dinner plans while having lunch , " said Nadeem Ashraf , a jovial vendor at one tikka - shop .
But Ashraf , too , has noticed a downturn .
" The times are bad ; people are afraid to come out , " he says .
" It 's these terrorists .
Things are n't the same any more .
Lahoris used to to be more genial , always meeting each other , always celebrating festivals with a great fuss .
Culturally , things are changing . "
Rickshaw driver Shahid shrugged when asked who was to blame for the attacks .
" Educated people know better who it could be , " he said .
" Maybe [ security ] agencies , maybe politicians , a lot of people blame [ Indian intelligence ] .
But to the poor , it 's all the same , We have to feed our families , electricity rates are up , bread prices are up .
It 's the poor who suffer . "
The Terror Toll

Bamboo Flooring as an Alternative to Traditional Hardwood
If you are interested in a sustainable hardwood flooring option for your home then you must consider bamboo .
It ’s easy to clean and has anti-microbial properties so you know it will be around for a long time .
Bamboo is a fast - growing grass that is renewable , durable , and attractive .
It is an excellent alternative to tree wood because bamboo can grow wood faster than any tree .
Because bamboo is a rapid growing grass and not wood , it can be harvested every 5 - 7 years , unlike 15 - 100 years for many tree wood .
This makes bamboo an extremely environmentally friendly product for flooring .
A variety of bamboos products can be found in the market today .
We recommend ‘ strand woven bamboo ’ which is made by weaving together strands of bamboo grass .
The weaving process eliminates the needs for glues and formaldehydes that release toxic fumes into the environment over time .

So you know how dejected liberals threatened after 2000 and 2004 to " move to Canada " to be in more ideologically friendly territory ?
I was n't with that crowd , of course .
I was n't about to give up on this great nation of ours .
But that has long had me thinking : where would conservatives go if they wanted to escape this horrible SOCIALIST America , what with the 39 percent top rate and HEALTH CARE for all ( assuming we ever get it ) ?
Iran ?
They 'd love the theocracy , with a bona fide morality police to beat the crap out of non-believers !
But the country worships the wrong god .
So close ...
Russia ?
It 's got the oligarchy thing that conservatives love , plus a war - mongering leadership that dreams of empire .
Too bad they do n't speak American , or even use American letters in their alphabet !
Singapore ?
Unfettered capitalism , English as an official language , and a caning if you chew gum on the streets .
Oh , and jail if you get caught being gay .
It 's conservative nirvana !
Well , except that people are Asian .
If only they'd be whiter .

A playground for the rich , but with the oppressive hand of religion to stamp out all fun .
Still the wrong god , though .
Any other suggestions ?
Talk of filibustering the president ’s judicial picks is back -- even before Barack Obama has nominated anyone to the federal courts .
When the balance of power shifts in Washington , views on the virtues of filibustering tend to shift with it .
Four years ago , the Senate Republican majority faulted the minority Democrats for threatening what they deemed an “ unconstitutional filibuster ” of President Bush ’s court nominees .
Democrats then said they saw the filibuster as a needed check on extremism from the majority .
Now , both parties are adjusting their perspectives .
In the Senate , the filibuster rule allows talk to prevent action .
It takes 60 votes , not just a 51 - vote majority , to cut off debate and bring about a vote .
In a letter to President Obama last week , the 41 Senate Republicans described choosing judges as a “ shared constitutional responsibility . ”
They recommended that Obama renominate three of Bush ’s failed nominees : Peter Keisler , Glen E. Conrad and Paul Diamond .
Advertisement
And if Obama and the Democrats do not obtain GOP senators ’ approval of court nominees in their home states , “ the Republican conference will be unable to support moving forward on that nominee , ” the letter said .
For veterans of the wars over judges , this looked to be an opening salvo .
“ Threatening filibusters of yet - to - be - named judicial nominees . . . is not a good sign , ” said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy ( D - Vt. ) .
Nan Aron , president of the liberal Alliance for Justice , saw the Republicans as undergoing “ a miraculous transformation .
Having sought to do away with the filibuster during the Bush administration , they are now threatening to use it at the first opportunity , ” she said .
“ I ’d say they are trying to intimidate the Obama administration and to galvanize their base . ”
Advertisement
“ The Republicans are doing everything in their power to cement their reputation as the ‘ Party of No , ’ ” added Kathryn Kolbert , president of People for the American Way .
Some conservatives , however , were cheered by the Republicans ’ early move .
“ The letter is a remarkable show of strength and resolve on the matter of judges .
I was encouraged that all 41 [ GOP ] senators signed it , ” said Wendy E. Long , counsel for the Judicial Confirmation Network .
“ This says they are ready to give intense scrutiny when extreme folks are being nominated . ”
Both sides agree that the issue of judges has an outsized importance to the parties ’ base constituencies , even if it is not a top concern of most Americans .
Advertisement
“ Our polls show that judges is a good issue -- a huge winning issue for Republicans , ” Long said .
“ Obama won the election , but the American people do n’t agree with the Obama standard for judges . ”
During his eight years in office , Bush appointed 328 judges to the federal courts .
This was third - most of any president , behind Presidents Reagan ( 384 ) and Clinton ( 379 ) .
There now are 67 vacancies on the federal district and appellate courts .
Obama is expected to make his first set of nominations in April .
Still , some Republicans say they are not ready to use the filibuster threat .
Advertisement
“ Most conservatives feel we should stick with the principle that every nominee should get an up - and - down vote , ” said Curt Levey , executive director of the Committee for Justice , a group that lobbies for conservative nominees .
“ They want the Senate courtesies to be respected . ”
During the Bush era , Republicans repeatedly said the president ’s nominees deserved a vote on the Senate floor .
However , Levey said , the GOP ’s reluctance to consider filibusters could change quickly .
It “ will change if [ Democrats ] try to jam through judicial activists , ” he said .
Four years ago , the Republican majority came close to abolishing the filibuster rule .
With Vice President Dick Cheney in the Senate president ’s chair , they planned to change rules so judges could be approved by a simple majority .
Opponents called this the “ nuclear option ” in the overheated rhetoric of the time .
The dispute was defused when a bipartisan group of 14 senators , including John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , brokered a deal that cleared the way for several of Bush ’s disputed nominees to win confirmation .

The filibuster survived it all , an outcome the Republicans could find valuable in an era of Democratic dominance .

攻撃に使えるセキュリティ・ホールはどうやって見つけるのだろうか。
攻撃対象アプリケーションのリバース・エンジニアリングから始める者がいる一方で，もっと安易な方法を選ぶ者もいる。安易な方法の一つが，Webサーフィンだ。
「 ゼロディ攻撃のため にWebサーフィンするとは，どういう意味だ？」と不思議に思うだろう。
攻撃者たち は 「問題にぶつかったアプリケーション開発者が，疑問をオンライン・フォーラムに投稿して助けを求める」と知っているのだ。
開発者の投稿には， 「 こんなことやあんなことをしたら，Webブラウザがクラッシュする」といった内容のものがある。何らかのアプリケーションなどを「クラッシュ」させるコードを投稿する者も現れる。自分の投稿がセキュリティに悪影響を及ぼしかねないことなど，こうした開発者は理解していない。
ところが攻撃者たちはそのことをよく知っている。セキュリティ・ホールを探す際に使うお気に入りのやり方だ。
フォーラム投稿記事記事を見た攻撃者が，実際に機能するエクスプロイトを作る手順を紹介しよう。
あるゲーム関連フォーラムで，「 Caveman」というハンドルのメンバーが上記コードを投稿した。Cavemanによると，このスクリプトで他人のパソコンを「クラッシュ」させることに成功したという。
なお，米ウェブセンスのセキュリティ・ラボでは，悪質なコードを見付けるためにさまざまなWebサイトを監視/分析している。こうした活動を通じ，ある悪質なWebサイトのWebページで，このフォーラムに投稿された上記JavaScriptコードが使われているのを見付けた。
このコードの意味は分かるだろうか。
この攻撃者は ，Webブラウザのヒープ・メモリーにシェルコードを書き込み，ゲーム関連フォーラムで見付けた可能性のある「width="9999999 " height = " 9999999 " 」というセキュリティ・ホールを突き，Webブラウザに対してヒープ破壊（コラプション）攻撃を仕掛ける。こうしてシェルコード実行に導き，そのマシンを自分のものにしようとする。
この攻撃は，パソコンを 「クラッシュ」させるだけでは済まない。
我々は，このシェルコードの動作に疑問を持った。そこで，同シェルコードを簡単にC言語化し，ペイロードを実行してみた。
このペイロードを実行すると，パソコンはEthernetの28876番ポートを監視するようになった。
何を監視しているのか調べようとこのポートにtelnet接続したところ，答えが判明した。パソコンのシェル（コマンド・プロンプト）画面が現れたのだ。
つまり，パソコンが乗っ取られて一巻の終わりだ。

Hi , everyone , I wanted to give you a quick heads up that a new PSP firmware update , v5.03 , will be released soon .
This is a small update that improves system software stability during use of some features .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A precise , new nanotechnology treatment for drug addiction may be on the horizon as the result of research conducted at the University at Buffalo .
Scientists in UB 's Institute for Lasers , Photonics and Biophotonics and UB's Department of Medicine have developed a stable nanoparticle that delivers short RNA molecules in the brain to " silence " or turn off a gene that plays a critical role in many kinds of drug addiction .
The UB team 's in vitro findings were published online the week of March 23 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" These findings mean that in the future , we might be able to add a powerful pharmaceutical agent to the current arsenal of weapons in order to more effectively fight a whole range of substance addictions , " said Paras N. Prasad , Ph.D. , executive director of the UB Institute for Lasers , Photonics and Biophotonics and SUNY Distinguished Professor in the departments of Chemistry , Physics , Electrical Engineering and Medicine , who led the UB team .
The new approach developed by the UB researchers also may be applicable to treating Parkinson 's disease , cancer and a range of other neurologic and psychiatric disorders , which require certain drugs to be delivered to the brain .
At the same time , the study 's co-authors in the UB Department of Medicine say this highly translational research strongly suggests that the nanoparticles would be applicable to other diseases .
They will soon begin to study their use in treating AIDS dementia , prostate cancer and asthma .
" The findings of this study tell us that these nanoparticles are both a safe and very efficient way of delivering to a variety of tissues highly sophisticated new drugs that turn off abnormal genes , " said Stanley A. Schwartz , M.D. , Ph.D. , professor in the UB departments of Medicine , Pediatrics and Microbiology , director of the Division of Allergy , Immunology and Rheumatology in the UB School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences , and a co-author on the study .
The PNAS paper describes the development of an innovative way to silence DARPP - 32 , a brain protein , understood to be a central " trigger " for the cascade of signals that occurs in drug addiction .
DARPP - 32 is a protein in the brain that facilitates addictive behaviors .
Silencing of the DARPP - 32 gene with certain kinds of ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) , called short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , can inhibit production of this protein and thus , could help prevent drug addiction .
" When you silence this gene , the physical craving for the drug should be reduced , " said Adela C. Boniou , Ph.D. , a post - doctoral researcher in the Institute for Lasers , Photonics and Biophotonics in the UB Department of Chemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences , and a co-author .
The drawback has been in finding a way to safely and efficiently deliver the siRNA , which is not stable by itself .
The UB researchers were successful when they combined the siRNA molecules with gold nanoparticles shaped like rods , called nanorods .
This may be the first time that siRNA molecules have been used with gold nanorods .
" What is unique here is that we have applied nanotechnology to therapeutic concepts directed at silencing a gene in the brain , using RNA techniques , " said Supriya D. Mahajan , Ph.D. , research assistant professor in the UB Department of Medicine in the School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences .
In addition to their biocompatibility , the gold nanorods developed by the UB researchers are advantageous because they are rod-shaped rather than spherical , thus allowing for more siRNA molecules to be loaded on to their surface .
This further increases their stability and allows for better penetration into cells .
" We have demonstrated that we can use these gold nanorods to stabilize the siRNA molecules , take them across the blood - brain barrier and silence the gene , " said Indrajit Roy , Ph.D. , deputy director for biophotonics at the institute .
" The nanorods nicely address all three of these requirements . "
The nanorods delivered 40 percent of the silencing RNA molecules across the blood - brain barrier model , significantly higher than the amounts that have previously been achieved in other experiments .
In the next stage of the research , the UB scientists will conduct similar experiments in vivo .
The researchers are active participants in the strategic strength in Integrated Nanostructured Systems identified in the UB 2020 planning process , which brings together researchers in the life sciences , medicine and engineering to promote interdisciplinary advancements .

I like how Jennifer Love Hewitt ’s turned 30 and has officially given up on life .
I remember when I first started wearing sweatpants in public a couple of years ago because I could n’t find pants that were n’t elastic waist band to fit and for the first 6 months of the shit , I felt a little ashamed .
I still try to fake it when I head out to bars and shit , not because I am image oriented or really care all that much , but there ’s something about sweatpants that screams I slept in this shit , and did n’t bother getting dressed , that is never attractive or hot .
Sure she can accessorize with her Luis Vuitton and a mercedes , but as far as I ’m concerned bitch looks like the poor kid in your elementary school and not like a hot Jewish girl heading to camp and I blame her fat mother for that .
Jennifer Love Hewitt is a Fucking Dump of the Day

John Berry thinks -- along with everybody else -- that Republicans are following an old playbook : oppose everything a Democratic president does in the hope of convincing voters that he is in some sense a failure , and then ride opposition to him to congressional majorities .
Newt Gingrich did this in 1993 - 1994 , and it was a tragedy for the nation .
Now John
Berry thinks that this time it will be a farce :
‘ No Deal ’ Republicans Map Disaster of Own Making : March 4 ( Bloomberg ) -- Republicans are headed for a political disaster of their own making .
As bad news about the economy gets ever worse , the party of growth , markets and business is opposing every effort by President Barack Obama to shorten the recession and put people back to work .
Congressional Republicans have crowed about their almost - unanimous nay vote against Obama ’s $ 787 billion stimulus package ....
There ’s every reason to think the added spending and tax cuts will slow the sharp contraction in economic growth and then speed the ensuing recovery .
The claim that governments can’t boost growth -- because , as this theory goes , anything they spend reduces resources available to the private sector -- is bogus .
Some officials in the British Treasury made the same claim during the Great Depression to counter John Maynard Keynes ’s argument that added government spending was needed to fill the gap left by the big drop in private consumption and investment .
The U.S. economic boom produced by World War II spending buried this view .
You have to wonder why Republicans exhumed this discredited theory .
Now that they have , all that ’s needed for a spectacular Republican failure is for a solid recovery to start before the mid-term elections in November 2010 -- a highly likely prospect .
By then , after two years of opposition to Obama ’s efforts to make the lives of most Americans better , it should n’t be hard to convince voters that Republicans are an uncaring lot .
Polls show that almost two - thirds of Americans believe the Republican opposition is nothing more than an attempt to gain political advantage .
If those feelings persist , the Republican minorities in the House and Senate will be even smaller after the next elections than they are today ....
During the 1990 - 1991 recession , conditions were n’t close to as bad as they are today ....
Still , there was a widespread perception that Bush did n’t understand or care about the suffering of Americans ....
Republicans were n’t able to block the Obama - backed stimulus bill .
Still , their obstinacy in the Senate limited its effectiveness ...
You probably already know that the over - the - air ( OTA ) digital switch is coming tomorrow , and already has for many stations , Fox and CW in the Baltimore area for instance ( most stations currently offer digital , but Fox and CW are the only two that no longer offer analog ) .
You probably also know that if you ’re using cable or satellite it ’s most likely not going to affect you .
What you might be surprised to find out is that digital OTA TV is actually higher quality than cable and satellite TV .
Satellite , and many cable providers compress the signals they get from their local stations .
It allows them to offer more stations by shrinking the signal , but it also means that the stations are much lower quality .
That ’s part of the reason why some HD stations still look grainy .
So , it might be time to think about dusting off those rabbit ears .
After looking at my viewing habits , I ’ve come to realize that I typically watch the major networks , and a few shows on cable networks like TBS and USA .
Financially , it makes more sense to use an antenna for network TV and get a NetFlix subscription to rent shows that are on cable channels .
With today ’s economic crisis I would imagine this route would make sense for a lot of people .
Well , I did n’t actually go with rabbit ears when I decided to try out Digital OTA TV .
First I tried building my own antenna from the instructions here , it worked pretty well but there were artifacts ( I guess I ’m too far from the towers for an indoor antenna ) , so I decided to pick up a rooftop antenna and it ’s been crystal clear ever since .
If you ’re thinking about it , go to AntennaWeb , type in your address and they ’ll tell you where your local stations are located and what type of antenna you ’ll need .
If you ’re worried about losing your channel guide or DVR from your cable or satellite box , do n’t get too bent out of shape there are some options for this .
Some HDTV ’s will use the listings provided by the channels to offer a channel guide , but those listings are n’t always accurate and they do n’t go very far into the future .
Another option is to get a third party DVR , I use MythTV with an HDHomeRun to capture the signal .
You could also use an HD TiVo or even Windows Media Center with a digital capture card such as the HDHomeRun mentioned above .
In the end I ’d suggest dusting off those rabbit ears hooking them up to your HDTV and seeing what you can pick up .

Three years ago , in November of 2005 we started a project to upgrade Mono 's code generation engine as the engine started to age and it became increasingly difficult to improve code generation and extend the JIT engine in meaningful ways .
The new code generation engine is based on a linear intermediate representation as opposed to the tree - based intermediate representation that we had used up to Mono 2.0 .
Switching the code generation engine is a pretty significant effort and we did not want to switch it shortly before we had to ship Mono 2.0 , so we decided to ship 2.0 with the engine that had been in wide use .
Shortly after we branched Mono 's tree for the 2.0 release Zoltan merged his work from the linear branch into the main tree .
We have now shipped all of this as part of Mono 2.2 , you can get it here .
Some Benchmarks
Mono 's new engine generates much better code than the version found in Mono 2.0 .
Speed :
The engine will mostly benefit computationally intensive code , usually between 10 % and 30 % performance increase , with some cases going up as high as being 50 % faster .
Code size : the new engine generates slimmer code , typically 12 % to 20 % smaller code generated .
Check out some of the benchmark results .
Debugging the Transition
Although we had our test suite , and we regularly tested the code against most apps , we were still afraid that something might go wrong .
The new code could miss - compile something , and it would be hard in a large project to pin point exactly what went wrong .
For example , the problem might not appear while compiling a small test program like `hello world ' , but could appear when running a web site under heavy load or when running MonoDevelop .
Zoltan came up with a very interesting solution : for a period of time Mono had two JIT engines built into it , the new and the old one .
Here is where the clever trick comes in : an environment variable contained the number of methods that should be compiled with the new JIT engine .
After the Nth method had been compiled , the engine would switch code generators .
This was used to bisect regressions and failures .
A couple of months after we had done the switch and both our unit tests and our system tests passed the old JIT engine was eliminated from Mono .
SIMD
Using SIMD for accelerating certain floating point operations had been in the back of our minds for a while .
We looked into implementing that in our old engine , but that turned out to be very difficult .
With the new engine , Rodrigo was able to put together a prototype in a weekend ( the legend goes that Rodrigo 's wife was busy that weekend ) .
This prototype was later turned into Mono .
SIMD an API for accelerating vector operations .
Mono 2.2 is the first release to officially support and distribute it .
To learn more about Mono.
SIMD support , you can see this blog entry .
Full Generics Sharing
With this release , the generics code sharing engine has been completely debugged and is now enabled not only for code that lives in mscorlib , but for all generics code written by the user .
The Technical Details
We have provided A complete description of Mono 's new engine design and the the various code generation stages .

Obama 's unusual broadening of a president 's words to include nonbelievers .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- President Obama 's mention of " nonbelievers " in his inaugural address represents an important broadening of the circle of acceptability in American life , an acknowledgement of our growing diversity and a fuller embrace of the principles articulated in our nation 's charter documents .
One of the hallmarks of American life , dating to the 17th century , is its religious pluralism .
The Atlantic seaboard during the colonial period was home to everyone from Puritans , Roman Catholics and Dutch Reformed to Quakers , Baptists , Presbyterians , Swedish Lutherans , Anglicans , Huguenots , Mennonites and Schwenckfelders .
Jews arrived in New Amsterdam in 1654 , refugees from South America after the Portuguese takeover of Recifé .
Somehow it all worked , especially in the crucible of religious pluralism in the Middle Colonies : New York , New Jersey and Pennsylvania , where William Penn launched his " Holy Experiment " of religious toleration .
In the context of the New World , these religious groups learned to coexist with remarkably little conflict , and when it came time to configure the new nation , the founders in their wisdom elected not to designate any group as the state religion .
" Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof , " the First Amendment to the United States Constitution reads .
This provision set up a kind of free market for religion in America , allowing religious groups to compete in a marketplace unfettered by government interference .
Indeed , American history is littered with religious entrepreneurs ( to extend the economic metaphor ) who have peddled their wares in this marketplace and thereby contributed to the vigor and vitality of American religious life .
The story of religion in America life has been one of expansion and ever - increasing diversity .
Although Roman Catholics were present in the colonial period -- Maryland , named for the wife of Charles I , was founded by Catholics from England -- Catholics arrived in great numbers from Ireland , Germany and Italy over the course of the 19th century .
Many Protestants , their hegemony threatened , resisted , sometimes with violence .
Jews from Germany and Eastern Europe came as well .
Most of the resistance was episodic .
With notable -- albeit unfortunate -- exceptions , we Americans eventually rise to our better selves and embrace the principles of equality and toleration enshrined in our charter documents .
And we can trace these changes in our rhetoric .
The term " Judeo - Christian , " although coined late in the 19th century , became popular in the 1930s as the clouds of war were gathering in Europe .
In 1955 , after World War II , when so many sons of Jewish and Catholic immigrants fought the Axis powers , sociologist Will Herberg published a book entitled " Protestant - Catholic - Jew , " arguing that any of these religious expressions was legitimately " American . "
The following decade saw still more changes .
The civil rights struggle brought the vibrancy of African - American religious life to national attention , and Lyndon Johnson 's signature on the Hart - Cellar Immigration Act in 1965 removed immigration quotas .
In the decades since , the arrival of people from around the world , especially from South Asia and Southeast Asia , has literally recast the religious landscape of the United States .
Muslim mosques , Hindu temples , Sikh Gurdwäräs and Buddhist stupas have sprouted across the nation , from cities to the countryside .
And our rhetoric has evolved as well .
Whereas America might once have been described as a " Protestant " nation and then a " Christian " nation ( to reflect the inclusion of Roman Catholics ) , we moved to " Judeo - Christian " and then " Protestant - Catholic - Jew . "
More recently , we have talked about the " Abrahamic Traditions , " Jews , Christians and Muslims , thereby broadening the circle to include Islam , one of the three major monotheistic religions .
Even with this broadening landscape , however , presidents have generally acknowledged only believers and failed to mention atheists or agnostics .
Our rhetoric , in fact , has always lagged behind our reality .
When President Obama declared , " We are a nation of Christians and Muslims , Jews and Hindus and nonbelievers , " he sent a signal that it 's time , once again , to enlarge the circle of inclusiveness , consistent with the great American tradition of equality and toleration .
Although I 'm sure that Buddhists and Jains and Sikhs and countless other religious adherents would like to have been included in the president 's roll call , the message was clear :
We are a diverse nation , and the " free exercise " of religion guaranteed in the First Amendment also protects the exercise of no religion at all .

Days before President Bush left office in January , his administration fired a parting shot at Professor Lyle Craker ’s eight - year quest to cultivate marijuana for medical research by abruptly denying him a federal license despite a nearly two - year old Drug Enforcement Administration law judge ’s recommendation that he receive one .
But the new administration led by President Obama , who has publicly backed the use of marijuana for medical purposes to stave off pain , might reverse the decision and keep Craker ’s license application from going up in smoke .
A source familiar with the case said the White House will likely demand that the decision be reviewed .
“ Basically they want to do an autopsy of what occurred and have it go through a proper review , ” the source said .
Craker , who is based at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst , is cautiously optimistic Obama will do to the denial of the marijuana license what he has done to other Bush administration decisions on such hot - button cultural issues as embryonic stem - cell research and the abortion “ gag rule ” affecting overseas family planning groups .
“ Obama has indicated that he ’s for science over politics , ” Craker said in an interview .
“ And I certainly feel the situation we have currently is politics over science . ”
Just last week , Obama called for the head of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to “ develop a strategy for restoring scientific integrity to government decision making . ”
“ The public must be able to trust the science and scientific process informing public policy decisions , ” Obama wrote .
“ Public officials should not suppress or alter scientific or technological findings and conclusions . ”
On the issue of medicinal marijuana , Obama said at a November 2007 campaign stop in Iowa that he was open to allowing its use if it is what science and physicians suggest would be the best way to ease suffering .
“ There ’s no difference between that and morphine when it comes to just giving people relief to pain , ” Obama said then .
Administration officials familiar with Craker ’s application for a DEA license to grow the plant would not comment on the case .
Last month , 16 House members wrote Attorney General Holder asking him to amend or withdraw the DEA ’s final order on Craker ’s application so the president ’s new head of DEA could review the application .
They wrote that the administrative law judge ’s decision “ left no doubt ” that Craker is qualified to cultivate marijuana for research purposes .
The members , led by Rep. John Olver , D - Mass. , said they were concerned the Bush administration ’s ruling violated the “ spirit ” of a Jan. 20 memorandum from White House Chief of Staff Emanuel that essentially froze all “ 11th hour ” final orders .
The memo distributed shortly after the inauguration asked agency officials to reconsider final rules and regulations that have been published in the Federal Register , but have yet to take effect .
Craker ’s battle with the Bush administration began in 2001 , when he applied for a federal license to become a bulk manufacturer of marijuana and establish a privately funded facility at his university for DEA - and FDA - approved marijuana research .
His application posed a challenge to a decades - long monopoly enjoyed by the University of Mississippi as the country ’s only legal producer of marijuana for medical research , a program started in 1968 and overseen by the National Institute on Drug Abuse since 1974 .
A longtime backer , Senate Appropriations ranking member Thad Cochran , funneled $ 3.5 million in earmarked funds to the university ’s National Center for Natural Products Research , which is housed in a building that bears his name , in the FY09 omnibus spending bill .
His press secretary said this week that , as an Ole Miss alumnus , Cochran is proud to have the center in his state , and that the decision on any other license is “ up to DEA . ”
In 2007 , a DEA administrative law judge issued a non-binding recommendation in favor of granting Craker a license , saying NIDA ’s Mississippi - grown supply provided to approved scientists was insufficient for the research marijuana merits .
Despite letters of support from 45 House members and Massachusetts Democratic Sens. Edward Kennedy and John Kerry , then - DEA Administrator Karen Tandy and her successor , acting Administrator Michele Leonhart , made no decision on the license application for more than a year .
But less than a week before Bush left the Oval Office , Leonhart issued a final order denying Craker ’s application , aiming to close the books on a case that lasted nearly as long as Bush ’s tenure in office .
She set Feb. 13 as the final order ’s effective date .
The timing led Craker and Allen Hopper , who heads a legal team provided by the American Civil Liberties Union , to assume the decision was politically motivated .
Administrative law judges usually are nonpartisan “ technocrats ” who examine cases from legal and rational points of view , Hopper said .
“ But when you get to [ the ] level of DEA administrator , that ’s a political appointment , ” he said .
The source familiar with the case agreed the decision was “ entirely political . ”
“ It just seems it was rushed on ideological grounds , ” this source said .
Craker said one reason Leonhart did not favor granting him a license was concern it would set off a rush of license applications from researchers seeking to grow their own .
“ I think our case is dynamite in a logjam , ” Craker said .
“ Once something like this is broken , it ’s kind of hard to put it back together . ”
Since the final order , Hopper has filed a motion to reconsider and has asked for a hearing to present witnesses and evidence that can refute Leonhart ’s arguments .
Meanwhile , four days before the Feb. 13 effective date of the order denying a license to Craker , Leonhart , who is still DEA ’s acting chief but now reports to Obama , extended the date to April 1 .
Justice Department spokeswoman Laura Sweeney , who fielded questions about marijuana licensing , said the date was pushed back because Craker ’s legal team asked for an extension to file supplemental evidence .
She said it was not in response to Emanuel ’s Jan. 20 memo .
Much of the outcome hinges on the fact that Obama has not yet nominated someone to lead the DEA .
Rep. Sam Farr , D - Calif. , who co-signed the letter to Holder , remarked that the Obama administration has moved “ incredibly slow ” at filling this position .
But with a plunging economy and two wars , who can blame Obama for the lack of immediate attention to the drug issue ?
“ I hate to tell you this — it ’s not the most important issue that I ’m concerned about , ” Farr said .

Vasectomies Are Up , Lasik Is Down
I asked my ophthalmologist on Friday how his business was doing in the recession , and he said it was stable .
He noted , however , that his colleagues who specialize in Lasik surgery had seen a 60 percent drop in business .
Clearly , Lasik , which is not reimbursed by most insurance plans , is postponable in times when incomes drop ; at least in the short run , it is a luxury good .
Other medical procedures may even be inferior goods in the short run .
A recent report on NBC noted that there has been a recent rise in vasectomies .
Apparently some couples , fearing that their incomes may be permanently lower , wish to minimize the chances of having another child for whom it will be difficult to provide .
We know that plastic surgery is another luxury good .
I wonder how one would classify still more medical procedures .
The genome era and the advent of high - throughput technologies have brought about a huge increase in the amount of data available to biologists : each genome contains tens of thousands of genes , whose products can potentially interact with each other in an astronomical number of ways .
This quantitative change has created a need for a qualitative change in the way we perform analyses : the human brain is not very good at understanding thousands of things at once , let alone millions or billions , so we must find new ways to extract comprehensible patterns from torrents of data .
Many of the techniques being developed to analyze large biological networks fall under the umbrella of systems biology .
Some of the newest tools have been used guide genetic perturbation studies in yeast , resulting in the discovery of novel lifespan control genes .
What can such network analysis tell us about human aging ?
To address this question , Bell et al. compiled a list of gerontogenes ( i.e. , genes whose wildtype function is associated with accelerated aging , and whose loss - of - function mutants are associated with longer life ) from model systems , and studied the connectivity of these genes within the context of interaction data obtained from a large - scale ( though not comprehensive ) two - hybrid screen of human proteins .
A Human Protein Interaction Network Shows Conservation of Aging Processes between Human and Invertebrate Species
We have mapped a protein interaction network of human homologs of proteins that modify longevity in invertebrate species .
This network is derived from a proteome - scale human protein interaction Core Network generated through unbiased high - throughput yeast two - hybrid searches .
The longevity network is composed of 175 human homologs of proteins known to confer increased longevity through loss of function in yeast , nematode , or fly , and 2,163 additional human proteins that interact with these homologs .
Overall , the network consists of 3,271 binary interactions among 2,338 unique proteins .
A comparison of the average node degree of the human longevity homologs with random sets of proteins in the Core Network indicates that human homologs of longevity proteins are highly connected hubs with a mean node degree of 18.8 partners .
Shortest path length analysis shows that proteins in this network are significantly more connected than would be expected by chance .
To examine the relationship of this network to human aging phenotypes , we compared the genes encoding longevity network proteins to genes known to be changed transcriptionally during aging in human muscle .
In the case of both the longevity protein homologs and their interactors , we observed enrichments for differentially expressed genes in the network .
To determine whether homologs of human longevity interacting proteins can modulate life span in invertebrates , homologs of 18 human FRAP1 interacting proteins showing significant changes in human aging muscle were tested for effects on nematode life span using RNAi .
Of 18 genes tested , 33 % extended life span when knocked - down in Caenorhabditis elegans .
These observations indicate that a broad class of longevity genes identified in invertebrate models of aging have relevance to human aging .
They also indicate that the longevity protein interaction network presented here is enriched for novel conserved longevity proteins .
The authors ’ focus on genes studied in model organisms is well motivated ; genes that control aging in one species are more likely than one would expect from chance to affect aging in another species , even if those species are as diverged as yeast and worms .
The findings : compared to the genome as a whole , longevity genes tend to be more highly connected network , often acting as “ hubs ” within the network ; furthermore , these genes are more connected to one another than the average gene , forming a “ longevity network ” that stands out against the web of all interactions .
In conjunction with expression data , this network has predictive power : genes that interact with components of the longevity network and exhibit increased expression in aging muscle are very likely to function as gerontogenes in C. elegans .
This finding demonstrates once again the significant conservation of lifespan control systems across large evolutionary distances .
Perhaps more importantly , it also shows that applying network analyses to large data sets can do more than merely catalog information .
With the right combination of high - throughput data , a good network model and the right kinds of statistics , the tools of systems biology can reveal new biology that otherwise would have taken us a very long time to discover .

The latest results from the quarterly Clarius Skills Index have predicted that if unemployment continues to rise there will be an oversupply of between 35,000 and 50,000 skilled workers in Australia by 2010 .
The Index indicates that skills shortages across most industries peaked in the December 2008 quarter and were likely to fall over the next 18 months .
Unemployment has reached record levels in the last couple of months , and Clarius Group executive chairman Geoff Moles said the predicted oversupply of labour would represent a massive change in the employment landscape , but will not affect every industry .
“ While economic pressures are changing the national employment landscape rapidly , the skilled labour market easing does not reflect the reality in every industry sector . ”
Last year , Clarius reported on the top ten industries facing skills shortages which included chefs , tradespersons and health and building professionals .

This is where it all began for me : the D&D Basic Rules Set .
When I opened this book in 1983 , I had no idea that it would change my life .
Back then , if you told 11 year - old me that I 'd be 36 and wiping tears from my face because reading it brought back so many joyful memories , he would have called you one of the names the cool kids called him for playing it .
( Do n't judge him too harshly ; he 's only 11 . )
My original D&D Basic set was a garage sale casualty , but the book in this picture is a first printing that I bought at a game store about ten years ago .
It 's perfect in every way , except for a missing character sheet in the middle , which I printed from the PDF copy I bought from Paizo last year .
The Keep on the Borderlands module beneath it belonged to someone named Randy Richards , who wrote his name and phone number ( as we so often did in those days ) on the cover .
I do n't know who Randy Richards is , if he cares , or if he 'll even read this , but if he does , I want him to know : your book is in very good hands , Randy , and its current owner loves it as much as anyone could .
I 've been on a real D&D kick lately ( blame the Penny Arcade podcast , and how much I love 4e ) but I had n't actually gone back to the beginning and read the Basic Rules for a very , very long time .
So late last night , after my family went to sleep , instead of watching TV or reading blogs , I went to my bookshelf and grabbed the Player 's Manual you see in this picture .
I read it cover - to - cover for the first time in over 20 years , and played the solo adventure , which was the very first dungeon I ever visited .
I named my fighter Thorin , just like I did when I was a kid .
I made a map on graph paper , rolled dice on the floor , and felt pure joy wash over me .
I scared off a Giant Rat and killed the remaining two before I failed – like I did when I was 11 – to solve the riddle of O - T - T - F - F - S - S , losing all my treasure .
I tried to talk to the Goblins ... before I killed them and took their treasure : 100 sp and 50 gp .
I battled the Rust Monster , who was just as tough and unreasonable an opponent for a first level fighter as I remember .
Thorin eventually managed to defeat it with some ... creative ... trips back to town to replace his armor and weapons , just like he did a quarter century ago .
Luckily for him , the Rust Monster did n't heal between battles ... just like the last time he faced it .
I decided to leave the skeletons for another time , and walked back to town with my 650 gp and 100 sp .
When I calculated my XP , I had earned 1084 ... not too shabby .
I closed up my book , and went to sleep happy .
When I was a kid , the D&D Basic Rules Set was never just a game to me ; it was my portal into a magical , wonderful world that I still love .
Now that I 'm an adult , it is n't just a couple of books to me ; it 's a time machine .
The world I live in is filled with uncertainty and occasionally - overwhelming responsibility , but for an hour or so last night , I was 11 years - old again , and I went back to a world where the biggest problem I faced was trying to save up for a Millennium Falcon .
When I read " You decide to attack the goblins before they can get help ... "
I could hear my Aunt Val tell me “ That ’s a game that I hear lots of kids like to play , Willow .
It ’s dragons and wizards and those things you liked from The Hobbit .
The back says you use your imagination , and I know what a great imagination you have . ”
I could feel the weight of my Red Box , which I carried with me pretty much everywhere I went , and how huge the thing felt in my tiny arms .
I could feel it get heavier as I added modules and characters , and my own dungeons , drawn on graph paper .
I could hear the snap of the thick green rubber band I eventually had to wrap around it , and I could see the yellowing scotch tape I added to the corners .
I enjoyed it so much , I 'm going to reread the Dungeon Master 's Rulebook next , and run the Group Game adventure it contains , " for use by a beginning Dungeon Master . "
Then , it 's time to go back to the Keep on the Borderlands , using just the Basic Rules , where Magic - users can't wear armor , Fighters have 8 HP , Dwarf and Elf are classes , and everyone dies at least once before finally taking a character to second level , because that 's where it all started for me , and sometimes you just have to go back to your roots .

A more cerebral discussion is offered by Brian Buetler :
[ T] hough it 's easy to place too much emphasis on this particular episode , and that doing so only makes it harder for the White House and Treasury to address the problem -- there is an underlying issue here that matters quite a bit .
It 's not that the success of the bailout depends on what happens to these $ 160 million , but that these $ 160 million strongly suggest that some very rich , and , perhaps , very bad men have leveraged their way into control of the whole bailout process and the government 's now following their lead .
And their incentives are , to say the least , not in line with the best interests of the vast majority of taxpayers .
If that perception is correct , then it's hard to imagine the financial rescue succeeding .
If that perception is incorrect , but still pervasive , it very much limits the tools Geithner et al. may need to complete the process , and in that sense , it 's important for the administration to reverse the perception .
. . .
I think [ those arguing that the AIG bonuses are a trivial distraction ] badly underestimate the extent to which this was the manifestation a genuinely systemic problem .
It 's simply not the case that Geithner and other high - level economic officials were so concerned with the bigger picture that they outsourced the question of compensation to Congress entirely .
On the contrary , they were extremely involved in resolving that very question .
They were opposed to strict compensation limits .
And even though they may not have winked and nodded at AIG specifically , or at this or that bonus package , they made a calculation and arrived at the conclusion that caving to the extortion of the very people who triggered this collapse was worth a few hundred million tax payer dollars .
It 's hard to say exactly why they decided that .
I 'm sure that in part they underestimated the potential for political backlash , and now they 've learned their lessons the hard way .
But clearly they also thought that letting executives take home big fat piles of government money was either a matter of expedience or a matter of necessity .
And either way it has huge implications for the success or failure of one of the most expensive and urgent government programs in the country 's history .
Well stated by Buetler .
In response to the general critiques of the " it 's just a distraction ' school ' " ( the JOList ( kidding ) ) , Yglesias writes :
A lot of people , myself included , spent a lot of time in 2007 and 2008 observing that a lot of the old gaps inside the progressive camp had narrowed or vanished since the 1990s .
But I think the Panic of ‘ 08 is tending to reopen a new gap .
On the one hand you have people basically inclined toward Hiltzik ’s that a lot of the people making the big bucks for the past 10 years are basically scammers who lucked into the ability to siphon tons of money out of the economy without really doing anything useful or valuable , and between people who think that they ’re genuinely smart hard - working people who just happen to deserve to pay somewhat more in income taxes than they currently do .
This is just plain wrong , and to put a real point on my criticism , it is just the way the DLC would respond to disagreement about its foreign policy views .
I think the Iraq debate amongst " progressives " and Democrats is actually very instructive here .
Like Yglesias , the Democratic and " progressive " supporters of the Iraq War treated those who disagreed with them as " Un Serious " and who did not understand the issues or who were knee jerk opposers of all wars .
This was utter nonsense .
I addressed that point in a 2006 post on Peter Beinart 's book :
Beinart 's central problem is that he has married his analysis to the story of the Henry Wallace movement in the Post - World War II period and has convinced himself that it describes and explains contemporary liberal views of the United States and its role in the world .
What does Henry Wallace have to do with today`s liberalism ?
Nothing of course .
But like his TNR colleague Jon Chait , Beinart wants those liberals and Democrats who disagree with them to be wild eyed useful idiots who " coddle terrorists , " are crazy Leftists and haters of America .
He is wrong and for obvious reasons .
Yglesias is adopting the same approach .
disagreement with the view that concerns for the " Masters of the Universe " should not be in the forefront of government policy are casually tossed aside as the " old debate " between " pro-business " and " anti-business " Democrats .
This is lazy thinking and wrong .
As a staunch defender of Clintonomics , free trade and other " pro-business " policies ( hell , I still defend the repeal of the Glass - Steagall Act and think its reimposition would be a mistake ) , I think it is pretty clear that I do not line up the way Yglesias wants me to ( and I doubt other critics of the " AIG is a distraction " idea line up too far from me . )
Just as I opposed the Iraq War AFTER supporting Desert Storm and even the Panama incursion , because it was a bad choice of policy , my opposition today to the Obama Administration 's Wall Street - centric approach comes from the belief that the circumstances we face today do not permit for an approach that adopts this type of thinking .
Of course , the irony of the lazy thinking Yglesias employs here is that our current President was a staunch opponent of the Iraq Debacle ( who would have been labelled as " UnSerious " if his views were even considered at all ) and famously said " I do n't oppose all wars .
I 'm opposed to dumb wars . "
Similarly , I would argue I am not opposed to all bailouts .
I am opposed to dumb bailouts .
The Obama Administration 's approach has been to embrace dumb bailouts , due to the systemic rut in its thinking about the financial crisis and the " Masters of the Universe " who helped cause it .
Speaking for me only
Pro-democracy protesters wear red in a Bangkok stadium , December 13 , 2008 .
By Giles Ji Ungpakorn
March 21 , 2009 --
The current dispensation in Thailand is based on a political reaction to stem and reverse some of the populist measures of the deposed prime minister , Thaksin Shinawatra , who himself was a neoliberal with a few pro-poor schemes .
Even this was unacceptable to the elites who used the courts , the military and the monarchy to depose him and institute an anti-democratic constitution which protects their privileges .
But now that Thaksin is gone , a grassroots movement of the poor is emerging to challenge the hold of the elites , the military and the monarchy over Thailand .
Today , the Thai government , and its elite supporters , are once again using the language of the Cold War and the era of military dictatorships in order to throttle free speech and democracy .
Everything in Thailand is not as it seems .
The so - called Democrat Party is in government , but not because of support from the majority of the electorate .
In fact , the Democrat Party has never won anything approaching a majority and this is why the party welcomed the military coup in 2006 .
The Peoples ' Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) , those yellow - shirted royalists who seized the two international airports last year , are neither an alliance of the people nor are they for democracy .
Its membership base is among the extremist middle classes who believe that the Thaksin Shinawatra government spent “ too much ” money on welfare and populist policies for the poor .
The PAD believes that only is it true guardian of the monarchy and that the majority of the Thai electorate , who are poor , should not have the right to vote .
The PAD has an armed “ guard ” and has used violent tactics on the streets of Bangkok to destabilise elected governments .
It proposes a “ New Order ” in Thai politics where only 30 % of the parliament is elected .
It wants members of parliament to be elected by “ professional groups ” rather than through a one - person one - vote system .
This would ensure that doctors and professionals have much more voting power than poor agriculturalists or factory workers .
Tragically , most socalled “ liberal ” academics supported the 2006 coup and the PAD .
Amazingly , so did half the Thai non-governmental organisation ( NGO ) movement .
The PAD works hand in glove with the army and it has received endorsement from the queen .
The assault on democracy
Five years ago , under the elected Thaksin government , Thailand had a thriving and developing democracy with freedom of expression , a relatively free press and an active civil society where social movements campaigned to protect the interests of the poor .
This was not , however , the work of the Thaksin administration , since there were serious problems of human rights abuses .
Thaksin 's government used murderous repression in the predominantly Muslim southern provinces of Malay and killed more than 3000 people in the so - called “ war on drugs ” .
The situation , though , has become much worse since the 2006 coup which overthrew his government .
Today , the country is creeping towards totalitarianism .
The present government , led by the Democrat Party , is only in power because of the military which staged a coup in 2006 .
Despite the grave economic crisis , its priority is just to crack down on free speech and dissent , claiming the need to protect “ national security ” .
The Thai political crisis started with mass demonstrations led by the PAD in early 2005 .
The PAD began as an “ alliance from hell ” between disgruntled royalist media tycoon Sonti Limtongkul and a handful of NGO and social movement leaders .
They attacked Thaksin ’s Thai Rak Thai government for corruption .
Interestingly , they never showed any interest in criticising his human rights abuses .
Thaksin responded to the growing crisis by dissolving parliament and calling fresh elections .
The opposition boycotted these elections and “ liberal ” academics “ explained ” that calling fresh elections was “ undemocratic ” .
The courts then annulled the election .
The anti-democratic forces knew that Thaksin ’s Thai Rak Thai party was immensely popular and would win any vote .
Rather than accepting that the electoral support for Thaksin was because of the government 's first - ever universal healthcare scheme and many other pro-poor measures , they claimed that the poor did not understand democracy and were just “ bought ” by Thaksin .
The Democrat Party spent most of its time attacking these pro-poor policies as being a waste of money and against “ fiscal discipline ” .
Little wonder then that ordinary
Thais would not want to vote for them !
The NGO and social movement leaders of the PAD moved sharply to the right , becoming fanatical royalists and calling on the monarch to sack Thaksin 's elected government .
This the king refused to do , but the PAD 's demands were seen as a green light for a military coup and the military obliged in September 2006 .
PAD leaders and military junta leaders were seen celebrating their victory at a New Year 's party in 2007 .
At that time , the Democrat Party also welcomed the coup .
Newly ordered constitution
The army ripped up the best constitution Thailand has ever had and replaced it with one of its own .
A referendum was held to approve the military constitution .
Many provinces were under martial law , campaigning for a “ no ” vote in the referendum was deemed illegal and full - page advertisements in the press urged people to vote “ yes ” .
The referendum result was extremely close , a small majority being in favour .
Half the NGOs , the PAD , most academics , the mainstream media and the Democrat Party all supported the new constitution .
The military constitution allowed for half the senate to be appointed by the military , rather than elected .
It decreased the role of political parties and installed a crony system where members of the elite appointed themselves to the senate , the judiciary and to so - called “ independent bodies ” .
The constitution laid down that neoliberal free market policies must be used in the interests of fiscal discipline , but also imposed a huge increase in the military budget .
The final clause in the constitution , which previously gave citizens the right to oppose military coups , was changed to legitimise the 2006 coup and any future seizures of power .
The courts in Thailand have never been truly independent or just .
The military used the courts to dissolve the Thai Rak Thai party and then held the elections .
Despite this , Thaksin 's party won a majority .
So the courts were used for a second time to dissolve the new party which had evolved from Thai Rak Thai .
It is clear that the aim was to cripple the most popular party and not allow it to form a stable government .
At the same time the PAD launched its deliberate “ campaign of chaos ” in order to achieve its “ New Order ” .
It used violence to take over Government House , wrecking the interior .
It staged violent actions to try and prevent the elected parliament from convening and subsequently it seized the two international airports in 2008 with the support of the military and the Democrat Party .
The PAD cared little about the damage to the country 's economy and jobs , on the assumption that it , as the elites , would not be hurt and the poor could just suffer .
No one from the PAD has been punished for these violent actions .
After the 2006 coup , the PAD descended into a fascist - type of organisation .
It took on ultra-royalist and ultra-nationalist politics .
Its supporters wore royal yellow shirts .
It nearly caused a war with Cambodia over an ancient hilltop ruin .
It built up its own armed guard which openly carried and used weapons on the streets of Bangkok .
The present Thai foreign minister is a PAD supporter who took part in the illegal occupation of the airports .
The PAD 's media outlet , Manager Group , have started witch - hunts against academics and social activists who question the deterioration of democracy and question the use of the lese majeste law .
It encourages people to commit acts of violence against those who think differently or oppose them .
Finally , at the end of 2008 , the army bullied and bribed some of the most corrupt elements in Thaksin 's party to change sides and support the Democrat Party .
So Eaton - and Oxford - educated Abhisit is now the prime minister .
His name sums it all up .
It means “ privilege ” .
It is the privileged of Thai society that united against the modernising policies of Thaksin 's Thai Rak Thai party .
For the first time in decades , a party was gaining mass support from the poor because it believed that the poor were not a burden .
They argued that the poor should be “ stakeholders ” rather than serfs .
The Thai Rak Thai was no socialist party , but a party of big business committed to free - market policies at a macro and global level and Keynesian policies at the village level .
Use of lese majeste law
The present government appears vicious and paranoid .
Its priority seems to be to stifle dissent by using the lese majeste law .
Anyone who criticises the government or the army is deemed to have “ insulted the king ” .
They are censoring the electronic media and community radio stations and encouraging citizens to inform on each other .
People are being arrested for posting comments on the internet by tracing their computer IP numbers and they are thrown in jail , even before a trial .
Recently , the manager of Prachatai , a respected independent online newspaper , was arrested .
The mainstream TV and print media are already working hand in glove with the military .
The courts have been used as an instrument of dictatorship .
Judges protect themselves by threatening anyone who dares to criticise them with a jail sentence for “ contempt of court ” .
They claim that anyone who criticises the courts is criticising the monarch .
Lese majeste trials are given little publicity and people cannot find out what actions are deemed to have insulted the monarch .
There is no transparency and accountability , no justice , no freedom of speech and no academic freedom .
One worrying question is why most academics support the military and the PAD .
Equally worrying is the question why decent NGO activists and some trade unionists did so too .
As far as the academics are concerned , even those claiming to be “ liberal ” were always elitist .
Most believed that the problem of Thai democracy was that the poor lacked education .
But the education system that these academics have promoted is one where students learn everything by rote .
The idea that an essay in politics might discuss arguments , rather than be merely descriptive , is met with surprise .
The NGO movement has a different problem .
It is a movement which turned its back on politics and concentrated on single issues and on lobbying governments of any shade and colour .
It swung from admiration of the Thaksin government to supporting the military coup .
In a nutshell then , the old groups in civil society have helped to create the monster of the “ New Order ” that is now strangling Thai democracy .
In early 2007 , I published a book called A Coup for the Rich . [1 ]
This short academic book was written as a protest against the shrinking democratic space in Thailand .
I tried to analyse what exactly was happening to Thai democracy .
I criticised the gross human rights abuses of the democratically elected Thaksin government .
But I also argued that a military coup was not the answer to this .
Because my book opposed the military coup “ solution ” , I was charged with lese majeste or insulting the monarch .
How can there be academic freedom when my own university , Chulalongkorn University , gave my book to the police ?
How can there be academic standards if political scientists like myself are not allowed to discuss what the monarch , the army and the elites do ?
And through all this , most Thai academics remained silent , some supporting the destruction of democracy , others censoring themselves because of fear .
Class war for democracy
The civil war which is developing in Thailand is a class war between the rich and the poor .
But it expresses itself in a very distorted and complicated manner .
Those yellow shirts who backed the coup and the subsequent undemocratic measures hate the fact that Thaksin 's Thai Rak Thai government won huge support for providing universal healthcare and public projects to lift people out of poverty .
Since the overthrow of the Thaksin government and as a result of the prolonged crisis , a grassroots “ red shirt ” movement has developed .
It is being built up by ordinary citizens who want democracy and freedom .
They are moving beyond Thaksin .
What is also amazing is that this is becoming a republican movement because of the dragging of the monarchy into politics by the military and the PAD .
The monarch has never once spoken out against the destruction of democratic rights and allows people to crawl on the ground in front of him .
Traffic is stopped in the streets of Bangkok for the royal family to pass , yet emergency ambulances never get the same treatment .
The conservative elites want us to believe that the monarch loves and cares for the people and that they love him back .
But the Thai population are quite capable of looking after themselves .
All that is beautiful and honourable about Thai society has been created by its working people .
The current monarch grew in stature under the corrupt military dictators : Sarit Dhanarajata , Tanom and Prapass .
He allowed executions of people who were accused of killing his elder brother , when there were strong reasons to doubt the truth of these accusations .
He supported the bloodbath at Thammasart University on October 6 , 1976 , where scores of students were tortured and killed , because he felt that Thailand had “ too much democracy ” .
At the time he was also the patron of the violent gang that was collectively called the “ village scouts ” .
The monarch allowed the army to stage a coup in September 2006 .
Furthermore he allowed his name to be used by the army , the PAD protesters and the Democrat Party , in the destruction of democracy .
He has been an advocate of economic views which reveal his opposition to state - sponsored social welfare for the poor and to income redistribution .
But what is worse , as one of the richest men in the world , the king has the arrogance to lecture the poor to be sufficient in their poverty through the notion of “ sufficiency economy ” .
This is nothing more than a reactionary ideology which argues that the poor must know their place .
Finally , this king allows his supporters to proclaim that he is “ the father of the nation ” , and yet his own son is not respected by anyone in Thai society !
For the millions of Thais who know all this to be true , it is only fear and intimidation that prevents speaking this truth about the monarchy .
The anti-democracy elites in Thailand , who claim legitimacy from the monarch , only do so because they have no other legitimacy .
The monarch is weak , but these powerful elites create an illusion of his power to frighten people .
The army , the conservative elites and the Democrat Party are scared that this royal legitimacy is rapidly evaporating , specially at a time when the monarch is getting very old .
His son is held in contempt by the population because he is known as a thug who parades his wife naked for video snap shots .
Most
Thais have seen these videos and photographs and it does nothing for their respect for the institution of monarchy .
A new civil society is emerging from the “ red shirt ” movement .
Many will feel uncomfortable that this is a movement of ordinary citizens and not the educated middle class .
But this is what is surely required to build a democratic society based on social justice .
The need is to cut down the military 's influence in society , reform the judiciary and the police and to expand freedom and democracy through this grassroots movement .
And it is necessary to abolish the monarchy too for it has now become an obstacle to freedom and human dignity .
Thais need to create a culture of citizenship rather than being merely “ royal subjects ” .

' Break up the banks , bust the trusts ! ' exclaims Olbermann David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Friday March 20 , 2009
Print This Email This Keith Olbermann used his Thursday Special Comment on MSNBC 's Countdown to lay out one of his most impassioned tirades yet , this time a diatribe against " the latest atrocity " from banks he feels the US should " break up " and regulate " to within an inch of their existences . "
Yelling several times , " Enough ! " during his monologue , Olbermann recounted the recent history of Vikram Pandit , the CEO of Citigroup who vowed to reduce his salary to just $ 1 a year and accept no bonus in the face of his company losing over $ 5 billion and laying off over 9,000 people .
When he was first made CEO , Citigroup was already reeling from losses of between eight and 11 billion dollars .
" ... what Mr. Pandit got was a new 10 million dollar executive suite for himself and his key associates , " said Olbermann . " ...
In fact , he then accepted a total compensation package for 2008 of 38 million dollars . "
" Mr. Pandit , you re probably just a good actor and a damned liar and a con man , " he continued .
" But I 'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume instead , that you just can't tell the difference between one dollar and 38 million of them .
That would certainly explain the maelstrom into which you , and your colleagues at Citi and your counterparts elsewhere , have gotten us , including the vast majority of us who are just innocent bystanders .
" ... Mr. Pandit 's corporation should be cut up into little pieces .
And when he and the other ultra-millionaires wonder what hit them , we should make sure they are easily reminded .
Our representatives should entitle the legislation that ends their moral ponzi schemes , ' The Punish Vikram Pandit Act of 2009 . ' "
Olbermann is n't the only media figure with sharpened words for America 's bankers .
On Thursday 's New York Times op - ed page , Simon Johnson and James Kwak posited an analogy between the current financial crisis and the executive " smokescreen " that drove the series of Asian market collapses in 1997 .
Arguments made by their bankers , then , are quite similar to our bankers , today , they wrote .
" The leaders of Thailand and South Korea did not listen to such arguments , and thank goodness .
Some of the leading
Thai banks were taken over by the government .
After the crisis , a civil servant in charge of one such bank noted that its bad loans were much bigger than had been indicated before the takeover , largely because of an internal coverup .
Only when outsiders took over did the public discover the full scope of the losses .
" The South Korean government also demanded that the banks and the chaebols make a clean break .
This generated a great deal of political noise  particularly when foreign managers were brought in , as when the Carlyle Group bought a stake in KorAm Bank in 2000 and Lone Star Funds purchased the Korea Exchange Bank in 2003 .
" But these reforms made all the difference . "
" The far right in this country , without the slightest provocation or justification , screams ' socialism , ' and the sheep who follow that far right , and who do not know what the word means and do not know it is only being used because ' communism ' now rings laughably hollow in this cry of fire in a crowded unemployment line , there is outrage , to be sure , " said Olbermann .
" But there is also license .
They think this is socialism ?
There is a million miles of reform left to go before we actually hit actual socialism .
But if they 're going to call us names , whether they apply or not , let 's give them real reform .
" Break up the banks .
Regulate the financial industries , to within an inch of their existences .
Roll back corporate legal protections .
Make liable the officers of corporations for their debts and for their deeds .
Resurrect the rallying cry of a hundred years past : bust the trusts ! "

- Tiahuanuco probably a Sanctuary , not a Seat of Dominion .
TIAHUANUCO lies almost in the very centre of the great terrestrial basin of lakes Titicaca and Aullagas , and in the heart of a region which may be properly characterized as the Thibet of the New World .
Here , at an elevation of twelve thousand nine hundred feet above the sea , in a broad , open , unprotected , arid plain , cold in the wet and frigid in the dry season , we find the evidences of an ancient civilization , regarded by many as the oldest and the most advanced of both American continents .
It was to explore and investigate the monumental remains that have made this spot celebrated that I had come to Tiahuannco , and I lost no time in commencing my task .
This was not an easy one , for even with the aid of the drunken Cura we were unable to procure laborers to assist us , for not only had we reached the village on the eve of the Chuño , or potato festival , a remnant of ancient observances , but before we had finished our work the Feast of Corpus Christi had commenced .
Chicha flowed like water , and the few inhabitants that the Chuño festival had left sober deliberately gave themselves up to beastly intoxication .
This was not my only difficulty .
While we were toiling our way upwards through the mountain road , my photographer , on whose skill I had depended , became dangerously ill .
One bitter night , under an ebon sky , with no one to assist us save some kindly Indians , we tried in vain to relieve his sufferings and compose his mental hallucinations .
The disease baffled all our efforts , and before sunrise death brought him relief and release .
He murmured something in the Gaelic tongue , in which only the endearing word " mamma " sacred in all languages was intelligible , and died with that word lingering on his thin , blue lips .
I had provided myself with a complete and costly set of photographic apparatus , which I regarded as indispensable to success in depicting the ancient monuments ; but I had little knowledge of the art , and must now become my own photographer , or lose many of the results of my labor .
With no instruction except such as I could gain from Hardwick 's " Manual of Photographic Chemistry , " I went to work , and , after numerous failures , became tolerably expert .
I had but a single assistant , Mr. H- , an amateur draughtsman , and only such other aid as I could get from my muleteer and his men , who were eager to conclude their engagement , and simply astounded that we should waste an hour , much more that we should spend days , on the remains of the heathens .
Still , the investigation was undertaken with equal energy and enthusiasm , and , I am confident , with as good results as could be reached without an expenditure of time and money which would hardly have been rewarded by any probable additional discoveries .
We spent a week in Tiahuanuco among the ruins , and , I believe , obtained a plan of every structure that is traceable , and of every monument of importance that is extant .
The first thing that strikes the visitor in the village of Tiahuanuco is the great number of beautifully cut stones , built into the rudest edifices , and paving the squalidest courts .
They are used as lintels , jambs , seats , tables , and as receptacles for water .
The church is mainly built of them ; the cross in front of it stands on a stone pedestal which shames the symbol it supports in excellence of workmanship .
On all sides are vestiges of antiquity from the neighboring ruins , which have been a real quarry , whence have been taken the cut stones , not only for Tiahuanuco and all the villages and churches of its valley , but for erecting the cathedral of La Paz , the capital of Bolivia , situated in the deep valley of one of the streams falling into the river Beni , twenty leagues distant .
And what is true here is also true of most parts of the Sierra .
The monuments of the past have furnished most of the materials for the public edifices , the bridges , and highways of the present day .
The ruins of Tiahuanuco have been regarded by all students of American antiquities as in many respects the most interesting and important , and at the same time most enigmatical , of any on the continent .
They have excited the admiration and wonder alike of the earliest and latest travelers , most of whom , vanquished in their attempts to penetrate the mystery of their origin , have been content to assign them an antiquity beyond that of the other monuments of America , and to regard them as the solitary remains of a civilization that disappeared before that of the Incas began , and contemporaneous with that of Egypt and the East .
Unique , yet perfect in type and harmonious in style , they appear to be the work of a people who were thorough masters of an architecture which had no infancy , passed through no period of growth , and of which we find no other examples .
Tradition , which mumbles more or less intelligibly of the origin of many other American monuments , is dumb concerning these .
The wondering Indians told the first Spaniards that " they existed before the sun shone in the heavens , " that they were raised by giants , or that they were the remains of an impious people whom an angry Deity had converted into stone because they had refused hospitality to his viceregent and messenger .
I shall give only a rapid account of these remains , correcting some of the errors and avoiding some of the extravagances of my predecessors in the same field of inquiry .
I must confess I did not find many things that they have described ; but that fact , in view of the destructiveness of treasure - hunters and the rapacity of ignorant collectors of antiquities , does not necessarily discredit their statements ; for Tiahuanuco is a rifled ruin , with comparatively few yet sufficient evidences of former greatness .
The ruins are about half a mile to the southward of the village , separated from it by a small brook and a shallow valley .
The high - road to La Paz passes close to them in fact , between them and some mounds of earth which were probably parts of the general system .
They are on a broad and very level part of the plain , where the soil is an arenaceous loam , firm and dry .
Rows of erect stones , some of them rough or but rudely shaped by art ; others accurately cut and fitted in walls of admirable workmanship ; long sections of foundations , with piers and portions of stairways ; blocks of stone , with mouldings , cornices , and niches cut with geometrical precision ; vast masses of sandstone , trachyte , and basalt but partially hewn ; and great monolithic doorways , bearing symbolical ornaments in relief , besides innumerable smaller , rectangular , and symmetrically shaped stones , rise on every hand , or lie scattered in confusion over the plain .
It is only after the intelligent traveler has gone over the whole area and carefully studied the ground , that the various fragments fall into something like their just relations , and the design of the whole becomes comprehensible .
Leaving aside , for the present , the lesser mounds of earth of which I have spoken , we find the central and most conspicuous portion of the ruins , which cover not far from a square mile , to consist of a great , rectangular mound of earth , originally terraced , each terrace supported by a massive wall of cut stones , and the whole surmounted by structures of stone , parts of the foundations of which are still distinct .
This structure is popularly called the " Fortress , " and , as tradition affirms , suggested the plan of the great fortress of Sacsahuaman , dominating the city of Cuzco .
The sides of this structure , as also of all the others in Tiahuanuco , coincide within ten degrees with the cardinal points of the compass .
Close to the left of the Fortress ( I adopt this name , and the others I may use , solely to facilitate description ) is an area called the " Temple , " slightly raised , defined by lines of erect stones , but ruder than those which surround the Fortress .
A row of massive pilasters stands somewhat in advance of the eastern front of this area , and still in advance of this are the deeply embedded piers of a smaller edifice of squared stones , with traces of an exterior corridor , which has sometimes been called the " Palace . "
At other points , both to the south and northward , are some remains to which I shall have occasion to refer .
The structure called the Temple will claim our first attention ; primarily because it seems to be the oldest of the group , the type , perhaps , of the others , and because it is here we find the great monolithic sculptured gateway of Tiahuanuco , which is absolutely unique , so far as our knowledge goes , on this continent .
The body of the Temple forms a rectangle of 388 by 445 feet , defined , as I said before , by lines of erect stones , partly shaped by art .
They are mostly of red sandstone , and of irregular size and height ; those at the corners being more carefully squared and tallest .
For the most part , they are between 8 and 10 feet high , from 2 to 4 feet broad , and from 20 to 30 inches in thickness .
The portions entering the ground , like those of our granite gateposts , are largest , and left so for the obvious purpose of giving the stones greater firmness in their position .
These stones , some of which have fallen and others disappeared , seem to have been placed , inclining slightly inwards , at approximately 15 feet apart , measuring from centre to centre , and they appear to have had a wall of rough stones built up between them , supporting a terre - plein of earth , about 8 feet above the general level of the plain .
On its eastern side this terre - plein had an apron or lower terrace 18 feet broad , along the edge of the central part of which were raised ten great stone pilasters , placed 15 1 / 2 feet apart , all of which , perfectly aligned , are still standing , with a single exception .
They are of varying heights , and no two agree in width or thickness .
The one that is fallen , which was second in the line , measures 13 feet 8 inches in length by 5 feet 3 inches in breadth .
It is partly buried in the earth , but shows 32 inches of thickness above ground .
Among those still erect the tallest is 14 feet by 4 feet 2 inches , and 2 feet 8 inches ; the shortest 9 feet by 2 feet 9 inches , and 2 feet 5 inches .
These are less in dimension than the stones composing the inner cell or sanctum of Stonehenge , which range from 16 feet 3 inches to 21 feet 6 inches in height ; but they are nearly , if not quite , equal with those composing the outer circle of that structure .
They are much more accurately cut than those of Stonehenge , the fronts being perfectly true , and the backs alone left rough or only partially worked .
The tops of the taller ones have shoulders cut into them as if to receive architraves ; and as this feature does not appear in the shorter ones , it may be inferred that their tops have been broken off , and that originally they were all of one length .
And here I may call attention to another singular feature of this colonnadenamely , that the sides or edges of each erect stone are slightly cut away to within six inches of its face , so as to leave a projection of about an inch and a half , as if to retain in place any slab fitted between the stones , and prevent it from falling outwards .
The same feature is found in the stones surrounding the great mound or Fortress , where its purpose becomes obvious , as we shall soon see .
Such is the general character of the exterior propylon , if I may so call it , of the structure called the Temple .
But within the line of stones surrounding it there are other features which claim our attention .
I have said that the interior is a mound of earth raised about eight feet above the general level .
But in the centre and towards the western side is an area sunk to the general level , 280 feet long by 190 feet broad .
It was originally defined on three sides by walls of rough stones which rose above the surface of the mound itself , but which are now in ruins .
If this sunken area communicated in any way with the more elevated interior parts of the structure , the means of communication , by steps or otherwise , have disappeared .
Across the end of the area not shut in by the mound , the line of stones which surrounds the Temple is continued without interruption ; but outside and connected with it is part of a small square of lesser stones , also erect , standing in the open plain .
Regarding the eastern side of the Temple , marked by the line of pilasters which I have described , as the front , we find here , at the distance of 57 feet , the traces of a rectangular structure , to which I have alluded as the " Palace , " which was composed of blocks of trachyte admirably cut , 8 to 10 feet long by 5 feet broad , with remains of what appears to have been a corridor 30 feet broad extending around it .
The piers which supported the Palace still remain , sunk deep in the ground , apparently resting on an even pavement of cut stones .
Remove the superstructures of the best - built edifices of our cities , and few , if any , would expose foundations laid with equal care , and none of them stones cut with such accuracy , or so admirably fitted together .
And I may say , once for all , carefully weighing my words , that in no part of the world have I seen stones cut with such mathematical precision and admirable skill as in Peru , and in no part of Peru are there any to surpass those which are scattered over the plain of Tiahuanuco .
The so - called Palace does not seem to have been placed in any symmetrical relation towards the Temple , although seemingly dependent on it ; nor , in fact , do any of the ancient structures here appear to have been erected on any geometric plan respecting each other , such as is apparent in the arrangement of most of the remains of aboriginal public edifices in Peru .
The Fortress stands to the southwest of the Temple , the sides of the two coinciding in their bearings , and is 64 feet distant from it .
As I have already said , it is a great mound of earth , originally rectangular in shape , 620 feet in length and 450 in width , and about 50 feet high .
It is much disfigured by the operations of treasure - seekers , who have dug into its sides and made great excavations from the summit , so that it now resembles rather a huge , natural , shapeless heap of earth than a work of human hands .
The few of the many stones that environed it , and which the destroyers have spared , nevertheless enable us to make out its original shape and proportions .
There are distinct evidences that the body of the mound was terraced , for there are still standing stones at different elevations , distant horizontally nine , eighteen , and thirty feet from the base .
There may have been more terraces than these lines of stones would indicate , but it is certain that there were at least three before reaching the summit .
This coincides with what Garcilasso tells us of the mound when first visited by the Spaniards .
He says , speaking of the ruins under notice : " Among them there is a mountain or hill raised by hand , which , on this account , is most admirable .
In order that the piled - up earth should not be washed away and the hill leveled , it was supported by great walls of stone .
Noone knows for what purpose this edifice was raised . "
Cieza de Leon , who himself visited Tiahuanuco soon after the Conquest , gives substantially the same description of the so - called Fortress .
On the summit of this structure are sections of the foundations of rectangular buildings , partly undermined , and partly covered up by the earth from the great modern excavation in the centre , which is upwards of 300 feet in diameter , and more than 60 feet deep .
A pool of water stands at its bottom .
This latest piece of barbarism was , however , only in continuation of some similar previous undertaking .
All over the Fortress and on its slopes lie large and regular blocks of stone , sculptured with portions of elaborate designs , which would only appear when the blocks were fitted together .
Some portions of the outer or lower wall are fortunately nearly intact , so that we are able to discover how it was constructed , and the plan and devices that were probably observed in all the other walls , as well as in some parts of the Temple .
In the first place , large , upright stones were planted in the ground , apparently resting on stone foundations .
They are about ten feet above the surface , accurately faced , perfectly aligned , and inclining slightly inwards towards the mound .
They are placed seventeen feet apart from centre to centre , and are very nearly uniform in size , generally about three feet broad and two feet in thickness .
Their edges are cut to present the kind of shoulders to which I alluded in describing the pilasters in front of the Temple , and of which the purpose now becomes apparent .
The space between the upright stones is filled in with a wall of carefully worked stones .
Those next the pilasters are cut with a shoulder to fit that of the pilaster they adjoin ; and they are each , moreover , cut with alternate grooves and projections , like mortise and tenon , so as to fit immovably into each other horizontally .
Vertically they are held in position by round holes drilled into the bottom and top of each stone at exact corresponding distances , in which , there is reason to believe , were placed pins of bronze .
We here see the intelligent devices of a people unacquainted with the uses of cement to give strength and permanence to their structures .
Nearly all the blocks of stone scattered over the plain show the cuts made to receive what is called the T clamp , and the round holes to receive the metal pins that were to retain the blocks in their places , vertically .
The Fortress has on its eastern side an apron , or dependent platform , 320 by 180 feet , of considerably less than half the elevation of the principal mound .
Like the rest of the structure , its outline was defined by upright stones , most of which , however , have disappeared .
The entrance seems to have been at its southeast corner , probably by steps , and to have been complicated by turnings from one terrace to another , something like those in some of the Inca fortresses .
The tradition runs that there are large vaults filled with treasure beneath the great mound , and that here commences a subterranean passage which leads to Cuzco , more than four hundred miles distant .
The excavations certainly reveal some curious subterranean features .
The excavation at its southwest corner has exposed a series of superimposed cut stones , apparently resting on a pavement of similar character , twelve feet below the surface .
It is said that Von Tschudi , when he visited the ruins , found some " caverns " beneath them ( but whether under the Fortress or not does not appear ) , into which he endeavored to penetrate , but " was glad to be pulled out , as he soon became suffocated . "
I found no such subterranean vaults or passages in any part of Tiahuanuco ; but I do not deny their existence .
To the southeast of the Fortress , and about two hundred and fifty paces distant , is a long line of wall in ruins , apparently a single wall , not connected with any other so as to form an enclosure .
But beyond it are the remains of edifices of which it is now impossible to form more than approximate plans .
One was measurably perfect when visited by D'Orbigny in 1833 , who fortunately has left a plan of it , more carefully made than others he has given us of ruins here or elsewhere .
Since 1833 , however , the iconoclasts have been at work with new vigor .
Unable to remove the massive stones composing the base of what was called the Hall of Justice , they mined them , and blew them up with gunpowder , removing many of the elaborately cut fragments to pave the cathedral of La Paz .
Enough remains to prove the accuracy of D'Orbigny 's plan , and to verify what Cieza de Leon wrote concerning these particular remains three hundred years ago .
The structure called the Hall of Justice occupied one end of a court something like that discoverable in the Temple .
In the first place , we must imagine a rectangle , 420 feet long by 370 broad , defined by a wall of cut stones , supporting on three sides an interior platform of earth 130 feet broad , itself enclosing a sunken area , or court , also defined by a wall of cut stones .
This court , which is of the general level of the plain , is 240 feet long and 160 broad .
At its eastern end is , or rather was , the massive edifice distinguished ' as the Hall of Justice , of which D'Orbigny says : " It is a kind of platform of well - cut blocks of stone , held together by copper clamps , of which only the traces remain .
It presents a level surface elevated six feet above the ground , 131 feet long and 23 broad , formed of enormous stones , eight making the length and two the breadth .
Some of these stones are 25 1 / 2 feet long by 14 feet broad , and 6 1/ 2 feet thick .
These are probably the ones measured by Oiego de Leon , who describes them as 30 feet long , 15 in width , and 6 in thickness .
Some are rectangular in shape , others of irregular form .
On the eastern side of the platform , and cut in the stones of which they form part , are three groups of alcoves , or seats .
One group occupies the central part of the monument , covering an extent of fifty - three feet , and is divided into seven compartments .
A group of three compartments occupies each extremity of the monument .
Between the central and side groups were reared monolithic doorways , similar in some respects to the large one , only more simple , the one to the west alone having a sculptured frieze similar to that of the great gateway .
In front of this structure , to the west , and about twenty feet distant , is a wall remarkable for the fine cutting of its stones , which are of a blackish basalt and very hard .
The stones arc all of equal dimensions , having a groove running around them , and each has a niche cut in it with absolute precision .
Every thing goes to show that the variety of the forms of the niches was one of the great ornaments of the walls , for on all sides we find stones variously cut , and evidently intended to fit together so as to form architectural ornaments . "
So much for the description of D'Orbigny .
I measured one of the blocks with a double niche , which is shown in the engraving of the terrace walls of the Fortress .
It is 6 feet 2 inches in length , 3 feet 7 inches broad , and 2 feet 6 inches thick .
The niches are sunk to the depth of 3 inches .
One of the monolithic doorways originally belonging to this structure is unquestionably that forming the entrance to the cemetery of Tiahuanuco .
This cemetery is an ancient rectangular mound , about a hundred paces long , sixty broad , and twenty feet high , situated midway between the village and the Fortress .
Its summit is enclosed by an adobe wall , and , as I have said , the entrance is through an ancient monolithic gateway , of which I give a front and rear view .
It is 7 feet 5 inches in extreme height , 5 feet 10 1 / 2 inches in extreme width , and 16 1/ 2 inches thick .
The doorway , or opening , is 6 feet 2 inches in height , and 2 feet 10 inches wide .
The frieze has a repetition of the ornaments composing the lower line of sculptures of the great monolith , but it has suffered much from time and violence .
The ornamentation of the back differs from that of the front , and seems to have been made to conform to the style adopted in the interior of the structure .
In making our measurement in the cemetery we disturbed a pack of lean , hungry , savage dogs of the Sierra - an indigenous species which had dug up the body of a newly - buried child from its shallow , frozen grave , and were ravenously devouring it .
They snarled at us with bristling backs and bloodshot eyes as we endeavored to drive them away horn their horrible feast by no means the first , as the numerous rough holes they had dug , the torn wrappings of the dead , and the skulls and fragments of human bodies scattered around too plainly attested .
I subsequently represented the matter to the cura , but he only shrugged his shoulders , ejaculating , " What does it matter ?
They have been baptized , and all Indians are brutes at the best . "
Returning to the Hall of Justice , we find , to the eastward of it , a raised area 175 feet square , and from 8 to 10 feet high , the outlines defined by walls of cut stone .
This seems to have escaped the notice of travelers ; at least , it is not mentioned by them .
In the centre of this area there seems to have been a building about fifty feet square , constructed of very large blocks of stone , which I have denominated the " Sanctuary . "
Within this , where it was evidently supported on piers , is the distinctive and most remarkable feature of the structure .
It is a great slab of stone 13 feet 4 inches square , and 20 inches in thickness .
It is impossible to describe it intelligibly , and I must refer to the engraving for a notion of its character .
It will be observed that there is an oblong area cut in the upper face of the stone , 7 feet 3 inches long , 5 feet broad , and 6 inches deep .
A sort of sunken " portico " 20 inches wide , 3 feet 9 inches long , is cut at one side , out of which opens what may be called the entrance , 22 inches wide , extending to the edge of the stone .
At each end of the " portico " is a flight of three miniature steps leading up to the general surface of the stone , and sunk in it , while at the side of the excavated area are three other flights of similar steps , but in relief .
They lead to the broadest part of the stone , where there are six mortises , 8 inches square , sunk in the stone .
6 inches , and forming two sides of a square , of 3 feet 7 inches on each side , and apparently intended to receive an equal number of square columns .
The external corners of the stone are sharp , but within six inches of the surface they are cut round on a radius of twelve inches .
I cannot resist the impression that this stone was intended as a miniature representation or model of a sacred edifice , or of some kind of edifice reared by the builders of the monuments of Tiahuanuco .
The entrance to the sunken area in the stone , the steps leading to the elevation surrounding it , and the naos opposite the entrance , defined perhaps by columns of bronze or stone set in the mortises and supporting some kind of roof , constituting the shrine within which stood the idol or symbol of worship all these features would seem to indicate a symbolic design in this monument .
The building in which it stood , on massive piers that still remain , was constructed of blocks of stone , some of them nearly fourteen feet in length and of corresponding size and thickness , and was not so large as to prohibit the probability that it was covered in .
Looking at the plan of the Temple , and of the enclosure to the area , one side of which was occupied by the building called the Hall of Justice , we cannot fail to observe features suggestive of the plan cut in the great stone which I have called symbolical .
The most remarkable monument in Tiahuanuco , as already intimated , is the great monolithic gateway .
Its position is indicated by the letter m in the plan .
It now stands erect , and is described as being in that position by every traveler except D'Orbigny , who visited the ruins in 1833 , and who says it had then fallen down .
I give two views of this unique monument , both from photographs , of some interest to me , as the first it was ever my fortune to be called on to take .
It will be seen that it has been broken the natives say by lightning the fracture extending from the upper right - hand angle of the opening , so that the two parts lap by each other slightly , making the sides of the doorway incline towards each other ; whereas they are , or were , perfectly .
vertical and parallel a distinguishing side two small niches , below which , also on either side , is a single larger niche .
The stone itself is a dark and exceedingly hard trachyte .
It is faced with a precision that no skill can excel ; its lines are perfectly drawn , and its right angles turned with an accuracy that the most careful geometer could not surpass .
Barring some injuries and defacements , and some slight damages by weather , I do not believe there exists a better piece of stone - cutting , the material considered , on this or the other continent .
The front , especially the part covered by sculpture , has a fine finish , as near a true polish as trachyte can be made to bear .
The lower line of sculpture is 7 1 / 2 inches broad , and is unbroken ; the three above it are 8 inches high , cut up in cartouches , or squares , of equal width , but interrupted in the centre , immediately over the doorway , by the figure in high - relief to which I have alluded .
This figure , with its ornaments , covers a space of 32 by 21 1/2 inches .
There are consequently three ranges or tiers of squares on each side of this figure , eight in each range , or forty - eight in all .
The figures represented in these squares have human bodies , feet , and hands ; each holds a sceptre ; they are winged ; but the upper and lower series have human heads wearing crowns , represented in profile , while the heads of the sixteen figures in the line between them have the heads of condors .
The central and principal figure is angularly but boldly cut , in a style palpably conventional .
The head is surrounded by a series of what may be called rays , each terminating in a circle , the head of the condor , or that of a tiger , all conventionally but forcibly treated .
In each hand he grasps two staves or sceptres of equal length with his body , the lower end of the right - hand sceptre terminating in the head of the condor , and the upper in that of the tiger , while the lower end of the left - hand sceptre terminates in the head of the tiger , and the upper is bifurcate , and has two heads of the condor .
The staves or sceptres are not straight and stiff , but curved as if to represent serpents , and elaborately ornamented as if to represent the sinuous action of the serpent in motion .
The radiations from the head which I have called rays , for want of a better termseem to have the same action .
An ornamented girdle surrounds the waist of this principal figure , from which depends a double fringe .
It stands upon a kind of base or series of figures approaching nearest in character to the architectural ornament called grecques , each extremity of which , however , terminates in the crowned head of the tiger or the condor .
The face has been somewhat mutilated , but shows some peculiar figures extending from the eyes diagonally across the cheeks , terminating also in the heads of the animals just named .
The winged human - headed and condor - headed figures in the three lines of squares are represented kneeling on one knee , with their faces turned to the great central figure , as if in adoration , and each one holds before him a staff or sceptre .
The sceptres of the figures in the two upper rows are bifurcate , and correspond exactly with the sceptre in the left hand of the central figure , while the sceptres of the lower tier correspond with that represented in his right hand .
The relief of all these figures is scarcely more than two - tenths of an inch ; the minor features are indicated by very delicate lines , slightly incised , which form subordinate figures , representing the heads of condors , tigers , and serpents .
Most of us have seen pictures and portraits of men and animals , which under close attention resolve themselves into representatives of a hundred other things , but which are so artfully arranged as to produce a single broad effect .
So with these winged figures .
Every part , the limbs , the garb , all separate themselves into miniatures of the symbols that run all through the sculptures on this singular monument .
The fourth or lower row of sculpture differs entirely from the rows above it .
It consists of repetitions seventeen in all smaller and in low - relief , of the head of the great central figure , surrounded by corresponding rays , terminating in like manner with the heads of animals .
These are arranged alternately at the top and bottom of the line of sculpture , within the zigzags or grecques , and every angle terminates in the head of a condor .
The three outer columns of winged figures , and the corresponding parts of the lower line of sculpture , are only blocked out , and have none of the elaborate , incised ornamentation discoverable in the central parts of the monument .
A very distinct line separates these unfinished sculptures from those portions that are finished , which is most marked in the lower tier .
On each side of this line , standing on the rayed heads to which I have alluded , placed back to back , and looking in opposite directions , are two small but interesting figures of men , crowned with something like a plumed cap , and holding to their mouths what appear to be trumpets .
Although only three inches high , these little figures are ornamented in the same manner as the larger ones , with the heads of tigers , condors , etc .
These are the only sculptures on the face of the great monolith of Tiahuanuco .
I shall not attempt to explain their significance .
D'Orbigny finds in the winged figures with human heads symbols or representations of conquered chiefs coming to pay their homage to the ruler who had his capital in Tiahuanuco , and who , as the founder of sun-worship and the head of the Church as of the State , was invested with divine attributes as well as with the insignia of power .
The figures with condors ' heads , the same fanciful philosopher supposes , may represent the chiefs of tribes who had not yet fully accepted civilization , and were therefore represented without the human profile , as an indication of their unhappy and undeveloped state .
By parity of interpretation , we may take it that the eighteen unfinished figures were those of as many chieftains as the ruler of Tiahuanuco had it in his mind to reduce , and of which , happily , just two - thirds had claims to be regarded as civilized , and , when absorbed , to be perpetuated with human heads , and not with those of condors .
Another French writer , M. Angrand , finds a coincidence between these sculptures and those of Central America and Mexico , having a corresponding mythological and symbolical significance , thus establishing identity of origin and intimate relationship between the builders of Tiahuanuco and those of Palenque , Ocosingo , and Xochicalco .
Leibnitz tells us that nothing exists without a cause ; and it is not to be supposed that the sculptures under notice were made without a motive .
They are probably symbolical ; but with no knowledge of the religious ideas and conceptions of the ancient people whose remains they are , it is idle to attempt to interpret them .
Nowhere else in Peru , or within the whole extent of the Inca empire , do we find any similar sculptures .
They are , as regards Inca art , quite as unique in Peru as they would be on Boston Common or in the New York Central Park .
The reverse of the great monolith shows a series of friezes over the doorway , five in number , of which the engraving will give a better idea than any description .
Above the entrance on either hand are two niches , twelve by nine inches in the excavation .
It will be observed that those on the right have a sort of sculptured cornice above them which those on the left have not .
The second one on the left , it will also be observed , is not complete , but evidently intended to be finished out on another block , which was to form a continuation of the wall of which the gateway itself was designed to be a part .
Indeed , as I have said , nearly all the blocks of stone scattered over the plain are cut with parts of niches and other architectural features , showing that they were mere fragments of a general design , which could only be clearly apparent when they were properly fitted together .
The lower niches , now on a level with the ground , show that the monolith is sunk deeply in the soil .
They exhibit some peculiar features .
At each inner corner above and below are vertical sockets , apparently to receive the pivots of a door , extending upwards and downwards seven inches in the stone .
D'Orbigny avers that he discovered the stains of bronze in these orifices and I have no doubt that these niches had doors , possibly of bronze , hinged in these sockets , and so firmly that it was necessary to use chisels ( the marks of which are plain ) to cut into the stone and disengage them .
These large niches are 28.2 inches by 18.2 inches wide .
On the face of the monolith , on each side of the doorway , but near the edges of the stone , are two mortises 10 inches by 9 , and 6 inches deep , and 12 inches by 6 , and 3 1/ 2 inches deep respectively , which are not shown in the drawings published by D'Orbigny and some others .
I very much question if this remarkable stone occupies its original position .
How far it has sunk in the ground it was impossible for me to determine , for the earth was frozen hard , and we had no means of digging down to ascertain .
D'Orbigny , as I have already said , states it was fallen when he visited it .
Who has since raised it , and for what purpose , it is impossible to say .
Noone that we could find either knew or cared to know anything about it .
It seems to me not unlikely that it had a position in the hollow square of the structure called the Temple , in some building corresponding with that called the Hall of Justice .
Or , perhaps , it had a place in the structure enclosing the stone I have ventured to call symbolical .
It is neither so large nor so heavy that it may not be moved by fifty men with ropes , levers , and rollers and although we no not know of any reason why it should have been removed from its original position , we know that many of the heaviest stones have been thus moved , including the monolithic doorway at the entrance of the cemetery .
In addition to the various features of Tiahuanuco already enumerated , I must not neglect to notice the vast blocks of unhewn and partially hewn stones , that evidently have never entered into any structure , which lie scattered among the ruins .
The positions of two or three are indicated in the plan .
The one to the northeast of the Temple is 26 by 17 , and 3 1/2 feet aboveground .
It is of red sandstone , with deep grooves crossing each other at right angles in the centre , twenty inches deep , as if an attempt had been made to cut the stone into four equal parts .
Another of nearly equal dimensions , partly hewn , was between the Temple and the Fortress .
Another , boat - shaped and curiously grooved , lies to the northwest of the great mound .
It measures upwards of forty feet in length , and bears the marks of transportation from a considerable distance .
There were formerly a number of specimens of sculpture in Tiahuanuco besides the two monolithic gateways I have described .
Says Oiego de Leon : " Beyond this hill [ referring to the Fortress ] are two stone idols , of human shape , and so curiously carved that they seem to be the work of very able masters .
They are as big as giants , with long garments differing from those the natives wear , and seem to have some ornament on their heads . "
These , according to D'Orbigny , were broken into pieces by blasts of powder inserted between the shoulders , and not even the fragments remain on the plain of Tiahuanuco .
The head of one lies by the side of the road , four leagues distant , on the way to La Paz , whither an attempt was made to carry it .
I did not see it , but I reproduce the sketch of it given by D'Orbigny , merely remarking that I have no doubt the details are quite as erroneous as those of the figures portrayed by the same author on the great monolith .
The head is 3 feet 6 inches high and 2 feet 7 inches in diameter ; so that if the other proportions of the figure were corresponding , the total height of the statue would be about eighteen feet .
D'Orbigny found several other sculptured figures among the ruins ; one with a human head and wings rudely represented ; another of an animal resembling a tiger , etc. Castelnau mentions " an immense lizard cut in stone , " and other sculptured figures .
M. Angrand , whose notes have been very judiciously used by M. Desjardains , speaks of eight such figures in the village of Tiahuanuco , besides two in La Paz , and one , broken , on the road thither .
I found but two ; rough sculptures of the human head and bust , in coarse red sandstone , one of a man and the other of a woman , standing by the side of the gateway of the church of Tiahuanuco .
They are between four and five feet high , roughly cut , much defaced , and more like the idols which I found in Nicaragua , and have represented in my work on that country , than any others I have seen elsewhere .
Among the stones taken from the ruins , and worked into buildings in the town of Tiahuanuco , are a number of cylindrical columns cut from a single block , with capitals resembling the Doric .
One of these stands on each side of the entrance to the court of the church , 6 feet high and 14 inches in diameter .
There are also many caps of square columns or pilasters , besides numbers of stones cut with deep single or double grooves , as if to serve for water - conduits when fitted together a purpose the probability of which is sanctioned by finding some stones with channels leading off at right angles , like the elbows in our own water - pipes .
The stones composing the structures of Tiahuanuco , as already said , are mainly red sandstone , slate - colored trachyte , and a dark , hard basalt .
None of these rocks are found in situ on the plain , but there has been much needless speculation as to whence they were obtained .
There are great cliffs of red sandstone about five leagues to the north of the ruins , on the road to the Desaguadero ; and , on the isthmus of Yunguyo , connecting the peninsula of Copacabana with the mainland , are found both basaltic and trachytic rocks , identical with the stones in the ruins .
Many blocks , hewn or partially hewn , are scattered over the isthmus .
It is true this point is forty miles distant from Tiahuanuco in a right line , and that , if obtained here , the stones must have been carried twenty - five miles by water and fifteen by land .
That some of them were brought from this direction is indicated by scattered blocks all the way from the ruins to the lake ; but it is difficult to conceive how they were transported from one shore to the other .
There is no timber in the region of which to construct rafts or boats ; and the only contrivances for navigation are floats , made of reeds , closely bound into cylinders , tapering at the ends , which are turned up so as to give them something of the outline of boats .
Before they become water - soaked these floats are exceedingly light and buoyant .
As to how the stones of Tiahuanuco were cut , and with what kind of instruments , are questions which I do not propose to discuss .
I may , nevertheless , observe that I have no reason to believe that the builders of Tiahuanuco had instruments differing essentially in form or material from those used by the Peruvians generally , which , it is certain , were of champi , a kind of bronze .
I have thus rapidly presented an outline of the remains of Tiahuanuco - remains most interesting , but in such an absolute condition of ruin as almost to defy inquiry or generalization .
Regarding them as in some respects the most important of any in Peru , I have gone more into details concerning them than I shall do in describing the better - preserved and more intelligible monuments with which we shall have hereafter to deal .
We find on a review that , apart from five considerable mounds of earth now shapeless , with one exception , there are distinct and impressive traces of five structures , built of stones or defined by them the Fortress , the Temple , the Palace , the Hall of Justice , and the Sanctuary terms used more to distinguish than truly characterize them .
The structure called the Fortress may indeed have been used for the purpose implied in the name .
Terraced , and each terrace faced with stones , it may have been , as many of the terraced pyramids of Mexico were , equally temple and fortress , where the special protection of the divinity to whom it was reared was expected to be interposed against an enemy .
But the absence of water and the circumscribed area of the structure seem to weigh against the supposition of a defensive origin or purpose .
But , whatever its object , the Fortress dominated the plain ; and when the edifices that crowned its summit were perfect , it must have been by far the most imposing structure in Tiahuanuco .
The Temple seems to me to be the most ancient of all the distinctive monuments of Tiahuanuco .
It is the American Stonehenge .
The stones defining it are rough and frayed by time .
The walls between its rude pilasters were of uncut stones ; and although it contains the most elaborate single monument among the ruins , and notwithstanding the erect stones constituting its portal are the most striking of their kind , it nevertheless has palpable signs of age , and an air of antiquity which we discover in none of its kindred monuments .
Of course , its broad area was never roofed in , whatever may have been the case with smaller , interior buildings no longer traceable .
We must rank it , therefore , with those vast open temples ( for of its sacred purpose we can scarcely have a doubt ) , of which Stonehenge and Avebury , in England , are examples , and which we find in Brittany , in Denmark , in Assyria , and on the steppes of Tartary , as well as in the Mississippi Valley .
It seems to me to have been the nucleus around which the remaining monuments of Tiahuanuco sprung up , and the model upon which some of them were fashioned .
How far , in shape or arrangement , it may have been symbolical , I shall not undertake to say ; but I think that students of antiquity are generally prepared to concede a symbolical significance to the primitive pagan temples as well as to the cruciform edifices of Christian times .
We can hardly conceive of remains so extensive as those of Tiahuanuco , except as indications of a large population , and as evidences of the previous existence on or near the spot of a considerable city .
But we find nowhere in the vicinity any decided traces of ancient habitations , such as abound elsewhere in Peru , in connection with most public edifices .
Again , the region around is cold , and for the most part arid and barren .
Elevated nearly thirteen thousand feet above the sea , no cereals grow except barley , which often fails to mature , and seldom , if ever , so perfects itself as to be available for seed .
The maize is dwarf and scant , and uncertain in yield ; and the bitter potato and quinoa constitute almost the sole articles of food for the pinched and impoverished inhabitants .
This is not , prima facie , a region for nurturing or sustaining a large population , and certainly not one wherein we should expect to find a capital .
Tiahuanuco may have been a sacred spot or shrine , the position of which was determined by an accident , an augury , or a dream , but I can hardly believe that it was a seat of dominion .
Some vague traditions point to Tiahuanuco as the spot whence Manco Capac , the founder of the Inca dynasty , took his origin , and whence he started northwards to teach the rude tribes of the Sierra religion and government ; and some late writers , D'Orbigny and Castelnau among them , find reasons for believing that the whole Inca civilization originated here , or was only a reflex of that which found here a development , never afterwards equaled , long before the golden staff of the first Inca sunk into the earth where Cuzco was founded , thus fixing through superhuman design the site of the imperial city .
But the weight of tradition points to the rocky islands of Lake Titicaca as the cradle of the Incas , whence Manco Capac and Mama Ocllo , his wife and sister , under the behest of their father , the Sun , started forth on their beneficent mission .
Certain it is that this lake and its islands were esteemed sacred , and that on the latter were reared structures , if not so imposing as many other and perhaps later ones , yet of peculiar sanctity .
But before starting on our visit to that lake and its sacred islands , I must relate some of the incidents of our stay in Tiahuanuco .
CHAPTER XVI .
AT TIAHUANUCO , AND TO THE SACRED ISLANDS .
Suspected of Treasure - hunting .
-The Guardian of the Tapadas . -The Potato - feast and Corpus Christi . -The Indian Celebration . -Music , Dancing , and Costumes . -Departure from Tiahuanuco . - Village of Guaque .- Cattle feeding in the Lake. - Tortora Bridge over the Outlet of the Lake . - Entry into the Village of Desaguadero .
- A Convivial Cura.-Hospitalities of the Caballeros and Señoritas . -Mine Host the Comandante . - Zepita .-Scenes on the Road. - Comparatively Fertile Region .-Village of Yunguyo .
- A Pressing Invitation .
-A Dinner Compliment .
- A Legal Luminary .
I HAVE no doubt , the Cura of Tiahuanuco believes to this day that our visit to the ruins was for the purpose of digging for treasures , and that we had some itinerario , or guide , obtained from the archives of Old Spain to direct our search .
What the Indians themselves thought , they did not tell us .
But on our very first day among the monuments , and within an hour after we had pitched our photographic tent and got out our instruments , we became aware of the presence of a very old man , withered , wrinkled , and bent with the weight of years .
His hair was scant and gray , his eyes rheumy , and his face disfigured by a great quid of coca that he carried in one cheek .
He wore tattered pantaloons of coarse native cloth , made from the fleece of the llama , kept together by thongs ; his poncho was old and ragged ; and the long woollen cap , that was pulled low over his forehead , was greasy from use and stiff with dirt .
He had an earthen vessel containing water suspended from his waist , besides a pouch of skin containing coca , and a little gourd of unslacked lime .
In his hand he carried a small double - edged stone - cutter 's pick or hammer .
He paid us no perceptible attention , but wandered about deliberately among the blocks of cut stone that strew the ground , and finally selected one of a kind of white tufa , which he rolled slowly and with many a pause up to the very foot of the great monolith , then seated himself on the ground , placed it between his legs , and after preparing a new quid of coca , began to work on the stone , apparently with the purpose of cutting it in halves .
He worked at it all day with small effect , and during the whole time neither noticed us nor responded to our questions .
Just before returning to the village , in the edge of the chill night , I prevailed on one of our arrieros , who could speak Aymara , to ask him what was his occupation .
He got the curt answer from the old man , that he was " cutting out a cross . "
Every morning he was at the ruins before us , and he never left until after we did at night .
All day he pecked away at the stone between his knees , apparently absorbed in his work and oblivious of our presence .
After a time we came to look upon him as an integral part of the monuments , and should have missed him as much as the great monolith itself .
One evening I mentioned the old man to the cura , who again put on mystery , took me out for a turn in the plaza , and explained in whispers , heavy with fumes of cañaso , that the old man was nothing more nor less than a spy on our doings , and that we made no movement in any direction that he did not carefully observe .
" He is , " said the padre , " one of the guardians of the tapadas .
He is more than a hundred years old .
He was with Tupac Amaru when he undertook to overturn the Spanish power , and he led the Aymaras when they sacked the town of Huancane , and slew every white man , woman , and child that fell into their hands .
He is a heathen still , and throws coca on the apachetas .
Ah ! if I only knew what that old man knows of the tapadas , señor , " exclaimed the cura , with fervor , " I should not waste my life among these barbarians !
You can pity me !
And for the love of God , señor , if you do come across the treasures , share them with me !
I can't live much longer here ! "
And the padre burst into a maudlin paroxysm of tears .
Von Tschudi , when he was at Tiahuanuco , found or obtained some ancient relics small stone idols , if I remember rightly  but had not proceeded many miles on his way to La Paz before he was surrounded by a party of Indians from the town , and compelled to surrender them .
We suffered no molestation , although there is no doubt we were closely watched , and that the deaf and apparently almost sightless old stone - cutter was a spy on our actions .
I have already said that our visit to Tiahuanuco was coincident in time with the Chuño and Corpus Christi .
The population of the place , as indeed of the whole region , is Indian , the white priests , officials , and landed proprietors being so few as hardly to deserve enumeration .
These Indians are of the Aymara as distinguished from the Quichua family , and are a swarthier , more sullen , and more cruel race ........
Only a few days before the largest BitTorrent tracker will celebrate its 5th anniversary , the Pirate Bay reached a new milestone .
The site now tracks 25 million peers , which is more than the entire populations of Sweden , Norway , Finland , Iceland and Denmark combined .
When The Pirate Bay was founded , November 2003 , it was a site targeted at the Swedish population .
This soon changed however , when the founders found out that most visitors came from outside Sweden , or even Scandinavia .
In the years to come , The Pirate Bay established itself as the largest BitTorrent tracker on the Internet .
Recently , the number of peers that use the tracker at any given point in time grew larger than the entire population of Scandinavia .
In fact , over the past 12 months , the number of peers more than tripled , to 25 million .
At the time of publication , The Pirate Bay tracks 25.064.271 peers , divided over close to 1.856.243 torrent files .
Quite an accomplishment when you consider that it is not even 2 months ago since they the 15 million mark .
Coincidentally , the server that tracks the statistics crashed due to a hard drive failure , right around the time they reached the new milestone .
We asked Peter Sunde , co-founder of the site , how this huge surge can be explained , and whether the traffic to the site is also increasing .
“ I think it ’s because of the new updates to the software and recent additions in hardware , ” Peter told Torrent Freak .
“ We ’re putting up new trackers all the time to cope with the traffic increase .
And yes , the traffic to the site is also increasing .
New visitor records every week . ”
In an attempt to make their “ torrent tracking ” record official , The Pirate Bay applied for an entry in the Guinness book of world records last week .
A record that they will probably break themselves every weekend .
It is estimated that The Pirate Bay tracks 50 % of all public torrents , which means that they are responsible for a significant part of the total Internet traffic .
“ It ’s just weird , ” says Peter in response to these mind boggling statistics .
“ It ’s cool to do something that big , but it ’s scary that it ’s so few people managing that of a big system .
PLEASE , people , start more trackers !
Put them out there , have open systems !
We need the diversity . ”
It might indeed be a good idea to spread the load a bit .
There are plenty of private trackers , but good and reliable open trackers remain scarce .
Meanwhile , The Pirate Bay will continue to update their hardware , and tweak their software , while working on side - projects such as the recently updated email service Slopsbox .
Hollywood will probably not be too happy when they hear that the Swedish deviant has broken yet another record , but Peter and the other Pirate Bay founders could n’t care less what they think .
Peter has a message for them though : “ Stop hating the future .
Be smart and come over from the dark side . ”
Typically , we only hear clergy talk about violent videogames in a negative way .
But Brooklyn Rabbi Micah Kelber has an op -ed in Jewish media outlet The Forward this weekend , in which he describes , at length and with a lot of subtlety , how Activision - produced ( ATVI ) World War II - themed videogame ' Call of Duty : World At War ' helped him confront his life - long fear of Nazi persecution .
The whole thing is worth reading , but a taste of what the Rabbi has to say :
As a Jew , being involved in virtually ending World War II allows you to experience the closest thing possible to killing the sense of victimhood created by the Holocaust .
And you do it without actually hurting any real people .
In fact , it ’s so satisfying that when you get to shoot down the golden eagle on the Reichstag , while sniping headshots at flame - throwing Nazis , you simply do n’t want the war to end ...
The surprising benefit of the game was that throughout my entire life , since sneaking into the synagogue library with David Yagobian and paging through a book of Nazi medical experiments , I have had nightmares about Nazis .
Jewish summer camp did n’t help .
In games like “ Call of Duty , ” you get unlimited lives ; you keep playing the game until you are victorious .
It ’s a safe place .
When your character dies , you may have to go back to a checkpoint , but this is simply inconvenient , never tragic or final .
You will always have another chance to kill your demons .

Three deer have been caught on CCTV running amok in a beer shop in Pennsylvania in America .
Beer Arena employee Tony Shadler says he was caught off - guard and closely missed being hit , as the deer ran in behind customers who had just left .
After running through aisles and knocking over beer crates , the deer left empty handed and unhurt through the backdoor .
Democrats are hailing a ruling from a three - judge panel saying it will make it difficult for Coleman to win .
Court leaves Coleman with little hope
After seven weeks of reviewing a hand recount , millions spent on legal fees and a tough legal ruling Tuesday afternoon , Norm Coleman still looks like the loser in the Minnesota Senate race .
But even as Democrat Al Franken ’s campaign celebrated a three - judge panel ’s decision to put at most 400 ballots back in play , the Coleman camp is still promising to take its case to the Minnesota Supreme Court .
And it ’s not ruling out an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court or filing a new lawsuit in federal district court .
Advertisement
Ben Ginsberg , a central player for George W. Bush during the 2000 Florida recount and Coleman ’s lawyer , said , “ If the court does not reverse its decision , it will give us no choice but to appeal that order to the Minnesota Supreme Court . ”
And Ginsberg said it was “ an open legal question ” on whether the candidate leading after the Minnesota Supreme Court rules should be certified the winner and thus be seated in the Senate .
In its ruling Tuesday , the three - judge panel ordered absentee ballots to be turned over to the Minnesota secretary of state ’s office by April 6 .
The ballots would then be counted in open court by April 7 .
Once the ballots are counted on April 7 , the court will very likely issue a final opinion , which can be appealed to the state Supreme Court within 10 days .
That means Minnesota will most likely be without a second senator for at least the rest of April , a boon to the GOP , which is trying to prevent Democrats from getting their 59th seat in a chamber where 60 is king .
The court case has been exhaustive — three judges spent seven weeks reviewing 19,181 pages of filings , 1,717 exhibits , and hearing testimony from 142 witnesses .
The ruling was a huge blow to the Coleman campaign , which at early points of the trial wanted the court to consider 4,800 ballots but ultimately asked the panel to count an additional 1,360 .
All told , the math really does n’t look good for Coleman after this decision , as he would have to win an overwhelming majority of these 400 ballots in question to overcome Franken ’s 225 - vote lead , and not every one of these ballots will necessarily be opened and recounted .
“ We are obviously pleased , ” Marc Elias , chief legal counsel for Franken , said in a conference call with reporters .
“ Obviously , the math is going to be very difficult for former Sen. Coleman and his legal team .
...
We feel pretty good about where we stand , but we are going to wait until Tuesday for these ballots to be opened and counted . ”
Conversely , a GOP staffer close to Coleman said : “ It ’s not looking good . ”
Coleman ’s camp had already promised a Minnesota Supreme Court appeal if these absentee ballots did n’t turn the race around , but if they lose that round as well , there will be severe pressure for Coleman to bow out , and Senate Democrats may start clamoring to seat Franken in the Senate .
Ginsberg called the Tuesday ruling an “ April Fool ’s Day order . ”
“ We said that this court ’s Friday the 13th order is wrong , and now their almost April Fool ’s Day order is equally wrong . ”
Coleman also has the full backing of Senate Republicans , who are happy to keep the appeal going as long as possible , even though many Republicans privately acknowledge that Coleman ’s case is a long shot .
“ The NRSC has and will continue to support Norm Coleman ’s efforts to ensure that thousands of Minnesotans are not disenfranchised , that ballots exist before they are counted , and that every legitimate vote that was cast is counted once in Minnesota , ” said Brian Walsh , a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee .
But Senate Democrats are clamoring to have Franken seated as soon as legally possible .
“ Sen .
Reid is looking forward to the final resolution of this case by the Minnesota courts so that Al Franken can finally be seated as the new senator from Minnesota , ” said Jim Manley , a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev . ) .
The court did not rule on Coleman ’s argument that the different methods Minnesota counties use for counting absentee ballots violated the Constitution ’s equal protection clause or on 132 ballots deemed missing from the Minneapolis area .
It ’s unclear whether the court will address those issues before it makes a final ruling .
In the ruling , the court also said it reviewed each ballot “ on a ballot - by - ballot basis ” to determine whether they complied with state and federal law .
“ Contestants ’ [ Coleman 's ] presumptions are not reasonable in light of the small number of absentee ballots at issue in this election contest and the fact that these absentee ballots have already been carefully reviewed as many as three times by state and local officials , ” the court said .
Coleman was widely expected to lose before this three - judge panel and is probably going to appeal the order to the state Supreme Court .
If he loses before the state court , Coleman would have the option of appealing directly to the U.S. Supreme Court — or filing a brand - new suit in a federal district court .
In the ruling , the court determined that the 400 ballots should be counted “ based upon a thorough review of the evidence and a finding that the voter complied with Minnesota law , ” as well as ballots with “ relevant information ” that was redacted or illegible and absentee ballots where the court requires the original to make a finding .
“ To be clear , not every absentee ballot identified in this order will ultimately be opened and counted , ” the ruling said .
And making matters even murkier for Coleman is that the order appears to identify ballots that both sides wanted opened .
Elias called the order “ a win for the people of Minnesota ” and said Gov. Tim Pawlenty , a Republican , should certify the election if Franken remains ahead in the count .
When the case will end could depend on how much patience the Minnesota public has with Coleman .
If Coleman wins over the public in arguing that thousands of voters are being disenfranchised by the court ’s ruling , he could buy time to continue pursuing the case .
Otherwise , he ’ll almost certainly damage any future runs for public office , including a rumored bid for governor .

KABUL ( Reuters ) - More than a thousand Afghans signed up on Thursday to say they wanted to go and fight Israel in the Gaza Strip , many of them blaming the United States which has some 30,000 troops in Afghanistan , for supporting the Jewish state .
Accusations by Taliban militants and some Muslim clerics that Israel and its main ally , the United States , aim to destroy Islam have a strong impact on public opinion in Afghanistan , where Washington plans to almost double its troop numbers this year .
Scores of young men crowded into the library of Kabul ’s Milad ul - Nabi mosque , lined with banners reading “ Death to Israel ” and “ Death to America , ” to sign up to fight Israel .
“ More than a thousand brave Afghans registered their names here to fight Israeli troops in Gaza , ” said Habibullah Assam , the imam of the mosque and organizer of the campaign .
“ Several hundred Afghans , including doctors and teachers , have also volunteered to give blood to help the miserable people of Palestine , ” he said .
“ The acts of Israel against the innocent Muslims of Gaza are barbaric and inhumane and widely helped by the Americans , ” Assam said , adding that nearly 10,000 people across Afghanistan had so far volunteered to fight in Gaza .
One Afghan at the mosque said he fought in Chechnya in the 1990s after being trained by the Pakistan - based Lashkar - e - Taiba Islamist militant group which India says is behind the Mumbai attacks .
“ I have the military training and I will do whatever possible to go to Gaza to at least fire one bullet toward Israel , ” Mohammad Ayaas said .
“ I will be the luckiest person to die beside my Muslim brothers fighting for an honorable cause . ”
The 13 - day Israeli operation against Hamas in Gaza led to protests in Afghanistan last week .
While reaching Gaza from Afghanistan is all - but impossible , many of the volunteers said they would take revenge on U.S. troops inside Afghanistan instead .
“ Infidels are killing Muslims everyday and the United States is saying Israel ’s offensive is just , ” said Mohammad Akram , a shopkeeper .
“ If we ca n’t reach Gaza , we should seek revenge on Israel ’s allies in our own country like the Taliban do . ”
U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan are struggling to contain a virulent Taliban insurgency to expel them and topple the Western - backed Afghan government .
U.S. President - elect Barack Obama has vowed to make Afghanistan a foreign policy priority once he comes to office on January 20 .

In an above - average house in an upscale neighbourhood of a decidedly well - to - do area , the wine flows , the laughter cascades and the canapes are politely declined .
About 15 women are gathered in the spacious kitchen / dining room of this comfortable home in California 's Orange County , all showing off their jewellery .
Incomes in " The OC " are 25 % higher than average for the state and unemployment lower .
But even here , the US recession is biting .
House prices have fallen nearly 30 % in a year and now about one home in every 250 is at risk of foreclosure , or repossession .
America 's wealthy are hurting , so this is a get - together with a difference : a gold party .
Guests bring old unwanted jewellery and sell it .
It is tupperware for tough times .
Not so much a bring - and - buy as a bye - to - bling .
Erin Stevenson says the parties are a fun way to sell Gold parties happen in other states but , in California , Erin Stevenson 's company has about 11 reps who organise up to three parties a week .
Erin has never known it as busy .
At the home of hostess Stephanie West , who recently retired early from the airline industry , Erin and her team of buyers test guests ' trinkets for quality and weight .
Stephanie herself has a bag full of gold jewellery she has had for years , presents from old boyfriends that she will never wear again .
Many others clutch the same : once valued , now unwanted gifts .
Erin pays about 60 % of the market price , and then sells the gold in bulk to a refinery for about 95 % of the going rate .
So the refinery pays below market rates , Erin makes a profit and , at more than $ 900 ( £ 640 ) an ounce , the guests feel like they are getting money for nothing .
Here , at least , gold parties are not a way to make ends meet .
They offer easy liquidity for the cash - strapped middle - classes .
Each customer 's gold is weighed and tested for quality Many say they will spend the money they realise on treats - a piece of art they could not otherwise justify or a meal for the family .
Amie Larson , who says she holds down four jobs , says she is selling gold that was a gift from her ex-husband in order to pay for her new husband 's birthday party .
After the gold is weighed and sorted by carat , Erin calculates the total worth for each guest .
The wine has helped ease the mood but it is when the cheques get written that the party really starts to swing .
And the amounts are not small .
Hostess Stephanie Hunt made $ 477 and salon - worker Amie Larson $ 416 , while another guest , Bebe Bach , came out tops with $ 541 .
Others walked off with about $ 100 or $ 200 .
One told me : " It 's $ 100 more than I came in with . "
As America 's recession bites harder , it seems even the country 's wealthier residents are willing to make every penny count .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China is not afraid of the Internet , its Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday , even as access to the popular video sharing site YouTube was apparently blocked .
A screenshot of YouTube.com , taken on July 15 , 2008 .
REUTERS/www.youtube.com
YouTube , owned by search giant Google Inc , has been unavailable for users in China , which filters the Internet for content critical of the Communist Party , since late on Monday .
“ Many people have a false impression that the Chinese government fears the Internet .
In fact it is just the opposite , ” Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told reporters .
He said he did not know about YouTube being blocked .
A Google spokesman confirmed that access to the video site has been blocked in China over the past 24 hours .
“ YouTube is currently blocked in China .
We do n’t know the reason for the blockage , but are working as quickly as possible to restore access to our users in China , ” said spokesman Scott Rubin .
Rubin would not comment on whether YouTube has contacted the Chinese authorities to confirm it has officially been blocked or if it is a technical problem .
Both Google and YouTube have previously been blocked in China for brief periods , according to the company .
In the past Chinese authorities have blocked specific videos .
Access to YouTube had been spotty earlier in March , the one - year anniversary of widespread protests by Tibetans against Chinese rule .
Qin said China ’s 300 million Internet users and 100 million blogs showed “ China ’s Internet is open enough , but also needs to be regulated by law in order to prevent the spread of harmful information and for national security . ”
An Internet crackdown that began in January has closed hundreds of Chinese sites , including a popular blog hosting site and several sites popular with Tibetans .
It has been described by analysts as another step in the Party ’s battle to stifle dissent in a year of sensitive anniversaries , including the 20th anniversary of the government ’s bloody crackdown on the pro-democracy Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 .
YouTube , which has country - specific sites in 23 countries , has in the past been blocked in certain countries , including Turkey and Thailand in disputes over specific videos .
Continuation of : The Power of Positivist Thinking
Consider this statement :
The ultra-rich , who control the majority of our planet 's wealth , spend their time at cocktail parties and salons while millions of decent hard - working people starve .
A soft positivist would be quite happy with this proposition .
If we define " the ultra- rich " as , say , the richest two percent of people , then a quick look at the economic data shows they do control the majority of our planet 's wealth .
Checking up on the guest lists for cocktail parties and customer data for salons , we find that these two activities are indeed disproportionately enjoyed by the rich , so that part of the statement also seems true enough .
And as anyone who 's been to India or Africa knows , millions of decent hard - working people do starve , and there 's no particular reason to think this is n't happening at the same time as some of these rich people attend their cocktail parties .
The positivist scribbles some quick calculations on the back of a napkin and certifies the statement as TRUE .
She hands it the Official Positivist Seal of Approval and moves on to her next task .
But the truth is n't always enough .
Whoever 's making this statement has a much deeper agenda than a simple observation on the distribution of wealth and preferred recreational activities of the upper class , one that the reduction does n't capture .
Philosophers like to speak of the denotation and the connotation of a word .
Denotations ( not to be confused with dennettations , which are much more fun ) are simple and reducible .
To capture the denotation of " old " , we might reduce it to something testable like " over 65 " .
Is Methusaleh old ?
He 's over 65 , so yes , he is .
End of story .
Connotations0 are whatever 's left of a word when you subtract the denotation .
Is Methusaleh old ?
How dare you use that word !
He 's a " senior citizen ! "
He 's " elderly ! "
He 's " in his golden years . "
Each of these may share the same denotation as " old " , but the connotation is quite different .
There is , oddly enough , a children 's game about connotations and denotations1 .
It goes something like this :
I am intelligent .
You are clever .
He 's an egghead .
I am proud .
You are arrogant .
He 's full of himself .
I have perseverance .
You are stubborn .
He is pig -headed .
I am patriotic .
You 're a nationalist .
He is jingoistic .
Politicians like this game too .
Their version goes :
I care about the poor .
You are pro-welfare .
He 's a bleeding - heart .
I 'll protect national security .
You 'll expand the military .
He 's a warmonger .
I 'll slash red tape .
You 'll decrease bureaucracy .
He 'll destroy safeguards .
I am eloquent .
You 're a good speaker .
He 's a demagogue .
I support free health care .
You support national health care .
He supports socialized health care .
All three statements in a sentence have the same denotation , but very different connotations .
The Connotation Game would probably be good for after - hours parties at the Rationality Dojo2 , playing on and on until all three statements in a trio have mentally collapsed together .
Let 's return to our original statement : " The ultra-rich , who control the majority of our planet 's wealth , spend their time at cocktail parties and salons while millions of decent hard - working people starve . "
The denotation is a certain ( true ) statement about distribution of wealth and social activities of the rich .
The connotation is hard to say exactly , but it 's something about how the rich are evil and capitalism is unjust .
There is a serious risk here , and that is to start using this statement to build your belief system .
Yesterday , I suggested that saying " Islam is a religion of peace " is meaningless but affects you anyway .
Place an overly large amount of importance on the " ultra - rich " statement , and it can play backup to any other communist beliefs you hear , even though it 's trivially true and everyone from Milton Friedman on down agrees with it .
The associated Defense Against The Dark Arts technique is to think like a positivist , so that this statement and its reduced version sound equivalent3 .
... which works fine , until you get in an argument .
Most capitalists I hear encounter this statement will flounder around a bit .
Maybe they 'll try to disprove it by saying something very questionable , like " If people in India are starving , then they 're just not working hard enough ! " or " All rich people deserve their wealth ! 4 "
Let us take a moment to feel some sympathy for them .
The statement sounds like a devastating blow against capitalism , but the capitalists cannot shoot it down because it 's technically correct .
They are forced to either resort to peddling falsehoods of the type described above , or to sink to the same level with replies like " That sounds like the sort of thing Stalin would say ! " - which is , of course , denotatively true .
What would I do in their position ?
I would stand tall and say " Your statement is technically true , but I disagree with the connotations .
If you state them explicitly , I will explain why I think they are wrong . "
YSITTBIDWTCIYSTEIWEWITTAW
is a little long for an acronym , but ADBOC for " Agree Denotationally But Object Connotationally could work .
[ EDIT : Changed acronym to better suggestion by badger ]
0 : Anatoly Vorobey says in the comments that I 'm using the word connotation too broadly .
He suggests " subtext " .
1 : I feel like I might have seen this game on Overcoming Bias before , but I can't find it there .
If I did , apologies to the original poster .
2 : Comment with any other good ones you know .
3 : Playing the Connotation Game a lot might also give you partial immunity to this .
4 : This is a great example of a hotly - debated statement that is desperately in need of reduction .

Who would have known , five years ago , when you locked me out of the bedroom for three straight weeks and begin dictating the story into a toy voice recorder you stole from the children , that this would be the ticket to achieving your dreams ?
I speak for all of us ( the children have forgiven you for the theft ) when I say that we could n't be happier about where you are today .
Me. About those dreams though ... your books strike me as pure escapism ( not an insult , who am I to shame readers or authors for their harmless vices ? ) which leaves me wondering exactly what you are trying to escape from with this tale of a young woman who is unmistakably " you " and her romance with a handsome young vampire .
Obviously , being your husband of many years , I have some stake - pun might be intended -- in this question .
Has our love life become stale ?
Has our domestic bliss been not all you imagined it would be ?
Understandable , if a little hurtful .
Love is not a fairytale , not outside your bestselling series of young adult novels in any case .
It is a series of chemical processes that humans can hardly control , let alone channel into a stable arrangement of consistent peace and happiness .
Of course , it is not exactly the same chemical process for me , but still I understand these disappointments as well as any of you humans do .
So I do n't blame you for wanting to escape the mundanity of our home life .
It 's just that , well , the particular subject you chose to make this escape with strikes me as a distinctly malicious plot choice .
You could have written about a young woman ( who is you ) falling in love with an beautiful space alien , or a young woman ( who is you ) falling in love with a reckless but quietly caring secret agent , or a young woman ( who is you ) falling in an experimental sapphic love with a free - spirited blond girl with a passion for folk music , nude swimming , and group sex - I would have especially enjoyed reading this last idea , maybe you could develop it for your next book .
But you chose instead to tackle an idealized version of vampire love , a subject which can only strike me as threatening when you yourself are married to a vampire .
How am I , a father of two and a civil servant of the night , to compete with some story book fantasy of what vampire love should be ?
A mature vampire relationship includes a recognition of your partner 's faults .
Real vampires , sorry to say , are not cold and sculpted as stone , but cold and sculpted as a dead body reanimated through unspeakably demonic forces .
Yes , I have a little mid-eternal life paunch developing .
You think your own butt has n't expanded as fast as your clean cut romance empire ?
And how could I find it anything but insulting when just after the famous to - do over my ( fatal ! ) inability to take you and the kids to a sunny day at the beach , you decided to rewrite the basic rules of vampirism so that your pretty boy vampire hero no longer dissolved in the sun but rather sparkled beautifully like a cadaverous Adonis ?
Real vampires , dear , do n't spend their time repeating high school over and over , dressed in the very latest trends .
We like our black flowing capes , and we 've lived long enough to know that , even if they 're not in style now , they will be eventually .
In the meantime , a sheet of darkness to hide our pale faces beneath is an invaluable utility .
Also black is a forgiving color when your spare time activities inevitably include a certain amount of spillage .
This is the life you chose when you fell in love with a vampire , or , apparently , fell in love with the idea of the vampire .
Sure , the romance of the outcast and the bad boy all rolled together with superhuman elegance may seem irresistible , but once you make the commitment to anyone there are always facets of a person that will annoy you .
Going out to eat is a challenge for us , for instance .
There are restaurants that will cater to vegans , to lactose intolerants , to sufferers of wheat allergies , but just try explaining to the waiter that no garlic can be in the food and that nothing with garlic can be carried within ten feet of table or I will shrink back hissing , probably knocking over a few tables in the process .
Oh , and of course you always act like it 's such a big deal when I get overexcited during intercourse and transform into a gigantic bat .
Believe me , there are worse sexual problems for a husband to have .
And yes , I will occasionally bring home half - dead drifters , mesmerized by my obsidian eyes and devastated by the massive blood loss .
You think I like it when you go to Safeway and bring home a giant bag of nacho corn chips , storing it in the pantry " for later use " but somehow always throwing out a sad , hollowed out husk of a bag that very same night ?
We all have our vices .
If you did n't know that my vice was going to include the slaughter and consumption of drifters , prostitutes , and the occasional society woman , then maybe you should have done more reading before you got into this .
Which reminds me , how uninformed is some poor little girl going to be when she reads your book and thinks that it is preparing her for the tolls of a long term relationship with a vampire ?
The point is , dear , that while I 'm proud of your success , I would like to take this opportunity to suss out any possible discontent on either of our parts .
Escapism is wonderful in small doses , and the children and I certainly appreciate the new income , although my vast European fortune had us pretty well covered before .
But if this marriage is to work , then sooner or later you must come to terms with the realities of vampire love .
I can't always live up to your vampiaraic ideals .
I can't pretend that I am near overthrown with an animal desire for your blood above all else , constantly fighting with myself not to give in and consume you .
The truth is your blood type is one I 've always found distasteful .
Nothing against you , just one of my peccadilloes .
Basically , my lovely Stephanie , I 'd eat you if I was on a desert island and had no other choice , but given the whole world in front of me I 'd rather go for a blood type that does n't make me gag .
Speaking strictly in terms of cuisine , of course .
I love you and the children with all of my heart .
My heart is not beating and has most likely shriveled to the size of a dried plum by now , but these things are metaphors not anatomy lessons .
Good luck with the movies and whatever book you are working on now .
I hope our love stays strong until you become too old and my eternal youth makes me bored and physically disgusted at the sight of you .
Love ,

Darwin once described The Origin of Species as one long argument .
Much of science and skepticism , in fact , is the art and logic of arguing , and most of these blog posts on Skepticblog are just long written arguments .
How to argue logically is therefore one of the core intellectual skill - sets of scientific skepticism .
It is why skeptics will frequently whip out their logical fallacy detectors when arguing with defenders of not - so - critical thinking or true - beliefs .
Even in everyday conversations we commit and encounter countless errors in logic .
It is therefore highly valuable to be familiar with the common ways in which human logic goes astray .
Also the internet has resulted in an explosion of human communication , especially , it seems , arguing .
Much of the social constraints are lifted when typing over the intertubes under a pseudonym .
Knowledge of good and bad arguing are therefore more essential than ever for the computer literati and wannabe internet flame warriors .
I recently was pointed to this website , which reprints an internet meme that has been going around for a while .
It presents 38 Ways To Win An Argument by Arthur Schopenhauer , and offers advice on how to intentionally use logical fallacies in order to flummox your opponent , deceive your audience , and thereby win arguments .
The person who pointed me to that website , however , missed the fact that the advice is satirical – it is meant to expose these tactics , not recommend them .
Also , the author of this list is not really Arthur Schopenhaur , but is a modern adaptation of his writing .
Arthur Schopenhaur was a German philosopher who lived from 1788 - 1860 .
He was a rationalist and logician .
What he did write was a book called The Art of Controversy – here is a free 0nline English translation ( another wonder of the internet ) .
In this book Schopenhaur does indeed review the tactics of deceitful and fallacious arguments , but he does not frame them as satirical advice .
He is exposing them in a straightforward fashion , giving examples of each .
The prose is also more typical of what we would expect from a 19th century philosopher .
In the first section Schopenhaur gives some background on the nature of logic and discourse .
He writes :
Logic , therefore , as the science of thought , or the science of the process of pure reason , should be capable of being constructed à priori .
Dialectic , for the most part , can be constructed only à posteriori ; that is to say , we may learn its rules by an experiential knowledge of the disturbance which pure thought suffers through the difference of individuality manifested in the intercourse between two rational beings , and also by acquaintance with the means which disputants adopt in order to make good against one another their own individual thought , and to show that it is pure and objective .
While logic is pure and based entirely on first principles , argument is partly a learned and quirky human endeavor .
The section titled Stratagems is the part that was adapted to the 38 Ways to Win an Argument .
Here is the first translated directly from Schopenhaur :
The Extension .
— This consists in carrying your opponent ’s proposition beyond its natural limits ; in giving it as general a signification and as wide a sense as possible , so as to exaggerate it ; and , on the other hand , in giving your own proposition as restricted a sense and as narrow limits as you can , because the more general a statement becomes , the more numerous are the objections to which it is open .
The defence consists in an accurate statement of the point or essential question at issue .
He then follows with specific examples .
And here is the modern adaptation :
1 Carry your opponent ’s proposition beyond its natural limits ; exaggerate it .
The more general your opponent ’s statement becomes , the more objections you can find against it .
The more restricted and narrow your own propositions remain , the easier they are to defend .
I do not know who originally wrote the adaption , as every reference I could find credits Schopenhaur for writing it ( if someone finds a reference let me know ) .
I therefore assume this is open - access internet content , and for convenience reproduce the entire list below .
It is worth a read , as is Schopenhaur ’s much longer original .
It is time worth dedicating to perfecting skills in logic and discourse , especially in this age of internet skepticism .

38 Ways To Win An Argument
Adapted from The Art of Controversy by Arthur Schopenhauer
1 Carry your opponent ’s proposition beyond its natural limits ; exaggerate it .
The more general your opponent ’s statement becomes , the more objections you can find against it .
The more restricted and narrow your own propositions remain , the easier they are to defend .
2 Use different meanings of your opponent ’s words to refute his argument .
Example : Person
A says , “ You do not understand the mysteries of Kant ’s philosophy . ”
Person B replies , “ Oh , if it ’s mysteries you ’re talking about , I ’ll have nothing to do with them . ”
3 Ignore your opponent ’s proposition , which was intended to refer to some particular thing .
Rather , understand it in some quite different sense , and then refute it .
Attack something different than what was asserted .
4 Hide your conclusion from your opponent until the end .
Mingle your premises here and there in your talk .
Get your opponent to agree to them in no definite order .
By this circuitous route you conceal your goal until you have reached all the admissions necessary to reach your goal .
5 Use your opponent ’s beliefs against him .
If your opponent refuses to accept your premises , use his own premises to your advantage .
Example , if the opponent is a member of an organization or a religious sect to which you do not belong , you may employ the declared opinions of this group against the opponent .
6 Confuse the issue by changing your opponent ’s words or what he or she seeks to prove .
Example : Call something by a different name : “ good repute ” instead of “ honor , ” “ virtue ” instead of “ virginity , ” “ red- blooded ” instead of “ vertebrates ” .
7 State your proposition and show the truth of it by asking the opponent many questions .
By asking many wide - reaching questions at once , you may hide what you want to get admitted .
Then you quickly propound the argument resulting from the proponent ’s admissions .
8 Make your opponent angry .
An angry person is less capable of using judgment or perceiving where his or her advantage lies .
9 Use your opponent ’s answers to your question to reach different or even opposite conclusions .
10 If your opponent answers all your questions negatively and refuses to grant you any points , ask him or her to concede the opposite of your premises .
This may confuse the opponent as to which point you actually seek him to concede .
11 If the opponent grants you the truth of some of your premises , refrain from asking him or her to agree to your conclusion .
Later , introduce your conclusions as a settled and admitted fact .
Your opponent and others in attendance may come to believe that your conclusion was admitted .
12 If the argument turns upon general ideas with no particular names , you must use language or a metaphor that is favorable to your proposition .
Example :
What an impartial person would call “ public worship ” or a “ system of religion ” is described by an adherent as “ piety ” or “ godliness ” and by an opponent as “ bigotry ” or “ superstition . ”
In other words , insert what you intend to prove into the definition of the idea .
13 To make your opponent accept a proposition , you must give him an opposite , counter - proposition as well .
If the contrast is glaring , the opponent will accept your proposition to avoid being paradoxical .
Example :
If you want him to admit that a boy must to everything that his father tells him to do , ask him , “ whether in all things we must obey or disobey our parents . ”
Or , if a thing is said to occur “ often ” you are to understand few or many times , the opponent will say “ many . ”
It is as though you were to put gray next to black and call it white ; or gray next to white and call it black .
14 Try to bluff your opponent .
If he or she has answered several of your question without the answers turning out in favor of your conclusion , advance your conclusion triumphantly , even if it does not follow .
If your opponent is shy or stupid , and you yourself possess a great deal of impudence and a good voice , the technique may succeed .
15 If you wish to advance a proposition that is difficult to prove , put it aside for the moment .
Instead , submit for your opponent ’s acceptance or rejection some true proposition , as though you wished to draw your proof from it .
Should the opponent reject it because he suspects a trick , you can obtain your triumph by showing how absurd the opponent is to reject an obviously true proposition .
Should the opponent accept it , you now have reason on your side for the moment .
You can either try to prove your original proposition , as in # 14 , maintain that your original proposition is proved by what your opponent accepted .
For this an extreme degree of impudence is required , but experience shows cases of it succeeding .
16 When your opponent puts forth a proposition , find it inconsistent with his or her other statements , beliefs , actions or lack of action .
Example : Should your opponent defend suicide , you may at once exclaim , “ Why do n’t you hang yourself ? ”
Should the opponent maintain that his city is an unpleasant place to live , you may say , “ Why do n’t you leave on the first plane ? ”
17 If your opponent presses you with a counter - proof , you will often be able to save yourself by advancing some subtle distinction .
Try to find a second meaning or an ambiguous sense for your opponent ’s idea .
18 If your opponent has taken up a line of argument that will end in your defeat , you must not allow him to carry it to its conclusion .
Interrupt the dispute , break it off altogether , or lead the opponent to a different subject .
19 Should your opponent expressly challenge you to produce any objection to some definite point in his argument , and you have nothing to say , try to make the argument less specific .
Example :
If you are asked why a particular hypothesis cannot be accepted , you may speak of the fallibility of human knowledge , and give various illustrations of it .
20 If your opponent has admitted to all or most of your premises , do not ask him or her directly to accept your conclusion .
Rather , draw the conclusion yourself as if it too had been admitted .
21 When your opponent uses an argument that is superficial and you see the falsehood , you can refute it by setting forth its superficial character .
But it is better to meet the opponent with a counter - argument that is just as superficial , and so dispose of him .
For it is with victory that you are concerned , not with truth .
Example :
If the opponent appeals to prejudice , emotion or attacks you personally , return the attack in the same manner .
22 If your opponent asks you to admit something from which the point in dispute will immediately follow , you must refuse to do so , declaring that it begs the question .
23 Contradiction and contention irritate a person into exaggerating their statements .
By contradicting your opponent you may drive him into extending the statement beyond its natural limit .
When you then contradict the exaggerated form of it , you look as though you had refuted the original statement .
Contrarily , if your opponent tries to extend your own statement further than your intended , redefine your statement ’s limits and say , “ That is what I said , no more . ”
24 State a false syllogism .
Your opponent makes a proposition , and by false inference and distortion of his ideas you force from the proposition other propositions that are not intended and that appear absurd .
It then appears that opponent ’s proposition gave rise to these inconsistencies , and so appears to be indirectly refuted .
25 If your opponent is making a generalization , find an instance to the contrary .
Only one valid contradiction is needed to overthrow the opponent ’s proposition .
Example : “ All ruminants are horned , ” is a generalization that may be upset by the single instance of the camel .
26 A brilliant move is to turn the tables and use your opponent ’s arguments against himself .
Example : Your opponent declares : “ so and so is a child , you must make an allowance for him . ”
You retort , “ Just because he is a child , I must correct him ; otherwise he will persist in his bad habits . ”
27 Should your opponent surprise you by becoming particularly angry at an argument , you must urge it with all the more zeal .
No only will this make your opponent angry , but it will appear that you have put your finger on the weak side of his case , and your opponent is more open to attack on this point than you expected .
28 When the audience consists of individuals ( or a person ) who is not an expert on a subject , you make an invalid objection to your opponent who seems to be defeated in the eyes of the audience .
This strategy is particularly effective if your objection makes your opponent look ridiculous or if the audience laughs .
If your opponent must make a long , winded and complicated explanation to correct you , the audience will not be disposed to listen to him .
29 If you find that you are being beaten , you can create a diversion –that is , you can suddenly begin to talk of something else , as though it had a bearing on the matter in dispute .
This may be done without presumption if the diversion has some general bearing on the matter .
30 Make an appeal to authority rather than reason .
If your opponent respects an authority or an expert , quote that authority to further your case .
If needed , quote what the authority said in some other sense or circumstance .
Authorities that your opponent fails to understand are those which he generally admires the most .
You may also , should it be necessary , not only twist your authorities , but actually falsify them , or quote something that you have entirely invented yourself .
31 If you know that you have no reply to the arguments that your opponent advances , you by a fine stroke of irony declare yourself to be an incompetent judge .
Example : “ What you say passes my poor powers of comprehension ; it may well be all very true , but I ca n’t understand it , and I refrain from any expression of opinion on it . ”
In this way you insinuate to the audience , with whom you are in good repute , that what your opponent says is nonsense .
This technique may be used only when you are quite sure that the audience thinks much better of you than your opponent .
32 A quick way of getting rid of an opponent ’s assertion , or of throwing suspicion on it , is by putting it into some odious category .
Example :
You can say , “ That is fascism ” or “ Atheism ” or “ Superstition . ”
In making an objection of this kind you take for granted
1 ) That the assertion or question is identical with , or at least contained in , the category cited ;
and
2 ) The system referred to has been entirely refuted by the current audience .
33 You admit your opponent ’s premises but deny the conclusion .
Example : “ That ’s all very well in theory , but it wo n’t work in practice . ”
34 When you state a question or an argument , and your opponent gives you no direct answer , or evades it with a counter question , or tries to change the subject , it is sure sign you have touched a weak spot , sometimes without intending to do so .
You have , as it were , reduced your opponent to silence .
You must , therefore , urge the point all the more , and not let your opponent evade it , even when you do not know where the weakness that you have hit upon really lies .
35 Instead of working on an opponent ’s intellect or the rigor of his arguments , work on his motive .
If you success in making your opponent ’s opinion , should it prove true , seem distinctly prejudicial to his own interest , he will drop it immediately .
Example : A clergyman is defending some philosophical dogma .
You show him that his proposition contradicts a fundamental doctrine of his church .
He will abandon the argument .
36 You may also puzzle and bewilder your opponent by mere bombast .
If your opponent is weak or does not wish to appear as if he has no idea what your are talking about , you can easily impose upon him some argument that sounds very deep or learned , or that sounds indisputable .
37 Should your opponent be in the right but , luckily for you , choose a faulty proof , you can easily refute it and then claim that you have refuted the whole position .
This is the way in which bad advocates lose good cases .
If no accurate proof occurs to your opponent , you have won the day .
38 Become personal , insulting and rude as soon as you perceive that your opponent has the upper hand .
In becoming personal you leave the subject altogether , and turn your attack on the person by remarks of an offensive and spiteful character .
This is a very popular technique , because it takes so little skill to put it into effect .

Mmm ... tasty .
But will astronauts enjoy the taste of their own urine recycled ?
Astronauts flying aboard space shuttle Endeavour on Saturday plan to deliver a device to the International Space Station that may leave you wondering if Nasa is taking recycling too far .
Among the ship 's cargo , which will help prepare the station for an expanded six - person crew , is a water regeneration system that , as one astronaut puts it , " will make yesterday 's coffee into today 's coffee " .
" It 's one of these great circle - of - life things , " explained Don Pettit , a former space station science officer serving as a mission specialist aboard Endeavour .
The new system distils , filters , ionizes and oxidizes wastewater - including urine -- into fresh water for drinking .
I 've got some in my fridge .
It tastes fine to me
Bob Bagdigian , Nasa
The US space agency was n't really thinking about saving the environment when it decided to invest $ 250 m in the water recycling gear .
With the space shuttles due to retire in two years , Nasa needed another way to make sure the station crew would have a good supply of fresh water .
The orbiters make water as a byproduct of their electrical systems .
On missions to the space station , the water is bagged and transferred over to the outpost for storage .
" When the shuttles retire , that nice water - delivery system that we have will go away , " said Endeavour astronaut Sandra Magnus , who will be staying behind on the station for a four - month flight .
" In addition we 're going to have six people on - station , so our requirements for water will go up . "
Ms Magnus replaces Nasa astronaut Greg Chamitoff , who has been aboard the station since June .
Every drop of water on board the ISS is precious
Nasa does n't plan to start using the new system immediately - engineers want samples to analyse to make sure it functions properly in zero -gravity .
The water has been thoroughly tested on Earth , including blind taste tests that pitted recycled urine with similarly treated tap water .
People may think it 's disgusting , but if it 's done correctly the water is purer than you drink on Earth
Heidemarie Stefanyshyn - Piper , Endeavour astronaut " Some people may think it 's downright disgusting , but if it 's done correctly , you process water that 's purer than what you drink here on Earth , " said Endeavour astronaut Heidemarie Stefanyshyn - Piper .
The most frequent comment was the faint taste of iodine in the water , added Nasa 's Bob Bagdigian , who oversaw development of the water regeneration system .
Iodine is added at the final step of the process to control microbial growth .
" Other than that , it is just as refreshing as any other kind of water , " Mr Bagdigian said .
" I 've got some in my fridge .
It tastes fine to me . "
The International Space Station is also being fitted with an extra bathroom unit
Nasa plans to double the station 's crew size from three to six as early as May .
Endeavour also will be delivering two new sleeping compartments , more exercise gear , a galley and perhaps most important , a second toilet .
" With six people , you really do need to have a two - bathroom house .
It 's a lot more convenient and a lot more efficient , " Ms Magnus said .
Astronauts also plan to work on the space station 's solar power system .
Four spacewalks are scheduled to begin repairs on a contaminated rotary joint needed to aim solar panels at the Sun .
The flight is the fourth and final mission of the year .
Nasa had hoped to fly a servicing call to the Hubble Space Telescope last month but delayed the mission to May 2009 to prepare for some additional repair work on the observatory .
In all , Nasa plans 10 more shuttle flights before the fleet is retired in 2010 .

To hear Republican House members tell it , you 'd think House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stuffed $ 30 million into the stimulus bill to benefit an endangered mouse in her district .
Rep . Steve King of Iowa called it an earmark and " a pet project " while pointing to a sign he made that said " Pelosi 's Mouse slated for $ 30 Million . "
Rep . John Boehner of Ohio opposed the bill and asked how money " for some salt marsh mouse in San Francisco is going to help a struggling autoworker in Ohio ? "
And Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana said on Fox News that there was " $ 30 million in there to protect mice in San Francisco . "
The tale of the mouse appears to have originated around Feb. 6 , 2009 , from Republican staff members of the U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations Committee .
" Appropriations Republicans , concerned with this irresponsible process and possible abuse of taxpayer funds , have asked various federal agencies how they intend to spend the windfall of cash that Congress may approve in the ' stimulus ' bill , " said a memo posted to the site .
" One peek behind the bureaucratic curtain has yielded the following examples of hidden program information that is not included in the language of the bill or report .
These are programs which various federal agencies have privately indicated they will fund with ' stimulus ' money . "
The memo lists a number of projects , including up to $ 37.5 million for " wetland restoration in the San Francisco Bay Area — including work to protect the Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse . "
That became fodder for a Feb. 11 e-mail from Michael Steel , Boehner 's spokesman .
" Thirty million dollars for wetland restoration in the San Francisco Bay Area — including work to protect the Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse , " Steel wrote .
" This sounds like spending projects that have been supported by a certain powerful Democrat in the past .
And it certainly does n't sound like it will create or save American jobs . "
That e-mail made it into a Feb. 12 story in the Washington Times headlined " Pelosi 's mouse slated for $ 30 M slice of cheese . "
The story stated , incorrectly as it turns out , that the stimulus bill " includes $ 30 million for wetlands restoration that the Obama administration intends to spend in the San Francisco Bay Area to protect , among other things , the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse . "
And that story was then picked up by the Drudge Report .
That 's when the mouse references exploded , morphing from a possible project of an unnamed agency to Pence 's " $ 30 million in there to protect mice in San Francisco . "
We wanted to get to the bottom of this issue and find out what was up with the mouse .
Turns out the salt marsh harvest mouse is a previously obscure beneficiary of a major environmental restoration project for the San Francisco Bay area .
" A friend e-mailed me and asked me if any of the $ 30 million for the mouse was for us , and I was like ' What are you talking about ? ' " said Steve Ritchie , an engineer with the California State Coastal Conservancy , a state agency charged with preserving and restoring the coastline .
When the stimulus bill was first proposed and a call went out for ready - to - go projects , Ritchie prepared a list of the agency 's shovel - ready projects and submitted it to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , both of which received money in the final version of the stimulus bill .
Three projects would turn abandoned industrial salt operations back into natural wetlands , about 26,000 acres in all .
It turns out the mouse is an endangered species that likes tidal salt marshes , and it 's mentioned by name as one of several species that will benefit .
But the projects themselves — the South Bay Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project , the Napa Plant Site , and the Napa Salt Marsh restoration — are intended to do more than just benefit wildlife .
It 's major construction work to create recreation areas and to restore marshland that will resist flooding and storm surge .
" This is bulldozers , front - end loaders , backhoes .
These are major earth - moving projects to break down levees , to resculpt the landscape and to make sure nature can do its thing , " Ritchie said .
" Right now , we just have these lousy little salt pond levees and they break . "
" These are real jobs , and these are truly ready to go , " he added .
" We can definitely spend this money for construction by Nov. 30 , 2010 . "
Given this description of the projects , which were first reported in the San Jose Mercury News , it 's a serious distortion to say there 's money in the bill to protect San Francisco mice .
The bill does n't even list the San Francisco projects by name .
And the funding agencies — the Corps of Engineers or NOAA — could still decide to fund the projects or not .
The bill passed a final vote in the House on Feb. 13 , with no Republicans supporting it .
So Pelosi did not put an earmark in the bill to save the mice .
In fact , there 's no money in the bill for mice .
For this reason , we rate Pence 's remark False .

AKRON —
The former inmate whose heart stopped after he was shot with a Taser at the Summit County Jail Feb. 21 was moved from Akron General Medical Center to a mental health facility .
Attorney Eddie Sipplen said today that Gregory Dillard , 21 , of Akron , is being treated at Northcoast Behavioral Healthcare .
" He was taken directly from the hospital to Northcoast , " said Sipplen .
" His medical condition was well enough to be removed from ICU and then be moved from the hospital to Northcoast . "
At the time of the incident , Summit County Sheriff Drew Alexander said Dillard was being held on two cases from Akron Municipal Court .
He had served his time on one of the cases and was being released on bond on the second .
But he flooded his cell as he was about to be released , ripped off his clothes and jumped up and down on his bed , officials said .
Officers opened a cell door in the mental health unit to give Dillard clean clothes and the inmate attacked two deputies .
One of the officers used his Taser , striking Dillard once in the chest area .
Alexander said Dillard 's heart stopped momentarily .
Jail nurses and emergency service workers helped revive him , and he was taken to the Akron hospital .
" You just could n't reason with him , " Alexander said .
Sipplen said Dillard had been on medication for mental disorders but had not been given any for about a week leading up to the accident .
A spokeswoman for the sheriff 's department said the allegation is " absolutely untrue . "
" We never deny anyone their medication , " said Chris Croce .
" We can not force someone to take their medication .
On Feb. 19 , the nursing staff was put in restraints because he would not take his medication .
He was out of control and they feared he would hurt himself .
After he calmed down , he agreed to take his medication and was removed from the restraints . "
She said he was given his medication in his cell , but does not know if he took it or not .
Sheriff 's deputies said Dillard has been in the County Jail 11 different times for various crimes involving drugs and violence .
Sipplen said he wanted to determine if the Taser device was faulty or whether the officers were improperly trained .
SAN JOSE , California —
The Apple II computer is long gone , but its heart beats on in the developing world , where 8 - bit computers sell for as little as $ 12 .
Now , computer scientists see a way of using those ubiquitous , primitive PCs to help kids learn — by playing games .
" It is about bringing affordable computer learning to the 90 percent of learners in the world who can't afford a $ 1,000 or even a
$ 100 computer , " says Derek Lomas , who is leading the Playpower.org team .
The project , first talked about last year , is gathering steam .
Lomas and his partners are talking to manufacturing partners in China to produce the $ 12 systems , which are based on cheap computers already sold throughout the developing world .
Some of the computers will be sold through
Maker
Shed , the e-commerce arm of Make magazine in the United States , while the rest will be distributed through non-profit partners in developing countries .
And the Playpower team has collaborated with other groups in the 8 - bit computer hacking community to help build educational software for the computers .
The Playpower team touted its ambitious project with a high - energy presentation in front of a standing - room - only hotel conference room at ETech 2009 in San Jose .
While 8 - bit musician Jordan Gray improvised funky digital beats on a PSP , the screen displayed a rapid - fire series of images showing photographs of poor children , screenshots from old 8 - bit games like Oregon Trail and relevant stats ( " More than 4 billion people earn less than $ 3,000 per year " ) .
The $ 12 computing system itself defies conventional expectations of what a computer today should be .
The soul of the Apple II and a geek microprocessor favorite of the 1970s , the 8 - bit 6502 processor is the heart of these computers .
It is small enough to be contained within a full - size keyboard and sold for mere dollars .
The keyboard also has a slot for game cartridges , and is usually sold with a mouse and two game controllers .
Many of these systems are currently on sale as " TV computers " in Bombay , Bangalore and Nicaragua .
They are often packaged in boxes emblazoned with unlicensed cartoon art ( Mario , Spiderman ) and misspelled English ( " Lerrn compiters the fun way ! " ) and are bundled with games that would likely be copyright violations in the United States .
And like the early home computers sold in the United
States , they plug into a TV screen for display .
Although these computers are currently aimed at the gaming market , Playpower.org envisions using them to deliver educational software and learning games to children in developing countries .
The project will run on machines that are within the reach for millions of families that make less than $ 3,000 a year , say Lomas and his partners , Jeremy Douglass and Daniel Rehn .
Lomas and Rehn are students at the University of California at San Diego , while Douglass is a post doctoral research fellow there .
It 's an ambitious project and one that requires just a tad of youthful optimism to pull it off .
Dodge a pothole in China or India and you are likely to bump into the carcass of yet another ambitious attempt to bring low - cost computing to the developing world .
The MIT Media Lab - backed One
Laptop Per Child project planned to bring $ 100 computers to those in need .
That project has never been able to achieve that price point , although OLPC cofounder Mary Lou Jepsen said Tuesday here that more than a million of the project 's XO laptops had been shipped to kids in more than 30 countries .
Recently , Indian government officials made an announcement of a $ 10 " computer " that proved to be a dud .
" The $ 100 laptop does a lot of things that makes it expensive , such as its screen , own power system and a faster processor , " says Lomas .
But Playpower.org offers something different .
The group has n't created a new machine .
Instead it builds on something that already exists .
Lomas first saw one of these inexpensive 8 - bit computer at a computer market in Mumbai where he was on an internship .
" There are many manufacturers in India and China that make them since the chip went off patent a few years ago , " says Lomas who brought the $ 12 computer back to the United States .
" And while it may not be powerful enough to run YouTube or surf the internet at high speed , it is great for educational games and related ideas . "
For most Americans , if the 8 - bit processor sounds like a blast from the past , it is .
The 8 - bit 6502 chip technology , along with the Zilog z80 , kicked off the U.S. home - computing revolution , aided in part by enthusiast organizations such as the Homebrew Computer Club .
Early 6502 home computers included the Apple II , the BBC Micro and the Commodore PET .
All of them included the Basic programming language .
The 8 - bit machines faded away in the United States to be replaced by the Pentiums and Core2 Duo processors .
But in China and many parts of Asia , the chips are still produced , to the tune of more than a million chips a year , estimates Lomas .
And they are very cheap .
" Rather than figure out how we can create a cultural niche for a $ 10
computer , we thought :
Let 's identify the systems that are affordable and in demand , and put them to work , " says Jeremy Douglass , co-founder of
Playpower.org .
The games that the Playpower.org project is developing for the 8 - bit computer will teach users basic skills such as English and typing .
And they are working on some fun ideas .
Playpower.org has collaborated with 8 BitPeoples , a collective of artists focused on applying the 8 - bit aesthetic to games and music , says Rehn .
The collective provides music that can be used in Playpower 's games , for instance .
Creating software and games for the $ 12 , 8 - bit computer will be easy , says Lomas .
After all , it 's something even fifth graders can do , because the Basic programming language remains part of the elementary school curriculum in many schools in China and India .

Kucinich requests investigation into ' executive assassination ring ' John Byrne
Published : Monday March 16 , 2009
Print This Email This After comments made by a New Yorker journalist about Vice President Dick Cheney 's alleged involvement in a " executive assassination ring " abroad , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) called Monday for a formal congressional probe .
Kucinich 's call was concomitant with a letter he sent to House Oversight Chairman Edolphus Towns .
Describing the allegation , Kucinich writes , " Mr. Hersh made the allegation before an audience at the University of Minnesota on Tuesday , March 10 , 2009 " in which " he stated ,  Under President Bushs authority , theyve been going into countries , not talking to the ambassador or the CIA station chief , and finding people on a list and executing them and leaving .
It is a special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently .
They do not report to anybody , except in the Bush - Cheney days , they reported directly to the Cheney office ...
Congress has no oversight of it . ' "
Hersh 's claim is detailed here in an earlier piece by Raw Story .
 If true , these operations violate longstanding U.S. policy regarding covert actions and illegally bypass Congressional oversight , " Kucinich adds .
" Hersh is within a year or more of releasing a book that is said to include evidence of this allegation .
However , we cannot wait a year or more to establish the truth . 
The 62 - year - old lawmaker and former Democratic presidential candidate is known for his bold and liberal moves .
In April 2007 , he filed an impeachment resolution against Vice President Cheney over manipulating evidence about Iraq 's weapons program prior to the US invasion .
The measure was blocked by the Democratic leadership .
He also presented articles of impeachment against President George W. Bush in June 2008 , but that effort again went nowhere .
Hersh , the New Yorker journalist who made the claim , also revealed US preparations for a possible Iran strike that was later sidelined , and is also known for revealing the My Lai massacre during Vietnam .
The full text of Kucinich 's letter follows :
March 13 , 2009
The Honorable Edolphus Towns
Chairman
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform
U.S. House of Representatives
2157 Rayburn House Office Building
Washington , DC 20515
Dear Chairman
Towns :
As you may already be aware , recent media reports indicate that investigative reporter , Seymour Hersh , while answering questions before a public audience at the University of Minnesota divulged information about what he calls an executive assassination ring operating under the George W. Bush Administration .
If substantiated , the allegation would have far reaching implications for the United States .
Such an assertion from someone of Hershs credibility that has a long and proven track record of dependability on these issues merits attention .
Mr. Hersh is within a year or more of releasing a book that is said to include evidence of this allegation .
However , we cannot wait a year or more to establish the truth .
As such , I request that the Full Committee immediately begin an investigation to determine the facts in this matter .
Mr. Hersh made the allegation before an audience at the University of Minnesota on Tuesday , March 10 , 2009 .
He stated ,  Under President Bushs authority , theyve been going into countries , not talking to the ambassador or the CIA station chief , and finding people on a list and executing them and leaving . 
Mr. Hersh continued ,  It is a special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently , " he explained .
" They do not report to anybody , except in the Bush - Cheney days , they reported directly to the Cheney office . . . Congress has no oversight of it .
If true , these operations violate longstanding U.S. policy regarding covert actions and illegally bypass Congressional oversight .
Current statute governing covert action ( 50 U.S.C. 413b ) requires a presidential finding and notification to the appropriate congressional committees .
Additionally , Executive Order 12333 clearly states that  [ n ] o person employed by or acting on behalf of the United States Government shall engage in or conspire to engage in assassination . 
I urge the Committee to explore Mr. Hershs allegation .
Please do not hesitate to call on me or my staff if we can be of assistance .
Sincerely ,
Dennis J. Kucinich
Member of Congress

Monsanto's Government Ties
Prior to being the Supreme Court Judge who put GW Bush in office , Clarence Thomas was Monsanto 's lawyer .
The U.S. Secretary of Agriculture ( Anne Veneman ) was on the Board of Directors of Monsanto 's Calgene Corporation .
The Secretary of Defense ( Donald Rumsfeld ) was on the Board of Directors of Monsanto 's Searle pharmaceuticals .
The U.S. Secretary of Health , Tommy Thompson , received $ 50,000 in donations from Monsanto during his winning campaign for Wisconsin 's governor .
The two congressmen receiving the most donations from Monsanto during the last election were Larry Combest ( Chairman of the House Agricultural Committee ) and Attorney General John Ashcroft .

In order for the FDA to determine if Monsanto 's growth hormones were safe or not , Monsanto was required to submit a scientific report on that topic .
Margaret Miller , one of Monsanto 's researchers put the report together .
Shortly before the report submission , Miller left Monsanto and was hired by the FDA .
Her first job for the FDA was to determine whether or not to approve the report she wrote for Monsanto .
In short , Monsanto approved its own report .
Assisting Miller was another former Monsanto researcher , Susan Sechen .
Deciding whether or not rBGH - derived milk should be labeled fell under the jurisdiction of another FDA official , Michael Taylor , who previously worked as a lawyer for Monsanto .

" Monsanto should not have to vouchsafe the safety of biotech food , " said Phil Angell , Monsanto 's director of corporate communications .
" Our interest is in selling as much of it as possible .
Assuring its safety is the FDA 's job .
" It would be nice to think the FDA can be trusted with these matters , but think again .
Monsanto has succeeded in insuring that government regulatory agencies let Monsanto do as it wishes .
Take a look :
In December it was ‘ Benjamin Button ’ , in January it was “ Notorious ” , this month though it ’s the chart - topping remake of “ Friday the 13th ” that ’s lead to one strange act of real - life violence .
According to The Express , a party to celebrate the launch of the film last Friday became like a scene out of it when actor Warrington Gillette , who played Jason Vorhees in 1981 ’s “ Friday the 13th Part 2 ” , was attacked with an axe .
The actor arrived in full costume , wearing the character ’s famous ice hockey mask , and took to the stage to frighten partygoers wielding a real axe .
However a woman took the performance seriously , invading the stage and trying to wrestle the weapon away from him ,
In the process he slashed his hand .
A source says “ She jumped on stage and tried to grab his axe .
It was straight out of a horror movie .
Lingerie - clad models were running and screaming , as a blood - soaked Jason ran off the runway to get to a hospital . ”
While developers have been privy to pre-releases of Apple 's Snow Leopard operating system for quite some time , those distributions have been stripped of several features including a significant UI overhaul that the company is now preparing for broader consumption , AppleInsider has been told .
People familiar with the matter say the next developer build of the software will unleash some of the biggest changes to the next - gen OS since Apple first previewed the software to developers at last June 's Worldwide Developers Conference .
Among the changes under consideration for the new build is a striking overhaul to the Mac OS X user interface , which is expected to surrender its platinum theme .
Apple has reportedly been working on this new interface since day one , despite public claims that Snow Leopard would forgo forward - facing improvements for a focus strictly on under - the - hood enhancements .
Still , those familiar with the situation say it's not clear whether management has given the green light to include the UI changes in an incremental developer build .
The concern is that those changes will inevitably leak on the web , and therefore they may preserve them for an official demonstration during the company 's spring Worldwide Developers Conference .
These latest reports add to previous claims that similarly predicted Apple would eventually wrap Snow Leopard in a new interface rumored to go by the code - name " marble . "
Details were sparse , but speculation pointed to the adoption of the smoother iTunes - style scrollbars and a move towards a darker chrome motif for application windows alongside an inverted menubar with light text on a dark background .
Interface elements and colors of the rumored " Marble " theme .
It 's possible that Apple may have already tipped its hand to this end earlier this month when it included the first external builds of its QuickTime X Player with Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard build 10A286 .
The software included a new minimal interface consisting only of a titlebar , leaving all playback controls to reside in floating interface overlays .
An artist 's mockup of the minimal QuickTime X Player window interface with the " trim " tools overlay .
The titlebar itself ( seen in the artist rendition , above ) is reminiscent of the iPhone 's semi- transparent black glass interface but is also capable of adopting hues from the video frames playing beneath it .
Although seen in the rendering as sporting a purplish hue ( due to the underlying blue video frame ) the titlebar appears glass - black when set atop a white or tan - colored video frame .
Story Highlights
Next Snow Leopard builds to include big changes
Snow Leopard to be wrapped in new interface ahead of launch
WWDC to offer finalized preview , release date
Snow Leopard to hit retail within two months of WWDC
Upcoming iPhone OS 3 beta to activate live Push Notification support
As it stands , Apple reportedly plans to use its WWDC 2009 to preview a feature complete version of Snow Leopard and announce a formal release date .
Based on the current status of the software , those familiar with the project say the company will need approximately two months from this public preview to fine tune the software .
Assuming WWDC takes place in June , that would suggest a release around August .
Most solar panels on utility and municipal properties power single items , like traffic lights and parking meters .
These panels , however , would feed directly into the electrical grid .
By selling the electricity into the wholesale market , the utility expects to offset some of the cost of installing the panels .
The project would add about 10 cents to each customer ’s monthly bill in the first year and as much as 35 cents in subsequent years .
It comes at a time when many renewable energy installations  including those on homes  are being scaled back because of the lack of money or the higher cost of loans .
“ We saw how the financial crunch has really brought renewables to a grinding halt , and this is a way to get it back going and a way to make sure all our customers benefit , ” said Ralph Izzo , the chief executive of Public Service Enterprise Group , the utility ’s parent company .
In addition to raising money by selling the panels ’ electricity , P.S.E. & G. also expects to receive a federal tax credit and income from selling the state renewable energy credits that accrue when solar energy is produced .
The bulk of the money for the project , however , would come from new bonds and equity from Public Service Enterprise .
Mr. Izzo said he did not expect his utility to have difficulty issuing bonds in the shaky debt markets , and added that the price of installing the panels  about $ 6.44 for each watt produced  was far lower than just a few years ago .

Science is not difficult to explain .
Today we will see how British journalists go out of their way to cherry - pick which evidence they cover , and then explain the risks and benefits in what has been shown to be the single most unhelpful way possible .
" Screening all older men for prostate cancer ' could reduce deaths by a fifth ' , " said the Mail .
" Prostate cancer hope " said the Mirror .
" Calls for new policies on NHS cancer tests " said the Independent .
" Prostate cancer screening could cut deaths by 20 % " said the Guardian .
" Better cancer screening is every man 's right " was the editorial in the Scotsman , where they wound themselves into a froth of indignation .
But was this just British journalists finding something to complain about ?
Because all around the world , people were saying something completely different , on the same day , about the very same academic publication : " Prostate cancer screening may not reduce deaths " said the Washington Post .
" Studies cast doubt on leading prostate cancer test " said USA Today .
" PSA testing may not save your life after all " said Scientific American .
" Prostate cancer blood test does little to decrease death rate " said the Sydney Morning Herald .
And so on .
Why would the American and the Australian journalists say something completely different to the British ones , about the very same evidence ?
First , our journalists were simply confused .
Not a single newspaper managed to clearly explain the risks and benefits of screening in the trial they were writing about .
It 's very simple : the study took more than 160,000 men between the ages of 55 and 69 and randomly assigned them either to get PSA screening , or to be left alone .
The differences were marginal .
Yes , there were 20 % fewer deaths in the screening group .
What does that mean in terms of real people , in real numbers you can understand , not percentages ?
First , 1,410 men would need to be screened to prevent one death .
Second , for each death prevented , 48 people would need to be treated ; and prostate cancer treatment has a high risk of very serious side - effects such as impotence and incontinence .
These figures are not hard to find : they are in the summary of the research paper .
For complex risk decisions such as screening , it has been shown in three separate studies that patients , doctors , and NHS purchasing panels make more rational decisions about treatments and screening programmes when they are given the figures as real numbers , as I did above , instead of percentages .
I 'm not saying that PSA screening is either good or bad : I am saying that people deserve the figures in the clearest form possible so they can make their own mind up .
It gets worse .
British journalists also deliberately ignored one whole half of the research , and I 'll confess I 've slightly lost my sense of humour over this .
There were in fact two large studies on PSA testing published in the New England Journal on 18 March 2009 , not one .
They were both published on the same day , in the same journal , they are side by side on the same contents page .
British journalists discussed only one of them - the one that said PSA screening does reduce deaths .
The study they ignored was huge too : it took more than 75,000 men and randomly assigned them to either a screening programme , or no screening .
It found no difference in death rates between the two groups at all , and in case you think it was a close thing , in fact , there was a non-significant trend towards more deaths in the screening group .
Not one UK newspaper mentioned this trial .
So newspapers ignore one half of the evidence and fail to explain the other half properly .
In the past , nobody could catch them , and nobody could compete with them .
That has now changed .
Anyone can write , and publish online , and appear in Google news alerts : the NHS , medical research charities , individual academics , journals ' press offices .
These people are intelligent , informed , and they can explain things clearly , without worrying about eyecatching hysteria , or space , or hyperbole .
Some will be silly , some wo n't be .
If they ignore half the evidence , they will be busted in the comments , mocked , and sensible visitors will never come back .
They can also link directly and transparently to scientific papers , which mainstream media still refuse to do .
Journalists insist that we need professionals to mediate and explain science .
From today 's story , their self - belief seems truly laughable .

China is worried about its vast United States treasury holdings and premier Wen Jiabao has urged Washington to safeguard their value .
This is how the US - and all governments for that matter - borrow money : they issue government securities , which other countries and institutions buy .
So , the US national debt is owned predominantly by Asian economies .

So who was it ?
Want to start a startup ?
Get funded by Y Combinator .
March 2009
A couple days ago I finally got being a good startup founder down to two words : relentlessly resourceful .
Till then the best I 'd managed was to get the opposite quality down to one : hapless .
Most dictionaries say hapless means unlucky .
But the dictionaries are not doing a very good job .
A team that outplays its opponents but loses because of a bad decision by the referee could be called unlucky , but not hapless .
Hapless implies passivity .
To be hapless is to be battered by circumstances — to let the world have its way with you , instead of having your way with the world . [ 1 ]
Unfortunately there 's no antonym of hapless , which makes it difficult to tell founders what to aim for .
" Do n't be hapless " is not much of rallying cry .
It 's not hard to express the quality we 're looking for in metaphors .
The best is probably a running back .
A good running back is not merely determined , but flexible as well .
They want to get downfield , but they adapt their plans on the fly .
Unfortunately this is just a metaphor , and not a useful one to most people outside the US .
" Be like a running back " is no better than " Do n't be hapless . "
But finally I 've figured out how to express this quality directly .
I was writing a talk for investors , and I had to explain what to look for in founders .
What would someone who was the opposite of hapless be like ?
They 'd be relentlessly resourceful .
Not merely relentless .
That 's not enough to make things go your way except in a few mostly uninteresting domains .
In any interesting domain , the difficulties will be novel .
Which means you can't simply plow through them , because you do n't know initially how hard they are ; you do n't know whether you 're about to plow through a block of foam or granite .
So you have to be resourceful .
You have to keep trying new things .
Be relentlessly resourceful .
That sounds right , but is it simply a description of how to be successful in general ?
I do n't think so .
This is n't the recipe for success in writing or painting , for example .
In that kind of work the recipe is more to be actively curious .
Resourceful implies the obstacles are external , which they generally are in startups .
But in writing and painting they 're mostly internal ; the obstacle is your own obtuseness . [ 2 ]
There probably are other fields where " relentlessly resourceful " is the recipe for success .
But though other fields may share it , I think this is the best short description we 'll find of what makes a good startup founder .
I doubt it could be made more precise .
Now that we know what we 're looking for , that leads to other questions .
For example , can this quality be taught ?
After four years of trying to teach it to people , I 'd say that yes , surprisingly often it can .
Not to everyone , but to many people . [ 3 ]
Some people are just constitutionally passive , but others have a latent ability to be relentlessly resourceful that only needs to be brought out .
This is particularly true of young people who have till now always been under the thumb of some kind of authority .
Being relentlessly resourceful is definitely not the recipe for success in big companies , or in most schools .
I do n't even want to think what the recipe is in big companies , but it is certainly longer and messier , involving some combination of resourcefulness , obedience , and building alliances .
Identifying this quality also brings us closer to answering a question people often wonder about : how many startups there could be .
There is not , as some people seem to think , any economic upper bound on this number .
There 's no reason to believe there is any limit on the amount of newly created wealth consumers can absorb , any more than there is a limit on the number of theorems that can be proven .
So probably the limiting factor on the number of startups is the pool of potential founders .
Some people would make good founders , and others would n't .
And now that we can say what makes a good founder , we know how to put an upper bound on the size of the pool .
This test is also useful to individuals .
If you want to know whether you 're the right sort of person to start a startup , ask yourself whether you 're relentlessly resourceful .
And if you want to know whether to recruit someone as a cofounder , ask if they are .
You can even use it tactically .
If I were running a startup , this would be the phrase I 'd tape to the mirror .
" Make something people want " is the destination , but " Be relentlessly resourceful " is how you get there .
Notes
[ 1 ] I think the reason the dictionaries are wrong is that the meaning of the word has shifted .
No one writing a dictionary from scratch today would say that hapless meant unlucky .
But a couple hundred years ago they might have .
People were more at the mercy of circumstances in the past , and as a result a lot of the words we use for good and bad outcomes have origins in words about luck .
When I was living in Italy , I was once trying to tell someone that I had n't had much success in doing something , but I could n't think of the Italian word for success .
I spent some time trying to describe the word I meant .
Finally she said " Ah! Fortuna ! "
[ 2 ] There are aspects of startups where the recipe is to be actively curious .
There can be times when what you 're doing is almost pure discovery .
Unfortunately these times are a small proportion of the whole .
On the other hand , they are in research too .
[ 3 ] I 'd almost say to most people , but I realize ( a ) I have no idea what most people are like , and ( b ) I 'm pathologically optimistic about people 's ability to change .
Thanks to Trevor Blackwell and Jessica Livingston for reading drafts of this .
I once used freezer bag plastic , a reconfigured freezer bag sealer and waxed paper like this to make 2 long tubes for sled kite spars .
I blew some air in , rolled the tube around a dowel to build up air pressure , pressed a straightedge down to contain the air and sealed it up on the unpressured side .
I could n't believe that I could stand on the tube without popping it !
The rest of the kite was lighter weight garbage bag plastic .
The pressure was plenty enough to keep the sled kite in shape .
It flew in very light breezes .
I made another sled by overlapping plastic from a walmart bag and sealing in 2 places for each spar , leaving a long narrow tube for inflating and rolling up around the dowel .
It actually took very little pressure to keep the kite in shape .
When I let the reel spin free , the kite went downwind nearly horizontally and shot upward as soon as I stopped letting line out .
Some type of reuseable valve could make these saleable .
Microsoft has officially announced the five versions of Windows 7 it will sell at launch , together with a version specifically designed for low - cost netbooks .
Microsoft has officially announced the five versions of Windows 7 it will sell at launch within the United States , together with a version specifically designed for low - cost netbooks .
The five versions available for U.S. customers will be : Windows 7 Starter , Windows 7 Home Premium , Windows 7 Professional , Windows 7 Enterprise and Windows 7 Ultimate .
But Microsoft will only sell Windows 7 Home Premium and Windows 7 Professional at retail , in a bid to eliminate some of the confusion caused by a plethora of Windows Vista versions .
A sixth version , Windows 7 Home Basic , will only be sold in emerging markets , Microsoft said .
Want all the details that we know about the new Windows 7 versions ?
Check out our FAQ : " The Windows 7 Versions : What You Need to Know "
Microsoft did not release the prices of the new Windows 7 versions , and offered no additional details as to when they would launch .
Most expect Windows 7 to ship near the end of 2009 , however .
Microsoft also declined to say when it would stop selling Windows Vista .
" We 've learned a lot over the years as we 've released versions of Windows to the market .
We spent a lot of time listening to customer and partner feedback , " Microsoft said in a document describing the changes that was released to PCMag .
" We heard from customers that they liked the choices Windows Vista offered , but that upgrading sometimes meant tradeoffs .
Customers told us that they want us to make it simpler to identify which version is right for them . "
And that means that a single version 
Home Premium  will be offered to consumers , with a separate version  Professional  offered to businesses .
Both the Home Premium and Professional SKUs will contain discrete features that are n't overlapped to the other .
So why not leave it at that ?
" When you have a customer base of more than one billion , two options can't satisfy all of their varied needs , " Microsoft explained .
" For that reason we will continue to offer a few targeted SKUs for customers with specialized needs . "
Windows 7 Ultimate Edition , meanwhile , wo n't be sold directly to consumers .
Instead , Windows 7
Ultimate will be an upgrade offered only as an add - on , which also means that consumers will be forced to pay for Windows 7 Home Premium or Windows 7 Professional , and then pay again for the upgrade .
However , Microsoft will roll out all of the versions on a single disc , allowing users the choice of either buying offline media or applying for an online upgrade key that will unlock the additional capabilities .
" Ultimate combines all of the features of Windows 7 Home Premium plus provides access to all of the Enterprise features including BitLocker , BitLocker To Go , AppLocker , BranchCache , DirectAccess ( accessing a corporate network without Remote Access Server installed ) , MUI , etc. , " Microsoft said .
BitLocker and AppLocker lock down data and applications , respectively .
And Ultimate Extras ?
Gone .
" Our new approach to planning and building Windows does n't have the capacity to continue to deliver features outside the regular release cycle , " Microsoft said .
Perhaps the largest change , however , is Microsoft 's recognition of the netbook market .
Previously , Microsoft sold its Starter software only into emerging markets .
Now , the company has positioned Starter as an ideal entry point for extending Windows 7 into netbooks .
The catch ?
Like other Starter editions , that netbook will only run three applications at a time , an arbitrary limitation the software imposes .
Those limitations ignore background services like antivirus applications , but trigger when the controlling antivirus application is opened , Microsoft 's documents say .
Starter is described as a " worldwide entry - level SKU " .
" Windows Starter has been our entry - level offering in emerging markets with Windows XP and Windows Vista , " Microsoft 's documents say .
" With Windows 7 we are making Windows 7 Starter our worldwide entry - level offering for small notebook PCs ( also known as netbooks ) .
" While these PCs with sufficient hardware will be able to run any Windows 7 SKU and we believe that most consumers will want the rich experience offered by Windows 7 Home Premium or Windows 7 Professional , we recognize that some consumers want a very low price point for their small notebook PC and only have basic computing requirements , " Microsoft added .
" Windows 7 Starter meets the needs for a certain segment of customers with reduced computing requirements . "
One interesting twist : Microsoft claims that any netbook should be able to run essentially any version of its Wndows 7 operating system : " However , Windows 7 was designed in a way that any edition of the OS should be able to run on small notebook PCs with sufficient hardware , " the documents say .
That , in part , is because the company said it has " invested significantly in engineering efforts around improving performance , reliability , and compatibility in Windows 7 . "
On the business front , Microsoft will offer Windows 7 Professional , with the capabilities of joining a managed network , backing up data over the network , and encrypting data .
The software will also allow users the option of location - aware printing , such as printing to a home printer while at home , and defaulting to a shared printer in an office environment .
Enterprise will offer a step up for Professional users , and will only be available through volume licensing .
With that version , business users will have the option of using BitLocker data encryption on internal and external drives , locking apps with AppLocker , improved remote access without the need for a VPN with DirectAccess , and a decrease in the time to open a shared file with a service called BranchCache .
Both of the latter services will require Windows Server 2008 R2 , Microsoft says .

Harvard Law Dean Elena Kagan , President Obama ’s choice to represent his administration before the Supreme Court , told a key Republican senator Tuesday that she believed the government could hold suspected terrorists without trial as war prisoners .
She echoed comments by Atty .
Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. during his confirmation hearing last month .
Both agreed that the United States was at war with Al Qaeda and suggested the law of war allows the government to capture and hold alleged terrorists without charges .
If confirmed as U.S. solicitor general , Kagan , 48 , will defend the administration ’s legal policy in the courts .
During the Bush administration , the solicitor general argued for the White House ’s war - on - terrorism policies , including the president ’s decision to imprison foreign fighters and alleged terrorists at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .

Last year , the Supreme Court dealt the Bush administration a setback when it ruled that these alleged “ enemy combatants ” had a right to be heard by a judge and to plead for their freedom .
But the high court left unanswered the question of whether accused terrorists and others with suspected ties to Al Qaeda could be held for years without trial .
That issue is now before the Obama administration .
The new president has announced that the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay will be closed , and he has created a task force of lawyers and military officers to decide how to handle current and future detainees .
The group will be led by Holder and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates .
In 2004 , the high court agreed with the Bush administration that battlefield prisoners can be imprisoned for the duration of the war .
Its decision came in the case of Yaser Esam Hamdi , a U.S. - born Taliban fighter who was captured in Afghanistan .
It is not clear whether the same applies to civilians who are captured as suspected terrorists .
Sens. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) and Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) both raised the issue Tuesday .
Feinstein called it “ a fundamental question as we consider the end planning for detainees as Guantanamo is closed . ”

Graham , a former Air Force lawyer , stressed the stark difference between criminal law and the law of war .
He and Kagan agreed that under criminal law , no person can be held indefinitely without a trial .
“ Do you believe we are at war ? ” Graham asked .
“ I do , Senator , ” Kagan replied .
Graham cited the example of someone who is not carrying a gun or fighting on a battlefield .
“ If our intelligence agencies should capture someone in the Philippines that is suspected of financing Al Qaeda worldwide , would you consider that person part of the battlefield ? ” he asked .
He added that he had asked the same question of Holder , who replied that he agreed that person was on the battlefield .

“ Do you agree with that ? ” the senator said .
“ I do , ” Kagan replied .
Graham said that under the law of war , the government can say , “ If you ’re part of the enemy force , there is no requirement to let them go back to the war and kill our troops .
Do you agree that makes sense ? ”
Kagan replied , “ I think it makes sense , and I think you ’re correct that that is the law . ”

“ So America needs to get ready for this proposition that some people are going to be detained as enemy combatants , not criminals , ” Graham concluded .
Civil liberties advocates , including the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights First , have urged the Obama administration to follow the U.S. rules of criminal justice in such cases .
Under these rules , civilians who are alleged to conspire with terrorists must be charged with a crime and given a trial .

How many times have you read on here that BDSM is not a one size fits all ?
That each person can tailor their lives to suit them with no recriminations and ridicule , and that no matter what your particular fetish or kink is that there is bound to be some more who like exactly the same as you .
With BDSM it is up to you as an individual to make it your own , and some people like soft core and some the more extreme , but that is what is so great about this life , there are no rights or wrongs , just differences * I am not including abuse in this as that is wrong no matter what style of life you lead *
A Dom or Master who likes spanking , this is not uncommon , how soft or extreme they like it is again not uncommon , there are many who think that a spanking is enough for them while there are those who like the whips and floggers , some like to tie a sub or slaves hands , others their whole body , again this is something for the individuals .
No matter how soft or extreme you want this life , it is possible , and as long as you are having fun there is no reason not to explore that side of yourself , as long as your partner * sub or slave * is willing as well
Video : Calif . cop shoots apparently helpless man in the back David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday January 5 , 2009

Two videos showing a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer fatally shooting an unarmed , cooperating 22 - year - old man have surfaced , thanks to a vigilant teen and an anonymous cameraman .
According to officials , five officers arrived at a subway station around 2 a.m. in response to reports of fighting on a train .
Officers handcuffed a group of suspects , and detained the soon - to - be victim , Oscar Grant III .
In both videos , though detained , Grant had clearly not been cuffed .
Mario Pangelina Jr. , aunt to Grant 's four - year - old daughter , witnessed the events leading up to the shooting .
" First , an officer grabbed Oscar by the neck and pushed him against the wall , " the Oakland Tribune quoted her as saying .
" Oscar did n't fight him , but he did n't go down either .
He was like , ' What did I do ? '
Then another officer came up with his Taser and held it right in his face .
Oscar said , ' Please do n't shoot me , please do n't Taser me , I have a daughter , ' over and over again , real fast , and he sat down . "
Footage captured by camera - phone - wielding Karina Vargas , 19 , shows officers had detained several men .
Over the proceeding minutes , officers become defensive as groups of yelling youths stand on the periphery and meander past .
At one point , a male shouts , " Yo , f -- k the police ! "
Vargas several times makes attempts to get closer .
When her camera focuses on Grant , he is sitting with his back against a wall , surrounded by others in handcuffs .
He holds up his hands , apparently speaking with the officers , when they force him to the ground .
Two officers struggle to turn him over , even as he appears to be strewn across another man 's legs , when suddenly one of the men retrieves his gun from its holster .
At this point in Vargas ' video , she turns to her immediate left and focuses on an officer wrestling another man to the ground .
Then , the shot rings out .
San Francisco's KTVU aired a second video clip from an anonymous witness .
In it , Grant is clearly pinned by two officers and completely immobile .
Then , without provocation , the officer at Grant 's waist draws his weapon and fires .
After the gunshot , as the audio track dissolves into indiscernible shouting and commotion , an enraged onlooker hurls an object at the police .
Vargas retreats to her train and peeks the camera at the officers again .
" They just shot him !
They just shot him ! " she yells .
" ... I got you , mothaf - - kers ! "
The victim was fatally wounded when the bullet passed through his back , hit the ground , and ricocheted into his lungs .
He died in a hospital several hours later .
Grant 's mother and daughter are being represented by civil rights attorney John Burris , who has a history of work on police abuse issues , including the beating of Rodney King .
At a Sunday news conference , Burris called the incident " without a doubt , the most unconscionable shooting I have ever seen . "
A person close to the investigation told the San Francisco Chronicle that BART officials are looking into the possibility that the officer thought he was firing a Taser and pulled out his gun by mistake .
Last June , a Maryland district court found that an officer who shot a fleeing suspect in the elbow while believing he was firing his Taser was not guilty of violating the suspect 's rights against unreasonable search and seizure .
Burris has announced a civil suit against BART for $ 25 million .
He has also recommended that charges of second - degree murder or manslaughter be filed against the officer .
" It 's pretty clear from the tape and from witnesses that he was n't doing anything of a threatening nature to the officer , " Burris said at a Jan. 4 press conference .
He added that he 's seen footage from three other cameras that captured Grant 's slaying .
The Bay Area police are appealing to the public for " calm . "
" We are taking this investigation very seriously , " said Chief Gary Gee during a Sunday press conference .
" As frustrating as it is , I want to stress that we cannot and will not jeopardize this case by discussing details before the investigation is complete . "

Learn How ... ' Socialize ' it ?
Oregon may grow , tax and sell medical marijuana Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday March 12 , 2009
Print This Email This Submitted legislation would impose $ 98 - per- ounce tax on cannabis
In most states , the issue of medical marijuana is not on any legislative docket .
In Oregon however , a state which already allows medical marijuana , socializing the weed is being pitched as a bipartisan cause célèbre .
Maybe socializing is the wrong word .
" House Bill 3247 would direct the state to establish and operate a marijuana production facility , " reported Oregon 's KGW - TV .
" The state would control potency and pharmacy distribution . "
Okay , so maybe it is n't .
If the legislation , which is currently in committee review , becomes law , the state would take control of Oregon 's booming cannabis industry , bringing growing and sales under the public domain .
Oregon 's current medical cannabis program allows care providers and patients to grow their own supply , but both Republicans and Democrats in the state feel the system is not working .
Their solution is to bankroll the bud on the public dime and charge a weighty tax -- $ 98 per ounce -- every time an approved patient makes a purchase .
" Many patients have no assurance that their marijuana is not laced with pesticides or other toxic chemicals , " Rep. Jim Thompson ( R - Dallas ) , told The Oregonian .
" If passed into law , this legislation will implement safe standards to dispense the drug through a tightly - controlled system . "
" Rep. Ron Maurer , R - Grants Pass , and Rep. Chris Harker , D - Beaverton , are also sponsors of the bill , " the paper reported .
" Now that 's what we call bipartisanship . "
" Radical ?
For sure , " said Oregon Live 's Janie Har .
" Even California , a state where dope dispensaries run rampant , does n't have government workers growing pot . "
" Private growers have been accused of illegally selling pot to non-cardholders , and other grow sites have been targeted by burglars and robbers , " reported Oregon station KATU .
" There are growing concerns that private grow sites are being misused for illegal marijuana sales , threatening the safety and well - being of legitimate participants in the program , " Rep. Chris Harker , ( D - Beaverton ) , told the station .
" ( The bill ) takes medical marijuana off the streets and into a safer and more secure environment . "
In 2004 , Oregon voters rejected a similar measure which would have created state - run cannabis distribution facilities .
According to the state 's Department of Human Services , about 21,000 have been approved for the medical cannabis program .

Kevin Saff is not what many would consider “ the ideal candidate . ”
He started his career as a C++ coder for a major manufacturer , but then quit to pursue a mathematics degree in Canada .
That did n’t quite do it for him either , as he then dropped out to pursue something far more interesting : canoe from Calgary to New Orleans .
But after 1,200 + miles of rowing , his journey ended in Minneapolis with a cracked boat and a frozen river .
Temporarily , of course , as he plans to pick up and continue south someday soon .
All that said , Kevin was pretty excited when he received his first response to all the resumes he ’d been sending out to various Minneapolis - based companies .
He immediately called back to schedule an interview and was pleasantly surprised at how flexible the interviewer was : Kevin could “ stop by any time . ”
After putting on his interview clothes , Kevin hopped on a bus , transferred to a few other busses , and , after almost two hours , finally reached his destination .
It was a residential apartment complex .
When he knocked on the door of “ Suite 318 , ” Kevin was greeted by Jeff , a man in his 50’s with glasses precariously perched on his conical head and a face a few days past shaved .
Upon entering the apartment , the first thing Kevin noticed was a blue tarp hung over the south - facing window , blocking the sun and a view of the Mississippi river .
The second was Jeff sitting down on a computer , firing up a popular MMO .
“ You see this , ” Jeff said , avatar running towards the closed city gate , “ when you get to the door you have to wait while the game loads the next area .
You should just be able to see out through it . ”
Taking this as the technical portion of the interview , Kevin started to explain about how he would implement dynamically loading regions .
Kevin was very clear that , while he had never written something like that before , he was certainly aware of the basic concepts involved .
“ Now , look .
He just runs right through the tree .
Right through it !
You see that ? ”
He harrumphed and turned toward Kevin with a look like someone died .
“ Mmm , horrible , ” was all Kevin could get out while he tried to think about what could be done to detect that kind of collision .
Jeff pulled up a website with a few 3D models on it and asked , “ what does 100,000 polygons mean ?
Hey , could we just have the program write whatever text we wanted over these signs so we could sell ads in - game ? ”
Kevin felt at a disadvantage since he had n’t done any 3D programming since toying around with POV - Ray work a decade ago .
He struggled through an explanation about how models are essentially a web of triangles with a flat texture projected onto them , and that in - game ads should not , in fact , be difficult .
“ Really ? ” Jeff said .
“ Okay , they tell me we can finish this in six months if we work part - time , so we can probably finish it in three if we work full - time . ”
He had been describing a game as complex as Spore .
“ I 'm outsourcing most of the work to the Philippines .
They ’re willing to work on a royalty basis .
You can transmit the technical requirements to them , change my words into code they can understand . ”
“ Change ... your words ... into code ... they ’ll understand ... ” Kevin gibbered .
“ Really , you can do that ? ”
Jeff peered through his glasses .
At that point , Kevin had given up all hope that a decent game could be made .
But he still wanted to know how much money he could get out of this guy .
“ So ... how much would I be getting for this ? ”
“ $ 75,000 per month , ” Jeff said , with no hesitation .
Kevin blinked .
“ That ’s , um , after the game ’s done , right ? ”
Jeff pulled up a spreadsheet .
“ A popular game gets about 250,000 players .
At $ 15 a month , that means they pull in ... $ 3,750,000 .
They tell me to pay about 10 % of that to the developers .
I ’d give you 2 % .
That ’s ... $ 75,000 . ” He smiled at the screen .
“ But , ah , nothing until we ’re pulling in that kind of money ? ”
“ We ’ll offer advertising in the game , ” he said .
“ Do n’t you think companies like Google would like to get in on this , advertise in our game ? ”
He blinked again .
“ I ’m not sure Google really needs that kind of exposure . ”
Deciding to go on the offensive , Kevin said “ Okay , a friend of mine , Calvin , worked for five years on his game , Venture the Void .
Go ahead and pull it up at venturethevoid.com . ”
He started typing in the address bar : “ venture of the void ” .
Kevin corrected him and soon colorful planets and spaceships swirled on the monitor .
“ Okay , see he ’s generating all these planets automatically .
No two are the same , they ’ve got times of day , automatically generated weather , plants ...
You see that spaceship ?
No two of them in the game are identical , even over multiple plays .
All that and guess how many paying players he got ? ” Kevin paused .
“ Twenty - five . ”
“ Oh , ” Jeff said , “ but did he advertise on this site ? ”
He navigated to the third or fourth hit on Google for “ MMO ” .
It was some portal for MMO games with reviews , news , and all sorts of things .
“ I ’m not sure , ” Kevin hesitated , “ Calvin submitted it lots of places . ”
He just shook his head .
“ All that work and he did n’t even advertise in the right places .
If he just would have advertised here , he could have been rolling in the money . ”
It was pretty clear that Kevin was n’t going to get any money out of this engagement , so he decided to cut his losses and make the long journey back to his own apartment .
As he stood up to end the interview , Jeff casually blurted out “ I never leave the apartment . ”
Kevin raised an eyebrow .
“ I ’ve got an idea every day , ” he said .
“ I ’ll just be doing something then , POW !
An idea !
That ’s why you need me .
Now , look at this . ”
Jeff walked over to his closet and took out one of those massive wargames from the 70’s .
He told him about a “ compare and contrast ” essay he had in college , “ comparing tic - tac - toe to checkers to chess to games like this with thousands of pieces . ”
Ten years ago , he presented investors the idea of developing a series of games like this on the computer .
“ ‘ It ’s just like printing money ! ’ they told me . ”
Not one game chit had been popped from its original cardboard .
Kevin could n’t help but wonder if any investors had sprung for this free money .
“ Have you ever played the computer game Civilization ? ” Jeff asked .
Before Kevin could even nod affirmatively , he continued “ One time I was playing and a chariot parked in the mountains defeated a howitzer !
That ’s just never going to happen .
One time I just sat down and started writing down things that were wrong with the game .
POW !
I had a list of ninety things , just like that . ”
It was time for him to go .
Kevin wished Jeff luck , but told him frankly what he thought of his enterprise .
After his two - hour ride home , the first thing he did when was email his friend Calvin the link to the magical money - making MMO forum , asking for only 2 % of his proceeds .
He expects to be rolling in money any time now .
Photo Gallery Salvaging Cologne's Destroyed Historical Archive
Many in Germany 's fourth biggest city are asking if the collapse of one of Europe 's most important historical archives was caused by the construction of an underground railway line .
One report suggests work on the line was n't done as carefully as it should have been .
Fredrik Neij , one of the PirateBay admins currently on trial in Stockholm , admitted that he was hupping his servers from the courtroom while the lawyers were making closing arguments :
– A server was down and I restarted it , Neij tells expressen.se .
He is one of the four founders of The Pirate Bay that stand accused of " complicity to making copyrighted material accessible " ( yes , that 's the charge ) .
That did n't stop him from taking care of a server mishap in the middle of the trial 's closing argument .
Thepiratebay.org was down during the best part of Monday , which had a good deal of file - sharing folks worried that the website might be down for good this time .
Thankfully for them , he had his trusty laptop at hand and could restart the server remotely , so that eager fileswappers could get back inside .
- We have Internet access [ in the court room ] so it was no problem , Neij told Expressen today ( Tuesday ) ;
- Besides , I 'm keeping up with the coverage of the trial .
The farcical battle between a sadly incompetent prosecution vs. knowledgeable and sometimes loud - mouthed defendants is almost at an end , and the fact that Neij manages thepiratebay.org 's servers remotely during the trial is just one of several examples that point out the huge gap in technical know - how that the sides have exhibited .

Sonic Hedgehog
Purpose
The purpose of this page is to describe the protein Sonic Hedgehog ( shh ) .
Secondary goals include a discussion of mutants and a brief description of two shh homologues .
How Shh Got its Name
Sonic hedgehog is , in fact , named after the character from the popular Sega Genesis video game .
The original hedgehog gene was found in Drosophila and was named for the appearance of the mutant phenotype which causes an embryo to be covered with pointy denticles resembling a hedgehog .
The first two homologues of hedgehog were named after species of hedgehog and the third was named after the video game character ( Gilbert , 2000 ) .
What is Sonic Hedgehog ?
Sonic Hedgehog is one of three homologues found in vertebrates .
The hedgehog family consists of sonic hedgehog ( shh ) , desert hedgehog ( dhh ) , and indian hedgehog ( ihh ) .
Shh is the most common of the three and is therefore the best documented ( Gilbert , 2000 ) .
Shh is made in the notochord of developing embryos .
This important protein has many functions throughout the life of the organisms in which it is expressed .
Below a few of these areas are described in detail .
How Shh Functions in Early Development
In the neural tube , the dorsal region is where the spinal neurons will get input from sensory neurons .
The motor neurons reside in the ventral region .
The embryonic development of the dorsal region is determined by signals coming from the epidermis , and the development of the ventral region is determined by signals , such as proteins , coming from the notochord .
It is this ventral development stemming from the notochord that shh enters the scene .
As shh is secreted from the notochord , a gradient is formed .
Different levels of shh cause different types of cells to be formed in the developing embryo ( Gilbert , 2000 ) .
Figure 1 describes how shh is secreted from the cell .
Figure 1 : This cartoon depicts the process by which shh is secreted from cells in the notochord from transcription to secretion .
The original protein product undergoes cholesterol - mediated cleavage .
The amino - terminal portion is the active portion and is secreted from the cell following cleavage .
These initially secreted proteins induce medial hinge cells to form the floor plate of the neural tube .
The floor plate cells secrete more shh that will form the shh gradient throughout the developing embryo .
This concentration signal will determine cell fates throughout the neural tube ( Gilbert , 2000 ) .

Shh is a transcription regulating protein .
It makes sense that a molecule involved in development would regulate transcription because cells are taking on specific characteristics during development based on which genes are transcribed .
Shh affects two other genes that are part of the pathway through which shh functions ( Gilbert , 2000 ) .
See Figure 2 for a more detailed explanation .
Figure 2 : Shh interacts with two transmembrane proteins as it interacts with sells in the neural tube .
They are Patched ( ptc ) and Smoothened ( smo ) .
Ptc actually binds with shh whereas smo is a signal transducer .
In the absence of shh , ptc inhibits smo .
The inhibition of smo actives a transcriptional repressor , and so transcription does not occur .
When shh is present , it binds with ptc and so ptc cannot interfere with the functioning of smo .
With smo uninhibited , other proteins are able to enter the nucleus that will cause transcription to be activated ( Gilbert , 2000 ) .

Shh in Optic Development
Shh is involved in the separation of the single eye field into two bilateral fields .
Although not proven , it is thought that shh emitted from the prechordal plate suppresses Pax6 which causes the eye field to divide into two .
If the shh gene is mutated , the result is cyclopia , a single eye in the center of the face ( Gilbert , 2000 ) .
Pasta is one of the best ways to introduce omnivores to vegetarian dishes that , in the immortal words of my friend Kendra , “ do n’t suck . ”
The truth is , there is no reason in the world that vegetarian cuisine should suck any more than non-vegetarian cuisines .
Delicious is delicious , and as far as I am concerned , plant - based foods can be just as delectable as meat - based foods .
When you add eggs , honey and dairy products to the plant - based foods , you are heading toward culinary Nirvana .
Now , do n’t get me wrong –there are some delicious vegan cuisines in the world .
Some of the Indian traditional diets are vegan and most Buddhist Chinese and Japanese cuisines are completely vegan , and every dish I have tasted from those traditions are amazingly splendid and filled with flavor .
But , I have to admit that I love eggs , especially when they come from free - range hens , and cheese in nearly every one of its forms , has been my favorite food since I could toddle along and show a preference .
I love me some cheese .
And honey –oh –I like it way better than cane sugar because its flavor is the essence of sunlight .
Okay , enough blathering about my thoughts on vegetarian cuisine , and on to the luxuriously decadent vegetarian pasta which I want you all to try–that is , unless you are allergic to tree nuts .
In that case , skip this one .
The inspiration for this recipe came from a dish that another Babara made years and years ago at Seven Sauces , a restaurant that used to be “ The ” place to eat in Athens .
The chef and founder , a dear lady named Barbara , ( her son was one of my line cooks at Salaam–and a damned good one , too ) used to make a delicious vegetarian pasta dish that included gorgonzola , broccoli , garlic and toasted walnuts , all tossed with fettuccine in a light cream sauce .
That was my favorite dish , and I ate it just about every time I went there , which was a lot back in those years .
I just loved it and could never get enough of it–in fact , on the night of my and Zak ’s wedding rehearsal dinner , which was held at Seven Sauces , I ordered it , but to my dismay , I was too nervous to do more than pick at it .
So , that dish has been in my memory for years .
And now that Seven Sauces is no more , and the dear chef has gone to greener pastures years before , I decided I should just haul off and cook my own version of it .
So that is what I did , but of course , I made a few modifications myself .
Which is what I always do , as everyone knows .
First of all , I substituted rapini for the broccoli .
It has a similar flavor , but a texture and shape that is much more amenable to getting twirled up on the fork with the fettuccine–no “ stabby - stabby , twirly - twirly maneuvers ” are necessary to eat it .
( You know –stab the broccoli floret , then twirl the pasta , then eat . )
With the rapini , all you have to do is go twirly - twirly with the fork , and voila–a bite of pasta with greens come together in one wonderful mouthful .
I also added caramelized onions and a bit of sherry because to my way of thinking , everything tastes better with caramelized onions and sherry .
Well , nearly anything .
And , I put a tiny bit of Aleppo pepper in it , but you could be like the original Barbara and use lots of cracked black peppercorns instead–because frankly , if I could without fear of allergic reaction –I would .
What is crucial to this dish , however , is the cheese .
Get the nicest gorgonzola you can afford–or failing that , get whatever good blue cheese you can get .
You only need about three ounces of it , and the rest of the ingredients are n’t that expensive , so splurge a little .
It is really worth it to use the best ingredients you can in a pasta dish this simple .
Now , if you cannot eat blue - veined cheeses because you are allergic to blue - green molds , well , then –I am sad for you , because I know how you feel .
If that is the case , use a ripened cheese , like a brie or Camembert .
It wo n’t taste the same , but it will still be very , very good .
Just remove the rind from it –I do n’t like the lumps it leaves in the sauce .
One more thing –this is a very rich dish .
You do n’t need to eat much of it to feel satisfied .
Just a small bowl of it is enough to satiate even the greatest of appetites .
To cut the richness , you can serve it with a green leafy salad with a light balsamic vinaigrette dressing .
Morganna tasted it and said it would be better with prosciutto , but I disagree .
First of all , it would defeat the purpose of eating a vegetarian meal , and secondly , and more importantly , I think it would make it far too rich .
She argued that it was already rich and I should just throw down and be like Mario Batali and just own the richness and take it over the top , but no –I think I will leave it as it is .
Maybe some wild mushrooms next time , but no prosciutto .
Anyway , here is how to make it–sans prosciutto .
Fettuccine with Rapini , Walnuts and Gorgonzola
Ingredients :
1 cup shelled English walnut pieces
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 cups thinly sliced onions
1 teaspoon salt
4 cloves garlic , peeled and minced
1/2 teaspoon Aleppo pepper flakes or freshly ground black pepper to taste
4 cups rapini , washed well and dried , then thinly cut in ribbons or small chunks , excluding the larger stalks
1/3 cup dry sherry
1/2 cup heavy cream
3 ounces gorgonzola cheese , crumbled
salt to taste
1 pound fettuccine , cooked al dente and drained
Method :
Warm a wide , deep , heavy - bottomed pan over medium flame for a minute or two .
Add the walnut pieces and toast , stirring , until the nuts darken slightly and begin to smell brown and good .
Remove from the pan and allow to cool .
Reserve 1/3 of the nut pieces , and chop the rest until they are fine , but not powdery .
Wipe the pan you used to toast the walnuts out and use to cook the rest of the sauce .
Add the olive oil and heat over a medium flame for a minute , then add the onions .
Spread them into a near - single layer and sprinkle with salt , then cook , stirring , until they turn medium golden brown .
Sprinkle in the garlic , pepper flakes , or black pepper , and the finely chopped walnut pieces , and cook , stirring , until the garlic is fragrant and golden .
Add the rapini , and cook , stirring , until the leaves wilt and give up some of their moisture .
Add the sherry , and stir , allowing the alcohol to boil away .
Add the cream , and cook , stirring until the cream boils .
Add 2/3 of the cheese , stirring until it is combined with the sauce .
Taste for salt and adjust seasoning as needed .
Add the freshly cooked , drained fettuccine to the pan , turn off the heat , and toss to coat the pasta .
( Here is an important tip–if you cannot get the timing of having the sauce and the pasta ready at the same moment , cook the sauce first , then turn off the heat or turn it down to way - down - granny - low , while the pasta cooks .
The pasta cannot wait for the sauce–it will get all gummy and cold and nasty if it waits , whereas the pasta sauce will be fine .
You may lose the fresh green color of the rapini if you cook it too long , but it wo n’t ruin the texture and overall flavor of the dish . )
Twirl into bowls , and sprinkle with the reserved nuts and crumbled gorgonzola bits .
This makes enough to serve four to six adults , depending on their appetites and whether or not you serve salad with it .

Money Morning
As I watch the $ 900 billion stimulus bill wind its way through Congress , knowing this will be piled atop the estimated 2009 deficit of $ 1.19 trillion , the longtime banker in me keeps asking the same worrisome question :
How the devil are they going to finance all this rubbish ?
A report released Wednesday by the U.S. Treasury Department 's Borrowing Advisory Committee on the government 's borrowing plans gave me the answer I expected : With great difficulty .
Truth be told , recent market developments have already provided a warning – though I 'm not altogether certain that message has been received .
In fact , much of the market may be focusing on the wrong problem .
Treasury Debt Worries
According to a MarketWatch.com news story also released Wednesday , analysts are worriedthat the interbank market is becoming tighter again , since the three - month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) has risen from a low of 1.09 % on Jan. 13 to 1.23 % Wednesday , while the benchmark Federal Funds rate has remained in target range of 0.00 % to 0.25 % .
They fear that banks are once again becoming nervous about the health and stability of their sector brethren , making them even more reluctant to lend to one another .
However , if people are worried about the creditworthiness of banks , they 're a lot more worried about the U.S. Treasury .
The 10 - year Treasury bond yield bottomed out at 2.07 % on Dec. 17 .
Wednesday 's closing yield was 2.93 % .
Thus , while LIBOR has increased by 14 basis points , or 0.14 % , the 10 - year Treasury bond yield , which is supposed to be less volatile than short - term rates , has risen by 86 basis points , or 0.86 % .
This is not entirely a panic reaction by investors fearful that the U.S. government will go bust ( although credit - default - swap spreads on the U.S government debt have widened recently , and are higher than on Germany ) .
It also represents two other factors :
The fear of inflation .
And the increasing difficulty the U.S. Treasury is likely to find in financing its gigantic borrowing requirements .
The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee paints a bleak picture .
The average maturity of Treasury debt has declined from the 60 - to - 70 - month average that was the rule from 1986 to 2002 , all the way down to the 48 months that 's been the norm of late .
And that 's at a time of exceptionally low real interest rates , which the Treasury could have locked in for decades to come if it had borrowed long - term .
From 2001 to 2007 , Treasury abolished the 30 - year Treasury bond , financing only shorter - term during a period in which rates were low and the budget deficit was exploding upwards .
We 're not talking great foresight here !
This tactic – borrowing short - term and hoping for the best – is still being used .
All the existing issue maturities – in two , three , five , 10 and 30 years – are being increased and the 30 - year issues are being moved from quarterly to monthly .
However , the advisory committee recognized that even these changes would not be enough to fund the U.S. Treasury 's borrowing requirement , which the Committee estimated could be as much as $ 3 trillion to $ 4 trillion between now and September 2010 .
( In addition to the official budget deficit , the federal government 's various " investments " in the U.S. banking system , the automobile sector and elsewhere must be financed somehow ) .
A Mismatched Strategy ?
The committee did n't take the opportunity to recommend issuing 50 - year bonds , which Britain has done very successfully , and which would have had the advantage of postponing the maturity beyond the problems caused by Baby Boomer retirements and medical needs ( by 2059 , the youngest Baby Boomers would be 95 , so there wo n't be many left ) .
Instead , the government decided to issue seven - year bonds , hoping for some unexpected additional investor demand in the range between five years and 10 years .
The committee 's schedule will cause real problems with refinancing .
The plan to issue $ 540 billion annually in two - year notes and $ 420 billion in three - year notes brings huge refinancing problems in 2011 and 2012 , precisely when the budget deficit will still be gigantic and credit will be needed to finance the ( hoped - for ) early stages of an economic recovery .
By keeping debt maturities so short , the committee raises the risk of serious market indigestion , which would force yields much higher and cause major damage to the economy .
This financing problem is the hidden side of stimulus packages .
The federal budget deficit is likely to run around 10 % of U.S. gross domestic product ( GDP ) in 2009 and 2010 , and should continue close to that level for several years thereafter ( because the government could not risk killing a fragile recovery by pushing too hard to get the budget back into balance ) .
With Treasury bond issue maturities being so short , producing large refinancing needs , the impact of such huge financing demands on the economy will be huge .
What 's the " Right " Size For the Stimulus ?
Followers of the great British economist , John Maynard Keynes , like to brag about the supposed " multiplier " of government spending , by which $ 1 in spending produces , say , $ 1.50 of extra output .
However , if the deficit - financing problems become severe , $ 1 of spending would produce less than $ 1 of net extra output .
Indeed , too much stimulus could even reduce net output by driving up interest rates and " crowding out " private sector borrowers from the market .
That would make the Keynesian multiplier negative .
As the winner of the 2008 presidential election , President Barack Obama has a right to alter spending priorities to reflect his victory and the desires of his supporters .
At this point , however , I 'm starting to believe that he should do so by replacing other spending on a dollar - for - dollar basis ( raising taxes in a recession is also dangerous ) .
Since the U.S. budget deficit – before any stimulus – is already predicted to be $ 1.19 trillion in the fiscal that ends in September , the economically ideal size of a stimulus package may well be negative .
Tens of thousands of Californians out of work for more than a year soon will be getting an extra 20 weeks of unemployment insurance checks , thanks to the federal economic stimulus program .
The Legislature approved the extended benefits Thursday , and processing of them is expected to get underway as early as today after Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signs legislation authorizing the state to receive more than $ 3 billion from Washington .
The money will be an immediate lifeline for 76,000 people whose benefits were set to run out April 11 .
By the end of the year , an estimated 394,000 more should get the extra help .
“ This is a safety net .
It buys me time , ” said Alan Feuerstein , a Santa Monica writer , who hopes to find new work before he exhausts the latest extension .

The money comes at a time when the state is reporting a 10.5 % unemployment rate for February , its highest level in 26 years .
About 1.95 million Californians are without jobs .
Last month , unemployment hit 10.9 % in Los Angeles County , 11.9 % in San Bernardino County , 12.6 % in Riverside County , 9.2 % in Ventura County and 7.8 % in Orange County .
Twenty - one of the state ’s 58 counties -- all rural areas of the Central Valley , desert and mountains -- have unemployment in excess of 15 % .
“ Accessing billions of dollars in federal unemployment aid not only will keep families in their homes , it ’s going to provide a quick boost to withering local economies and small businesses , ” said Art Pulaski , executive secretary - treasurer of the California Labor Federation .
Weekly benefits run from $ 65 to $ 475 .
Under the extension , the maximum period for benefits will increase to 79 weeks from 59 weeks .

This is the third benefit extension in recent years .
Before the recession , the unemployed could get 26 weeks of benefits .
Then - President Bush and Congress twice extended benefits last year .
People whose benefits have run out will be eligible for the extension if they were getting checks on Feb. 22 .
On Thursday , lawmakers gave final approval to a pair of bills that made California eligible for the $ 3 billion in benefits and an additional $ 839 million that could be used to bolster the state ’s insolvent unemployment insurance fund .
Schwarzenegger praised both parties in the state Senate and Assembly for working out differences over the extension legislation and a related measure that makes it easier for low - wage workers to qualify for assistance .

“ I applaud the Legislature for working across the aisle and as quickly as possible to pass this needed legislation that will help boost our economy , provide critical services for Californians , create jobs and put people back to work , ” he said .
Getting the two bills to the governor ’s desk turned out to be somewhat of a tricky proposition .
Early in the process , business groups and their Republican allies in the Legislature were nervous that taking the federal money could force employers to pay higher taxes in the future .
“ We wanted to make sure that California is eligible for the stimulus money , but that it ’s done in a way that does n’t leave us with future financial obligations that are unchecked , ” said Jason Schmelzer , a lobbyist for the California Chamber of Commerce .
After extensive negotiations , the chamber is satisfied that taking the federal money will be good for workers , business and the state ’s tax revenues .

Officials expect the influx of cash from the extension to be spent almost immediately on food , rent and other necessities .
They said money should quickly circulate through local businesses .
“ The most important thing we can do right now to help our economy and the day - to - day lives of Californians is to make sure those who are unemployed have the cash to pay their bills and feed their families , ” said Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) .

( CNN ) -- During the Great Depression , President Franklin Roosevelt reassured anxious Americans through his famous fireside chats over the radio .
Americans can submit questions on WhiteHouse.gov for President Obama to answer live online Thursday .
Now , in the 21st century , President Obama has found his own fireside equivalent , launching an online town hall meeting Thursday where he will answer citizens ' questions about the troubled economy and his efforts to fix it .
" We 're going to try something a little different .
We are going to take advantage of the Internet to bring all of you to the White House to talk about the economy , " he says in an introductory video on the site .
As of late Wednesday afternoon , more than 30,000 people had submitted more than 32,000 questions on the official administration Web site , WhiteHouse.gov .
Americans may submit questions , and vote on others ' queries , until 9:30 a.m. ET Thursday .
Obama has promised to answer the most popular questions through a live video stream on WhiteHouse.gov .
beginning Thursday at 11:30 a.m. ET .
The site had recorded more than 1 million votes as of late Wednesday afternoon .
The White House 's
Web site asks people to agree to post " only questions related to the economy ( including topics essential to long - term economic growth , such as education , fiscal responsibility , green jobs and energy , health care reform , and home ownership ) . "
A quick review of questions revealed deep concerns among Americans trying to make ends meet .
" What is the government doing to make higher education more affordable for lower and middle class families ? " asked James of Bloomington , Indiana , who described himself as a full - time student who also works full time , " only to break even at the end of the month . "
" Why do I have to be to the point of foreclosure to get any help with my mortgage ?
Why are n't you helping the people who want to prevent foreclosure ? " asked another questioner from Providence , Rhode Island .
Observers say Obama , who revolutionized the use of technology as a political tool during his campaign , will be the first president to address questions from the public live on the Internet .
By allowing people to submit any question they want and answering them live on the Web for the entire world to see , the administration hopes to create a more transparent style of governing that will help win public support .
" This is just the tip of the iceberg , " said Don Tapscott , author of " Growing Up Digital , " a book exploring the generation that has grown up on the Web .
" It turns out that the Internet is a new medium of human communication that not only helps you get elected , it changes the way you govern . "
Along the presidential campaign trail , Obama was praised for his innovative use of social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook to announce events , rally volunteers and raise money .
Nine years ago , when George W. Bush ran for president , Internet media tools such as Facebook , Twitter and YouTube did n't exist .
Bush and former President Bill Clinton engaged in online chats with citizens , but neither relied on the Internet as a platform for reaching the American public as Obama does , said Andrew Rasiej , co-founder of the Personal Democracy Forum and the tech President blog .
" It 's changing the relationship between the president and the country , " Rasiej says .
" It 's building on a 21st - century information age platform .
We want to make sure our president is n't stuck in a bubble . "
Some observers wondered whether Obama 's creative social media initiatives , dubbed Obama 2.0 , would continue once he entered office .
But Thursday 's online meeting -- the first of many , according to the government -- reaffirms his commitment to engaging with Americans through technology , Rasiej said .
While Obama 's staffers have stopped posting updates on social networking sites since the election , they are sill reaching constituents through WhiteHouse.gov , which is more interactive than previous administrations '
Web sites .
Launching an online town hall meeting will allow more effective communication with citizens , said Ellen Miller , executive director at the Sunlight Foundation , a group that advocates government transparency .
Americans can submit their own questions and receive direct responses without questions or answers being filtered by the media , she said .
" There might be a question asked that would n't have been asked at a press conference , " she said .
" It 's a significant step forward for new - media communications . "
Adam Ostrow , editor of Mashable.com , a guide to social media , said the online town hall - style meeting will encourage Americans to get involved beyond the election .
" It gives people a sense of participation and what is going on and to be able to shape some of the decision that will be made , " he said .

Porsche earned more profits than revenues in the first half of its financial year thanks to controversial dealings in Volkswagen options that left many hedge funds nursing heavy losses .
The luxury sports car - maker reported this morning that it enjoyed a € 6.8 bn ( £ 6.3 bn ) windfall from its share options in VW , whose value soared last autumn after it emerged that Porsche controlled most of the company .
But Porsche also gave its first signal that the global recession has caught up with it by warning that sales would drop this year , as high - rolling consumers opt for less conspicuous products .
First - half sales revenues were down 13 % to €3bn as pre-tax profits quadrupled to € 7.3bn .
Under Wendelin Wiedeking and Holger Haerter , its abrasive chief executive and chief financial officer respectively , Porsche angered market players late last year by its obscure dealings in VW options which , briefly , made VW the world 's largest company by market capitalisation as the stock rose five times in value to more than € 1,000 per share .
Hedge funds had short - sold VW , on the belief that the company was overvalued .
But panic buying broke out on 28 October last year when the market realised that Porsche actually owned or held options on most of VW 's shares , leaving the ' shorters ' chasing the remaining few shares to close their positions .
The German authorities , including chief regulator BaFin , mounted an inquiry into alleged short - selling and market manipulation which ended inconclusively .
Investors remain wary of Porsche which is now seeking a credit rating for the first time to restore confidence and has always protested its innocence .
Porsche already owns 51 % of VW , the world 's third - largest auto group , and has just secured an extension to a € 10bn credit line to help fund its purchase of more VW stock to boost its stake to 75 % - enough to give it full control of a normal German company .
But the federal state of Lower Saxony continues to hold on to a blocking 20 % vote .
" Knowledge of the sizes and shapes of asteroids is crucial to understanding how , in the early days of our Solar System , dust and pebbles collected together to form larger bodies and how collisions and re-accumulation have since modified them , " says Marco Delbo from the Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur , France , who led the study .
Direct imaging with adaptive optics on the largest ground - based telescopes such as the Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) in Chile ( see ESO 21/05 and 18/07 ) , and space telescopes , or radar measurements ( ESO 11/07 ) are the currently favoured methods of asteroid measurement .
However , direct imaging , even with adaptive optics , is generally limited to the one hundred largest asteroids of the main belt , while radar measurements are mostly constrained to observations of near - Earth asteroids that experience close encounters with our planet .
Delbo and his colleagues have devised a new method that uses interferometry to resolve asteroids as small as about 15 km in diameter located in the main asteroid belt , 200 million kilometres away .
This is equivalent to being able to measure the size of a tennis ball a distance of a thousand kilometres .
This technique will not only increase the number of objects that can be measured dramatically , but , more importantly , bring small asteroids that are physically very different from the well studied larger ones into reach .
The interferometric technique combines the light from two or more telescopes .
Astronomers proved their method using ESO 's VLTI , combining the light of two of the VLT 's 8.2 - metre Unit Telescopes .
" This is equivalent to having vision as sharp as that of a telescope with a diameter equal to the separation between the two VLT Unit Telescopes used , in this case , 47 metres , " says co-author Sebastiano Ligori , from INAF - Torino , Italy .
The researchers applied their technique to the main belt asteroid ( 234 ) Barbara , which was earlier found , by co-author Alberto Cellino , to have rather unusual properties .
Although it is so far away , the VLTI observations also revealed that this object has a peculiar shape .
The best fit model is composed of two bodies each the size of a major city – with diameters of 37 and 21 km – separated by at least 24 km .
" The two parts appear to overlap , " says Delbo , " so the object could be shaped like a gigantic peanut or , it could be two separate bodies orbiting each other . "
If Barbara proves to be a double asteroid , this is even more significant : by combining the diameter measurements with the parameters of the orbits , astronomers can then compute the density of these objects .
" Barbara is clearly a high priority target for further observations , " concludes Ligori .
Having proven the validity of their new and powerful technique , the team can now start a large observing campaign to study small asteroids .

Robert Pigott reports .
The GIVE Act H.R. 1388 , Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act , is a bill now being reviewed in Congress .
I do not know if it will pass and become law .
I think it resembles the real estate debacle in so far as it needs a lot of inept compliance to get anywhere .
Instead of a sharp sword that took skill and time to create , the wording of this bill reminds me of a huge heavy blunt club with a few nails embedded in the tip .
But therein is its very power .
The words are purposefully indistinct and vague .
A paid - off judge armed with a bunch of legalistic scribbles that can be interpreted the way he wants is empowered to do injustice .
Stepping back in time a bit , when I first saw Mr M's article about this bill I did not know what to think .
" The 12th amendment to the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act ( GIVE ) , that was just rubber stamped by the Senate , states , “ Amendment to prohibit organizations from attempting to influence legislation ; organize or engage in protests , petitions , boycotts , or strikes ; and assist , promote , or deter union organizing .
" This is being attached to a bill that will make military service mandatory and which will create a seven- million person domestic army under direct authority of the Federal government .
And they 're going to be trained into believing that trying to influence legislation , engaging in protests , signing a petition , boycotts , striking , or to assist , promote , union organizing , will be an act against our government and under those guidelines , under the still in place Patriot Act , be considered an enemy combatants and can be interned without charge indefinitely . "
After I read these words by Mr. M I did not know what to think so I did some research .
It took awhile and some research to discover that this was indeed a real bill .
I now have the entire bill on my desktop ( minus any sneaky rewording they have done to the bill as it goes on its way through the government .. they are pretty sneaky with that these days ) .
The bill is a maze of words so as to confuse .
I did a speed read to try and get the gist of it .
And when I got the gist of I got a bit panicky .
This was my reaction ( in the comment area of Mr. M's article ) :
The Great War has Begun ...
In the mythic words of the Lord of the Rings , it is fair to say " The Great War has Begun . "
The Orcs are on the march from Mordor .
They will soon reach Osgiliath .
No one knows who will win ...
Frodo and his friends or the evil Sauron .
Oh my God !!! ”
Since having said that I now feel a bit less dramatic about the whole thing .
But I am none - the - less still alarmed and am glad that Mr. M and his article have enabled me to become a more informed citizen .
I now realize what kinds of things our government is doing these days .
I feel now that " Mordor 's Orc Army " has not been created yet but that this bill and its intention is to create just that .
I am not calling humans " Orcs " but saying , rather , that when people are horribly mistreated , some of their actions can become pretty dangerous ; understandably so .
Another commentor to the article , " Jersey Girl , " said this :
disturbing amendments ...
H.Amdt. 48 Rep. Titus [ D - NV ] by
Amendment to create a National Service Reserve Corps and requires an annual service requirement of at least 10 hours and / or annual training .
A member of the National Service Reserve Corps is one who has completed a term of national service , fulfilled training , and will respond to national disasters and other emergencies .
These individuals will be listed in a national database for the ease of immediate deployment in case of emergency .
Proposed : Mar 18 , 2009 .
Accepted : Mar 18 , 2009 .
Rep. Miller [ D - CA ] H.Amdt. 49 by
The amendments prohibits organizations from attempting to influence legislation ; organize or engage in protests , petitions , boycotts , or strikes ; and assist , promote , or deter union organizing .
Proposed : Mar 18 , 2009 .
Accepted : Mar 18 , 2009 .
Later on in the comment area Jersey Girl tells us how easy it would be to make this army happen :
There are NO jobs in this country for our people .
Especially young ones coming out of school now .
What do you think happens to so many young people when they can't find work ?
They join the MILITARY do n't they ?
So now , with these civilian brigades they are talking about , most of America 's youth will be joining .. following me yet ?
They are intending to hook everyone in this " volunteerism " brigade to an electronic base to keep track of their whereabouts at all times .
Which by the time they are through recuiting will be EVERYONE .
Since they mention even seniors in their plan , I 'm sure Obama 's Social Security and Medicare cuts will force this group into the " corporation 's " brigade as well ..
And the word " corporation " is fascist enough is it not ?
Now go back and read the second amendment I posted in my previous comment .
If you do a little critical thinking it 's certainly not a big leap at all to come to the conclusion that it means the final end to any freedom of speech in this country .
With nearly every citizen being part of this process due to lack of jobs and income the implications are chilling to say the least .
The free speech cages , tasers and sprays that they use on us at protests and on the streets and airports are bad enough but in this amendment that has been " approved " they are saying we are n't even allowed to speak out against the government without punishment by law .
Wake up .
This is how Nazi Germany started with their youth brigades and E Germany with their Stasi .
Those people thought they were a great idea too .
After all who does n't want to serve their country ?
But how can a free country ask it 's citizens to spy on each other in the name of freedom ?
How can a free country ask it 's citizens to give up their civil liberties while serving their country in a civilian capacity as this amendment seems to do ?
Is this the America you want ?
Is n't this the America you saw under George W Bush and rejected ? "
I think Jersey Girl made some very pertinent observations in those comments .
Let me tell you more about this bill and what I see as its intent to create what I am calling an " ORC ARMY " Here are some words of the bill itself and who the government wants to ensnare and how ... in its purposely confusing language .
SEC .
1302 . REQUIRED AND ELIGIBLE NATIONAL SERVICE PROGRAMS .
Section 122 is amended to read as follows :
SEC .
122 . NATIONAL SERVICE PROGRAMS ELIGIBLE FOR PROGRAM ASSISTANCE .
( a) Required National Service Corps -
The recipient of a grant under section 121( a ) and each Federal agency operating or supporting a national service program under section 121 ( b ) shall , directly or through grants or subgrants to other entities , carry out or support the following national service corps , as full - or part - time corps , including during the summer months , to address unmet educational , health , veteran , or environmental needs .
You are specified as a recipient of a grant that obliges you to service but the grant it seems ( the wording here is very confusing ) can be given to someone who is associated with you and not you .
And it does not specify whether or not you applied for or wanted this " grant . "
(3) APPROVED SUMMER OF SERVICE POSITION -
The term ‘ approved summer of service position ’ means a position in a program described under section 120 ( c ) ( 8 ) for which the Corporation has approved the provision of a summer of service educational award as one of the benefits to be provided for successful service in the position .
AWARD ?
God save me from such " awards . "
Here is more about these " awards " :
( e) Application for Grant -
(1) SUBMISSION -
To receive a grant or enter into a contract under this part , an applicant shall prepare , submit to the Corporation , and obtain approval of , an application at such time , in such manner , and containing such information and assurances as the Corporation may reasonably require .
In requesting applications for assistance under this part , the Corporation shall specify such required information and assurances .
This last paragraph has an " applicant " applying for a grant .
The nature of the applicant may be spelled out in the wording at the end of the paragraph were the word " corporation " is used .
Here are more of the people this " ORC ARMY " is supposed to include as mentioned in the bill :
(4) BABY BOOM GENERATION -
The term ‘ Baby Boom generation ’ means the generation that consists of individuals born during the period beginning with 1946 and ending with 1964 .
And others mentioned are ...

Hello ,
I have watched how Russia uses her press ( Russia Today & RIA ) and it is very predictable .
The press has a few articles that state issues about possible problems with things .
( anything )
Then as we get closer to the day of reckoning the articles get more to the point .
Then what they have hinted at happens .
It is like clock work and 95 % accurate .
I call these articles warning shots like over the bow of a ship on the seas .
In the case of Ukraine this time , about two weeks ago the first article appeared that Ukraine is having issues with collecting money for gas payments .
Then the articles appeared about Ukraine cutting back on the amount of gas they need .
Then came articles that Ukraine might not be able to come up with all the money .
Now , the articles state how the situation can be circumvented .
The next articles will be about Ukraine not paying .
So on and So on !
So : Medvedev is letting the world know that Ukraine is about to default and once again not pay her gas bills .
The message is very clear and Medvedev has come up with a way to help and Russia will lead the way …
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev suggested on Sunday that European financial institutions should create a pool to help Ukraine pay for natural gas supplies and Russia was ready to participate in this process .
“ Some analysts say that the economic situation in Ukraine is virtually close to a collapse .
If we feel that they are unable to pay , let ’s create a financial pool and help them with money .
I believe this is a way out of the situation for all .
There is a group of European financial institutions and we are also ready to participate , ” Medvedev said in an interview with the Spanish media on the eve of his visit to Spain .

Russian media reports said , citing sources in Gazprom , could again cut off gas supplies to Ukraine if $ 400 million was not transferred by March 7 .
I can promise you that Ukraine is about to go belly up just like Iceland did .
Ukraine owes everyone and their brother money .
Do n’t say that Russia has not fired several warning shots …

Asus ’ success with its
Eee line of netbooks might have come as a surprise , but the company is now determined to expand the Eee brand into every possible niche and form factor .
Case in point : the insanely cool Eee Keyboard , which will surely bring a smile on the faces of those who remember the glory days of the home computer .
Pictures courtesy of El Reg .
At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , Asus showed off its latest addition to the EEE family , the EEE Keyboard .
The computer packs the usual Intel Atom internals , and puts them in a thin metal case with a built - in keyboard with Apple - style individually inset keys , much like many home computers from the days Back To The Future was cool .
It has a small built - in touchscreen display , which can display the Windows desktop or a set of media controls .
If you think this is n’t already cool enough ( which I cannot imagine ) , then you should know that it comes with Ultra - Wideband Wireless HDMI buit - in .
Plug in a small box at the back of your TV , and connect to it wirelessly , and send the display signal over the airwaves .
It comes with the usual wireless options and ports as well , of course .
Right now , it ’s clearly a prototype , as the battery life does n’t extend much beyond an hour ; the goal is to have at least three hours of battery life once the device starts shipping .
It does n’t come with an optical drive , but Asus plans on shipping a set of themed peripherals to go with the Eee Keyboard .
Asus plans to start shipping the Eee Keyboard in September 2009 .
MONTREAL –
He 's the dog that should n't have survived .
But Michou , the charcoal and white miniature poodle with the dark , trusting eyes , locked inside a vehicle for 19 days in the freezing January cold without food or water , not only survived , but is thriving with new owners , an animal control officer involved in the case says .
Michou's weight dropped from about 20 pounds to nine pounds as he sat starving and dehydrated in the freezing cold and was near death inside the EuroVan of his Quebec owner , who had flown off from the Burlington , Vt. , international airport over the Christmas and New Year holidays .
After being rescued , Michou was somehow able to pull through , and for that reason Vermonters have called him the " miracle dog . "
The 12 - year - old poodle is gaining weight , getting friskier by the day , and has been adopted by the foster couple who took him in after his ordeal , said Susan Powers , animal control officer for Williston , Vt. , a suburb of Burlington , who helped find Michou the foster family .
" It was a miracle he was still alive , " Powers said .
" We do n't quite understand how in the world he was still living .
The two vets who cared for him do n't understand either , how a dog could live for that long .
We know many dogs who have died in far less time than that .
He 's a little guy with a good , strong spirit . "
Michou 's ordeal continues to make waves in Burlington .
An editorial broadcast by the local NBC affiliate slammed both the owner , 50 - year - old Pascal Bellon of Frelighsburg , Que. , and the institutions that gave Bellon a $ 100 ticket for what happened .
" That so - called punishment is a crime , too , " station general manager Gary Sands said on - air .
" Vermont law says Bellon could have been fined $ 7,500 and sent to prison .
He should have been . "
That prompted viewer comments echoing their displeasure , read on the air on Sunday .
Police at the time said that when they met Bellon upon his return , he told them he did n't realize the dog was in the van .
Without evidence he intended to cause harm , the police said , they could n't lay criminal charges .
Investigators concluded the abandonment was accidental .
The public flooded the Humane Society of Chittenden County and the police with demands for information and offers to adopt the animal .
" There is a prevailing frustration with the situation and a certain disbelief that this could have happened without an individual 's knowledge , " said B.J. Rogers , the Humane Society 's executive director .
" Burlington in particular is a very dog friendly , highly dog populated area .
So it engendered a lot of compassion for the dog and frustration with both the owner and the system that ultimately was unable to sort of hold him accountable for at least what people perceived to be the events . "
In Frelighsburg , a picturesque border town in the eastern townships , the attitude is different .
Numerous interviews revealed a community steadfastly behind Bellon , who could not be reached for an interview .
They believe the abandonment was inadvertent and that Bellon should get his dog back .
" This is an unfortunate incident and to see what a fuss has been made when there are so many situations in this world deserving of time and energy , it 's a shame to put so much attention on an unfortunate incident , " said resident Holly Gosselin .
Michou could hardly move when he was found .
His fur was caked with excrement and his eyes crusted over from an infection .

Powers would n't release the name of the new owners , but they are retired and have a lot of time to look after Michou , she said .
He is taking supplements along with his food to help him get better .
" He 's very affectionate , " Powers said .
" He wants to be on your lap . "
Here are some playable 4 - note voicings .
Analyze all these voicings ; most of them could be used in many ways !
For example , the 2nd voicing shown could be used as : F6/9 , Am7sus4 , Dm7sus4 , Bbmaj13 , C6/9 , F # 7alt , Gm9sus4 , and a few other things !
First , let 's harmonize the scale in 3 - note voicings :
Note how we automatically get triads interspersed with " cluster " voicings .
Cool .
The sound of those close intervals may take some getting used to .
Bar 1 is in root position ; bars 2 + 3 are 1st and 2nd inversions .
In the last bar , I spread the voicings from the first group : I moved the middle voice up to the top ( and also moved the whole voicing down an octave ) .
All the inversions could be spread - voiced as well ; try it ...
For our purposes , let 's examine the A minor pentatonic scale ( A - C - D - E - G ) .
Many of us first encountered this scale in a rock or blues context ; it has many other potential applications !
Most players are at least vaguely familiar with pentatonic scales .
They 're used in all kinds of music all over the world .
Jazz players often use a pentatonic scale as a melodic device , but overlook its harmonic possibilities .
Since this scale is n't entirely made up of steps , some interesting voicings result from harmonizing it .
One reason for pentatonic scales ' popularity is that they can be used over many different tonal centers without too many " avoid notes " , notes that sound bad against a chord .
This property of the scales also makes them useful for comping .
There are others , but this 'll do for now .
Of course , it'd be pretty tough to memorize this table , so here are a few hints .
You can use this pentatonic scale harmonically just as you might use it melodically :
A Few Hints :
 On a minor chord , you can use a minor pentatonic scale starting from the chord 's root , 2nd , or 5th .
 On a major chord , you can use a minor pentatonic scale starting from the chord 's 3rd , 6th ( or 7th for a Lydian [ # 11 ] sound ) .
 On an unaltered dominant 7th chord or 7sus4 , you can use a minor pentatonic scale starting from the chord 's 2nd , 5th or 6th .
 On an altered dominant 7th , you can use a minor pentatonic scale starting from the chord 's # 9 .
Okay , let 's look at some musical examples now .
In the first couple of examples , we 'll continue to use the A minor pentatonic over a set of changes .
Then we 'll get into mixing and matching different minor pentatonics using the guidelines above .
In example 1 , we have a common ii -V7 - I progression , all handled with the A minor pentatonic scale .
Notice the ambiguous , " open " sound a lot of these voicings have .
Many of these voicings lack " guide tones " , which is OK in a group context ; someone else 'll likely be playing the guide tones .
In real life , you 'll probably find this pentatonic approach most satisfying when mixed with other types of voicings .
Too much ambiguity can get tedious eventually ...
Example 2 is a I - IV - iii - VI progression in F major .
Note the # 11 sound on the IV .
Again , we 're using only voicings from A minor pentatonic .
Now we 're going to start using voicings from more than one minor pentatonic scale .
I 've labeled the scale choices ; check them against the " hints " above to see how I chose the scales .
Example 3 :
In spots where the harmony does n't change much , using alternate pentatonic choices can liven up the sonic landscape .
In example 4 , I used Dm , Em and Am pentatonics to play over a long stretch of D minor .
( This example 's not too interesting rhythmically ; I wanted to cram in a lot of voicings ! )
Try voicings like this next time you play " Impressions " or " So What " .
" But , Bob , " I can hear you saying , " do n't all these voicings exist in the C major scale ? "
Well , sure they do , but what makes them sound different is that we 're leaving out certain notes in the major scale ,
or , more accurately , choosing to concentrate on only some of the notes at a time .
As I implied earlier , I doubt I 'd play a whole tune using nothing but pentatonic harmony ,
but this method can open up some interesting sounds .
Used judiciously , it can provide a nice contrast to tertian [ third - based ] harmony .
Enjoy ...
Chipotle Pepper Popcorn
Love Chile Peppers ?
Come learn about 39 different chile peppers .
Some are mild like the Anaheim and some are so hot they are literally being used as weapons .
Complete with information about their origin and history , uses , and full - color photographs !
or as Available on Amazon.com or as a PDF Download
I was recently reading an article about making traditional popcorn on the stove , instead of the crappy microwave kind .
I definitely love freshly popped popcorn but the other night I decided to spice it up some with chipotle powder and it turned out great .
Just take 1/2 cup of unpopped popcorn kernals and put them into a pot with enough olive oil to coat the bottom and about 1/2 tablespoon of chipotle powder and 1/2 tablespoon of salt .
Cover the pot and put it on a burner turned to high , shaking it constantly .
In about 60 seconds you 'll have a pot full of fluffy , spicy , chipotle flavored popcorn .
You can obviously alter the amount of chipotle powder you use so it will come out with a heat level you like .
Many people also recommend using tabasco sauce , especially the chipotle flavor , or using red chili flakes .
The possibilities for spicy popcorn are endless !
' We are very afraid after this '
The arms cache at the madrassa was hidden in the ceilings
Bangladeshi police are investigating a madrassa ( or Islamic theological school ) established by a British charity where a cache of weapons was uncovered .
The BBC's Abdullah al - Muyid has been to visit the madrassa at the centre of the story .
I saw the poster on the wall of the ferry I caught to Bhola : " So bombing and killing people is not allowed in Islam " .
It referred to a hadith - the stories of the words and deeds of the Prophet Muhammad handed down by word of mouth .
It was an expression of the deep concern over the rise of militant activities and bombing incidents across Bangladesh .
Recently the country 's elite anti-terror force , the Rapid Action Battalion , uncovered a huge stash of firearms , ammunition and explosives at a madrassa .
It is not new to find this type of thing in madrassas , but for the first time a UK link has been found .
Green Crescent Madrassa was established by a British citizen of Bangladeshi origin and the organisation which provides funds for it is registered as a charity in the UK .
Well - defended After driving more than 230 km ( 143 miles ) and crossing over three big rivers , my 12 - hour journey came to an end .
The arms cache was in a separate building to the students ' quarters I had reached the village of Rumkeshob in the island district of Bhola .
The village does not look different from any other in the country , but an unusual pink - coloured single - storied building in a well - defended complex has pushed this place into the media spotlight .
The Green Crescent Madrassa complex is in the rear side of the village and a narrow zigzagging driveway connects it to the main road .
The four hectare ( 10 acre ) site is cut off from the village by a 2.4 m ( 8 ft ) wide canal full of water .
The entrance has a small bridge with a gap negotiated by an iron sheet which acts as a drawbridge .
Two policemen were guarding the main entrance and they rolled the bridge to let us in .
A canal acts as a moat between the madrassa and the village
There are eight rooms in the first building around a courtyard in the middle which is not visible from outside , and this has an extension as well .
In one of the rooms the police allowed me to enter , I saw benches and a blackboard on the wall .
The adjacent room was being used as the bedroom for the students , and the next one to it was the dining room .
This building is connected to another one - used as the teachers ' quarters - by a concrete path , and in between these two buildings is a big pond or water tank .
It was in this second building that the discovery of firearms , ammunition and explosives was made .
All the weapons and explosives were found in the ceiling of the three rooms - well hidden from the eyes of anyone .
' We never suspected ' " I never went inside , " said Mumtaj Begum , who lives just on the other side of the canal that separates the complex from its neighbours , " we thought it was only for rich people . "
Mohammad Ali , the local council member , said foreigners were seen coming and going , but no - one knew what their purpose was .
Maybe they were piling up these things to create anarchy in the country
HM Azimul Haque , police investigator " They brought in people from other places to build this place and rarely allowed us to go inside .
We are very afraid after this discovery of these dangerous things , " said Mr Ali .
Another villager , Abdur Rhaman , said : " He used to give a lot of things to the poor ... last time he gave hijabs to the poor women .
We never suspected that he was doing something of this kind . "
And a villager known as Sohidul explained : " They said there would be an orphanage , a madrassa and a hospital - we were very happy . "
No -one ever suspected militant activity at the complex .
Assistant Superintendent of police H M Azimul Haque is leading the investigation team .
" As we recovered some books on jihad , I think there is a strong connection to militancy and maybe they were piling up these things to create anarchy in the country , " he told me .
The sense of surprise and unease at the discovery of the arms cache goes well beyond Bhola .
Nitul Dey , a businessman I met on the ferry , said : " I no longer feel safe as they can throw a bomb in a busy marketplace full of innocent people , now safety has become a major concern for many of us .
" I do not understand why these educated people are doing these things when they are living relatively better than us . "

IMF stands for the International Monetary Fund , an international organizations that offers both loans and bailout packages , and that has been subjected to extensive debate and controversy over the past years .
Initially designed to ensure the stability of the worldwide financial system after World War III , the IMF has become one of the most important financial institutions of its kind , with a great influence over many countries .
The policies of the International Monetary Fund has changed , and while many agree with them , others claim that they bring a lot of damage not only to the economy , but also to the surrounding environment .
That being said , here is a deeper insight into some of the most important and controversial aspects related to the IMF :
1. Some Say Its Policies Hurt The Surrounding Environment
Many environmentalists and other environmentally - conscious people claim that the International Monetary Fund offers loans that are paving the way for the exploitation of the natural resources , which are depleting at a very fast pace .
Apparently , the IMF does not take into account the impact of its lending policies on nature , and environmental aspects are not included in the policy making process .
Some people also claim that the struggle to pay back the loans granted by the International Monetary Fund has lead to an unsustainable and damaging liquidation of some of the world ’s most valuable natural resources , such as cocoa .
The cocoa exports have soared in the Ivory Coast , and this has led to the loss of approximately 70 % of the forests found here .
2. Some Critics Consider The Lending Conditions To Be Too Harsh
The lending conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund are by far the most controversial and most commonly debated topic , and for a good reason given the fact that the IMF primarily lends money to poorer countries and then it applies severe financial restrictions .
The problem is not the fact that it helps poor countries re-stabilize their economy as it did after the recession that hit the entire world a few years back , as this is a very good and helpful thing for the countries in question , but the fact that the conditions attached to these loans are very difficult to meet , and often with great sacrifices .
With that in mind , it must be said that in order for a country to repay its loans ( usually millions or billions of dollars ) , its economy must be liberalized and there must be some serious government spending cuts involved , which can take their toll on the country ’s economy in the long run .
Besides this , the overall social structure of the country can be impacted as well , given the fact that the conditions imposed by the IMF often reflect the finance - related beliefs of Western nations , which may not always be in the best interests of the borrower .
Many people claim that these conditions are often designed to compromise not only the economic sovereignty of the receiving countries , but also their political structure .
The fact that the conditions are too intrusive has generated a lot of backlash from other countries , and so did the so - called “ structural adjustments ” that the receiving countries had to meet in order to be eligible for the loan .
In addition to the government spending cuts imposed by the International Monetary Fund , the IMF also implies strict banking regulations , addressing various government deficits as well as a regulated pension policy .
All these changed have caused a severe domestic opposition in most of the receiving countries , over the years .
3. The Policies Are Imposed All At Once , Which Leads To Privatization And An Increased Unemployment Rate
Besides the fact that these policies are severe enough and likely to cause domestic opposition , the IMF did not even impose them in an appropriate sequence , but rather all at once , which leads to a serious of consequences including the privatization of government services in a very rapid manner ( for instances , selling utilities companies to private investors ) .
In turn , given the fact that private owners aim to make a company as efficient and as cost - effective as possible , the chances are that the new owners of such companies ( which , as stated above , are often either utilities or water supply companies ) are very likely to let go a significant part of the staff , which leads to an increased rate an unemployment .
The reduced government salaries and pensions coupled with an increased unemployment rate can destabilize the financial and social structure of a country even more than the financial crisis itself .
In some cases , the borrowing countries do not have a properly developed unemployment management program , neither does it have social safety programs or other plans to support families who have lost one or more primary sources of income .
In other words , those people who were fired when the company they worked for was sold will be unable to financially support their families .
This is why privatization must be introduced as part of a larger , more comprehensive and thoroughly designed program that involves creating new jobs designed to replace the lost ones .
These programs should include low interest rates for mortgages and other loans , along with other more specific macroeconomic policies .
4. The IMF Accepts Little To No Public Criticism
Those who oppose the policies of IMF claim that the International Monetary Fund was not even open to public criticism when it came out with these severe policies , and in many cases the agreements that took place between the receiving countries and the IMF were often kept secret until the papers were signs and the loan was already taken out .
In many times , this led to a severe backlash from the general public in the borrowing countries .
5 . The Policies Of The Washington Consensus Are Universally Imposed
Last , but certainly not least , the critics of the International Monetary Fund also claims that the institution imposes the policies of the Washington Consensus on all the borrowing countries , without understanding the distinct and primary financial and social characteristics ( and differences ) of the borrowing countries , which in turn makes these policies very difficult to carry out and , as mentioned earlier , often very counter - productive for the general economy of the receiving countries .
In order for an international monetary organization such as the IMF to be able to impose generally applicable rules , regulations and policies , it must firstly study and specialize in the economies and the political climate of the borrowing countries , economies that the International Monetary Fund often oversees .

Gunmakers can thank a former New York senator and presidential candidate for an ongoing boom in gun sales , if you ask one local firearms vendor .
[ efoods ]
George Nemec , owner of Nemec ’s Sport Shop & Farm & Garden Center in Warrensburg , said gun sales at his business began to increase about two years ago , after Sen.
Hillary Clinton announced her intent to run for president .
People were concerned about the possible impact of a Democratic president on the Second Amendment right to bear arms .
“ Handguns , shotguns , rifles — it ’s every type , ” Nemec said .
“ People are worried the government is going to take their guns away , or they ’re going to tax them ( guns and ammunition ) to death . ”
With a Democratic president in office and economic troubles fueling fears of rising crime , guns — and the rounds they fire — are a hot commodity these days .
Across the country , gun dealers are reporting a big uptick in sales of both firearms and ammunition .
Requests for federal background checks for prospective gun buyers have surged since last fall , with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms reporting a nearly 50 percent increase after the election of President Barack Obama .
Tom King , president of the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association , said gun and ammunition sales around the country have risen in recent months .

( Updates with background on debt issuance )
DAR ES SALAAM , March 8 ( Reuters ) - Developing countries could face a financing gap of $ 270 billion to $ 700 billion this year as trade income dwindles and rich nations vie for capital to deal with a global slump , the World Bank said on Sunday .
The World Bank said even at the lower end of that estimate , resources of international institutions would not be sufficient to meet the financing needs as more and more emerging and developing countries are hit .
“ Should a more pessimistic outcome occur , unmet financing needs will be enormous , ” the World Bank said in a paper prepared for meetings of the G20 group of countries in London in April .
The World Bank spends billions of dollars annually fighting poverty in developing countries .
Last week , the International Monetary Fund said developing countries would need $ 25 billion , and possibly as much as $ 140 billion , in 2009 to meet their financing needs .
The World Bank said the crisis could have long - lasting repercussions for developing countries , which are contending with a drop in exports as world trade shrinks for the first time since 1982 at the same time remittances from overseas workers slow and falling commodity prices saps a revenue source many countries rely on .
“ The challenge facing developing countries is how , with fewer resources , to pursue policies that can protect or expand critical expenditures , including on social safety nets , human development and critical infrastructure , ” the World Bank said .
MATURING DEBT RISKS
Concerns are also mounting as to how emerging markets will be able to rollover maturing debt , particularly for banks and large corporations .
The global downturn is already pushing rich nations to step up their borrowing sharply to fund large - scale fiscal stimulus packages and efforts to strengthen banking systems .
“ Sovereign debt issuance by high - income countries is set to increase dramatically , crowding out many developing country issuers , ” the World Bank warned .
The World Bank estimates well over $ 1 trillion in emerging market corporate debt and $ 2 - 3 trillion in total emerging market debt will mature in 2009 , the majority of which reflects claims of major global banks extended cross - border or through affiliates and branches in emerging markets .
Most of this lending is in foreign currency , and for relatively short terms , meaning currency and maturity risks are primarily on the balance sheet of emerging market banks , corporate and households .
“ There is mounting evidence of growing pressure on interbank lines , particularly those extended to the corporate sector .
Recent evidence of rollover efforts on public debt of major corporates indeed suggests that even stronger corporates in key emerging markets are struggling , ” the Bank said .
It estimated that in 2009 , 104 of 129 developing countries will have current account surpluses smaller than private debt coming due .
For these countries , total financing needs were expected to amount to more than $ 1.4 trillion during the year .
External financing needs are expected to exceed private sources of financing ( equity flows and private debt disbursements ) in 98 of the 104 countries , implying a financing gap -- not taking into account flows from official sources -- in those 98 countries of about $ 268 billion .
Should rollover rates , or loan renewals , come in lower than expected , or capital flight significantly increase , this figure could rise to almost $ 700 billion , the World Bank said .
It said the situation could become as severe in poorer countries where falling growth will impact families living just above the poverty line , who are particularly vulnerable .
Many of the worst affected countries are heavily reliant on aid which could be cut as rich nations cope with budget pressures of their own .
“ There is a therefore a strong need to expand assistance to ( lower income countries ) to protect critical expenditures and prevent an erosion of progress in reducing poverty , ” the World Bank said .
Meanwhile , the likely sharp drop in remittances will affect the incomes of poor families as unemployment rises and more migrant workers lose jobs in Europe and the United States .
Remittance flows are estimated to have reached $ 305 billion in 2008 , up 9 percent from 2007 .
World Bank projections suggest remittances to developing countries will fall in 2009 , with Africa , Eastern Europe and Central Asia hardest hit .

The following article is from Newtopia Magazine about controversies surrounding 9 - 11 that are not getting media attention .
You can see the original article at http://www.newtopiamagazine.org/content/issue17/oped/911.php.
The Explosion of the 9 - 11 Truth Movement -- U.S. Media 's Dirty Little Secret By Bill Douglas , Co-Founder - National 911Visibility.org Newtopia Magazine , Volume III , Issue 17 June / July , 2004
A mass movement and a mountain of disturbing evidence has been growing beneath the radar of U.S. media .
The U.S. media ( including alternative media ) has done an extraordinarily superhuman job of hearing seeing and speaking no evil .
However , almost immediately after 9-11 - 2001 's horrendous attacks on New York and Washington D.C. , many researchers , ordinary citizens , and journalists [ who 've been given precious little print in U.S. papers or TV ] began to smell something rotten . . . not in Denmark . . . but rather , right here in the good ol ' US of A .
This movement 's early roots began when many people scratched their heads in wonder at how 4 commercial jet liners could fly hijacked for nearly an hour and a half the morning of 9 - 11 , without any Air Force fighter interceptor jets turning a wheel until it was too late , as stated by acclaimed Canadian TV journalist , Barry Zwicker .
Zwicker 's powerful documentary The Great Deception , which suggests top Bush Admin .
officials were likely complicit in the 9 - 11 attacks , aired on Canada 's Vision TV network which is viewed by millions of Canadians .
Unfortunately Americans in the U.S. have been protected from viewing this critical documentary .
Researchers , like Zwicker and others , quickly learned that in 2001 before the 9 - 11 attacks 62 aircraft had been intercepted by Air Force fighter interceptor jets , and usually within 10 to 15 minutes of going off course .
[ http://septembereleventh.org/airdefense.php]
Yet bizarrely , on 9 - 11 four commercial jets were hijacked off course for about one and a half hours before the last one crashed into the most highly protected building in the world ( the Pentagon ) .
. . yet no interceptor jet intercepted it in all that time .
Alarm bells went off with citizens across the U.S. and the world .
A number of people including former NYPD detective , Frank Serpico ( played by Al Pacino in the movie about his life as an NYPD whistleblower exposing corruption at the New York Police Department ) , began to express a suspicion of the official 9 - 11 story during a whistleblower awards ceremony nationally televised on C - SPAN .
Then other issues came to light regarding 9 - 11 , and foreknowledge of the attacks .
For example , a former Los Angeles Police Detective named Michael Ruppert noted that outrageously high volumes of insider trading on United and American Airlines stocks prior to 9 - 11 , ( reported on by CBS , Bloomberg and other financial papers ) actually had some strange ties to the Central Intelligence Agency .
9/11 - related insider trading was worldwide .
It occurred on markets in Hong Kong , Tokyo , Chicago , New York , London and Berlin .
Estimates of the total amount of insider trades have ranged from the hundred of millions ( CBS ) , to the billions ( Ernst Weltke - Chief of the Bundesbank ) , to the tens of billions ( Andreas von Bulow , former German cabinet minister ) .
But some of the put options purchased on United and American airlines inside the US caught Ruppert 's attention .
Put Options are bets one can make AGAINST a stock , betting that it will fall .
As Ruppert quickly noted , in one known case , a large number of put options were placed through the Alex Brown or ( AB Brown ) Unit of Deutschebank .
Ruppert recalled that AB Brown had been chaired until he became the Executive Director ( No. 3 ) at the CIA in 1998 , by A.B. Buzzy Krongard .
AB Brown and Deutschebank have a history of being connected with covert operations and money laundering .
In fact had , they had just been investigated by Senator Levin 's committee on Correspondent Banking and mentioned in Department of Justice investigations .
So , it begs the question , if you were an Arab terrorist who wanted to cash in on your foreknowledge of the next days ' attacks using United and American Airlines stock , would you go to a known CIA connected bank to do it ?
-- especially , if you knew , as Ruppert had previously documented , that the CIA tracks all stock trades in real time ?
Probably not .
One $ 2.5 million trade , made through AB Brown by a late - comer went unclaimed after 9 - 11 when the markets were closed for four days .
By that time alarms over the insider trades were sounding all over , even on CBS News .
Most of the smarter crooks had absconded with their money by exercising their put options while the attacks were taking place through offshore accounts .
The head of AB Brown , Mayo Shattuck III , who is a close friend and associate of Krongard , resigned the day after 9-11-2001 without anyone except Ruppert connecting the dots .
To this day the Bush Administration has not told us who made those insider trades or why the head of AB Brown resigned on 9-12-2001 .
Other stories from foreign press began to be read by a growing number of Americans who realized quickly that they had to read foreign press to get to the ugly facts around 9 - 11 .
A conservative French newspaper , La Figaro , reported an incredible fact , that the CIA station chief in Dubai had met with Osama Bin Laden weeks before the 9 - 11 attacks as Osama was being treated at a U.S. Army hospital in Dubai .
Yet , even though Osama was on the CIA most wanted list , the CIA station chief did not only NOT arrest him , but met with him and then reportedly went back to the U.S. for high level meetings in Washington following his meeting with Osama .
Even more bizarrely alarming facts surfaced such as the article in a prominent Indian newspaper reporting that the hijacker mastermind of 9 - 11 , Mohammed Atta , had been wired $ 100,000.00 by the head of Pakistani Intelligence weeks before 9 - 11 , who oddly enough was in Washington meeting with top Bush Admin .
officials ON 9-11-2001 .
Although none of these bizarre facts raised any hairs in the U.S. media corps , a corps which had done such an outstanding job ferreting out the truth on the weapons of mass destruction issue before the ill fated war on Iraq , these facts WERE disturbing to many other Americans .
Some Americans were able to see through the endless media fixation on celebrities and their endless foibles , and these vigilant Americans were looking deep , long and hard at the above facts and the more they saw the more alarming it became .
A movement began to build as people across America , who were seeing that the U.S. media 's Orwellian ability to focus on celebrity gossip , and yet be blind , deaf , and dumb to the growing likelihood that people within our government had foreknowledge of the coming attacks . . . was just too much too bear .
9-11 Truth or 911 Visibility movement actions began to spring up across the nation .
9-11 researchers , and concerned citizens began to organize through sites like www.911visibility.org and www.911truth.org.
9 - 11 family members became increasingly alarmed and disgusted as the Bush Administration ordered the Senate not to investigate the 9 - 11 attacks , and then spent the next two years trying to block all 9 - 11 investigations .
One widow , Ellen Mariani with her attorney , former Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania Phil Berg filed suit against the Bush Administration under the RICO Racketeering Act.
Ellen charged Bush et al with foreknowledge of the coming attacks , willfully allowing them to occur for political gain , and engaging in a criminal obstruction of the 9 - 11 investigations .
Other suits were filed by other 9 - 11 family members , including one represented by a former aid to Bob Dole filed in San Francisco court .
These suits have been virtually ignored by U.S. media , and by much of U.S. alternative media .
FBI agents Crowley and Wright , and former FBI translator Sibel Edmonds came forward to tell the public that our government had not acted on the information they had that may have prevented the coming 9 - 11 attacks .
Sibel Edmonds told the media ( who mostly ignored her ) that Condaleeza Rice was lying when she told America that they knew nothing of the coming attacks .
The intensity of the 9 - 11 truth issue continued to build , even as U.S. media virtually ignored the growing mountain of facts that directly contradict the official 9 - 11 story .
More voices began to clammer together to raise the issue in the public eye .
Protesters at ground zero in New York City raised a banner reading Bush Engineered 9 - 11 , while hundreds of protesters lined the streets of downtown Kansas City with Stop Bush 's 9 - 11 Cover Up signs .
9-11 widow Ellen Mariani went on a national tour speaking in churches and town meetings , explaining her RICO
Act suit against Bush et al for 9 - 11 , and 9 - 11 truth protests and teach - ins began to spread across the U.S. and Canada , and even Europe .
At the March 20th , 2004 Mobilization Against the War marches in San Francisco and New York thousands carried Stop the 9 - 11 Cover Up posters that were photographed by Associated Press and carried on the front page of papers across the U.S. and even radio shock jock Howard Stern 's website featured a shot of the Stop the 9 - 11 Cover Up signs on his websites homepage .
Even Minister Farakkhan of the Nation of Islam suggested on national television that people in the Bush Administration allowed the 9 - 11 attacks to occur to fool us into wars .
The 9 - 11 truth issue suddenly seemed to be bursting forth from all corners of society .
From shock jocks to Islamic leaders the official 9 - 11 story seemed to be crumbling apart before the nation 's eyes .
9-11 activists from across North America met in San Francisco for the first International Inquiry into 9 - 11 .
Although BBC World Radio and local media covered the event , it was virtually ignored by mainstream and even much of alternative U.S. media .
But , the movement builds anyway .
Canada is about to host the second International Inquiry into 9 - 11 , and a third may be held later .
The 9 - 11 truth issue gained momentum when respected theologian David Ray Griffin released his new book The New Pearl Harbor , which meticulously spells out why the official story is likely a snow job .
When it was endorsed by respected social justice author , teacher and activist Howard Zinn , the light of hope for 9 - 11 truth to come forth cast a brighter ray across the nation .
Then , actor and long time peace activist Ed Asner broke the 9 - 11 truth issue open to the national peace movement when he issued an open letter to the American peace movement urging them to make 9 - 11 truth their main priority , because two wars and endless losses of civil liberties are being based on 9 - 11 .
And as many are realizing when they take the time to look into the issue , the official story does NOT stand up to the light of day .
Almost immediately after Asner 's letter released , the National Green Party released a press statement that called into question the official 9 - 11story , the integrity of the 9 - 11 Commission , and called for an entirely new 9 - 11 investigation which would include 9 - 11 family members who are increasingly unhappy with the Commission 's milk toast efforts of inquiry .
This national 9 - 11 truth movement is going to get nothing but larger , clearer , and more organized .
The official story continues to grow thinner and more transparent as the snow job that it obviously is .
The United States media , both mainstream and alternative , continue to damage their credibility beyond repair .
A growing number of citizens reach out to foreign media , and only watch U.S. media to observe the distortion and omission that has made a mockery of our newspaper , television and radio media .
We are beginning to see what Soviet 's felt like when they picked up their newspapers or turned on their televisions .
After 9 - 11 our nation was turned upside down .
Those who challenged Bush suddenly became labeled as un-American .
Ashcroft sought to turn our postal service and gas company employees into a domestic spy force to keep an eye on us all .
The Patriot Act was rammed through Congress , a Congress in chaos as U.S. military AMES strain anthrax is sent . . . not to Bush or the Pentagon but to the top two Democrats who were actively challenging the Patriot Act - Daschle and Leahy ( head of the Senate Judiciary Committee ) .
To believe the several hundred page Patriot Act was created in the few short weeks since 9 - 11 before it was rammed through Congress is naiveté at it 's highest .
It was written before 9 - 11 , it only needed the proper climate for it to be rammed through .
Bush et , al , had plans to invade Iraq before 9 - 11 , they only needed the proper climate to enact their plans .
FBI field agents were screaming the facts that could have prevented the attacks , and in the words of FBI Agent Crowleyher attempts to get this information up the chain of command were almost DELIBERATELY thwarted .
9-11 exploitation and the constant terror invoked by Bush et al to keep us in a state of mind conducive to giving up liberty and to conduct endless wars becomes an increasingly obvious formula .
Yet , all is not lost , for today we have the Internet .
And we still have a democracy , if we act to preserve it .
This will require a mammoth effort to demand the full truth of 9 - 11 .
www.911visibility.org provides tools and support for doing just that .
The truth shall set U.S. free .
Unless we demand the full truth of 9 - 11 any discussion in the future about our environment , education policy , social spending , military spending , etc. will be poisoned with the unexposed lies of 9 - 11 .
9-11 truth is the most critical issue facing America and the world .

Oh my god , Michael Phelps was photographed smoking pot from a bong !
How could this Olympian , this national hero , have let us down so completely ?
What 's the world coming to ?
But seriously , what the heck is the world coming to when we 're supposed to feign outrage at and disappointment at what 's basically normal , to say nothing of NORML , adult behavior .
Depending on who 's numbers you believe , somewhere between 33 % and 47 % of Americans over the age of 12 will admit to having smoked marijuana at some point in their lives .
Throw in the people who wo n't admit it to a survey , and we 're probably looking at more than half of this country 's adult population .
So who exactly is supposed to be outraged here ?
Who is so offended that Phelps has to lose an endorsement dealand get suspended from doing what he does best , swimming , for three months ?
It 's not like he was found taking performance enhancing drugs .
I can see why the swim team might suspend him because they 're worried he might get stoned and start swimming in the wrong direction , but calling this misconduct or misbehavior is not just hypocritical , it 's stupid .
The sad thing is that if the guy just stood up , defended his behavior as being perfectly fine , and said " legalize , " then the press would come down on him even harder , probably in stories written by people who , at some point in their lives , had their lips on a bong , too .
I 've made the case for legalization or decriminalization before , so I wo n't repeat myself .
Let me just say , though , that if a law is unjust , you should break it .
This is not like Plaxico Burress shooting himself in the leg with an unregistered handgun .
That puts Phelps , along with the vast majority of American college students , in the long tradition of civil rights activists going all the way back to Henry David Thoreau .

Cast Iron Dutch Ovens :
Before anyone ever thought of a crock pot , there was the cast iron Dutch oven .
Dutch ovens have been used for hundreds of years .
Nothing will hold a good , even temperature better than the heavy metal of this monster pot , and it can go from stove top to oven without missing a beat .
Check out this very interesting and informative article on Dutch Oven Camp Cooking .
Cooking with Cast Iron Cookware :
I personally have five ( 5 ) old cast iron pots – a 10 - inch and a 12 - inch cast iron skillet , two large cast iron griddles , and a cast iron Dutch Oven .
I love my cast iron pans !
You can use a single cast iron frying pan or cast iron skillet for just about any cooking task .
Bake a cake , sear a filet , roast or fry a chicken , fry potatoes , stir - fry vegetables , etc .
One skillet is all you need , but because cast iron cooking is lot of fun and makes the food you cook taste great , you are probably going to want more than one cast iron pan .
Using Cast - Iron Cookware –
The benefits of cast iron pans and skillets are terrific :
Foods glide out of it as from a pan made with Teflon .
Cast - Iron goes from stove to oven .
No special utensils are needed to cook in it .
Cast - Iron will not war , and cleanup is a cinch .
A well - seasoned cast - iron pan will only get better with age , and will last you for a lifetime .
It is time people realize the culinary wonder that a cast iron pan can be !
Professional chefs consider cast iron cookware to be precision cooking tools , as these dependable pans enable precise control of cooking temperatures .
Their heat retention qualities allow for even cooking temperature without hot spots .
Cast iron pans can be used on top of the stove or to bake in the oven .
All our grandmothers had cast iron skillets and cast iron stove - top griddles .
In fact , your grandmother swore by it and the pioneers depended on it .
If you do not own a cast iron skillet , it is well worth the time and money to invest in one .
You can find them for sale on the internet , at cook stores everywhere , thrift stores , flea markets , or you can scour the tag and yard sales for one that might look as if it has seen better days .
If the pan is rusty or encrusted with grease , buy it anyway .
Do n’t worry !
I ’ll tell you how to get that new or old one into shape so you can enjoy it for a lifetime of fat free cooking .
You ’ll be able to pass the pan on to your own children and grandchildren .
Caring For Cast Iron Pans and Cast Iron Skillets
The first most common mistake of why people do not like cast iron is that they say everything sticks .
If food sticks to your cast iron pan , your pan is NOT seasoned right and you need to re-season it .
Cast iron is a natural non-stick surface and if your pan is seasoned correctly it WILL NOT stick !
Always preheat your cast iron frying pans before frying in them .
Water droplets should sizzle , then roll and hop around the pan , when dropped onto the heated surface .
If the water disappears immediately after being dropped , the pan is too hot .
If water only rests and bubbles in the pan , it is not quite hot enough .
NOTE : Do not pour large amounts of cold liquid into your hot cast iron frying pan .
This can cause the cast iron to break .
Never forget your potholders !
Cast iron pan handles get HOT when cooking !
There is a trick to maintaining cast iron cookware and that trick is known as “ seasoning ” or “ curing . ”
Your food will never stick to the bottom of the skillet or pot and the iron will not rust if it is properly seasoned .
Plus the cast iron cookware cleans up easily as well .
Seasoning or curing cast iron cookware means filling the pores and voids in the metal with grease of some sort , which subsequently gets cooked in .
This provides a smooth , non -stick surface on the inside of the cast iron pan .
If the cast iron pan was not seasoned properly or a portion of the seasoning wore off and food sticks to the surface or there is rust , then it should be properly cleaned and re-seasoned .
Seasoning a cast iron pan is a natural way of creating non-stick cookware .
And , like you cook and clean the modern non-stick cookware with special care to avoid scratching the surface , your cast iron cookware wants some special attention too .
NOTE : All new ( not old cast iron cookware ) cast iron pans and skillets have a protective coating on them , which must be removed .
American companies use a special food - safe wax ; imports are covered with a water - soluble shellac .
In either case , scrub the item with a stainless steel scouring pads ( steel wool ) , using soap and the hottest tap water you can stand .
How To Season Cast Iron Pans and Cast Iron Skillets :
Definition of Seasoning :
To season a cast iron pan means to create a slick and glassy coating by baking on multiple thin coats of oil .
This will protect the cast iron pan from getting rusted and makes for a non -stick cooking surface .
You season a cast iron pan by rubbing it with a relatively thin coat of neutral food - grade oil ( I stress a light coat of oil ) .
Rub the oil off with paper towels or a cotton cloth .
The pan will look like there is no oil left on the surface , but there is as the oil is just very thin ( the pan will look dry , not glistening with oil ) .
Use vegetable oils ( canola , sunflower , etc. ) , shortening ( like Crisco shortening ) or lard for seasoning your cast iron pans .
I recently experimented and found out that food - grade coconut oil / butter also works great .
Check out Smoking Points of Oils – Types of Cooking Oils .
Also check out the Q&A ’s web pages below : Techniques for Restoring and Seasoning Old Cast Iron Pans and Cast Iron Skillets .
Place the lightly - oiled cast iron pan , upside down , in the oven , with a sheet of aluminum foil on the bottom to catch any drips .
Heat the pan for 30 minutes in a 450 to 500 degree F. oven .
Once done , turn off the oven , and let the pan cool to room temperature in the oven .
Repeating this process several times is recommended as it will help create a stronger “ seasoning ” bond .
I usually do this process 3 to 4 times .
NOTE : Seasoning cast iron pans does generate smoke similar to cooking in a dirty oven .
The oil fills the cavities and becomes entrenched in them , as well as rounding off the peaks .
By seasoning a new pan , the cooking surface develops a nonstick quality because the formerly jagged and pitted surface becomes smooth .
Also , because the pores are permeated with oil , water cannot seep in and create rust that would give food an off - flavor .
Your ironware will be slightly discolored at this stage , but a couple of frying jobs will help complete the cure , and turn the iron into the rich , black color that is the sign of a well - seasoned , well - used skillet or pot .
Never put cold liquids into a very hot cast iron pan or oven .
They will crack on the spot !
Be careful when cooking with your cast iron pans on an electric range , because the burners create hot spots that can warp cast iron or even cause it to crack .
Be sure to preheat the iron very slowly when using an electric range and keep the settings to medium or even medium - low .
Important :
Unless you use your cast iron pans daily , they should be washed briefly with a little soapy water and then rinsed and thoroughly dried in order to rid them of excess surface oil .
If you do not do this , the surplus oil will become rancid within a couple of days .
Remember – Every time you cook in your cast iron frying pan , you are actually seasoning it again by filling in the microscopic pores and valleys that are part of the cast iron surface .
The more you cook , the smoother the surface becomes !

I am going to kill you .
We 've all heard the argument repeated by pundits and politicians in the post - Columbine era : teens who play violent video games are at an extreme risk of being corrupted by the violent media they 're exposed to .
It 's a theory that certainly seems to resonate with concerned parents in particular .
After all , no one wants to knowingly endanger their child 's mental well - being , especially with something that seems like an innocent pastime .
But in an argument that will probably make game critics ' heads explode , a new book believes that young boys who are struggling in school may need more exposure to violent media in order to do better .
The author of The Trouble With Boys , Peg Tyre , claims that the recent anti-violence efforts of the past decade are actually doing more to hinder boys ' development than help them .
Tyre 's suggestion is simple enough : let boys be boys by simply letting them engage in the aggressive fantasies that come to them naturally .
The idea for the book began when Tyre , a senior writer for Newsweek at the time , wrote a 2006 cover story for the magazine , called " Boy Crisis . "
The article focused on how boys were falling behind in school and what educational institutions were doing to address the issue .
The figures are certainly worrying , according to Tyre : " Boys get expelled from preschool at four times the rates of girls , " she writes .
" They are prescribed the lion 's share of ADHD medication , they get most of the C's and D's in middle school , and they drop out of high school more than girls .
Currently , only 43 % of undergraduates in the United States are men . "
So what 's the solution ?
Tyre 's suggestion is simple enough : let boys be boys by simply letting them engage in the aggressive fantasies that come to them naturally .
It 's a unique perspective , to be sure , and one that will definitely make readers sit up and take notice , since it seems so diametrically opposed to conventional wisdom .
When you stop to think about it , though , Tyre 's argument seems to make a fair amount of sense .
If you 've been around schools or youth organizations recently , you 've probably seen how even playfully aggressive behavior is often demonized by both parents and other adults .
A case in point from my own experience : when I served as an assistant scoutmaster for my Boy Scout troop at a summer camp in 2003 , a number of parents complained about the fact that the Rifle and Shotgun Shooting merit badges were available as part of the camp 's curriculum .
They believed that teaching teenage boys the standard safety , care , and operation of firearms was wrong .
Five years earlier , such complaints were unheard of , even in a suburb directly over the hill from Berkeley .
This attitude , though , seems to have permeated the entire country .
Tyre stresses that many boys relate to violence no matter what their background is .
" It does n't matter whether Mormons in Utah or lesbians in Cambridge are raising boys .
Many of them play and think around violence , " Tyre said during a recent talk with a group of parents in North Salem , NY .
" We might see them as doing something potentially dangerous .
But actually what they 're doing is playing around with ideas of courage and valor , good versus evil , and teamwork .
These are ideas we want to inculcate in our culture . "
Tyre believes that this anti-violence paranoia really started to spring up in the mid-to - late 1990s , when a number of high - profile school shootings received so much media attention that it overwhelmed common sense .
" There was such media saturation about [ events like Columbine ] that it seemed to people that it was happening in their communities next door , [ and ] it created a zero tolerance policy towards violence , " she told Ars .
" These morphed into a zero - tolerance policy towards aggression .
That sounds good in theory , but it sometimes means that things like running and playing ' Tag ' on the playground are discouraged . "
As a result , " we 're in this place — as a culture — where smart , right - thinking parents discourage their sons from violence , " Tyre said .
" It 's perfectly normal for little boys to think and talk around violence ; it does n't mean they 're going to be violent . "

While perusing the news links at reddit , I came across term new to me : Rape Tree .
The headline which read , “ ‘ Rape Trees ’ Found Along Southern US Border ” brought immediately to mind Michael Vick and I assumed that there was going to be some sort of dog fighting news on the border .
I then remembered that the term in Vick ’s case was rape stand and quickly learned that there ’s a whole other brouhaha brewing up on the border .
In the aforementioned article , Mariela Rosario writes :
Recently , a new method of marking territory has crossed over into the United States .
“ Rape trees ” are popping up in Southern Arizona and their significance is horrific and disgusting .
These “ rape trees ” are places where cartel members and coyotes rape female border crossers and hang their clothes , specifically undergarments , to mark their conquest and territory .
As a feminist living in Texas - a state in which our guard is on high alert due to “ escalating border violence ” - and frequent traveler to Mexico , I was especially interested in knowing more about what is being reported as a systematic abuse of illegally immigrating women .
What I found may shock you because I found nothing of substance .
Because I ’m not an avid follower of ultra conservative border blogs , I did n’t realize what a trigger this rape tree idea is for what I assume are anti-immigration and border wall types .
From Minute
Man blogs to far right leaning blogs ( which , incidentally , link to each other ) much of nothing has been said about the subject .
One of the things that struck me in this search was the far too frequently repeated accounts such as the one found in a piece written by Clark A. Kirby , TX State Director and published in Canada Free Press which reads :
On Tuesday , April 17th , a routine event took place on the border .
The victim , statistics show , was young , female , and of Latin American descent .
We do not know her name and never will .
She suffered , most likely , in silence .
If she is still alive , she will suffer for the rest of her life .
Evidence of her humiliation and subjugation was left at the scene for all to see – her underclothes hanging from the branch of the tree under which the detestable crime was committed .
“ Rape Trees ” are a visible reminder of the dangers of our unsecured borders .
I ’d say that ’s a whole lot of conjecture on the part of Mr. Kirby but he ’s not the only Texas politician running with this unfounded idea .
Representative Ted Poe [ R - TX ] has submitted into the Congressional Record :
Ripped from the bodies of unwilling women , undergarments cling to branches of a tree just a few feet from the lawless U.S. - Mexico border , dozens of pairs of underwear thrown there by rapists .
These are called rape trees .
Each pair is a trophy from a woman that was smuggled into the United States , victims that are heard screaming in the desert .
They are raped , even gang raped by illegal human smugglers , then forced into silence .
These trees are a warning .
Illegal immigrants evade our borders but crime does n’t evade them .
Some become criminals .
Some become victims .
They are raped , robbed and murdered by other illegals , human smugglers and brutal criminals who then claim other victims .
More than 70 percent of their rapes , murders and child sex crimes are against Americans .
One expert who studies sex crimes says about a hundred illegal sex offenders cross the border every day , leaving thousands of victims every year .
Rape trees are a warning to illegals not to talk .
They should be a warning to Americans as well , to shout out against illegal entry and human smuggling .
And that ’s just the way it is .
Link after link provided the same blog stories all linking back to one or another similar post about ladies ’ undergarments hanging in the trees near the border but not a one provided any sort of proof of rape .
It would seem that in normal police work , underwear in trees without a victim or witness would not lead to a rape investigation .
( This was verified by the dispatch operator of my local police department . )
I did find though a blog that documented pictures of what is being termed “ rape tree ” as well as acres of strewn about clothing and garbage .
To his credit , Gary Armstrong , the writer of that blog post had the integrity to use the word allegedly when describing a red panty in a tree as a trophy left by a rapist coyote .
While I ’m certain that many of the bloggers writing about “ rape trees ” are genuine in their intent and concern , I ca n’t help but notice that the well meaning yet unfounded posts have led to a plethora of somewhat ignorant documentaries about the subject .
Here ’s a You Tube clip of one :
I ’m assuming that the commentator has never been on a ski lift or visited a Dick ’s Last Resort ; ladies ’ undergarments are frequently found on display at both .
( Perhaps I should dial 911 and report a rape next time I ’m skiing and see women ’s underwear in the treetops under the lift . )
“ Border , ” an award winning documentary directed by Chris Burgard has been reviewed as :
Fort Worth , TX ( WiredPRNews.com ) —
The shocking documentary ‘ Border ’ shows how a porous border and limited enforcement enables human smugglers and drug traffickers to extort , rape , murder and humiliate those seeking a better life in the United States .
I ’ve not seen “ Border ” but it is interesting to note that the filmmaker was influenced by Kuki Gallmann , a writer and conservationist living in Kenya who was sued in 2001 by 915 Kenyans after their eviction by her allegedly resulted in the rapes of many women .
I certainly do n’t mean to discount the very real occurrences of violence against any woman but all this reading of non-proven incidents of rape brings to mind the term “ useful idiot . ”
It ’s a term I heard used in a 1984 news program featuring Soviet KGB defector Yuri Bezmenov .
In that interview , Mr. Bezmenov described how our country would be demoralised and ripped at the seams by useful idiots who parrot in news articles tripe fomented by those with larger agendas .
That idea that some women are raped while attempting to cross the border should never be discounted ; I do n’t doubt there is rape and other violence in some situations .
The idea of panties in trees being proof of widespread rape is what is laughable .
The conjectures without victims , witnesses or other proof make a mockery of the very real subject of abuse and the people who copy and paste such nonsense in blog posts are either well meaning idiots or idiots with an agenda , but idiots nonetheless .

There have been many comparisons to the Great Depression with our current economic crisis .
Massive speculation , rampant problems in the banking system , and exponential jumps in unemployment .
Yet we may have a lot to learn by looking at the former Great Depression known as the Long Depression .
The Long Depression lasted 65 months starting in October of 1873 and running until March of 1879 .
According to the National Bureau of Economic Research it is the longest period of contraction on record .
There is great debate as to the reasons for the Long Depression .
Much of the issues come from the fact that prices were falling because of improved productivity and also sound money in gold and silver .
We are currently seeing prices falling in many items including homes , cars , and other consumer goods .
So what are some of the causes of this depression ?
First , production during this time was increasing on a global scale .
So it is important to understand that .
Yet what occurred is that prices fell at an incredible velocity .
Just like any major calamity , the major turning point came when the Vienna Stock Exchange collapsed in May of 1873 .
The French economy was hurt because it had to make war reparations to Germany from the Franco - Prussian war .
In the U.S. much of the price collapse was based on tighter monetary policy .
The U.S. made a strong attempt to go back on the gold standard after the massive expansionary cost brought on by the Civil War .
The U.S was doing virtually the opposite of what is currently going by taking money out of circulation .
As we know , the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve in our current environment are exercising one of the most expansionary monetary policies ever witnessed .
Yet the problem of course is this money is making it into the hands of banks and we are witnessing depression in prices once again .
It is interesting to note that the “ greenback ” which was specie came about in August of 1861 and was authorized via the Legal Tender Act of 1862 and stayed in circulation until 1971 .
This brought on rampant speculation and fraud including the building of the Union Pacific and exploded with the 1869 Credit Mobilier panic .
There was a railway building bubble which collapsed in 1873 .
If you think of the housing bubble you can understand how over building in any industry can come crashing down once a fiat system is over leveraged .
Many nations around the world enacted protectionist policies to protect industries that were being hurt .
There were fierce movements of nationalism during this time which pushed economies into their respective corners .
Tariffs were enacted and President Harrison won the 1888 election on a protectionist message .
Many believed and followed the tenets of classic liberalism and believed the government had little role to intervene in the economy and many followed this .
This can not be said for our current crisis .
We are intervening like never before .
Massive bailouts .
Gigantic injections of liquidity .
Fiscal and monetary stimulus .
We are throwing everything at this crisis .
Yet the world markets have still seen $ 50 trillion in wealth disappear .
The problem of course is that we have been delaying any major correction for 30 years by hiding the technology bubble and housing bubble and now we are facing one major correction .
The Long Depression although it “ only ” officially lasted 65 months ran well into the 1890s :
The economy was in and out of depression many times for 30 years .
Yet the U.S. was expanding and wholesale giveaways of water , timber , fish , and minerals pushed major expansions and for those who were wealthy led to the Gilded Age .
Another huge crash occurred in 1893 .
And if you think bank runs are something from the past just think of the electronic bank run on IndyMac bank .
Here is how the old bank runs used to look ( New York City 1873 , 4th National Bank ) :
Another factor setting off the crash was the implosion of the Jay Cooke & Company .
This was a major component of the banking establishment .
It collapsed when it found that it was unable to market several million dollars in Northern Pacific railway bonds ( does this sound familiar ? ) .
At the time , much of the investment banking establishment was salivating for railroads much like our recent investment banks went off the edge with real estate .
When the funding source dried up or too much over building occurred , multiple external forces collapsed the market .
After the Civil War many people found employment in the railway boom .
Outside of agriculture it was the largest employer and also had the most money at risk .
In fact , there are many parallels with our current employment situation and how many people are dependent on the finance and real estate industries .
Once that industry imploded , many people found themselves out of work .
Europe recovered much quicker from the crash .
For example , German businesses managed to avoid the major wage cuts brought on by the depression in the U.S.
Also , the major influx of immigrants kept cheap labor on the market for the U.S.
In 1876 unemployment reached 14 % in the U.S. which is another interesting point from the Long Depression .
For the most part , the Great Depression saw wider unemployment – as stated before much of the problems occurred by the price depression being seen in goods and wages .
The U.S. also was the cheap labor market similar to what China and India are today .
Some of the problems in Europe occurred because of cheap American goods flooding the markets .
How things change .
The Long Depression was a troubling and long economic worldwide contraction .
The Long Depression , the Great Depression , and our current crisis all have a global entrenched component .
It would be wise for us to learn from these past events .
In fact , our current crisis resembles much of what Japan did with their baburu keiki ( asset bubble ) .
Massive fiscal stimulus and injections into otherwise insolvent banks .
We are in unchartered territory here .

What will happen to all the inner planets , dwarf planets , gas giants and asteroids in the Solar System when the Sun turns into a white dwarf ?
This question is currently being pondered by a NASA researcher who is building a model of how our Solar System might evolve as our Sun loses mass , violently turning into an electron - degenerate star .
It turns out that Dr. John Debes work has some very interesting implications .
As we use more precise techniques to observe existing white dwarf stars with the dusty remains of the rocky bodies that used to orbit them , the results of Debes ’ model could be used as a comparison to see if any existing white dwarf stars resemble how our Sun might look in 4 - 5 billion years time …
Today , our Sun is a healthy yellow dwarf star .
If you want to be precise , it is a “ G V star ” .
This yellow dwarf will happily burn 600 million tonnes of hydrogen per second in its core for 10 billion years , generating the light that is required to make our planet habitable .
The Sun is approximately half - way through this hydrogen burning phase , so it ’s OK , things are n’t going to change ( for the Sun at least ) for a long time yet .
But what happens then ?
What happens in 4 - 5 billion years when the supply of hydrogen runs out in the core ?
Although our Sun is n’t massive enough to entertain the thought of going out in a blaze of supernova glory , it will still go through an exciting , yet terrifying death .
After evolving through the hydrogen - burning phase , the Sun will puff up into a huge red giant star as the hydrogen fuel becomes scarce , expanding 200 times the size it is now , probably swallowing the Earth .
Helium , and then progressively heavier elements will be fused in and around the core .
The Sun will never fuse carbon however , instead it will shed its outer layers forming a planetary nebula .
Once things calm down , a small sparkling jewel of a white dwarf star will remain .
This tiny remnant will have a mass of around half that of our present Sun , but will be the size of the Earth .
Needless to say , white dwarfs are very dense , intense gravitational pull countered not by fusion in the core ( like all Main Sequence stars ) , but by electron degeneracy pressure .
When the Solar System reaches this phase in its evolution , what will it look like ?
What will become of the asteroids , gas giants , moons and rocky planets ?
I was very fortunate to chat with astrophysicist Dr John Debes , from NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center , at January ’s American Astronomical Society ( AAS ) conference in Long Beach ( California ) who is developing an n-body code simulating an evolving Solar System .
After the Sun has stopped hydrogen fusion in its core , it loses mass as it sheds its outer layers after the red giant phase and subsequent planetary nebula formation .
It is estimated that the Sun will lose about 50 % of its mass during this time , naturally affecting the Solar System as a whole .
As the Sun loses mass , the outer planets ( such as Jupiter ) will drift outwards , increasing their orbital radii .
In the simulation , Debes is very careful to ensure there is a gradual reduction in solar mass to ensure stability in the simulation .
What we are left with is an old Solar System , where little is left of the inner planets ( it is likely that anything within the orbit of the Earth will have been swallowed by the Sun as it expanded through the red giant phase ) .
Although the future white dwarf Solar System will seem very alien to present day , some things wo n’t change .
Jupiter ’s orbit might have receded with the drop in solar mass , it will remain a planetary heavyweight , causing disruption in asteroid orbits .
Using known asteroid data , the motion of these chunks of rocks are allowed to evolve , and over millions of years , they may get thrown out of the Solar System , or more interestingly , pushed closer to the white dwarf .
Once the whole system has settled down , resonances in the asteroid belt will become amplified ; Kirkwood Gaps ( caused by gravitational resonance with Jupiter ) will widen , and according to Debes ’ simulations , the edges of these gaps will become perturbed even more , making more asteroids available to be tidally disrupted and shredded to dust .
The AAS conference was full of amazing research into white dwarf observations .
The reason for this is that there are many white dwarf candidates out there with dusty metallic absorption lines .
This means that there used to be rocky bodies orbiting these stars , but became pulverised ( by tidal shear ) for astronomers to analyse .
These white dwarf systems can give us a clue as to what mechanisms could be supplying the white dwarfs with dusty material , even giving us a glimpse into the future of our Solar System .
“ We have a physical picture for the link between planetary systems and dusty white dwarfs , ” Debes said when describing his model in relation to the mysterious dusty white dwarf observations .
“ Dusty white dwarfs are truly a mystery !
We think we know what might be going on , but we do n’t have a smoking gun yet . ”
However , Debes is getting close to finding a possible smoking gun , he ’s basing his model on some of the key characteristics of these ancient dusty remnants to see what the Solar System could look like in billions of years time .
So , where does this dust come from ?
As the asteroid orbits are perturbed by Jupiter , they may get close enough to be tidally disrupted .
Get too close and they will get shredded by the gravitational shear created by the steep tidal radius of the compact white dwarf .
The asteroid dust then settles into the white dwarf .
The presence of this dust has a very obvious signature in the absorption lines of spectroscopic data , allowing researchers to infer an accretion rate for metal - rich white dwarfs .
In Debes ’ model , he has set the upper limit to 1016 g/ year and a lower limit to 1013 g/ year , consistent with observed estimates .
In his evolved Solar System model , Jupiter ’s gravity controls this accretion rate , pushing asteroids toward the white dwarf and , by using a powerful supercomputer to track the perturbations and eventual shredding of known asteroids , there may be an opportunity to arrive at a profound conclusion .
Debes is able to use his model to compare observations of known dusty white dwarfs with the simulated outcome of the Solar System .
With reference to previous studies ( in particularly Koester & Wilken , 2006 in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics ) , Debes has found some similar white dwarf “ Suns ” .
“ For G29 - 38 , the canonical dusty white dwarf , they [ Koester & Wilken ] estimate a total mass of 0.55 solar masses–about what people believe the mass that our own sun will have remaining when it becomes a white dwarf , ” Debes added .
“ But mass estimates are a bit uncertain –I ’ve seen estimates ranging from 0.55 - 0.7 solar masses for this particular white dwarf . ”
“ Another good candidate is a DAZ [ a metal - rich white dwarf ] called WD 1257+278 , which does not show dust but is spot on with the mass expected for the Sun–0.54 M Sun , ” said Debes .
“ Its accretion rate is also consistent with my model predictions so far assuming an asteroid belt mass and characteristic perturbation timescale that I found in my simulations . ”
Debes is continuing to make his model more and more sophisticated , but already the results are promising .
Most exciting is that we may already be observing white dwarfs , like G29 - 38 or WD 1257+278 , giving us a tantalizing glimpse of what our Solar System will look like when the Sun becomes a white dwarf star , ripping apart any remaining asteroids and planets as they stray too close to the Sun ’s tidal shear .
However , it also raises the question : if white dwarfs like G29 - 38 are being fed by the remains of tidally - blended asteroids , are there massive planets shepherding asteroids in these white dwarf systems too ?
The Armani 5th Avenue store in New York City , designed by Massimiliano & Doriana Fuksas Architects , opened last week .
The central feature of the 4 - storey store is a sculptural steel staircase .

Here 's some info from Georgio Armani :

GIORGIO ARMANI OPENS ARMANI/5th AVENUE IN NEW YORK
On February 18 , 2009 Giorgio Armani comes to the most celebrated street in New York .
Fifth Avenue has been the focal point of many contemporary and historical events , and has featured in novels such as Edith Wharton ’s The Age of Innocence , and countless films in which its most famous buildings such as the Empire State Building or the New York Public Library have played a major part .
As for the museums , there are so many that the section that fronts Central Park is known as Museum Mile .
“ A really exciting challenge – that is how I would describe our new concept store , Armani / 5th Avenue in New York .
It is a special project requiring a degree of courage , as it brings together in one space different elements such as Armani Jeans and Emporio Armani side by side with Giorgio Armani .
I was determined to send out a clear message of change , interpreting the current trend for mixing genres , juxtaposing items in different price brackets .
You could say that this is a provocative move – uniting in the same place and with the same furnishings , without visible boundaries , the various collections that combine to form the entire Armani universe .
This freedom of expression defines for me the spirit of Fifth Avenue : a prestigious shopping destination , of course , but one that is less exclusive in character than comparable addresses , with a democratic mood which I am certain represents the future .
I worked on the creation of this store with Doriana and Massimiliano Fuksas , whose hugely respected architectural practice is known for bringing a precisely judged sense of glamour to clothing stores .
This is the third project we have jointly accomplished , following on from Armani / Chater House in Hong Kong and Armani / Ginza Tower in Tokyo , and significantly all three offer totally distinctive environments , each different from the other , because I contend that identical retail spaces , monolithic and repetitive , belong in the past and cannot match the experience offered by a totally original store which introduces the public to the aesthetic excitement of fine contemporary architecture . “
- Giorgio Armani
ARMANI /5th AVENUE
On this avenue , that combines historical significance with an ultra modern , vibrant and pulsating buzz , at the intersection with 56th Street , Armani / 5th Avenue is revealed as a neatly defined and light building completely clad in glass - 164 feet long and 45 feet high ( 50 meters long and 14 meters high ) .
Spread over 4 floors , one of which is the basement , the store covers a total area of 43,000 square feet ( 4,000 square meters ) ; the retail area covers approximately 30,000 square feet ( 2800 square meters ) of which 5200 ( 480 square meters ) is occupied by the Bar and Restaurant .
Form and structure
Giorgio Armani has selected the architects Doriana and Massimiliano Fuksas and has actively collaborated with them throughout this building , conceived as a single , fluid space providing uninterrupted intercommunication , brought together by the impact of the vortex of the staircase .
The heart of the building is , in fact , epitomized by the staircase , a structure in rolled calender steel , made in Italy , and clad in plastic material that highlights its exceptional sculptural presence , an entity that is almost impossible to convey in terms of any normal geometric shape .
The sense of movement
An interplay of slightly overlapping bands distinguishes the structure of the building and leads to the upper floors , gliding over the vertical surface of the interior .
Each floor opens out into an ever - changing pattern of curved surfaces that add visual interest to the light putty - colored walls .
Whereas the colors are pure and constant – beige for the walls , black for the floors and ceilings , and metal – the shine , the glossy look , the use of different materials , the reflections from the lighting - all suggest movement , subdued atmosphere and color .
Special attention has been paid to the lighting , which defines and emphasizes the curvature of the walls and spaces .
The use of curves is a constant feature throughout the interior design , and is evident in every aspect of the store , from the display units to the hanging units , from desks to armchairs .
The internal layout
This fabulous concept store brings together the world of Armani throughout .
For signature shopping , there is no better place to start than on the ground floor for Emporio Armani and Giorgio Armani accessories as well as the Emporio Armani collection for women .
Down in the basement is the realm of those who favor a casual style of dress : Armani Jeans , EA7 – the sports line that includes specialized clothing and equipment , Emporio Armani Underwear and the Swimwear range .
The further up the building , the more selective and refined the choice of products become .
On the first floor , the Cosmetic area beckons , with its ultra sophisticated range of products with Crema Nera and the more sophisticated perfumes , followed by the area dedicated to Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani shoes .
From here it is a short hop to Giorgio Armani , Fashion , Classics and Eveningwear , all for women .
Following the pathway of the staircase and descending a few steps , the space is dedicated exclusively to the fashion section of the Emporio Armani line for men .
On the second floor , Emporio Armani , Giorgio Armani for men and Emporio Armani and Giorgio Armani shoes for men are displayed .
This floor also houses Armani / Casa , offering a choice of objets ; the space successfully evokes the huge Armani / Casa store in Soho .
Nearby there is a small area dedicated to the delights of Armani / Dolci , the first retail area for this collection of delicacies to open in the USA .
On both the first and second level , two specific spaces have been conceived and reserved for a private VIP fitting room .
From the Armani / Restaurant on the top floor , a fabulous view can be enjoyed – through an amber - colored filter – down Fifth Avenue , with Central Park in the background .
A line of lighting on the ground leads to the entrance to the restaurant , emphasizing the sensuous curve of the wall .
A virtual curtain is raised as you pass through it … the show begins , making the customer the star .
Doriana and Massimiliano Fuksas said : “ The building that incorporates Armani / 5th Avenue holds a very important place in the history of architecture because its façade is one of the first examples of the “ International Style ” .
When one is dealing with such a cultural milestone , one must always bear in mind that the exterior is totally New York , while the interior should have its own identity .
A reflection of the flair and aesthetic values that define the Giorgio Armani style .
The grand staircase is the focal point , an exciting sculptural feature which connects all the different levels that accommodate the Armani universe range by range .
Innovative in both layout and content , Armani / 5th
Avenue is the first concept store in which all the Armani products are presented in a single space , where the same design has been adopted throughout : the subtle colours and restrained shapes emphasise the value of the product . ”
The Armani /5th Avenue Special Collections
To celebrate the opening of this new concept store , Giorgio Armani has created a range of special accessories – a capsule collection that includes pieces from both Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani , only available for sale in the 5th Avenue store .
Notice the logo – all the Giorgio Armani items feature a black label inscribed “ Armani / 5th Avenue - Limited Edition . ”
Meanwhile the Emporio Armani items have the following inscription : “ Armani / 5th Avenue – Exclusive Edition . ”
The Giorgio Armani collections will include a jacket in blue python skin , a crew neck cashmere pullover , jeans , eyewear with a metal tag , accessories in crocodile nappa , and watches .
The Emporio Armani collections present an ultra urban and international look that reflects the vibrant energy so typical of Manhattan .

A modal dialog window is a message that pops up in front of your screen , and prevents you from continuing with your task until you 've dealt with it .
One example is a version of the Windows XP shutdown dialog , shown to the left .
Users get here by choosing Start >
Shut Down .
Potentially , if they Shut Down accidentally , unpleasant consequences could result , so this dialog is designed to prevent accidents .
It also surfaces related options ( Logoff , Suspend , Restart , etc. ) that may not appear at the initial level .
Contrast this solution with the pictured Macintosh OS X Leopard shutdown dialog .
Instead of requiring a user action to confirm the shutdown , the system counts down before shutdown .
A button is provided to skip the countdown , but users could simply walk away after the single command to shut down , and consider their task complete .
The designer discusses this feature 's design at length in his blog , contrasting it with the Windows XP and Vista solutions .
Modal dialogs proliferate online , not just in operating systems .
The lightbox style modal dialog , where the browser dims the page behind the dialog , is popular in web applications .
Problems with modal dialogs include :
Users habituate to dismissing them quickly , so they do n't offer protection .
They may be hidden behind other windows .
( I have this problem frequently with Adobe Acrobat 's print dialog . )
They slow users down .
In many cases , a better design would achieve the same goals without slowing users .
Firefox 3 and Google Chrome have killed the " Remember my login " modal dialog with its new browser bar implementation .
Contrast this bar with Internet Explorer 7 , which takes over the screen and requiring users to immediately decide -- save password or not ?
This is great because it keeps users immersed in their activity .
Remembering the password is a useful feature , but it 's still optional .
The browser bar surfaces the feature at the correct time without requiring users to stop everything and service it .
If you 're building web applications , kill your modal dialogs for asking permission .
Google Gmail , for example , foregoes delete confirmation and provides a link to undo your delete .
Undo is better than Are You Sure ?
John
Yoo is a disgrace to this nation for his actions in promoting torture in the Bush Administration .
This answer in a Q&A session tells you all you need to know about his man .
Matt Yglesias :
I ’m just going to quote Orrin Kerr on this : John Yoo : “ Now that I ’m not in the government , part of my role , because I have a certain amount of expertise , is to try to keep the government honest . ” – From an interview with the Orange County Register .
On the other hand , back when he was in government … .
That ’s funny .
But it ’s also outrageous .
It ’s not as if Yoo ’s job in government was as a press flask .
The Office of Legal Counsel really is there to try to keep the government honest .
David Addington and Dick Cheney were instrumental in using sycophants like John Yoo who willingly absconded their integrity and duties to push through Bush 's torture agenda .
.- During her recent visit to Mexico , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made an unexpected stop at the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe and left a bouquet of white flowers “ on behalf of the American people , ” after asking who painted the famous image .
The image of Our Lady of Guadalupe was miraculously imprinted by Mary on the tilma , or cloak , of St. Juan Diego in 1531 .
The image has numerous unexplainable phenomena , such as the appearance on Mary ’s eyes of those present in the room when the tilma was opened and the image ’s lack of decay .
Mrs. Clinton was received on Thursday at 8:15 a.m. by the rector of the Basilica , Msgr. Diego Monroy .
Msgr. Monroy took Mrs. Clinton to the famous image of Our Lady of Guadalupe , which had been previously lowered from its usual altar for the occasion .
After observing it for a while , Mrs. Clinton asked “ who painted it ? ” to which Msgr. Monroy responded “ God ! ”
Clinton then told Msgr. Monroy that she had previously visited the old Basilica in 1979 , when the new one was still under construction .
After placing a bouquet of white flowers by the image , Mrs. Clinton went to the quemador – the open air area at the Basilica where the faithful light candles - and lit a green candle .
Leaving the basilica half an hour later , Mrs. Clinton told some of the Mexicans gathered outside to greet her , “ you have a marvelous virgin ! ”
This evening Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is set to receive the highest award given by Planned Parenthood Federation of America -- the Margaret Sanger Award , named for the organization 's founder , a noted eugenicist .
The award will be presented at a gala event in Houston , Texas .
Uncategorized Bloggergate : Dan Maes ’ Latest Controversy • October 20 , 2010
Are some Republicans so desperate to see Dan Maes leave the governor ’s race that they ’d bribe him to drop out ?
Conservative activist Joseph Harrington , a Maes supporter , tells The Denver Post ’s Lynn Bartels he was approached by a “ well - known blogger , two metro - Denver - area GOP county chairs , two senior operatives for Tom Tancredo , ” and others to offer Maes a “ bunch of money ” — funneled from an unnamed donor — to abandon the race .
After Harrington made the allegations , Ross Kaminsky took to his Rossputin blog to out himself as the “ well - known blogger ” and deny the charges .
Such an arrangement — which would seemingly benefit American Constitution Party candidate Tancredo , Kaminsky ’s own choice for governor — could be considered illegal , reports the Denver Daily News .
Political blogger Ben DeGrow wades into the fray with an e-mail trail defending Kaminsky ’s take , writing that “ evidence indicates any deal - seeking came from ” the Maes camp .
But Colorado Ethics
Watch does n’t want the matter to be settled by bloggers .
The group is looking into the “ convoluted controversy , ” writes The Colorado Independent , and wants Maes to disclose any information he might have about illegal offers to drop out of the race .
Meanwhile , The Atlantic ’s politics editor takes a look at the “ quirk ” and “ zeal ” of the governor ’s race , writing of Democratic candidate John Hickenlooper , “ Ironically , in a year when voters seem to hate anyone who has ever been elected to anything , Hickenlooper ’s greatest strength will be his record as Denver ’s mayor . ”

When Steve Fambro and Chris Anthony founded Aptera Motors in 2006 , they wanted to create the world ’s most fuel - efficient car .
To do that , they had to ditch all conventional notions of car design to make the most aerodynamic vehicle possible .
The result is the Aptera 2e , a two - seater powered by an electric motor that delivers 100 miles of driving on an 8 - hour charge from a standard outlet .
The company says 4,000 people have already put down a deposit for the car , which is slated to hit driveways later this year .
But the design that makes the Aptera so efficient also disqualifies the car from the Department of Energy ’s $ 25 billion loan program for ultra - efficient cars — the same fund from which GM has requested more than $ 8 billion .
The company wants the low - cost loans to develop other models , such as a plug - in hybrid with a gas - powered generator .
So Aptera Motors went to Washington to show the feds why the reg needs to change .

( CNN ) --
A piece of debris zipping by at astronomical speed forced the crew of the international space station to take shelter in its escape capsule Thursday , a rare close call for the orbiting platform , NASA said .
Debris passed close by the international space station Thursday , and its crew moved to an escape craft .
The object -- about 5 inches across , and moving at nearly 20,000 mph -- passed within 3 miles ( 4.5 km ) of the station early Thursday afternoon , the U.S. space agency reported .
The near miss forced the three - member crew into the Soyuz return ship for about 10 minutes , NASA spokesman Kelly Humphries told CNN .
The chunk of metal came from a satellite rocket motor used on an earlier space mission , NASA said .
The North American Aerospace Defense Command warned mission controllers about the object Wednesday night , too late to take evasive action , Humphries said .
In previous instances , controllers have been able to maneuver the station out of the way of a threatening piece of space junk -- " but because of the late notice , we did n't have time to coordinate that , " he said .
Watch as Humphries describes the scare »
Instead , station commander Michael Fincke , flight engineer Yury Lonchakov and science officer Sandra Magnus retreated to the Soyuz until the debris passed .
NASA issued an all - clear for the station about 12:45 p.m. ET , Humphries said .
" They 're getting back out of the Soyuz and reactivating all the station systems so they can get back to normal duties , " Humphries said .
The station has had to dodge a possible collision eight times in the eight years it has been occupied , Humphries said .
Another NASA spokesman , Josh Byerly , said crews have had to seek shelter aboard the Soyuz " lifeboats " on several previous occasions .
Watch CNN's John Zarrella explain what happened »
The Soyuz is the workhorse of the Russian space program , and one has been kept at the station for use as a possible lifeboat in case of emergency .
Construction on the international space station 's orbital platform began in 1998 , and it has had astronauts aboard since 2000 .
CNN 's John Zarrella and Kim Segal contributed to this report .

or should it be morning joke ?
Anyway , Lady Claire should be the next POTUS , she is that good .
And I have to weigh in on Joe Scarborough who is trying to whip up hysteria around Obama and his movement on the financial market , or banks .
These banks need to have stress tests and decisions need to be made on which ones will survive .
No one expects Obama to snap his fingers and make irrational decisions , we had that from the last administration and we saw what happened .
Obama has been in office what , 50 days ?
And Joe Scarborough is trying to make him appear or seem inept ?
The only one who is inept is the morning joke , himself , Scarborough .
Give Obama time , he was given this bullshit by the Bush Administration , period .
And Scarborough the public KNOWS THIS .
Stop Paying Attention And You Will Learn Better ?
A new study challenges the prevailing assumption that you must pay attention to something in order to learn it .
Research in the journal Neuron says that stimulus - reward pairing can elicit visual learning in adults ... even without awareness of the stimulus presentation or reward contingencies .
Study participants were asked to view a computer monitor , maintain their gaze on a central spot and enjoy the occasional drop of water that was delivered to their mouths through a tube .
The drop of water was considered a reward because subjects were required to abstain from eating and drinking for five hours before the experimental session .
The visual stimuli that were paired with the liquid rewards were viewed with one eye and were imperceptible to the subjects because contour rich patterns were continuously flashed to the other eye .
Study author Dr. Aaron Seitz from the Department of Psychology at the University of California , Riverside and colleagues Drs. Dongho Kim and Takeo Watanabe from Boston University designed the novel experimental paradigm to take the " task " out of perceptual learning .
" The use of this procedure allowed us to examine the specific hypothesis that reward - related learning signals are sufficient to cause improvements in visual sensitivity for visual stimuli paired with rewards , " explains Dr. Seitz .
The researchers found that stimulus - reward pairing was sufficient to cause learning , even when the subject was not aware of the learned stimuli or stimulus - reward conditions .
The learning effects were specific to the eye receiving the stimuli , a condition indicative of an early , monocular stage of visual processing .
These results suggest that automatic reinforcement mechanisms ( such as those released at times of reward ) , rather than directed attention , determine improvements in sensory skills .
" Our findings support the suggestion that visual skill learning is generally an unconscious process and that goal - directed factors , such as directed attention , serve mostly to bias how learning takes place rather than actually gating the learning process , " hypothesizes Dr. Seitz .
The authors are careful to acknowledge that future studies are required .
The Israeli military on Thursday shelled the main United Nations aid compound in Gaza , struck a building that houses foreign news organizations , and caused a fire at a hospital .
The attacks sparked global condemnation even as efforts to reach a cease - fire continued .
Later in the day , Hamas struck the Israeli city of Beersheba with a salvo of Qassam rockets , injuring five people , two of them seriously .
The Israeli strikes on what political officials said were unintended targets in the Gaza campaign underscore what some analysts see as a furious drive by the Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) to achieve as many last - minute blows to Hamas as possible before a cease - fire is reached .
And at this stage of the war , fissures are emerging within the Israeli civilian and military leadership .
" It 's the final push to make Hamas understand , either they make a decision for a cease - fire , or it will be difficult to survive , " says Shmuel Rosner , a leading opinion maker and journalist .
" They need to show seriousness so Hamas does n't interpret Israel 's waiting of the last few days as reluctance to continue the operation . "
While Ehud Barak , Israel 's defense minister , apologized to UN Secretary - General Ban Ki Moon for Israel 's strike on their Gaza headquarters , Prime Minister Ehud Olmert took a different approach .
He said the building had been used by Palestinian militants to strike Israeli forces .
Mr. Olmert , quoting a senior IDF officer , said Israel 's troops opened fire on militants inside the compound shot antitank weapons and machine guns .
" It is absolutely true that we were attacked from that place , " he said .
Those two points provide a window into the differences that have developed at the top of the Israel political structure , run by an unlikely troika of Olmert , Mr. Barak and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni – none of whom are allied .
With an election set for Feb. 10 , the political rivals have become even more assertive in claiming their share of the credit for the war .
Ms. Livni , who is running to succeed Olmert , reportedly favors a unilateral pullback even without a cease - fire , according to media reports .
A swift pullback would minimize risks to Israeli soldiers as well as the chances of a giving Hamas an opportunity to score any parting blows .
A quick withdrawal would also improve Israel 's position with its Western allies , which is progressively eroding as damage and death tolls mount .
" She is afraid of a mess up , " says Gideon Doron , a political science professor at Tel Aviv University .
" The longer you stay there , the higher the likelihood of a soldier getting hurt .
That 's bad for the ruling party . "
Barak , who has got a boost from the polls for leading the war effort , reportedly supports a swift " humanitarian " cease - fire and the Egyptian efforts to reach a truce with Hamas .
He would also like to wrap up the fighting and show a willingness to pursue peace to bolster his position among in his pro-peace Labor Party .
Olmert , who reportedly supports continuing the operation , is a lame duck prime minister and is free of his colleagues ' political calculations .
Mr. Doron says he 's concerned about his legacy and would like to be remembered as the leader who squashed Hamas .
But meanwhile in Gaza , the war moved into one of its most deadly days amid some of the heaviest Israeli shelling on Thursday .
Israel 's military chief of staff told a parliamentary committee Tuesday that although Hamas has been dealt a serious blow , " we still have work to do . "
In the crosshairs are senior Hamas figures who have gone underground , including Mahmoud az - Zahar – whose home was hit by the Israeli air force late Wednesday night .
Hamas Interior Minister Saeed Seyyam was also killed Thursday .
Mr. Seyyam controlled Hamas police and security forces of about 13,000 men , many of whom were directly involved with fighting .
Many observers say that IDF strategists have a short - list of targets they want to strike before a cease - fire .
The Israel defense establishment , they say , is loath to slow down and give the impression that it 's tired or is lacking in the will to continuing fighting Hamas .
But Israel missile strikes drew even sharper international condemnation on Thursday , in particular from the UN Secretary - General , Ban Ki Moon , who is in Israel trying to bring about a cease - fire that would end Israel 's attacks on Gaza and the continued launch of rockets at Israel by Hamas militants .
Into the afternoon Thursday , the UN headquarters in Gaza , where some 700 Palestinian civilian had sought shelter , was still burning out of control , several hours after it was hit , forcing the suspension of major aid operations in the coastal territory .
The chief of operations there said there was n't enough water to douse the flames , a result of Gaza 's battered infrastructure in the 20 - day war with Israel .
" The warehouses are burning down , the fire is spreading , and we 're very concerned , " says John Ging , the director of operations in Gaza for UN Relief Works Agency ( UNRWA ) , the UN 's main arm for aid to Palestinians .
" There 's a shortage of water and that 's why it 's spreading .
All the food , medicine , and humanitarian aid we have to distribute in Gaza are stored here , " Ging adds .
The solution is to " stop the shooting , respect the UN , and then we can start to rebuild .
Our compound is falling apart before my eyes !
There are a million - and - half people depending on aid from us , and an attack on our compound is another challenge that we can do without . "
Mr. Ban , a diplomat who usually speaks in carefully crafted statements , issued his strongest statement to date on the conflict , which mushroomed on Dec. 27 after a six - month cease - fire expired and Hamas resumed rocket fire at Israel .
" I conveyed my strong protest and outrage to the defense minister and the foreign minister and demanded a full explanation , " said Ban , who had met Ms. Livni earlier Thursday as part of a multi-national effort to bring the devastating 20 - day - old war to an end .
Ban said in a press conference that he spoken to Barak .
" The defense minister said to me it was a grave mistake and he took it very seriously , " Ban said .
" He assured me that extra attention will be paid to UN facilities and staff and this will not be repeated . "
In Gaza , flames from the bombings Thursday also engulfed the al - Quds Hospital in Gaza City , though it was unclear whether this was from a direct hit or from a fire resulting from a nearby attack .
A UN spokesman said that the headquarters was hit by what was believed to be three white phosphorous shells , which burn at higher - than - usual temperatures , and that UN workers were unable to douse the flames with standard fire extinguishers .
Thursday marked the second time since the war began that a UN facility took a direct hit from Israel .
Last week , Israeli forces bombed a UN - run school in Jabalya , in northern Gaza , killing 39 Palestinians sheltering there .
The Israeli army says it hit the school because it was the source of mortar fire , but the UN says that no militants were found at the site .
At press time , emergency services in Beersheba , Israel , were dealing with the aftermath rocket attack there .
One of the Qassams launched by Hamas made a direct hit on a car .
In all , Gaza militants fired at least 24 rockets at Israel Thursday , hitting cities such as Gedera , Ofakim , and Sderot .
The wail of sirens , sending people in and out of bomb shelters , was heard throughout the day .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- General Motors Corp. shares fell as much as 18 % on Thursday after the troubled automaker and its auditor stoked more doubts that the company can keep its assembly lines running amid a historic dearth of new - car buyers .
“ ' Given the current administration , what are the odds that the Democrats tell the UAW to dissolve the union ?
It 's just not very likely . ' ”
The stock closed down 34 cents at $ 1.86 as part of a broader market pullback that brought the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % down 281 points , or 4.1 % .
See Market Snapshot .
Prompting the retreat , GM GM , - 2.37 % reiterated in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that bankruptcy is a possibility if its viability plan , as submitted to the Congress , does n't succeed .
The Detroit - based giant is seeking up to $ 30 billion in loans from the U.S. government , as well as loans from foreign governments including Canada , Germany , the U.K. , Sweden and Thailand for up to $ 6 billion more .
Vehicle sales , which have dropped 40 % in the U.S. from their peak and last month touched levels not seen in almost 30 years , will need to show signs of recovery next year under the plan .
GM 's survival also depends on its ability to obtain liquidity and financing to establish an appropriate level of debt , cut costs and have consumers convinced of its viability -- as well as partly owned GMAC 's ability to obtain funding from both wholesale and retail financing .
Deloitte & Touche made a similar analysis , concluding that GM's " recurring losses from operations , stockholders ' deficit and inability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations and sustain its operations raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern . "
The stock market shares those fears : GM 's shares have lost 90 % over the last 12 months .
GM said the conclusions reached by its own auditors were n't surprising , given prior public statements made by GM regarding its liquidity position .
" The auditor 's opinion has no impact on the aggressive actions we are taking to restructure our business for long - term viability . "
GM said in a statement .
" Once global automotive sales recover and GM 's restructuring actions generate the anticipated savings and benefits , the company is expected to again be able to fund its own operating requirements . "
Despite the heightened concerns , Erich Merkle , an industry analyst in Grand Rapids , Mich. , said he still believes that the bankruptcy route would be too messy , too complex and far too damaging to the economy .
" The best course of action , if such a thing exists , would be for the bondholders and the United Auto Workers to come to some sort of agreement to do what it takes to make GM viable , " he said .
" Given the current administration , what are the odds that the Democrats tell the UAW to dissolve the union ?
It 's just not very likely . "
March 22 , 2009 Evolutionary theorist Alastair Clarke this week published details of eight patterns he claims to be the basis of all the humour that has ever been imagined or expressed , regardless of civilization , culture or personal taste .
Clarke has stated before that humour is based on the surprise recognition of patterns but this is the first time he has identified the precise nature of the patterns involved , addressing the deceptively simple unit and context relationships at their foundation .
His research goes on to demonstrate the universality of the theory by showing how these few basic patterns are recognized in more than a hundred different types of humour .
Clarke explains : “ One of the most beautiful things about the theory is that , while denying all previous theories , it also unites them for the first time .
For decades researchers have concentrated on limited areas of humour and have each argued for causality based on their specific interest .
Now that we have pattern recognition theory , all previous explanations are accommodated by a single over - arching concept present in all of them .
“ The eight patterns divide into two main categories .
The first four are patterns of fidelity , by which we recognize the repetition of units within the same context , and the second four are patterns of magnitude , by which we recognize the same unit repeated in multiple contexts .
“ What this all means is that the basic faculty of pattern recognition equips us to compare multiple units for their appropriateness within a certain context , effectively selecting the best tool for the job , and then to apply our chosen unit to as wide a range of contexts as possible , effectively discovering the largest number of jobs that tool is good for . ”
“ Basically humour is all about information processing , accelerating faculties that enable us to analyse and then manipulate incoming data . ”
Clarke lists the patterns that are active in humour as positive repetition , division , completion , translation , applicative and qualitative recontextualization , opposition and scale .
“ Some are more intuitive than others , ” he admits .
“ The most basic , positive repetition , simply means that the unit is repeated in a similar form with the same purpose .
As with all patterns , the repeated unit can be composed of any information available to the human brain , whether an entity , action or property .
Then there ’s opposition , in which we take the unit and turn it against itself , such as can be seen in a mirror image or if we turn an arrow back to point in the other direction , producing a pattern of symmetry .
However , while all the patterns are relatively simple in structure the activity of some forms of translation and recontextualization can seem counter - intuitive at first sight .
“ In instances of humour these patterns may be recognized individually or in any possible combination of the eight .
Most instances are founded on one or two , although theoretically there is no limit to the number of patterns a person has recognized when they find something funny .
Pattern recognition remains a subjective matter , just like any other perception . ”
Details of the patterns and how they relate to more than a hundred forms of humour are published in The Eight Patterns Of Humour , which is also available as a free eBook from the publisher ’s website at www.pyrrhichouse.co.uk/eightpatterns for a period of 30 days .
“ The patterns reflect vitally important cognitive frameworks .
Those of fidelity provide us with a basic arithmetical toolkit , while those of magnitude provide everything required to develop syntactical systems .
Pattern recognition is in many ways pattern cognition , since the promotion of patterns through the reward systems associated with humour has massively accelerated humankind ’s ability to order and manipulate multiple units for multiple uses .
Put like that , there are few better ways to express human ingenuity and adaptability . ”
This publication is one of several within a series regarding Clarke ’s Pattern Recognition Theory Of Humour , which posits the fundamental role humour has played in the development of the intellectual and perceptual capacities of the species .
The theory is based on extensive observation and analysis .
“ While countless thousands of instances were informally considered over the years , ten thousand specific instances were analysed in a single document known as The Humour Ten Thousand . ”
This document is currently being prepared for publication and is to be made publically available on the internet during 2009 .
Due to its substantial length ( around 1500 pages ) the document will be published in sections of 1000 instances throughout the year .

Xenophon , Memorabilia I 2.62 , tr. Amy Bonnette :
In my [ Xenophon ’s ] opinion , Socrates – since this was the sort he was – deserved honor from the city rather than death .
One would find this out by examining the matter also according to the laws .
For , according to the laws , the penalty is death if someone is visibly stealing or taking clothes or purse - snatching or breaking into a home or selling free people into slavery or robbing temples .
But he above all human beings refrained from these things .
I do n’t know how to fit a comment on this passage into the dissertation just yet , so I want to comment here and figure it out later .
I ’ve been telling friends the last couple of days that Gotham , the world Batman is set in , is the question of what good wealth is .
Nearly everyone in Gotham just wants money for money ’s sake .
What sets Bruce Wayne apart is that , having wealth , he wants the city to be a better place ; the super villains are set apart in that they reject money as debased for the most part – one wonders if that ’s why they ’re considered “ insane , ” that they value other things .
Notably absent from the Watchmen movie was the question of wealth , the question of “ what ’s worth having . ”
Can any philosophic discussion occur with the question of value absent ?
If what is valued is presupposed , is that philosophic ?
Moralistic ?
None of the above ?
In any case – “ stealing ” moves away from the visible to the covered ( “ stealing clothes , ” “ purse - snatching ” ) .
Again , we recall “ uncovering ” is alethea , the Greek word for truth .
The purse conceals its contents completely , but more than likely contains wealth .
Then there is “ breaking into a home , ” “ selling free people into slavery , ” and “ robbing temples , ” all of which presuppose violence against another ’s property , citizenship itself , and finally the gods .
All of these things are punishable by death .
We can see why Xenophon has organized this list the way he has : reasoning is implicit in the first half of the list ; the seemingly less consequential crimes are statements of value , and perhaps what is most valuable is invisible , but reached for from the visible .
The more consequential crimes , the latter half of the list , are more public problems .
“ Breaking into a home ” – violence against private property – is used by Montesquieu as an “ alarm system ” for our nonclassical order ; even dumb people can tell something ’s wrong with the government when it is taking away land and money left and right .
But if the first half of the list ended with the question of wealth and the intellect , the second half – after a brief flirtation with the theme of freedom – ends with the question of wealth and piety .
There is a lack of parallelism here : do freedom and visibility really coincide as themes ?
Something is strange about how this list moves , or ties together .
As it primarily concerns wealth and freedom , two ideas which can contradict sharply , then given that one devotes oneself to one ’s true wealth , one wonders if this tension can be escaped .

WASHINGTON  A day after releasing a set of Bush administration opinions that claimed sweeping presidential powers in fighting terrorism , the Obama administration faced new pressure on Tuesday to support a broad inquiry into interrogation , detention , surveillance and other practices under President George W. Bush .
Justice Department officials said they might soon release additional opinions on those subjects .
But the disclosure of the nine formerly secret documents fueled calls by lawmakers for an independent commission to investigate and make public what the Bush administration did in the global campaign against terrorism .
The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , Representative John Conyers Jr. , Democrat of Michigan , said the revelations , together with the release of new information about the Central Intelligence Agency ’s destruction of 92 interrogation videotapes , had underscored the need for a commission that would have the power to subpoena documents and testimony .
Officials who discussed the process spoke on the condition of anonymity because memorandums still under review might involve classified information .
Among those that have not been disclosed but are believed to exist are a memorandum from the fall of 2001 justifying the National Security Agency ’s program of domestic surveillance without warrants and one from the summer of 2002 that listed specific harsh interrogation techniques , including waterboarding , that the C.I.A. was authorized to use .
YAOUNDE , Cameroon ( AP )  Pope Benedict XVI said on his way to Africa Tuesday that condoms were not the answer in the continent 's fight against HIV , his first explicit statement on an issue that has divided even clergy working with AIDS patients .
Benedict arrived in Yaounde , Cameroon 's capital , Tuesday afternoon to a crowd of flag - waving faithful and snapping cameras .
The visit is his first pilgrimage as pontiff to the African continent .
Benedict had never directly addressed condom use , though his position is not new .
His predecessor , Pope John Paul II , often said that sexual abstinence — not condoms — was the best way to prevent the spread of the disease .
Benedict said that the Roman Catholic Church is in the forefront of the battle against AIDS .
" You ca n't resolve it with the distribution of condoms , " the pope told reporters aboard the Alitalia plane headed to Yaounde .
" On the contrary , it increases the problem . "
The pope said that a responsible and moral attitude toward sex would help fight the disease .
About 22 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are infected with HIV , according to UNAIDS .
In 2007 , three - quarters of all AIDS deaths worldwide were there , as well as two - thirds of all people living with HIV .
Rebecca Hodes with the Treatment Action Campaign in South Africa said if the pope is serious about preventing new HIV infections , he will focus on promoting wide access to condoms and spreading information on how best to use them .
" Instead , his opposition to condoms conveys that religious dogma is more important to him than the lives of Africans , " said Hodes , director of policy , communication and research for the action campaign .
While she said the pope is correct that condoms are not the sole solution to Africa 's AIDS epidemic , she said they are one of the very few HIV prevention mechanisms proven to work .
Even some priests and nuns working with those living with HIV / AIDS question the church 's opposition to condoms amid the pandemic ravaging Africa .
The Roman Catholic Church rejects the use of condoms as part of its overall teaching against artificial contraception .
Senior Vatican officials have advocated fidelity in marriage and abstinence from premarital sex as key weapons in the fight against AIDS .
The late Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo made headlines in 2003 for saying that condoms may help spread AIDS through a false sense of security , claiming they were n't effective in blocking transmission of the virus .
The cardinal , who died last year , headed the Vatican 's Pontifical Council for the Family .
Benedict 's African trip this week will also take him to Angola .
Benedict was met by a crowd of photographers and cameras as he stepped off the plane after ground crews struggled to place the aircraft 's mobile staircase .
Temperatures on the ground were 88 degrees Fahrenheit ( 31 Celsius ) with high humidity .
The pope was greeted at the airport by Cameroon 's President Paul Biya who has ruled since 1982 , and whose government was accused in a recent Amnesty International report of a long list of abuses to crush political opponents .
The pope made no specific reference to the situation in Cameroon , but he did say in general remarks on Africa that " a Christian can never remain silent " in the face of violence , poverty , hunger , corruption or abuse of power .
" The saving message of the Gospel needs to be proclaimed loud and clear so that the light of Christ can shine into the darkness of people 's lives , " he said in arrival remarks as the president and other political leaders looked on .
Africa is the fastest - growing region for the Roman Catholic Church , though it competes with Islam and evangelical churches .
The pope also said Tuesday that he intends to make an appeal for " international solidarity " for Africa in the face of the global economic downturn .
He said that while the church does not propose specific economic solutions , it can give " spiritual and moral " suggestions .
Describing the current crisis as the consequence of " a deficit of ethics in economic structures , " the pope said : " It is here that the church can make a contribution . "
On the plane , Benedict also dismissed the notion that he was facing increasing opposition and isolation within the church , particularly after an outreach to ultraconservatives that led to his lifting the excommunication of a Holocaust - denying bishop .
" The myth of my solitude makes me laugh , " the pope said , adding that he can count on a network of friends and aides whom he sees every day .
In a letter to Catholic bishops released last week , the pope made an unusual public acknowledgment of Vatican mistakes and turmoil in his church over the rehabilitation of Bishop Richard Williamson .
While acknowledging mistakes were made in handling the affair , Benedict said he was saddened that he was criticized " with open hostility " even by those who should have known better .

BARRIE – City police and Camp Borden officers are discussing using joint street patrols to help keep the peace in Barrie 's busy entertainment district on peak weekends .
Teaming up with military police to patrol the bar zone is a concept " we would n't have any real problems with , " Barrie chief Wayne Frechette said in an interview .
" Would extra bodies help us ?
Sure . "
According to its website , CFB Borden trains some 15,000 recruits annually and is staffed by 3,250 military and 1,500 civilians .
Frechette said soldiers from the base do n't pose a big problem in Barrie bars and restaurants , but he agreed the sight of military police on foot patrol might help curb rowdyism .
" I think ( soldiers ) would be less inclined to cause trouble if they knew it would come up with their bosses on Monday morning , " the chief said .
The military police would deal only with their own personnel and not civilians in Barrie , he said .
CFB Borden spokesperson Lt. Jennie Jones confirmed that the idea of joint patrols was suggested last month by a Barrie staff sergeant .
" We 're looking at it , but it is too preliminary to comment further , " she said .
One benefit would be to cement the base 's partnership with Barrie police while recognizing their very separate jurisdictions , Jones said .
Barrie officers and military police have teamed up in the past when the situation called for it , she said , such as when a break - in occurred at the local armoury last fall .
Base Borden is located in Angus , about 25 kilometres to the southwest .
As the largest nearby city , Barrie is a popular drinking and dining spot for soldiers on weekend passes .

Joshua Abel , a bartender at Manhattans in downtown Barrie , said he has not heard of troublemaking by military personnel .
On the other hand " if they are in civilian clothes , how would you know whether they were in the military , " he said .
Today , my crush came over and we began to fool around .
He started to kiss my stomach , and just when I was getting into it , he pulled away with a disgusted look on his face , wiped his mouth , and said , " We 'll continue this when you get rid of all your bellybutton lint . "

Irish boffins believe they may be able to save us all from the scourge of cowfart - induced ecological catastrophe , according to reports .
It seems that adding fish oil to the parping bovine planet - wreckers ' diet can reduce their methane emissions .
As any fule kno , methane ( CH 4 ) - produced in the guts of various animals including cows and humans , and emitted by means of the trouser cough - is a hugely more potent greenhouse gas than CO 2 , being some twenty times as effective at trapping heat within the atmosphere .
Cattle in particular are so flatulent , and produce so much methane , that there have been calls to limit their numbers for the sake of the planet - despite the impact this would have on the availability of cheeseburgers etc .
But there may be no need for all that , says Dr Lorraine Lillis of University College Dublin .
She and her team of top Irish guff boffins have recently carried out a trial in which three cows were fed a special diet including fish oil rich in omega - 3 fatty acids , and had their noxious bottomnal emissions sequestered for analysis .
The special fish - fuelled cow farts , according to Lillis , contained 21 per cent less methane than everyday bovine flatulence products .
" The fish oil affects the methane - producing bacteria in the rumen part of the cow 's gut , leading to reduced emissions , " said Lillis , speaking at a microbiology conference in Harrogate today .
" Understanding which microbial species are particularly influenced by changes in diet and relating them to methane production could bring about a more targeted approach to reducing methane emissions in animals . "
However , simply using fish oil as in the trial might be a bit troublesome .
" Fish oil is expensive and difficult to get , " Lillis admitted to LiveScience .
Commercial scale bovine guff - buster diet supplements might have to use other sources of omega - 3 , or risk being too expensive and perhaps encouraging the ongoing worldwide decimation of fish stocks .
When it was revealed recently that human bottom - belch emissions were an eco hazard on a par with Googling - considered by some to be highly damaging ecologically - it became clear that the human race is also part of the problem here .
We are farting ourselves towards extinction .
We at the Reg naturally called at the time for the immediate development of automated , in - pant flare stack technology .
This would free humanity from the mindless and occasionally painful drudgery of burning off our farts in order to offset our compulsive Googling , leaving of TVs on standby etc .
( One methane molecule , when burnt , yields one of CO 2 and some water vapour , reducing its ecological burden by 95 per cent : failing to light your farts is incredibly environmentally irresponsible . )
If the new Irish fish oil fart - squelching technology should fail , it will clearly be time for every cow to be fitted with some type of buttock mounted guff - blast detonator kit , or possibly a storage tank allowing the noxious emissions to be burned later as fuel in fart - propelled cars or something . ®
PROPOSAL : fold keyword
Hi ,
This is a proposal for adding a simple " fold " operation on Collections .
It is in a very draft state IMO , and perhaps it was already discussed in the process of adding closures to the language .
Here I send it to you , nevertheless .
Regards , Gabriel PROJECT COIN SMALL LANGUAGE CHANGE PROPOSAL FORM v1.0 AUTHOR ( S ) : Gabriel Belingueres OVERVIEW
Provide a " fold " sentence to Java for non trivial iterations over Collections .
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)
FEATURE SUMMARY : Add the ability to support a form of " advanced for statement " , to capture typical collection iteration patterns involving tests on some condition to break the iteration , or calculating a single value from the collection elements , assigning a default value when the collection is empty .
The new " fold " keyword acts like a sugared , moderately complex enhanced for keyword that abstract this typical processing on collections .
MAJOR ADVANTAGE : Makes the coding of not so trivial operations on collections more readable .
MAJOR BENEFIT : Readability : Makes clearer the intention of the programmer when iterating over a collection to perform those typical but non trivial iterations .
MAJOR DISADVANTAGE : Some increased implementation and testing complexity for the compiler .
Add a new keyword for the language " fold " .
ALTERNATIVES :
There are some free libraries like Apache 's common-collection that helps in abstracting some aspects of complex collection iteration , however this library in particular is targeted for older java versions with no support for generics ( others may do though ) .
Libraries would need to pass the body of the for loop as an object , requiring to create an anonymous class , or making use of reflection to call the appropriate statements as if it where the body of the loop , making the implementation either less readable or less efficient , respectively .
The full fledged alternative would be to add closures to Java ( but closures seems to be not targeted for Java 7 AFAIK . )
EXAMPLES SIMPLE EXAMPLE : List < Integer > list = ArrayList < Integer >( ) ; l.add ( ... ) ; // sum all numbers in the list Integer sum = fold ( Integer n : list ; // iterating collection element n Integer result = 0 ) { //
Where to accumulate the result , and the initial value result += n ; } ; System.out.println(sum ) ; ADVANCED EXAMPLES : // returns true if all salaries of the employee collection are lower than 1000 or the collection is empty .
List < Employee > emps = .... ; Boolean allLower = fold ( Employee emp : emps ; Boolean result = Boolean .
TRUE ; !result ) { // break condition : must be a boolean expression result = ( emp.getSalary ( ).compareTo( new BigDecimal ( 1000 ) < 0 ) ; } // returns a new collection with the salaries of the employees not on vacation List < Employee > emps = ... ; List < BigDecimal > salaries = fold ( Employee e : emps ; List < BigDecimal > newList = new ArrayList < BigDecimal >( ) ) { if ( !
e.onVacation ( ) ) { newList.add(e.getSalary ( ) ) ; } } // returns the first N employees whose sum of salaries are lower than 1000000 List < Employee > emps = ... ; BigDecimal sum = BigDecimal .ZERO ; // sum the salaries List < Employee > selected Emps = fold ( Employee e : emps ; List < Employee > result = new ArrayList < Employee >( ) ; sum.add(e.getSalary ( ) ).compareTo( new BigDecimal ( 1000000 ) ) < 0 ) { result.add(e ) ; sum = sum.add(e.getSalary ( ) ) ; } ; DETAILS SPECIFICATION :
The following is somewhat informal , making emphasis in this draft document on the main idea instead of in formal grammar and JLS issues .
SYNTAX : foldStatement : fold ( VariableModifiers_opt Type Identifier : Expression ; LocalVariableDeclaration ; Expression_opt ) Statement
The first part is similar to what is required for the enhanced " for " keyword .
The second part is a variable declaration that MUST be initialized with the value returned when the collection is empty .
( It seems to me that it does n't make any sense if the variable is declared " final " .
)
Should be limited in scope to the fold body ( to align the behavior with the for keyword ) .
The third part is an optional boolean expression which acts as a break condition .
The fold returns an object that is to be assignable from the same static type declared in the second part , which can be assigned to a variable or used as an expression .
The behavior when the collection is null , or in the presence of exceptions should follow the same criteria than the enhanced for loop .
COMPILATION : Here are desugarings to currently legal Java source for the two examples above : // simple example Integer sum ; { // new scope for synthetic variables Integer $ result = 0 ; if ( !list.isEmpty ( ) ) { // NPE if collection is null for ( Integer n : list ) { $ result += n ; } } sum = $ result ; } // first advanced example ( with break condition ) Boolean allLower ; { // new scope for synthetic variables Boolean $ result = Boolean .
TRUE ; if ( !emps.isEmpty ( ) ) { // NPE if collection is null for ( Employee e : emps ) { if (!
$ result ) break ; $ result = ( emp.getSalary ( ) .compareTo( new BigDecimal ( 1000 ) ) ; } } allLower = $ result ; } TESTING : Generating various simple and complex uses of the new structure and verifying the proper execution results ; combinations to test include fold statements with and without break conditions , tests with specific collection types such as Lists , Sets , Maps .
Can expand on the enhanced for tests for further testing .
LIBRARY SUPPORT :
The same libraries that needs to be supported by the enhanced for loop .
REFLECTIVE APIS : None of core reflection , javax.lang.model.* , the doclet API , and JDPA model statements ; therefore , they are unaffected ( AFAIK ) .
The tree API in javac , does model statements , but maybe we can adapt the existing API for enhanced for statements .
OTHER CHANGES : No .
MIGRATION : Look for collection iterations with nested break conditions or element processing returning a single value .
COMPATIBILITY BREAKING CHANGES :
All existing programs remain valid .
EXISTING PROGRAMS :
The semantics of existing class files and legal source files are unchanged by this feature .
REFERENCES EXISTING
BUGS : None that I know about ( doing a quick search on the bug database . )

The series included space ships , vehicles , lunar bases , even a monorail .
30 years later , LEGO fans have set up a site to celebrate the retro-cool of those sets , called Neo Classic Space .
Neo Classic Space ( sometimes also called Classic Space 2.0 ) is an attempt to recreate the excitement of those early years .
LEGO fans around the world have built new models , borrowing the style and colour schemes of those early sets , but using newer parts and building techniques to add more detail and realism .
March 2009 sees the 30th anniversary of Legoland Space , so to celebrate we are running a special event for the month of March .
We 've asked some fantastic LEGO builders from around the world to create commemerative models .
Each day in March we plan to present a new model .
The response so far has been amazing , and we have some fantastic models coming up during the month .
They 're just past halfway through the celebration , and there are some wonderful builds on the site .
My favorite may be the LEGO recreation of the starfighter from the Buck Rogers TV show .

As the world recovers from the onslaught of the Watchmen movie and its omnipresent marketing campaign , the spotlight has yet again come on to Alan Moore – its comic book creator , guru of the graphic novel and mystical man of mystery .
And yet again , the spotlight has been desperately sweeping the stage only to find he has n't turned up .
He'd be easy to spot if he did – a giant of a man , always dressed in black , with formidable facial hair and large rings on every finger – but he 's the archetypal reclusive writer .
Amid the chatter of debate on the merits or otherwise of Hollywood 's rendition of what is generally agreed to be " the greatest comic - book story ever " , Moore has maintained his usual dignified silence and stayed put in his hometown of Northampton .
On the day I spoke to him , he had already turned down a profile in Time magazine and an interview with CNN , stating that he was busy preparing for a forthcoming benefit gig at the Frog and Fiddler , a local pub .
" I am aware of the immense power of absence , " he says .
" I 'm not being completely disingenuous here .
Of course I 'm aware it does n't hurt my reputation , but I 'm not playing hard to get as some publicity ploy .
I 'm genuinely busy with stuff that is really important to me . "
Nobody quite believes
Moore when he says he does n't care about the movies made of his work .
For most writers of any shade , a big - budget Hollywood adaptation of their work is a form of validation , not to mention a pension fund , but Moore puts his money where his mouth is – or rather is n't .
He has had his name removed from anything to do with the Watchmen movie .
He 's also demanded that his share of any profits from it go to Dave Gibbons , the original artist of the comic book ( who has co-operated with the movie production ) .
Assuming there are any profits , that is .
Despite being expensively made and exhaustively hyped , the movie has not taken the box office by storm .
It adheres to the comic with slavish reverence , transcribing whole chunks of dialogue verbatim , and using the pages as a storyboard for the expensive cinematography and production design .
As a comic , Watchmen was a cultural event , " the moment comics grew up " ; as a movie , it 's a star - free , 18 - certificate proposition with a labyrinthine plot , silly costumes and offputting levels of violence .
All of which only goes to prove Moore 's long - held contention that it is impossible to make movies out of his work .
" There is something about the quality of comics that makes things possible that you could n't do in any other medium , " he says , with just a hint of the exasperated schoolteacher .
" Things that we did in Watchmen on paper could be frankly horrible or sensationalist or unpleasant if you were to interpret them literally through the medium of cinema .
When it 's just lines on paper , the reader is in control of the experience – it's a tableau vivant .
And that gives it the necessary distance .
It 's not the same when you 're being dragged through it at 24 frames per second . "
Just as he distanced himself from other movies based on his works – V for Vendetta ( a vigilante saga set in an Orwellian Britain ) , The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen ( a superhero team of characters from Victorian literature ) , and From Hell ( a Jack the Ripper story starring Johnny Depp ) , none of which achieved any significant commercial or creative success – Moore has n't watched Watchmen .
He feels , he says , " emotionally distanced " from it now , and does n't even have a copy in the house .
Nor is he attached to any of the other titles he no longer owns the rights to , which is most of them .
In fact , he says he 's pretty much done with comic books altogether .
Moore 's career has been marked by disputes and fallings - out , largely due to issues of artistic integrity and perceived injustices .
He rose to prominence in the early 1980s , when he was recruited by America 's DC Comics ( home of Superman and Batman ) , having established himself on British titles such as 2000 AD and Warrior .
He reinvigorated a minor DC title , Swamp
Thing – a sort of sentient bog monster – with his now - familiar penchant for supernatural mysticism , psychedelic prose and adult characterisation .
That led to Watchmen , and opened the floodgates for other British writers , such as Neil Gaiman and Grant Morrison , who largely operated in the " mature reader " territory Moore conquered .
His relationship with DC deteriorated over issues such as rights and merchandising , however , and in 1999 he founded his own company , America 's Best Comics ( ABC ) , where he simultaneously wrote five titles , including League of Extraordinary Gentlemen .
But a few years later , ABC 's parent company , Wildstorm , was acquired by his arch - enemies DC , whom he now likens to " a rich stalker - girlfriend " .
" Much as I love the medium , I despise the industry , " he says .
" I 've always despised it to a certain degree but after this last few years and all this nonsense with the films , I believe it to be a completely poisonous place that is n't really going anywhere .
I did once feel I was part of a movement that wanted to change comics into something was valuable to culture , but I do n't really feel that kinship in the way I used to . "
The Watchmen movie was the final straw .
From his point of view , which he explains in great detail , various executives at DC ( which is owned by Time Warner , co-producers of the Watchmen movie ) tried to manipulate him and attempted to sneak out Watchmen - related products behind his back , using artist Dave Gibbons as a " messenger " , and even exploiting the fact of his best friend 's brother 's terminal illness to exert pressure on him .
" At that point , I decided I did n't want anybody at DC to ever contact me again .
That was what made me curse this wretched film and everything connected with it . "
Moore can at least be assured that his most recent comic book epic will not be made into a movie .
Lost Girls is a 320 - page , three - volume work of pornography , illustrated by Melinda Gebbie , a veteran of the San Francisco underground and also his wife .
In its own way , Lost Girls is as pioneering as Watchmen , albeit more difficult to read on public transport without getting strange glances .
" Most pornography is simply horrible , and not just from a woman 's perspective , " Moore says .
" We felt we could reclaim and redefine what pornography was , and we deliberately chose to use that word .
We did n't want to hide behind ' erotica ' – because it 's not etymologically accurate for one thing , and I 'm very fussy about that kind of stuff , and there 's a class element to it .
Pornos graphos – drawings or writings of wantons – that will do . "
Again , Lost Girls demonstrates what comics can do that movies can't – or at least should n't .
The story centres on three fictional women – Lewis Carroll 's Alice , Peter Pan 's Wendy and Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz , whose sexual exploits at an Austrian hotel it details with a mix of Carry On - style humour and De Sadean exhaustiveness .
Wendy gets it on with the Lost Boys , Dorothy gets it on with the Tin Man , everyone gets it on with everyone , in fact .
There are polysexual orgies , incest , bestiality , semi- pubescent sex – polite softcore it is not .
But in a country that 's still only comfortable acknowledging bad literary sex , the shamelessness is utterly refreshing , even – dare anyone ever admit it – arousing .
As always with Moore , he 's done his homework , ( including Simone de Beauvoir , Angela Carter and feminist critiques of pornography ) , and Lost Girls takes in the history of sexual literature , the impact of modernism , war , sexual repression and the ethics of the imagination .
And even if Gebbie 's illustrations leave very little to that imagination , they 're dreamy and sensual rather than cold and anatomical .
" There is a moral agenda in it .
Put simply , it 's ' make love , not war ' but it goes a bit further than that .
I think if we had a better relationship with our sexual imaginations , there would be a lot less sex crime – and a lot less directed at children . "
Moore is n't entirely done with comics – there 's a new trio of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen stories coming soon – but he 's keeping busy elsewhere .
A practising magician ( the occult kind , not the Paul Daniels variety ) , he 's been working on the Moon and Serpent Bumper Book of Magic – a history of the subject presented as a children 's annual , with none of " that creepy gothic shit " that hangs around modern - day views of the subject .
There 's also a 750,000 - word novel , which he expects to complete in a couple of years ' time .
Entitled Jerusalem , it follows on from his 1996 novel Voice of the Fire , a collection of short stories set in Northampton over 6,000 years .
" I 'm trying to tell the story of the neighbourhood I grew up in – much smaller than the area I covered in my first book , which was paradoxically a lot slimmer .
Whether my third novel is going to be a couple of million pages long and will be set just in this end of the living room I do n't know .
It 's a possibility . "
In entirely appropriate defiance of physical laws , Moore 's world seems to be expanding and contracting simultaneously .
As his career has progressed , he has homed in ever closer on his immediate landscape , while roving further across history , literature and human consciousness – usually right out to the edges .
In the process , his work has become ever more inimitable and unclassifiable : a rich blend of fantasy , psychogeography , folklore , occult mysticism , baroque prose , down - to - earth humour , social critique and literary criticism .
He surely merits his own adjective .
Moorean ?
Mooreish ?
" To me , all creativity is magic , " he says .
" Ideas start out in the empty void of your head – and they end up as a material thing , like a book you can hold in your hand .
That is the magical process .
It 's an alchemical thing .
Yes , we do get the gold out of it but that 's not the most important thing .
It 's the work itself .
That 's the reward .
That 's better than money . "
The single - volume hardcover edition of Lost Girls will be published in May .
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Volume III , Book One is out in April , both from Top Shelf productions .
Single - celled slime molds demonstrate the ability to memorize and anticipate repeated events , a team of Japanese researchers reported in January .
The study [ pdf ] clearly shows “ a primitive version of brain function ” in an organism with no brain at all .
In their experiment , biophysicist Toshiyuki Nakagaki of Hokkaido University and colleagues manipulated the environment of Physarum slime - mold amoebas ( near right ) .
As the cells crawled across an agar plate , the researchers subjected them to cold , dry conditions for the first 10 minutes of every hour .
During these cool spells , the cells slowed down their motion .
After three cold snaps the scientists stopped changing the temperature and humidity and watched to see whether the amoebas had learned the pattern .
Sure enough , many of the cells throttled back right on the hour in anticipation of another bout of cold weather .
When conditions stayed stable for a while , the slime - mold amoebas gave up on their hourly braking , but when another single jolt of cold was applied , they resumed the behavior and correctly recalled the 60 - minute interval .
The amoebas were also able to respond to other intervals , ranging from 30 to 90 minutes .
The scientists point out that catching on to temporal patterns is no mean feat , even for humans .
For a single cell to show such a learning ability is impressive , though Nakagaki admits he was not entirely surprised by the results .
After working with the slime mold for years , he had a hunch that “ Physarum could be cleverer than expected . ”
The findings of what lone cells are capable of “ might be a chance to reconsider what intelligence is , ” he says .
Pro-Israel and conservative blogs have been all over the story of CNN peddling a bit of Hamas theater today .
As you watch this video , take a good look at the supposed “ victim ” and the medical treatment he receives .
After the uproar erupted , CNN pulled the video from its servers , without a word of explanation .
Following the links provided on many of the blogs led you to a CNN video player page with the simple notice that this video was “ no longer available . ”
Now , more 12 hours later , even the empty video page is gone .
Now , the link takes you to a text - only story with no evidence that a video ever existed .
So , the video was questionable enough that it had to be removed , but the story supporting the fradulent video stays ?
That ’s not bad journalism , that ’s out and out propaganda .
And still not a peep from “ the most trusted name in news . ”
UPDATE !
CNN doubles down on deceit .
I love this explanation :
Responding to accusations that the resuscitation efforts of Mashharawi ’s brother appeared inauthentic , Martin said that , based on his years of reporting from Gaza , doctors often go through such efforts even with little hope that a patient can be saved .
So , if there ’s little hope that someone can be saved , you do chest compressions on the kid ’s stomach ?
Also watch the video again and focus on the damage allegedly caused by an Israeli missile launched from a drone .
The only missiles capable of being launched from a drone are Hellfire missiles .
Is there any doubt that a Hellfire missile would ’ve caused much more damage — including flattening the entire home ?
CNN brings new meaning to the term “ useful idiot . ”
Who are you going to trust ?
The “ most trusted name in news ” or your lying eyes ?

Sorry , there are no polls available at the moment .
The Foretich house in Mississippi 1 in 4 mortgages underwater
Almost 25 % of homeowners , or 10.7 million borrowers , were " underwater " on their mortgages during the third quarter , according to First American CoreLogic .
Another 2.3 million are near that drowning point , where you owe more on your loan than your home is worth .
A basic cost - benefit analysis predicts that these people will abandon their homes and accept foreclosure .
But there is little data measuring whether that logic holds true .
In fact , Eric Johnson , a business professor at Columbia University , believes it does n't .
After years of studying behavioral economics - essentially the economics of choice - he argues that people will simply not make such rational decisions .
" There are two effects that suggest [ walk aways ] wo n't happen so easily , " he says .
" The first is the endowment effect .
People tend to value their own house above its market price .
Owners do n't want to sell at a loss .
They have what we call a loss aversion .
"
The second is that people weigh the importance of immediate outcomes more heavily than long - term effects .
Walking away involves upfront expenditures of time , money and effort , while the benefits of walking away are back - loaded .
" People are impatient and weight present costs and benefits more , so they will walk away less often than we might think , " Johnson says .
In the following pages are some homeowners who have thought hard about the costs and benefits of walking away from their mortgages .
Twenty years ago today — at 12:04 AM on March 24th , 1989 — the Exxon Valdez tanker struck Bligh reef in Prince William Sound causing 10.8 million gallons of crude oil to spill into the sea .
The spill decimated the ecosystem and wildlife for 11,000 square miles and became one of the world ’s most infamous oil spills .
Twenty years later , researchers say that several bird species have yet to recover from the spill .
“ Analysis of the oil spills ’ impacts found that a significant portion of several species ’ populations were killed , including 5 - 10 percent of the world ’s Kittlitz ’s Murrelet population and 6 - 12 percent of the area ’s population of the Marbled Murrelet , ” said Dr. Michael Fry , director of Conservation Advocacy at American Bird Conservancy ( ABC ) .
“ We are concerned about a number of the bird species harmed in the catastrophe such as the Kittlitz ’s Murrelet whose population has yet to rebound . ”

According to ABC , Kittlitz ’s Murrelet ’s population plummeted 99 percent from 1972 to 2004 .
Since the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 the rate of decline went from 18 percent to 31 percent .
Researchers also believe that climate change is negatively affecting the species .
Two other bird species , the Pigeon Guillemot and the Marbled Murrelet , have not seen significant recovery in the Prince William Sound .
In fact , the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council has found that leaked oil can still be found in the Sound .
Given its slow rate of dissolving , the oil may persist for decades , even centuries .
“ Twenty years after the Exxon Valdez spill , oil still poses a grave threat to marine bird , ” said Dr. Fry .
“ American Bird Conservancy would like to see an acceleration of the phase out of single hulled tankers in the U.S. which are allowed until 2015 .
A similar requirement for double - hulled tankers needs to be made globally to protect birds and other wildlife from future spills .
Additional marine reserves and no - go zones for tankers during sensitive breeding and staging seasons should also be implemented to protect the most vulnerable species . ”
Oil spills are not past occurences .
On March 13th , 250 tons of oil spilled off Australia ’s northeast coast , blanketing local beaches and killing wildlife .
It has been called one of the worst environmental distasters in Queenland ’s history .

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service program restores bird habitat on farms and ranches
( 10/28/2008 )
Matt Filsinger is driving his white pickup headed northeast from Sterling to look at two of his projects .
This self - described introvert speaks enthusiastically about his job .
“ Ducks , ducks , ducks – that ’s what I love ! ” says Filsinger , grinning broadly .
Filsinger is a wildlife biologist with the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service .
He works with private landowners to set aside land and create attractive habitat for imperiled species .
Specifically , he designs wetlands to attract waterfowl .
Partners for Fish and Wildlife is a successful program that has been around since 1987 .
Landowners , including farmers and ranchers , form partnerships with the program because they reap a variety of benefits from it .
Nonprofit organizations such as Ducks Unlimited , Audubon and the Rocky Mountain Bird Observatory are also partners .
Collaboration between the federal government and private landowners is essential to preserving habitat and species , as 73 percent of the country ’s land is privately owned , and most wildlife lives on that land .
Birds face higher risk of extinction than conventionally thought
( 07/14/2008 )
Birds may face higher risk of extinction than conventionally thought , says a bird ecology and conservation expert from Stanford University .
Dr. Cagan H. Sekercioglu , a senior research scientist at Stanford and head of the world ’s largest tropical bird radio tracking project , estimates that 15 percent of world ’s 10,000 bird species will go extinct or be committed to extinction by 2100 if necessary conservation measures are not taken .
While birds are one of the least threatened of any major group of organisms , Sekercioglu believes that worst - case climate change , habitat loss , and other factors could conspire to double this proportion by the end of the century .
As dire as this sounds , Sekercioglu says that many threatened birds are rarer than we think and nearly 80 percent of land birds predicted to go extinct from climate change are not currently considered threatened with extinction , suggesting that species loss may be far worse than previously imagined .
At particular risk are marine species and specialists in mountain habitats .
Sensation , perception and computation
There ’s often seen to be a fight between symbolic AI and artificial neural networks ( ANNs ) .
The difference is between either modeling either within the grammar of a language , or through training of a network of connections between cells .
Both approaches have pros and cons , and you generally pick the approach that you think will serve you best .
If you ’re writing a database backed website you ’ll probably use symbolic computation in general , although it ’s possible that you ’ll use an ANN in something like a recommendation system .
There is a third approach though , one I ’ve fallen in love with and which unifies the other two .
It ’s really simple , too — it ’s geometry .
Of course people use geometry in their software all the time , but the point is that if you see geometry as a way of modeling things , distinct from symbols and networks , then everything becomes beautiful and simple and unified .
Well , maybe a little .
Here ’s an example .
I ’m eating my lunch , and take a bite .
Thousands of sensors on my tongue , my mouth and my nose measure various specialised properties of the food .
Each sensor contributes its own dimension to the data sent towards the brain .
This is mixed in with information from other modalities — for example sight and sound are also known to influence taste .
You end up having to process tens of thousands of data measurements , producing datapoints existing in tens of thousands of dimensions .
Ouch .
Somehow all these dimensions are boiled down into just a few dimensions , e.g. bitterness , saltiness , sweetness , sourness , sweetness and umami .
This is where models such as artificial neural networks thrive , in constructing low dimensional perception out of high dimensional mess .
The boiled - down dimensions of bitterness and saltiness exist in low dimensional geometry , where distance has meaning as dissimilarity .
For example it ’s easy to imagine placing a bunch of foods along a saltiness scale , and comparing them accordingly .
This makes perfect sense — we know olives are saltier than satsumas not because we ’ve learned and stored that as a symbolic relation , but because we ’ve experienced their taste in the geometrical space of perception , and can compare our memories of the foods within that space ( percepts as concepts , aha ! ) .
So that ’s the jump from the high dimensional jumble of a neural network to a low dimensional , meaningful space of geometry .
The next jump is via shape .
We can say a particular kind of taste exists as a shape in low dimensional space .
For example the archetypal taste of apple is the combination of particular sweetness , sourness , saltiness etc .
Some apples are sharper than others , and so you get a range of values along each such dimension accordingly , forming a shape in that geometry .
So there we have it — three ways of representing an apple , either symbolically with the word “ apple ” , as a taste within the geometry of perception , or in the high dimensional jumble of sensory input .
These are complimentary levels of representation — if we want to remember to buy an apple we ’ll just write down the word , and if we want to compare two apples we ’ll do it using a geometrical dimension — “ this apple is a bit sweeter than that one ” .
Well I think I ’m treading a tightrope here between stating the obvious and being completely nonsensical , I ’d be interested in hearing which way you think I ’m falling .
But I think this stuff is somehow really important for programmers to think about — how does your symbolic computation relate to the geometry of perception ?
I ’ll try to relate this to computer music in a later blog post …
If you want to read more about this way of representing things , then please read Conceptual Spaces by Peter Gärdenfors , an excellent book which has much more detail than the summary here …

I THINK THAT EACH AND every DM has one stupid problem that goes undetected for years , well , at least 1 , honestly we all probably have many , but there is usually at least one , that when you find out about it then it makes you feel really dumb .
My problem was the Surprise Roll .
I just never understood it !
I do n’t know if it just was n’t described clearly enough in my books , or just what the problem was , but I did it incorrectly for years .
Today ’s post is about Ambushes , and how to run them fairly , but of course the biggest element of an ambush is that the ambusher gain the element of surprise .
Surprise Rolls
To check for surprise , we as the DM , have to first determine a number of factors .
First we have to figure out how far away the monster is , and second , we have to roll a 1d10 , an unmodified check is 1 - 3 on a 1d10 , thus surprise happens less then half of the time , when enemies bump into each other , but some creatures have a bonus , or a penalty to their surprise roll .
Lets take a gator as an example : Alligator ’s are masters of ambushing .
They pick lairs where it is easy to hide , typically swamp water with lots of cover .
They always impose a – 4 to surprise rolls ,
This means that the gator can surprise the PC on a roll of 7 or below .
At the same time , alligators are very hard to surprise , the average person is incapable of such a feet !
We know this because the gator ’s – 4 also works in its favor , and is used to determine if the adventurer surprises it , thus even if we roll a 1 on our surprise roll ( 1d10 ) the gator still is n’t going to be surprised .
There are , of course , modifiers such as being invisible , or what the weather is doing , which you can find in the DMG .
Being suspicious helps a bit , but you have to be suspicious of a specific spot in order to benefit from the bonus .
A major factor in gaining surprise is DEX .
Those with high Dexterity are much harder to surprise , and it may be impossible for them to be ( DEX of 18 are only surprised on a 1 ) , while those with low DEX scores are very very easy ( DEX of 3 are always surprised on a 1 - 6 ) .
EFFECTS OF SURPRISE
Surprised characters get no attacks for one round .
They are totally off guard and vulnerable .
They get no AC bonus for high DEX , and their attacker also gains a + 1 to hit them !
The attacker ca n’t cast spells , but some monsters can use spell - like abilities , and the surprised persons all suffer a penalty to their saving throws , thus a monster like a Medusa could really do some damage to a party , all of the opponents did n’t expect her to be there , and their odds of stupidly looking at her dead on is very high !
We , as Dungeon Masters , must also consider what we can let the players and the monster get away with .
This is a judgment call !
And it probably will depend on the situation , but I know that I personally allow the use of magical treasure .
Say , a wizard has a wand ; I go ahead and let him use it , but this also means that I let monsters have full attacks , and what one can do , so can the other ; so enemy wizards with wands of their own get to use them as well , of course assuming that the casting time is instantaneous .
WHAT DOES THIS DO FOR AMBUSHES ?
Gaining a surprise is a definite element to properly ambushing other parties , but the difference is that ambushes are n’t determined randomly , these are always set up before hand , and it is totally up to you , as a DM , to decide if they are successful or not !
Of course this should work fairly consistently , PC characters can set up an ambush just as easily as enemy NPCs , so it will always be a judgment call as to if they are successful or not .
Advanced Dungeons & Dragons : 2nd Edition actually has two different rules for ambushes .
The original 2e method ( the PHB with the warrior on the horse ) says that ambushes are exactly the same as surprises , and are handled in that method , including the surprise roll at the beginning of the encounter .
But , when it came time to reprint the books ( the Black PHB with the warrior busting the door down ) , they changed this to a different method which I think works much better .
Ambushes give the attacker a bonus round of attacks , then surprise is checked , then the combat is ran normally .
Let ’s make an example :
The PCs are following a well used road , but are about to be ambushed by bandits .
There are 8 archers hiding in the woods , and 4 fighters pretending to be tired woodsmen walking towards the players .
The players can see the woodsmen but not the archers , but the plan is that once the PCs are in range , the archers are going to fire at them , the woodsman are going to yell “ Bandits ! ” and run towards the party and appear to be joining them for everybody ’s mutual protection , however once they get within melee range , they will be attacking as well .
This is a multi- layered ambush , and it will work because we said so .
( We are Dungeon Masters , hear us roar ! )
Thus , the archers get a free attack , all of them can shoot two arrows at the PC ’s before the second wave hits them , after firing their weapons , they ’ll drop them and grab their swords .
About this time , the PC ’s learn that the woodsmen are enemies , and they , the woodsmen , get a free attack !
Now we check for surprise .
There are over 10 members in the enemy party , so that is a +1 to the favor of the PC ’s ( surprised on a 1 or a 2 ) .
But , the enemy was camouflaged , pretending to be something that they were n’t , - 1 to - 3 depending on how the PC ’s reacted to it , lets say , to avoid arguments , that we totally snowed the players , and the attackers get a +3 ( Surprised on 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , or 5 ) , however , the party is now aware of their folly , and are either panicking or ready for an attack , again judging their reactions as players .
If they are panicking they are in trouble !
( Surprise on a roll of 7 or less ) but if they are ready , they get a – 2 ( Surprise on 3 or below ) .
Characters with High Dex can deduct their bonus from the Surprise Roll , thus a roll of 3 will still surprise their peers , but not them , they get to roll initiative and attack that round , but for everybody who is surprised , the ambushers get another free round to attack !
The woodsmen attack first , and then the archers armed with swords join the melee and also get a free attack before any initiative is ever rolled .
EFFECTS OF AN AMBUSH
An effective ambush also changes a few other rules .
An ambushing wizard can cast spells .
They are ready , and as long as they know that an enemy is approaching , and when they will be within range , they can go ahead and attempt to cast .
They may have to pass a WIS check to do it !
But they can still attempt to try , and the opponents saving - throw will be modified in the spell casters favor , receiving no bonuses for DEX and imposing the appropriate amount for surprise .
The first attack of an ambush will be done with an automatic + 1 bonus to hit , ignoring AC bonuses for high DEX , and continues if the party is still surprised on the following round .
Now keep in mind that depending on the time of day , and what the adventurers were doing all day , they might not be wearing their armors at all either !
Wo n't that be fun ?
PLANING AN AMBUSH
Naturally , forethought is needed to make an ambush work , and it might not !
It is completely up to the DM .
Characters may get mad and claim bizarre things to try and weasel their way out of the effects , but we have to plan for this too .
Thus , in order to make a successful ambush , it is probably best if we do n’t give them any reason to suspect anything , or add some form of misdirection so that the players themselves fall for it .
If the party has been fighting goblins all day , then the chances of them falling for an ambush could be so slim that they wo n’t fall for it .
But we can trick them into it , say by having 3 goblins act as bait :
The players see them , and if they give chase , they round the corner and are surprised by 10 goblin archers who pepper them with arrows .
But what we have to ask ourselves , as DM , is :
Is this truly an ambush , or is it just catching the party by surprise ?
Depending on the situation , we may get different answers for this .
If this was planned by the goblins , then it is an ambush , but if these 3 goblins just happened to turn the corner and warn the others that they are being followed , then it could just be a surprise .
The goblins do n’t really have any plan set up , now if they had set up a trap and given this encounter some forethought , THEN we have the elements of an ambush .
Thankfully there are n’t too many rules which dictates what is what , thus the over - all decision is ours to make .
Granted , we do n’t want to use ambushes every game , else they will lose their impact when we do plan them !
But we also want to make them beneficial to whoever is pulling it off .
Players can also utilize ambushes , but we need to judge when it will work , when it wo n’t , and if it really is an ambush or simply catching an opponent off guard .

Prolog in Python .
Version 1
Nature of a Prolog program With " normal " programming languages a program consists of statements telling the computer how to solve a problem step by step .
A Prolog program is different .
Facts and rules define the boundarys for a solution ( or set of solutions ) to queries issued by the user and Prolog searches for solutions automatically .
This will become clearer with some examples .
Suppose we have some facts about some relationships between people and some rules that let us infer more relationships .
Facts might be statements like " Bill is a boy " and " Bills mother is Alice " .
A rule might let us infer from these two statements that " Bill is Alice 's son " or that " Alice has children " .
In Prolog facts are represented in a syntax that will remind you of a function calls .
To indicate that Bill is a boy we would create the following " term " .
boy ( bill )
It would also be possible to use the term " bill ( boy ) " but that would n't be as useful because of the kind of questions we will want to ask .
It is also important to remember that " boy ( bill ) " is NOT a function call but simply a statement about a relation .
Also note that " bill " is not capitalized .
This is because Prolog generally uses capitalized words as variables and lowercase words as constants .
Bill is a constant just because Bill will always be Bill .
To represent the fact that Bill 's mother is Alice we could use the term mother ( alice , bill ) indicating the " mother " relationship between alice and bill , that is " alice is the mother of bill " .
It would be fine to write the term as " mother ( bill , alice ) " meaning " Bill 's mother is Alice " as long as we are consistent .
Prolog does not deduce any deep meaning from our facts and rules .
It just manipulates them to answer our questions .
Let 's stick with " boy ( bill ) " and " mother ( alice , bill ) " .
Now we can create a rule that means " If X is the mother of Y , then Y is the child of X " .
Here 's how such a rule might be written .
child ( X , Y ) :- mother ( Y , X ) where the " deep meaning " of child ( X , Y ) is " X is a child of Y " .
Notice that X and Y are captialized indicating they are variables .
Rules will generally have variables .
Also notice that the order is reversed from our " if " statement above .
The part to the left of the " :- " is called the head and the part to the right is the body whcih consists of one or more " goals " to be satisfied .
Here is another rule .
child ( X , Y ) :- father ( Y , X ) and finally son( X , Y ) :- child ( X , Y ) , boy ( X ) which says that X is the son of Y if X is the child of Y and X is a boy .
Notice that the body has two terms separated by a comma .
Both terms in the body must be satisfied to make the head term true .
A Prolog program consists of an ordered set of facts and rules in what is termed the " database " .
Let 's play with the program a bit before looking at the Python code .
? boy ( bill ) ? boy( frank ) ?
mother ( alice , bill )
Here we have entered three facts into the database .
Even now we can query them .
A query is simply a term followed by the ' ? ' mark . ? boy ( bob ) ? ? boy ( bill ) ?
Yes ? boy ( X ) ?
{' X ' : ' frank '} {'X ' : ' bill'} ? mother ( X , bill ) ?
{' X ' : ' alice '} ? mother ( alice , X ) ?
{' X ' : ' bill '} ? mother ( X , Y ) ? {'X ' : ' alice ' , ' Y ' : ' bill '} Asking if bob is a boy gave no response ( meaning No ) .
Asking if bill is a boy gives the answer " Yes " since the rule " boy ( bill ) " is in the database .
The query " boy ( X ) ? " means we want Prolog to find all values of X for which boy ( X ) is a fact in the database .
The query matches both " boy ( bill ) " and " boy ( frank ) " setting the variable X and reporting it for each .
Now look at all the questions we can ask about the single fact that alice is the mother of bill .
We can ask " Is anyone ( X ) bill 's mother ? " , " Is alice the mother of anyone ? " and even " Is anyone the mother of anyone else ? "
When variables are set they are displayed in a format that should be familiar .
You may have already guessed that our little Prolog interpreter stores variable settings in a Python dictionary , Next let 's add the two rules above and extend our querys .
? child ( J , K ) :- mother ( K , J ) ? so n ( X , Y ) :- child ( X , Y ) , boy ( X ) ? son( X, alice ) ?
{' X ' : ' bill '}
You might be wondering why I used variables " J " and " K " instead of " X " and " Y " .
Either is fine .
Like local variables in Python functions , the variables are local to the rule .
But a little later I want to walk through a query in detail without the confusion of separate variables with the same name .
Now let 's add some information about dads .
? child ( G, H ) :- father ( H , G ) ? father ( alex , bill ) ?
son( bill , X ) ?
{' X ' : ' alex'} {'X ' : ' alice'}
How it works
Let 's look more closely at how queries are processed in order to be ready to look at the Python code .
The first thing to do is to nail down some terminology .
Terms like " boy ( bill ) " consist of a predicate ( boy ) and one or more arguments ( bill ) .
Each argument can be ( for now ! ) a constant ( lower case ) or a variable ( capitalized ) .
A rule consists of a head term and a set of goal terms , each of which must be satisfied in order for the rule to succeed .
A query is a term matched against facts and rules in the database .
With the database as we have loaded it , the query " boy ( X ) ? " matches both " boy ( bill ) " and " boy ( frank ) " since X is a variable which can be set ( unified ) to either " bill " or " frank " .
In general two terms will match if their predicates match and each of their arguments match .
Arguments fail to match if they are different constants or variables set to different constants .
Unset variables are set by this matching process .
This unification process works in both directions ; as queries are applied to rules and as results are returned .
With the simple query " boy ( bill ) ? " a match was found without needing to set any variables .
As success is achieved , Prolog answers our query by showing how variables were set , or if no variables were set , simply with the word " yes " .
Let 's look a query in more detail .
The following is a tree diagram showing how one query will spawn subqueries with constraints imposed by unification .
The results of the query " son ( bill , A ) ? " will be " A=alice " and " A=alex " .
But let 's take it step by step .
We have a search tree and as we both descend and return ( ascend ) the tree , variables will be set through unification .
The goal " son ( bill , A ) " spawns a subgoal " son ( bill , Y ) :- child ( bill , Y ) , boy ( bill ) " where we have just set the variable X to bill .
Next " child ( bill , Y ) " will spawn " mother ( K , bill ) " and " father ( H , bill ) " , setting variables J and G. " mother ( K , bill ) " finds a solution , setting k to " alice " .
Now we ascend the tree , setting Y to " alice " and resuming the goal " son ( bill , Y ) :- child ( bill , alice ) , boy ( bill ) " to attack the second part " boy ( bill " .
This succeeds ( no variables set ) and we hit the top of the tree setting A to " alice " .
Then we descend again to find " alex " as a second answer to the query .
A look the code Having walked through a non trivial example , we 're now in a position to see how the two pages of code come together .
Click here to access the Python and perhaps get a printout .
Since I 'll refer to line numbers in the code it might be most convenient to have it in a text editor where navigation by line number is easy .
In the Python code terms and rules are represented by classes which really just hold their attributes .
They each support just two methods , an initializer to compile a string representation of the term or rule the __repr__ method to display it .
The Term and Rule Classes Let 's play with the Term class . >>> import prolog1 as prolog >>> a = prolog .
Term ( " mother ( alice , bill ) " ) >>> a mother ( alice , bill ) >>> a. pred ' mother ' >>> a.args [ ' alice ' , ' bill ' ]
Here the __init__ method ( line 16 ) has compiled the string " mother ( alice , bill ) " into a Term instance with a predicate and arguments .
These are represented by Python strings .
The __init__ method uses the ' split ' function in the string module to split fields on ' (' or ' , ' characters .
The input string has had all whitespace removed .
( line 64 ) Let 's try a compilation of a rule >>> b = prolog .
Rule ( " son ( X , Y ) : - mother ( Y , X ) , boy ( X ) " ) >>> b so n ( X , Y ) :- mother ( Y , X ) , boy ( X ) >>> b. head son( X , Y ) >>> b.goals [ mother ( Y , X ) , boy ( X ) ] >>>
A rule is made up of a head term and a list of goal terms .
In the __init__ function ( line 27 ) ' split ' is again used to cut up the pieces .
However re.sub first changes " son ( X , Y ) : - mother ( Y , X ) , boy ( X ) " to " son ( X , Y ) : - mother ( Y , X ) ; boy ( X ) " so that terms in the body can be easily split around the ' ;' character .
Let 's look at the ' unify ' function now ( line 92 ) .
' Unify ' takes four arguments ; a source term and environment , and a destination term and environment .
If unification is successful the destination environment may be updated .
Both environments are just dictionaries with variable bindings .
Unify will return 1 if successful , otherwise 0 .
The code should be straight forward , although it will not stay so simple in the later versions of our program as the definition of a term becomes more general .
Notice the use of the dictionary get method to try to resolve a variable in its own environment .
If the variable is not set , " get " will return None , which can indicate permission to set the variable .
>>> from prolog1 import * >>> unify ( Term ( " boy ( bill ) " ) , {} , Term ( " boy ( frank ) " ) , {} ) 0 >>> e = {} >>> unify ( Term ( " boy ( bill ) " ) , {} , Term ( " boy ( bill ) " ) , e ) 1 >>> e {}
Here we can see that different terms do not unify but two copies of the same term do .
Since there were no variables nothing was set in the destination environment 'e ' .
Let 's try something a little more complex . >>> e = {} >>> unify ( Term ( " boy ( bill ) " ) , {} , Term ( " boy ( X ) " ) , e ) 1 >>> e {'X ' : ' bill '}
This time the variable X is set in the destination environment .
If we now try .. >>> e = {'X ' : ' bill '} >>> unify ( Term ( " boy ( frank ) " ) , {} , Term ( " boy ( X ) " ) , e ) 0 >>> e {'X ' : ' bill '}
It fails because X was already set to ' bill ' .
Source arguments may also be variables .
Let 's look at a couple of situations . >>> >>> e = {} >>> unify ( Term ( " boy ( G ) " ) , {} , Term ( " boy ( X ) " ) , e ) 1 >>> e {}
Here unification succeeded but the variable X was not set since G has not yet been set .
However if we do set G then X will be set . >>> e = {} >>> unify ( Term ( " boy ( G ) " ) , {' G ' : ' frank'} , Term ( " boy ( X ) " ) , e ) 1 >>> e {'X ' : ' frank'}
The Goal class A Goal object is a bit of a misnomer but I can't think of any better name .
A goal is a rule , some of whose subgoals may have been matched and variables set .
In the tree diagram above , each branch and node represents a goal .
Except for our original query , each goal has a parent goal .
The attributes of a Goal object are the rule , parent , environment and an index which indicates which subgoal of the rule needs to be matched next .
When a Goal object is created ( line 43 ) it is vital that its environment is completely independent of another goal .
We do n't want to be sharing dictionaries here !
That 's why copy.
deepcopy ( ) ( line 50 ) is used to create a completely independent environments .
Searching for goals
Let 's look at the search function next .
Search will work with a stack of goals .
Our query ( a term ) is converted into a rule that then is used to create a Goal object that is in turn used to initialize the stack .
( line 117 )
Until the stack is empty goals are popped off the top and matched to facts and rules in the database ( line 136 ) .
When all goals in a rule succeed the parent goal is resumed , actually a copy is stacked anew where it was left off .
Where a goal requires a rule in the database to be satisfied , a child goal is started .
In both cases unification is applied to make ( or update ) the environment and the new goal is stacked for processing .
Whenever the original goal ( no parent ) is found , results are printed ( line 123 ) .
If variables have been set , they are output .
Otherwise the program simply replies " Yes " .
Now , you may be wondering ( and probably should be ! ) why we need a stack for processing .
Why not instead simply make " search " a recursive function ?
Well , it wo n't work .
In fact , I tried that at first .
But the nature of prolog is that a " call " to " search " would need to " return " multiple times ( or none ) , once for each solution found .
Our Python functions just can't do that .
The main program
This program is set up to process statements ( and queries ) from any files on the command line and then to interact in the same fashion with the user .
Interaction with the user may be turned off by using '.' ( meaning STOP ) as the last filename .
Within a file lines starting with ' # ' are comments .
The command " trace=1 " will turn on the trace feature .
When trace is on a line is printed by " search " each time a goal is stacked or popped from the stack .
The command " dump ? " will display the database .
Otherwise if the line ends with a ' ? ' it is assumed to be query ; if not , it must be a rule or fact to be added to the database .
Rules and facts may optionally end with a period .
The Government 's mandatory internet censorship plan , which is already being trialled by a number of small ISPs , will block sites contained on the ACMA blacklist for all Australians .
" We are not able to reconcile participation in the trial with our corporate social responsibility , our customer service objectives and our public position on censorship , " iiNet managing director Michael Malone said .
" It became increasingly clear that the trial was not simply about restricting child pornography or other such illegal material , but a much wider range of issues including what the Government simply describes as ' unwanted material ' without an explanation of what that includes . "
Betty Peters , 78 , a retired nurse educator from Melbourne whose pro-euthanasia YouTube videos were included on the blacklist , said she was " outraged " at the Government 's big brother attitude to Australian senior citizens .
" We do not need a 40 - year - old senator like [ Communications Minister ] Stephen Conroy deciding for us what is good and bad .
I am appalled that our free country has come to this , " said Peters , who does volunteer work for euthanasia organisation Exit International .
Senator Conroy and ACMA initially tried to discredit Wikileaks by saying the leaked blacklist was about double the size of ACMA 's list .
However , they admitted that both lists shared " some common URLs " .
Wikileaks said the disparity was due to the fact that the leaked list was from August last year and contained a number of older URLs that had since been removed by ACMA .
It quickly followed up by leaking a second version of the blacklist , dated March 18 this year , that is approximately the same size as the ACMA list and contains many of the same seemingly innocuous websites .
The renegade site also published instructions on how people can verify that the leaked list is legitimate .
The list was obtained by Wikileaks from internet filtering software that parents can opt to install on their computers .
ACMA provides its list of prohibited sites to these software developers for inclusion in their products .
Wikileaks was offline over the weekend and continues to be inaccessible , with a message on the site saying that it is " currently overloaded by readers " .
It plans to deploy additional resources to resolve the issue and is calling for people to help out with donations .
Last week 's leak of the ACMA blacklist reignited concerns that the internet filtering proposal could have unintended consequences for innocent businesses .
Experts warned that Australian businesses could be added to the list in error , with little recourse .
They would then be associated with child porn peddlers and sexual violence sites .
" Any person or corporation that would be identifiable on the list would potentially be deemed by the general public ... either a child molester or at least in the same category as child molesters , " said University of Sydney associate professor Bjorn Landfeldt .
" In effect , this could be interpreted by some as a government sanctioned hate list . "
Seven private medical laboratories have defrauded the Medi-Cal program of hundreds of millions of dollars by systematically overcharging the state by as much as 400 % for blood , urine and other lab tests , state Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown said Thursday .
Brown plans to announce a civil lawsuit today against the companies , five of which are in Los Angeles .
The suit aims to recover at least $ 100 million worth of the excessive charges paid by the program , which provides health services to the poor .
The attorney general ’s office launched an investigation three years ago after an executive of a competing medical lab filed a private false - claims action under seal .
The whistle - blower will be rewarded with a share of whatever fraudulent receipts the state can recover from the seven labs .

“ Our lawyer said that if I offered to settle this case for $ 100 million that the other side would jump at it , ” Brown said in an interview with The Times .
“ These companies have funds .
They ’re not all household names but they have money . ”
But the attorney general , rumored to be preparing another run for governor next year , could n’t explain why it took an outside party to realize that Medi-Cal was paying the suspect labs four times what it was paying other medical services vendors for blood , urine , HIV / AIDS , sexually transmitted disease and other tests ordered by the healthcare providers reimbursed by the state .
Nor could Brown say why criminal charges were not forthcoming in view of the magnitude of the fraud allegedly committed against the state for the last 15 years .
“ I do n’t know the answer to that .
These are all good questions -- if there were these gross discrepancies , why would n’t the state have jumped on this at an earlier point ? ”
Brown said .
“ If they were charging $ 8 for a lab test when competitors were charging $ 2 , what was the state doing ? ”

He said he could n’t say whether Medi-Cal was remiss in failing to notice , through internal reviews or audits , that the labs were overcharging .
Brown declined to name the companies before a news conference at which state lawyers will appear with the whistle - blower to expose the alleged wrongdoing .
“ They do n’t know this is coming , ” he said of the companies that are the targets of the lawsuit he planned to announce at the Los Angeles office of the state attorney general at 10 a.m .
Medi-Cal has been the target of other recent fraud schemes .

The former senior vice president of City of Angels Medical Center pleaded guilty this week to paying illegal kickbacks for referral of homeless people with Medi-Cal cards to the hospital for services .
A year ago , two physicians and three administrators from a downtown maternity clinic were arrested on suspicion of defrauding Medi-Cal of at least $ 2 million .
Sources have also told The Times that Medi-Cal has been asked to reimburse Kaiser Permanente ’s Bellflower Medical Center for hundreds of thousands of dollars for care of the octuplets born there in January .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Citigroup , once considered one of the nation 's mightiest financial institutions , logged another dismal milestone Thursday , as shares of the beleaguered bank slipped below $ 1 a share .
The move , which may have seemed unthinkable just months ago , came as the broader market fell once again toward new 12 - year lows due to worries about the health of the banking sector and the broader economy .
After falling as low as 97 cents a share midday , Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) pared some losses and finished the day at $ 1.02 , down 10 % from Wednesday 's close .
It marks the lowest level for the bank 's stock since Citicorp and Travelers Group merged in 1998 to create Citigroup .
Shares of other big banks finished sharply lower as well Thursday .
Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) declined 12 % and 14 % respectively .
Regional banks Fifth Third ( FITB , Fortune 500 ) and Milwaukee - based Marshall & Ilsley ( MI , Fortune 500 ) lost more than 20 % each .
Citigroup stock , which is one of the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones industrial average , traded around $ 57 at its peak .
That was in late 2006 , just months before subprime mortgages began to become problems and the credit market unraveled .
But fears about Citigroup 's exposure to soured mortgages and other consumer loans have sent shares plummeting this year , wiping out billions of dollars in shareholder value as a result .
The bank reported losses of nearly $ 28 billion last year and investors remain worried that the bank will continue to lose money as the economy weakens .
" At the end of the day it just underscores the shared ruin that has really been forced on the system through the credit crisis , " said Peter Kenny , managing director of institutional sales at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City , New Jersey .
The stock lost more than half its value last month alone as speculation grew that the government would have to step in and effectively nationalize the company .
Last Friday , the government unveiled plans to convert a portion of its $ 45 billion stake in Citigroup into common shares , a move that could give taxpayers as much as a 36 % stake in the bank .
Those efforts represented the latest government - led efforts aimed at propping up the ailing financial institution .
In October , the Treasury Department injected $ 25 billion into the company .
Less than two months later , regulators intervened again with an additional $ 20 billion investment and an agreement to backstop some losses against more than $ 300 billion in Citigroup 's troubled assets .
Since then , Citigroup has outlined plans to split the company into two businesses , effectively bringing an end to the company 's " financial supermarket " model .
Under the new arrangement , Citigroup would split itself into two units : Citicorp and Citi Holdings .
When asked about Citigroup at a hearing Thursday before the House Budget Committee , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said the Obama administration was prepared to provide ongoing support to those parts of the financial system that need assistance .
" It is very important -- and we will do this -- to make sure that the major institutions in our country have the resources and the funding and the ability to play their continuing role in our markets going forward , " he said .
Citigroup , which ranks as the nation 's second - largest bank based on assets , employs more than 300,000 workers in over 100 countries .
The bank , which once had the largest market capitalization of any financial firm , is now valued at just $ 5.5 billion .
Through Wednesday 's close , Citigroup was merely the 27th largest of 81 financial firms in the S&P 500 as ranked by market value .
( CNN ) --
What do you do when your 10 - year - old son wakes up in the middle of the night screaming , " There 's a ' roo in my room ! "
Beat Ettlin wrestled a kangaroo out of his house near Canberra after it crashed through a window .
If you 're Beat Ettlin , you wrest the marsupial into a headlock , drag it down your hallway and toss it out your front door .
Ettlin and his family were woken early Sunday when a 6 - foot - tall kangaroo crashed through a window , landed on their bed and thrashed around their house in the suburb of Garran , south of the capital of Canberra , Australia .
" At first , he ( my husband ) thought it was a lunatic ninja , " said Ettlin 's wife , Verity Beman .
" It leaped through the window , this martial - arts kind of figure .
It was very Jackie Chan . "
The family 's one - story house is in a suburb that butts against a kangaroo reserve .
About 2 a.m. Sunday , their dog began barking furiously .
Possibly possums , they thought .
The family had put up with possums scampering across their roof every night since they moved in three weeks ago .
Moments later , the window was smashed and a black figure landed on their bed .
Ettlin , after gathering his wits about him , exclaimed , " It 's OK .
It 's only a kangaroo , " Beman recalled .
" I was cowered under the quilt , thinking , ' No , it 's not OK , ' " she said .
The kangaroo jumped on top of the blanket that Beman and her 9 - year - old daughter were hiding under .
It then leaped onto the nightstand , punched holes in the furniture and left blood stains on the wall as it bounced into their son's room .
" That 's when his male instinct kicked in , " Beman said of her husband .
After putting the 90 - pound creature in a choke hold , Ettlin kept it low to the ground and pulled it toward the front door .
He knew that kangaroos carry their strength on their hind legs , Beman said .
" He held it by one arm .
He opened the front door with the other , then the screen door , " she said .
" It bounced across our veranda and bounced away . "
Ettlin is a chef , originally from the Swiss city of Stans .
Beman thinks he would not have tackled the kangaroo so readily were he Australian .
" They would be fully aware of the risk , " she said .
The house in shambles -- with blood and shattered glass everywhere -- Ettlin stood surveying the damage in his shredded underpants .
Scratch marks ran down his leg , but otherwise he was fine .
" I kept marveling at what he did , " Beman said .
" I called him my hero .
My hero in Bonds undies . "
Paula Oliveira received some 100 razor cuts on her belly Brazil has called in the Swiss envoy to discuss an alleged skinhead attack near Zurich on a pregnant Brazilian woman that caused her to miscarry twins .
Three skinheads reportedly attacked Paula Oliveira , a 26 - year - old lawyer , on Monday , leaving her badly scarred .
Ms Oliveira received some 100 cuts from a carpet knife , and the initials of the right - wing Swiss People 's Party ( SVP ) were also carved into her body .
Ms Oliveira 's family says the assault was racially - motivated .
It says she had been speaking Portuguese outside a Zurich train station shortly before the attack .
" What they did to my daughter is like a horror movie , " Ms Oliveira 's father , Paulo , told Brazil 's Globo TV .
The attack has caused shock in Brazil where it has been widely reported along with graphic images of the scars inflicted on Ms Oliveira , the BBC's Gary Duffy in Sao Paulo says .
Brazil 's Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has described the assault as " grave " and " shocking " .
Plea for patience
The facts surrounding the attack remain unclear but police in Zurich say a man called them on Monday evening to report that a woman in a train station needed help .
If that really was someone from our party ... that person would be immediately kicked out
Oskar Freysinger
Swiss People 's Party
The assault is said to have continued for about 10 minutes .
Ms Oliveira told police that she had suffered a miscarriage shortly afterwards in a toilet near the train station .
Ms Oliveira was working as a lawyer for a big European company in Switzerland .
She is said to have been living legally in the country for almost two years .
She is currently being treated at University Hospital Zurich .
No-one has been arrested in connection with the attack .
Swiss police have asked for patience while the investigation is continuing and appealed for anyone who may have witnessed the attack to come forward .
However , the BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says the police did not make the appeal , or supply any public information about the attack , until after the case was reported in the Brazilian media .
' Country of law '
Our correspondent says the Swiss People 's Party - whose name in German is " Schweizerische Volkspartei " ( SVP ) - is renowned for its anti-immigration stance , and has been accused of racism during political campaigns .
It is claimed the letters SVP stand for " Schweizerische Volkspartei "
Its poster during the 2007 general election , showing white sheep kicking a black sheep out of Switzerland , caused international outrage .
However the party has always denied any connection with neo -Nazis , our correspondent adds .
It won almost 29 % of the vote at the last election , and has for decades served in Switzerland 's coalition government .
A spokesman for the party , Oskar Freysinger , condemned the attack and said Switzerland was a country of law , in which every individual deserved respect .
" If that really was someone from our party , we would n't hesitate for a second .
That person would be immediately kicked out , " he told the Associated Press .

Let 's put this on the table right away :
As far as I 'm concerned , Mickey Rourke is a schmuck in the old - school sense -- a squinting organ , a thing that feels but does n't think .
A permanently wounded beast , a scar with legs .
At best .
I know this because I saw the Mick at the bottom of the barrel late in 1994 , spent two weeks trying to profile him while he was shooting a direct - to - video piece of crap with Tupac Shakur .
That he treated me like dirt was no big deal and no surprise , but he also made a point of bad - mouthing his estranged ( and now ex ) wife , urging me -- unprompted and at length -- to smear her .
He stank of both self - pity and braggadocio , and his effluvium of bullshit made it impossible to tell where the lies ended and the lunacy began .
In short , Rourke made it easy to write a fine profile , and I felt a certain pity for him , even as I called him a has - been : " Viewing his films in chronological order , watching a fine young actor re-create himself as a stumbling hack , " I wrote then , " without range , without craft , without even giving a damn , is both astounding and tragic , like seeing a wrecking ball slam a building into dust . "
I was wrong .
Mickey may yet be a schmuck -- while nobody should be judged only at his worst , how he deals with hard times says far more about a man than his waltz down easy street -- but in The Wrestler , his new film , Rourke does n't just make good on the promise of his early work ; he makes a miracle .
After a decade - plus of small - bore jobs in movies no one saw , after heaven knows how much plastic surgery , girdled by a musculature that looks like an off - the - rack job from Jose Canseco 's chop shop , and onscreen nearly every frame under the harshest lighting since Jimmy Whale 's Bride of Frankenstein , Mickey Rourke bares his ass and soul -- and covers himself in glory .
There will be buzz -- Best Actor buzz .
It 's a beauty of a performance , a harrowing of blood and brutal humor -- and no critic will fail to note that Rourke 's swollen lonesome clown of a wrestler hanging on long past his time is a version of the actor playing the part .
All fine , all true as far as it goes , and utterly irrelevant .
This rarest of cinematic wonders -- an honest American movie -- grim and funny and loud as hell , lumpen and lowbrow , saddled with a threadbare and timeworn plot but blessedly devoid of straining for high art , is simply impossible to imagine without Mickey Rourke 's heart pumping at its core .
Skip the Oscar ; give him a Nobel .
If " There are no second acts in American lives " is n't the most abused quote of the last century , it 's certainly the stupidest , especially when you consider that its issuer , F. Scott Fitzgerald , drank his gift to death by his early 30s and died at the age of 44 .
Sean Penn told me a while ago that Mick had become a different man since his brother , Joey , died in 2004 .
Maybe so , but probably not :
We are who and what we are -- even the actors among us -- our selves and being finally of a single piece .
A more precise gauge of life than Scott Fitzgerald , or any writer for that matter , is an actuary .
And according to Darren Aronofsky , director of The Wrestler , only one firm in the movie business was willing to fund the film at any price with Mick as star .
You can shoot a real movie with no second act and no Mickey Rourke , but not without money .
It 's nice that Aronofsky got it done .
Nice , too , for a writer to be wrong :
The schmuck can act .

Non-Essential # 6 : Brain Boosters
Edutainment for infants is all the rage these days .
With loaded names like Baby Einstein , Baby Mozart , Baby Genius , and Brainy Baby , they all claim to offer your baby the intellectual enhancements they ’ll need to get ahead , to maximize their potential , to succeed in today ’s fast - paced and competetive society .
But there is , in fact , no evidence that any of these toys , videos , books , or methodologies actually provide any long - term benefit , and often in fact have quite the opposite effect .
The issues of excessive testing , unrealistic expectations and high - pressure environments in public schools , over - scheduling , parents ’ loss of connection with their children and their own parental instincts , parental guilt over lack of quality time , confusion over conflicting messages on child development , the impact of consumerism and profit - driven children ’s industries , and how this all relates to the surge in ‘ educational enrichment ’ for babies is simply far too massive and complex to properly get into within this brief article .
Please , please , please read Much Too Early ! , a highly illuminating article by David Elkind , author of The Hurried Child and Miseducation : Preschoolers at Risk , for an overview of some of these issues .
Among other things , he explains how knowing the alphabet is not a step towards reading , clarifies the mis-application of the HeadStart program results , outlines the normal intellectual developmental steps of the young child , and reaffirms that education is not a race to be the first to the finish line .
Early Academics : A Distortion of Natural Development
As brain research has led to some understanding about the development of intelligence in young children , including such concepts as “ windows ” or critical periods and the importance of the first three years , ‘ experts ’ and educators have jumped on the findings , misinterpreted them , and launched this whole baby brain - building mess .
In this interview , John Bruer explains this history and debunks the myth of the “ first three years . ”
These myths extend back to in utero .
When studies of fetal heart rate showed that the unborn infant could differentiate between the voice of its mother and an unknown voice , the “ Pregaphone ” was invented .
This device ( supposedly ) allows you to read Shakespeare , play Mozart , and otherwise educate your baby while still in the womb .
Of course , your baby hears your voice just fine without this device anyway , so the specific advantage offered by it is rather murky .
Dr. Maria Montessori , in observing young children as they played and learned , observed what indeed appeared to be “ sensitive periods ” — decades before there was any corroborating brain research — where children appeared to be especially primed to learn certain skills or concepts .
However , rather than this being an opportunity for parents and teachers to feed factoids to the passive child , this was simply how the child was naturally forming itself .
In other words , a young child will instinctively seek out the learning experiences that will best suit its development at any particular time .
As long as there is a normal environment to explore , a child will learn to walk , jump , and run , understand spoken language , distinguish and identify colours , textures , and sizes , sing , count , and draw representational figures — incredibly complex ideas , all from its own curiosity and emergent drive to self - create .
Preschoolers and School - Age Children Also Suffer from Misapplied Academics
The pressure for scholastic success , combined with the belief that the best way to achieve this is through in an indoor classroom setting with textbooks and tests — rather than through practical experience and free play — has become so all - encompassing that schools are cutting recess , and the age for beginning institutionalized schooling keeps dropping ( despite the failure to provide any evidence that this actually improves success , and much evidence to the contrary ) .
In North America , the legal age for mandatory school attendance is usually 5 or 6 , though in many areas , you will be looked at quite oddly if your child is not in a formal academic preschool by age 3 or 4 .
By contrast , many Scandinavian countries do not begin formal schooling until age 7 , have longer holidays … and have higher results in literacy and academic achievement .
“ One of the most intriguing statistics from international comparisons is the lack of relationship between hours in the classroom and educational achievement . ”
[ social_buttons ]
If early academics for preschoolers does nothing to improve later school success — and apparently even has the opposite effect entirely — does it not stand to reason that we should utterly refrain from continuing to extend this mistake further and further back into childhood , even into infancy ?
Let The Children Play
So what should we do , then , with our babies ?
Of course we want the best for them , it ’s only natural to want to give them any advantage we possibly can .
First of all , breastfeed .
Formula - fed babies score 5 - 6 % lower IQ ’s by school age .
Second , wear your baby .
Babies who are worn cry less , and spend more time in the “ active alert ” state — when they are observing and absorbing information .
They also get more adult interaction and a better vantage point for viewing and learning about their world .
But , perhaps most important of all , let them play .
And play with them .
In the words of Kathy Hirsh - Pasek , and Roberta Michnick Golinkoff , authors of Einstein Never Used Flashcards : How Our Children Really Learn–and Why They Need to Play More and Memorize Less :
Do n’t let yourself be taken in by the messages about enhancing your baby ’s brain development that appear on flashy product lines .
Just as sex is used in advertising to sell products to adults , marketers have figured out that brain development sells to parents .
There is no evidence , however , that particular educational programs , methods , or techniques are effective for brain development .
For example , listening to Mozart is not bad for your child .
That is , if you like Mozart , there is no harm in playing it and exposing your child to music .
But you could just as well sing lullabies , play Simon and Garfunkel , the Indigo Girls , or any other band you like .
Music is wonderful .
There is no doubt about it .
But the evidence from research says that listening to Mozart , Madonna , or Mama Cass will not make your child a math genius or budding architect , or even increase his general intelligence . …
Your child will learn more when you play with him than when you buy him fancy boxes containing self - proclaimed “ state - of - the - art ” devices with exorbitant claims to build his brain .
( Read a lengthy excerpt from the book )
Golinkoff again :
Parents feel enormous pressure to spend meaningful time with their kids , and of course , everybody wants to do what ’s best for their kids .
But “ play ” has become a four - letter word .
And so often , parents take “ quality play time ” to mean “ teaching time . ”
They trade play in for structured activities , educational TV and flash cards .
But what I believe makes more sense , and what research indicates , is that children learn through play , and play with parents is the best .
Also remember , while you ’re happily playing with your child , that anything can be a toy .
You do n’t need a house full of mountains of playthings .
When my son was an infant , one of his favourite toys was the lid from an old bottle of Vaseline .
Possibly not the “ greenest ” toy ever , but he loved it .
Boxes , sticks , old clothes , pots and pans , brooms , simple wooden blocks , scraps of fabric , spoons , anything that makes noise …
You do n’t have to spend hundreds of dollars on plastic made - in - China nonsense , or even on high - quality wooden eco-friendly toys .
Just let them explore , and play .

Debt Snowball is a debt elimination strategy popularized by Dave Ramsey , a renowned debt and personal finance guru .
Under this method , you reduce your debt by paying the minimum monthly payment to all accounts , except the one with the smallest balance , which you ’ll try to pay down as fast as you can .
How the Debt Snowball Method Works
The basic steps in the Debt Snowball debt reduction plan are as follows :
List all debts from the smallest balance to the largest .
Pay the minimum payment on every debt , except the smallest debt .
Pay as much as you can towards that smallest debt until it is paid off .
Once the smallest debt is paid in full , repeat the process by paying as much as you can toward the next smallest debt .
The idea is that you ’ll be able to pay more toward the “ smallest ” debt each time a debt is fully paid off .
The process is named the “ snowball method ” because the payments you are sending to creditors grow larger over time , much like a rolling snowball .
You gain psychological momentum by achieving a quick win by paying off the smallest debt first .
Here is an illustration of the Debt Snowball method .
From the image , you can see Debt A is the smallest , followed by Debt B , Debt C , and the largest , Debt D. Assume you have $ 250 to pay each month and $ 50 is the minimum payment on each .
You ’d pay $ 50 on each , except you pay $ 100 toward your smallest one ( Debt A ) .
Once Debt
A is paid off , you roll the $ 100 payment toward Debt B , thus creating the “ snowball ” effect .
Debt Snowball Example
Let ’s say you have 5 outstanding accounts in the following amount : $ 500 , $ 625 , $ 675 , $ 1000 , and $ 1200 — note , the interest rate is irrelevant in this method .
You would order the accounts from the lowest balance to the highest balance using the Debt Snowball Method , like below :
To keep this simple , let ’s assume each debt requires a minimum payment of $ 25 per month and we are leaving out the increases in the balance due to finance charges .
Also , let ’s assume you ’ve budgeted $ 200 per month to pay off your debt .
In the first month , you ’ll pay $ 25 to all accounts , except the $ 500 one , which you ’ll use all of the remaining $ 100 to pay down .
After 5 months , the $ 500 debt would be fully paid and the remaining ones are reduced to $ 500 , $ 550 , $ 875 , and $ 1075 .
Now , you ’ll repeat the same process by paying $ 25 to all , except the next $ 500 one , which you ’ll pay $ 125 per month ( $ 100 from the original $ 500 debt that was paid off , plus the $ 25 you have been paying ) .
After 4 months , the second debt is paid off ( notice how it ’s faster than the first $ 500 ? ) , and the remaining debts are reduced to $ 450 , $ 775 , and $ 975 .
Rinse and repeat …
Debt Snowball Illustration
Here ’s the example in a table format to help you visualize the process .
Debt Snowball Controversy
The biggest controversy surrounding the debt snowball method is the disregard of the interest rate when it comes to prioritizing the accounts .
The logic here is that if you choose to pay down the debts with the highest interest rates first ( without taking balance sizes into consideration ) you truly can eliminate debts in a faster period of time .
By paying the higher interest accounts you also will be saving money in finance charges .
Depending on how logical your brain is with math the debt snowball may or may not work for you .
Yet it is not uncommon for some people to stick to the snowball method purely for the psychological reasoning and benefits rather than pure math .
For instance , the debt snowball method works well for some people simply because they see results much faster .
By starting with the lowest balances rather than the highest interest rates , they can see that “ Paid in Full ” statement faster .
This can be a huge motivating factor when you are trying to stay on track for eliminating debts .
Conversely , if you start with the higher interest balances it likely will take you much longer to see the debt actually go away even though you ’ll limit the amount of interest you pay .
Debt Avalanche , the High - Interest Method
Debt Avalanche is similar to Debt Snowball , but the idea is to pay off the highest interest debt first — something I also advocate and wrote in my debt reduction guide .
From the above example , you would order the accounts from the highest interest to the lowest interest using the Debt Avalanche Method , like below :
An Example of Debt Snowball vs. Debt Avalanche
Let ’s take a look at another example .
The Jones have two car loans and some credit card debt .
They have enough money to make all of their payments plus $ 170 extra each month to help knock their debt out faster .
This is what their debt looks like :
Car Loan # 1 : $ 5,000 remaining of original $ 12,000 60 month loan at 5.6 % .
Payment of $ 229.77 .
$ 5,000 remaining of original $ 12,000 60 month loan at 5.6 % .
Payment of $ 229.77 .
Car Loan # 2 : $ 1,200 remaining of original $ 6,000 48 month loan at 4.99 % .
Payment of $ 138.15 .
$ 1,200 remaining of original $ 6,000 48 month loan at 4.99 % .
Payment of $ 138.15 .
Credit Card # 1 : $ 6,800 balance at an interest rate of 19.99 % .
Minimum payment of $ 136 .
$ 6,800 balance at an interest rate of 19.99 % .
Minimum payment of $ 136 .
Credit Card # 2 : $ 800 balance at an interest rate of 3 % .
Minimum payment of $ 20 .
How do the two methods ( Debt Snowball vs. Debt Avalanche ) pan out ?
With the Debt Snowball method the Jones would pay off their debts in this order :
Credit Card # 2 , paid off in Month 5 , an interest cost of $ 5.29
Car Loan # 2 , paid off in Month 6 , an interest cost of $ 20.42
Car Loan # 1 , paid off in Month 11 , an interest cost of $ 177.10
Credit Card # 1 , paid off in Month 22 , an interest cost of $ 1,927.69 .
Total interest paid : $ 2,130.50 .
Not bad , but let ’s look at the Debt Avalanche method next .
This is how the debt would be paid off :
Credit Card # 1 , paid off Month 19 , an interest cost of $ 1,414.89
Car Loan # 1 , paid off Month 19 , an interest cost of $ 269.27
Car Loan # 2 , paid off Month 7 ( it naturally pays itself off due to the lower starting balance ) , an interest cost of $ 24.78
Credit Card # 2 , paid off Month 20 , an interest cost of $ 32.47
Total interest paid : $ 1,741.41 .
That ’s a savings of $ 389.09 and paid off 2 months earlier !
Here are a few articles about Debt Avalanche :
More Debt Snowball Variations
There are many variations of the Debt Snowball methods , i.e. , Debt Snowflake , Debt Deluge , etc .
Debt Snowflake
I first heard about Debt Snowflake from Paidtwice ( site now gone ) .
Debt Snowflake is a debt reduction plan based on Debt Snowball , but the idea is to actively find and use additional income to pay even more than the budgeted amount toward your top priority debt .
Here are a few articles about Debt Snowflake :
Other Debt Snowball Variations
Bottom Line
Paying off debt with any methodology is a smart move .
Paying off debt by paying your highest interest rate debts first is mathematically the best way to get out of debt .
But paying off debt with the smallest balance first and snowballing forward works almost as well .
You ’ll pay more in interest , but the psychological perk of knocking out a quick win at the beginning of the process can help motivate you to finish .
Again , paying down debt in any method at all is much better than just paying your minimum payments .

Danish special forces on board a navy warship have destroyed a small boat full of suspected Somali pirates .
Denmark 's TV2 channel said that special forces officers captured the alleged pirates , before sinking the vessel .
Seven pirates were taken into custody and are being sailed to Yemen , according to TV2 .
The officers were on board the Danish warship HDMS Absalon , which is part of a NATO task force set up to combat the increasing problem of piracy in the Gulf of Aden .
Bowing to international pressure , Switzerland announced on Friday that it would move toward a more rigid definition of tax evasion and help global authorities pursue tax cheats .
The surprise announcement came after a similar shift by two other European tax havens , Liechtenstein and Andorra , on Thursday .
Together the moves deal the biggest blow yet to European traditions of banking secrecy and come amid a global crackdown on tax evasion .
The three governments agreed to cooperate with authorities in the United States and elsewhere in investigating tax evasion and , under certain circumstances , to turn over data on accounts at banks headquartered within their jurisdictions .
" The adoption of the O.E.C.D standards is a significant signal that bank secrecy as it has existed for generations is coming to an end , " said Scott D. Michel , a tax lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale in Washington , D.C .
Updating the Militarization and Annexation of North America COMMENTARY : Updating the Militarization and Annexation of North America by Stephen Lendman Friday , 13 March 2009 The Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America ( SPP ) is a military - backed corporate coup d'etat against the sovereignty of three nations , their populations and legislative bodies .
The public is largely unaware of what is happening .
T he title refers to the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America ( SPP ) , also known as the North American Union - formerly launched at a March 23 , 2005 Waco , Texas meeting attended by George Bush , Mexico 's President Vincente Fox , and Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin .
It 's for a tri-national agreement , below the radar , for greater economic , political , and security integration with secret business and government working groups devising binding policies with no public knowledge or legislative debate .
In short , it 's a military - backed corporate coup d'etat against the sovereignty of three nations , their populations and legislative bodies .
It 's a dagger through the heart of democratic freedom in all three , yet the public is largely unaware of what 's happening .
Last April , New Orleans hosted the last SPP summit .
Ever since , progress may have stalled given the gravity of the global economic crisis and top priority need to address it .
Nonetheless , what 's known to date is updated below plus some related information .
Last September , the Army Times reported that the 3rd Infantry 's 1st Brigade Combat Team in Iraq would be re-deployed at home ( October 1 ) as " an on - call federal response force for natural or manmade emergencies and disasters , including terrorist attacks . "
" This marks the first time an active unit has been given a dedicated assignment to NorthCom , a joint command established in 2002 to provide command and control for federal homeland defense efforts and coordinate defense support of civil authorities . "
Then on December 1 , the Washington Post reported that the Pentagon will deploy 20,000 troops nationwide by 2011 " to help state and local officials respond to a nuclear attack or other domestic catastrophe . "
Three " rapid - reaction " combat units are planned .
Two or more others may follow .
They 'll be supplemented by 80 smaller National Guard units trained to respond to chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear , high - yield explosive , and other domestic " terror " attacks or disturbances .
In other words , homeland militarization and occupation are planned using troops trained to kill .
The pretext is national security .
In fact , they 'll be on - call against another major terrorist attack , real or contrived , as well as civil unrest given the gravity of the economic crisis , its affect on millions , and likelihood that sooner or later they 'll react .
Armed combat troops will supplement militarized local police in case security crackdowns are ordered or martial law declared .
" Catastrophic Emergency " procedures are in place to react to situations , " natural or manmade , " according to DHS / FEMA 's March 2008 " Preparedness for the Next Catastrophic Disaster " policy paper .
Should conditions warrant , initiatives to suspend the Constitution and declare martial law are in place , but militarizing America for business is also at issue .
Last October 1 , the Canadian Action Party posted a " COUP IN USA ALERT " after the Bush administration announced the homeland deployment of troops with " $ 100 billion ( bailout ) dollars " to do it .
What 's Likely in Prospect SPP efforts paused during the Bush to Obama transition , but " deep integration " plans remain .
On January 19 , Ottawa 's Carleton University 's Centre for Trade Policy and Law outlined an agenda for America and Canada going forward .
It called for " early and sustained cooperation " at a time of continuing global crisis , to include security , defense , trade and competitiveness .
It said the " most pressing issue is the need to re-think the architecture for managing North America 's common economic space ( including ) trade liberalization . "
It used language like " re-imagining ( and ) modernizing the border " that reads like erasing it and doing the same with Mexico .
In a similar vein , it recommends " integrating national regulatory regimes into one that applies on both sides of the border . "
It called the arrival of a new Washington administration " a golden opportunity " to forge a " mutually beneficial agenda ( that ) will define global and North American governance for years to come . "
It mentioned the specter of protectionism and need to avoid it given the current economic climate .
It advocates a " more ambitious Canada - US Partnership " beyond NAFTA , " in co-partnership with Mexico .
Titled " North America Next , " a recent Arizona State University North American Center for Transborder Studies report called for " sustainable and security competitiveness " and deeper US - Canada - Mexico integration through " sustainable security and effective trade and transportation ( to ) make ( the three nation ) North America( n partnership ) safer , more economically viable , and more prosperous . "
Both Carleton and Arizona State University project participants want SPP initiatives invigorated under a new Washington administration , especially in a climate of global economic crisis when addressing it takes precedence .
Other Issues in Play " The Canadian 's " Mike Finch " North American Union ( NAU ) watch " reports that US and Canadian organizations want to end free flow Internet information .
He cites an " net - neutrality activist group " discovery of " plans for the demise of the free Internet by 2010 in Canada , " and by 2012 globally .
Canada 's two largest ISPs , Bell Canada and TELUS , are behind a scheme to limit browsing , block out sites , and charge fees on most others as part of a 2012 " planned full ( NAU ) launching . "
Web host I Power 's Reese Leysen called it " beyond censorship : it is killing the biggest ( ever ) ' ecosystem ' of free expression and freedom of speech . "
He cited big company inside sources providing information on " exclusivity deals between ISPs and big content providers ( like TV studios and video game publishers ) " to decide which sites will be in the standard package offered customers , leaving the rest of the Internet unreachable except for fees . "
Leysen called his source " 100 % reliable " and cited similar information from a Dylan Pattyn Time magazine article , based on Bell Canada and TELUS sources .
Plans are for " only the top 100 - 200 sites making the cut in the initial subscription package , " likely to include major news outlets at the expense of smaller , alternative ones .
" The Internet would become a playground for billion - dollar content providers , " like cable TV providers , unless efforts are made to stop it .
Leysen thinks US and global ISPs have similar plans that include free speech restrictions and privacy invasions .
The stakes are high if he 's right .
Yet the profit potential is huge and friendly governments may oblige .
Also involved are " deceptive marketing and fear tactics " ( like citing child pornography threats ) to gain public approval for subscription services masquerading as online safety .
The time to stop it is now .
Earlier Plans to Rename SPP / NAU Last March , Canada 's Fraser Institute proposed it in an article titled : " Saving the North American Security and Prosperity Partnership " at a time of mounting criticism .
It recommended discarding NAU in favor of the " North American Standards and Regulatory Area ( NASRA ) " to disguise its real purpose .
It called the " SPP brand " tarnished so changing it was essential to continue where NAFTA left off by combining security with quality of life issues like food safety , global warming , climate change , and pandemic diseases .
It also wants better communications to sell it to the public .
Their idea is to fool most people until it 's too late to matter .
Rumblings in America at the State Level Running counter to " deep integration , " News with Views ( NWV ) writer Jim Kouri headlined on February 23 : " Individual States Declaring Sovereignty . "
He cites political strategist Mike Baker saying " Americans are becoming disenchanted with the federal government 's lack of perspective on " matters like : " illegal aliens , crime , ( and ) economic turmoil - while intruding into the private lives of citizens with gun-control laws and other intrusions , " issues our Founding Fathers " relegated to the individual states . "
Bothersome also are unfunded mandates that states can't handle given their over - stretched budgets and need to cut back .
In addition , Washington 's intrusion into local law enforcement is a big issue .
So far , nine states have declared sovereignty and another dozen or more are considering it .
Enacted or proposed legislation varies from all states ' rights to selective ones like gun control and abortion .
As of January 30 , Washington State is one of the former under House and Senate bill HJM - 4009 stating : " The Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States specifically provides that , ' The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people ; ' and The Tenth Amendment defines the total scope of federal power as being those powers specifically granted to it by the Constitution of the United States and no more . "
Earlier in January , New Hampshire enacted similar legislation ( HCR - 6 ) " affirming States ' rights based on Jeffersonian principles . "
Other states doing it totally or in part include California , Arizona , Montana , Michigan , Missouri , Oklahoma , and Georgia .
In addition , the following states are considering similar measures : Colorado , Pennsylvania , Illinois , Indiana , Kansas , Arkansas , Idaho , Alabama , Maine , Nevada , Hawaii and Alaska , and reportedly , Wyoming and Mississippi may as well .
Besides states rights issues , driving the current movement are : the grave and deteriorating economy ;
Wall Street 's harmful control over policy ;
its effects on checks and balances ;
excessive bailouts for an insolvent and corrupted banking system at the expense of local state budgets and rights ; and
reckless and unsustainable spending and national debt levels driving the nation to bankruptcy and placing untenable burdens on states .
Overall , concern is that Washington is complicit in driving the nation to ruin , and they want out or at least lean that way .
If this movement gains strength , at the least it will slow " deep integration , " stall it for a considerable time , but wo n't likely halt it .
Corporate America wants it , and most often what it wants , it gets .
It may just take longer than planned , much longer given the gravity of the global crisis , how hard it will be to resolve , and how long doing it will take .
Some experts predict another Great Depression as bad or worse than the first one and far worse than Japan 's " lost decades " - from 1990 to the present .
Top priority in world capitals and corporate boardrooms is preventing it if possible .
Except for " national security , " other initiatives are secondary .

LET IT DIE
by Douglas Rushkoff
March 15 , 2009
With any luck , the economy will never recover .
In a perfect world , the stock market would decline another 70 or 80 percent along with the shuttering of about that fraction of our nation ’s banks .
Yes , unemployment would rise as hundreds of thousands of formerly well - paid brokers and bankers lost their jobs ; but at least they would no longer be extracting wealth at our expense .
They would need to be fed , but that would be a lot cheaper than keeping them in the luxurious conditions they ’re enjoying now .
Even Bernie Madoff costs us less in jail than he does on Park Avenue .
Alas , I ’m not being sarcastic .
If you had spent the last decade , as I have , reviewing the way a centralized economic plan ravaged the real world over the past 500 years , you would appreciate the current financial meltdown for what it is : a comeuppance .
This is the sound of the other shoe dropping ; it ’s what happens when the chickens come home to roost ; it ’s justice , equilibrium reasserting itself , and ultimately a good thing .
I started writing a book three years ago through which I hoped to help people see the artificial and ultimately dehumanizing landscape of corporatism on which we conduct so much of our lives .
It ’s not just that I saw the downturn coming — it ’s that I feared it would n’t come quickly or clearly enough to help us wake up from the self - destructive fantasy of an eternally expanding economic frontier .
The planet , and its people , were being taxed beyond their capacity to produce .
Try arguing that to a banker whose livelihood is based on perpetuating that illusion , or to people whose retirement incomes depend on just one more generation falling for the scam .
It ’s like arguing to Brooklyn ’s latest crop of brownstone buyers that they ’ve invested in real estate at the very moment the whole market is about to tank .
( I did ; it was n’t pretty . )
Now that the scheme we have mistaken for the real economy is collapsing under its own weight , however , it ’s a whole lot easier to make these arguments .
And , if anything , it ’s even more important for us to come to grips with the fact that the system in peril is not a natural one , or even one that we should be attempting to revive and restore .
The thing that is dying — the corporatized model of commerce — has not , nor has it ever been , supportive of the real economy .
It was n’t meant to be .
And before we start lamenting its demise or , worse , spending good money after bad to resuscitate it , we had better understand what it was for , how it nearly sucked us all dry , and why we should put it out of our misery .
Chartered Corporations
Back in the good ol ’ days — I mean as far back as the late middle ages — people just did business with each other .
As traveling got easier and people got access to new resources and markets , a middle class of merchants and small businesspeople started to get wealthy .
So wealthy that they threatened the power of the aristocracy .
Monarchs needed to come up with a way to stabilize their own wealth before the free market unseated them .
They invented the corporate charter .
By granting an exclusive charter , a king could give one of his friends in the merchant class monopoly control over a region or sector .
In exchange , he ’d get shares in the company .
So the businessperson no longer had to worry about competition — his position at the top of the business hierarchy was locked in place , by law .
And the monarch never had to worry about losing his authority ; businesses with crown - guaranteed charters tend to support the crown .
But this changed the shape of business fundamentally .
Instead of thriving on innovation and progress , corporate monopolies simply sought to extract wealth from the regions they controlled .
They did n’t need to compete , anymore , so they just sucked resources from places and people .
Meanwhile , people living and working in the real world lost the ability to generate value by or for themselves .
For example :
In the 1700s , American colonists were allowed to grow corn but they were n’t allowed to do anything with it –except sell it at fixed prices to the British East India Trading Company , the corporation sanctioned by England to do business in the colonies .
Colonists were n’t allowed to sell their cotton to each other or , worse , make clothes out of it .
They were mandated , by law , to ship it back to England where clothes were fabricated by another chartered monopoly , then shipped back to America where they could be purchased .
The American war for independence was less a revolt against England than a revolt against her chartered corporations .
The other big innovation of the early corporate era was monopoly currency .
There used to be lots of different kinds of money .
Local currencies , which helped regions reinvest in their own activities , and centralized currencies , for long distance transactions .
Local currencies were earned into existence .
A farmer would grow a bunch of grain , bring it to the grain store , and get receipts for how much grain he had deposited .
The receipts could be used as money — even by people who did n’t need grain at that particular moment .
Everyone knew what it was worth .
The interesting thing about local , grain - based currencies was that they lost value over time .
The people at the grain store had to be paid , and a certain amount of grain was lost to rain or rodents .
So every year , the money would be worth less .
This encouraged people to spend it rather than save it .
And they did .
Late Middle
Ages workers were paid more for less work time than at any point in history .
Women were taller in England in that era than they are today — an indication of their relative health .
People did preventative maintenance on their equipment , and invested in innovation .
There was so much extra money looking for productive investment , that people built cathedrals .
The great cathedrals of Europe were not paid for with money from the Vatican ; they were local investments , made by small towns looking for ways to share their prosperity with future generations by creating tourist attractions .
Local currencies favored local transactions , and worked against the interests of large corporations working from far away .
In order to secure their own position as well as that of their chartered monopolies , monarchs began to make local currencies illegal , and force locals to instead use “ coin of the realm . ”
These centralized currencies worked the opposite way .
They were not earned into existence , they were lent into existence by a central bank .
This meant any money issued to a person or business had to be paid back to the central bank , with interest .
What does that do to an economy ?
It bankrupts it .
Think of it this way : A business borrows 1000 dollars from the bank to get started .
In ten years , say , it is supposed to pay back 2000 to the bank .
Where does the other 1000 come from ?
Some other business that has borrowed 1000 from the bank .
For one business to pay back what it owes , another must go bankrupt .
That , or borrow yet another 1000 , and so on .
An economy based on an interest - bearing centralized currency must grow to survive , and this means extracting more , producing more and consuming more .
Interest - bearing currency favors the redistribution of wealth from the periphery ( the people ) to the center ( the corporations and their owners ) .
Just sitting on money — capital — is the most assured way of increasing wealth .
By the very mechanics of the system , the rich get richer on an absolute and relative basis .
The biggest wealth generator of all was banking itself .
By lending money at interest to people and businesses who had no other way to conduct transactions or make investments , banks put themselves at the center of the extraction equation .
The longer the economy survived , the more money would have to be borrowed , and the more interest earned by the bank .
Financial Meltdown
Which is pretty much how things have worked over the past 500 years to today .
So what went wrong ?
Nothing .
The system worked exactly as it was supposed to .
The problem was that after America ’s post WWII expansion , there was really no longer any real growth area in the economy from which to extract wealth .
We were producing and consuming about as much as we could .
Almost no commercial activity was occurring outside the corporate system .
There was no room left to grow .
Sure , outsourcing , lay - offs , and technology created some efficiencies , but wars , rising costs of health care , and exchange rates essentially offset any gains .
Making matters worse , all that capital that the wealthy had accumulated needed markets — even fake markets — in which to be invested .
There was a ton of money out there — just nowhere to put it .
Nothing on which to speculate .
The dot.com boom seemed to offer the promise of a new market , but it fizzled almost as quickly as it rose .
So speculators turned instead to real assets , like corn , oil , even real estate .
They started investing speculatively on the things that real people need to stay alive .
What real people did n’t understand was that there is no way to compete against speculators .
Speculators are n’t buying homes in which to live — they are buying houses to flip .
Speculators are n’t buying corn to eat or oil to burn , but bushels to hoard and tankers to park off shore until prices rise .
The fact that the speculative economy for cash and commodities accounts for over 95 % of economic transactions , while people actually using money and consuming commodities constitute less than 5 % tells us something important .
Real supply and demand have almost nothing to do with prices .
We do not live in an economy , we live in a Ponzi scheme .
Luckily for us , the banks , and the speculators depending on them , made a bad wager : they bet on our continuing capacity to provide a reality on which to base their highly leveraged schemes .
We just could n’t do it .
They put us between a rock and a hard place .
With George W ’s help , they sold us on the notion of home ownership as a prerequisite to the American dream .
And they created a number of loan products which made it look as if we could actually afford over - priced homes .
The banking industry spent hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying for laws making bankruptcy difficult or impossible for average people to accomplish — while simultaneously selling average people loans that they would never be able to pay back .
The banks did n’t really care , anyway , since they never meant to keep these loans .
They simply provided the cash to mortgage companies , who then packaged the loans .
In return for putting up the original cash , the banks also won the right to underwrite the sale of those mortgage packages to investors — investors like pension funds , retirement funds , or you and me .
Get it ?
The banks get all the interest , but we put up all the money .
Our retirement accounts and pension funds invest in the very mortgages that we ca n’t pay back .
The bank collects any interest , playing both sides of the equation but responsible for neither .
And when the whole scheme begins to break down , what do we do ?
We try to bail out the very banks that created the mess , under the premise that we need these banks in order for business to come back , since only banks can lend the capital required for businesses to flourish .
Yes ,
It is Wrong
President Obama may be smarter than most of us , but he ’s still attempting to rescue the very institutions that robbed us in the first place .
He ’s not a socialist , as conservatives may be arguing , but he is a corporatist .
Using future tax dollars to fund government job programs is one thing .
Using future tax dollars to give banks more money to lend out at interest is robbing from the poor to pay the rich to rob from the poor .
As painful as it might be to watch , and as irritating as it might be to those with shrinking retirement savings , the collapse of the centralized corporate economy is ultimately a good thing .
It makes room for a real economy to rise up in its place .
And while it may be temporarily uncomfortable for the rich , and even temporarily devastating for the poor , it may be the fastest and least violent way to dismantle a system set in place for the benefit of 14th Century monarchs who have long since left this earth .
If the corporate supermarket chain ’s debt structure renders it incapable of stocking its shelves this spring , this may be the wake - up call that consumers need to finally subscribe to a Community Supported Agriculture farmer .
If the former associate fund analyst at Lehman realizes that he is unable to get a job not just because his industry is contracting but because his work day creates no real value for anyone at all , he will be forced to learn how to do something that does .
If an urban elite parent realizes he can no longer pay private school tuition for his kids , maybe he ’ll consider donating to public school the time he would have spent earning that tuition .
In short , the less we are able to depend on business - as - usual to provide for our basic needs , the more we will be forced to provide them for ourselves and one another .
Sometimes we ’ll do this for free , because we like each other , or live in the same community .
Sometimes we ’ll exchange services or favors .
Sometimes we ’ll use one of the alternative , local currencies coming into use across the country as Central bank - issued currencies become too hard to get without a corporate job .
Deprived of centralized banks and corporations , we ’ll be forced to do things again .
And in the process , we ’ll find out that these institutions were not our benefactors at all .
They were never meant to be .
They were invented to mediate transactions between people , and extract the value that would have passed between us .
Far from making commerce or industry more efficient , they served to turn the real world into a set of speculative assets , and real people into debtors .
The current financial crisis is the best opportunity we have had in a very long time for a bloodless revolution against the faceless fascism under which we have been living , unaware , for much too long .
Let us seize the day .
