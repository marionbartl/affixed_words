Polar Mesospheric Clouds ( also known as noctilucent clouds ) are transient , upper atmospheric phenomena observed usually in the summer months at high latitudes ( greater than 50 degrees ) of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres .
This image was acquired at an altitude of just over 200 miles in the pre-dawn hours of July 22 , 2008 as the International Space Station was passing over western Mongolia in central Asia .
A weirdly wonderful sight appeared to astronauts aboardthe International Space Station this summer — thin blue clouds hovering at theboundary between Earth 's atmosphere and the void .
The noctilucent or " night - shining " clouds are at an altitude of 47 to 53 miles ( 76 to 85 km ) , where meteors and bright aurora lights are not uncommon and the atmosphere gives way to theblackness of space .
The clouds remain a scientifically baffling phenomenon morethan 120 years after their discovery .
" It 's lovely , " said Gary Thomas , an atmosphericscientist at the University of Colorado after looking at a photo taken from thespace station .
" And it shows just how high these clouds really are ?
atthe very edge of space . "
The clouds form at dizzying heights where the air is onehundred million times drier than the Sahara .
By contrast , the commonhigh - altitude cirrus clouds only reach heights of 11 miles ( 18 km ) up .
" We have a fairly good idea that the water vaporfrom below gets transported upwards , " Thomas told SPACE.com .
" That is in essence the fuel . "
Part of that water vapor comes from rising air in thetropics , where a few parts per million of water escape into farthest reaches ofthe upper atmosphere .
Another likely source of water vapor is methaneoxidation .
Methane concentrations have more than doubled over the past 100 years , which could explain part of the changes in the high - flying clouds overthe past decades .
People first spotted the noctilucent clouds a few yearsafter the 1883 eruption of the Krakatoa super - volcano in Indonesia createdspectacular sunsets from ash in the atmosphere .
Robert Leslie of Southampton , England saw the clouds one evening in July 1885 and published the firstobservations in the journal Nature .
The clouds have since spread from the northern latituderegions such as Scandinavia , Scotland and Siberia to areas farther south .
Sightings have cropped up in Washington and Oregon in the United States , aswell as in Turkey and Iran .
Scientists can observe widespread instances of the cloudsthroughout the polar summer .
Some clouds even formedafter the fateful launch of the doomed space shuttle Columbia , when 400tons of water from the shuttle exhaust drifted toward the South Pole .
The mystery only thickened after the launchof a satellite dubbed Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere ( AIM ) in 2007 , whenAIM spotted a type of " stealth " noctilucent cloud made of smaller icecrystals less than 30 nanometers ( a red blood cell is about 10,000 nanometers ) .
Such clouds appear to stay in the upper atmosphere all the time .
" They 're just so tiny that they do n't scatter lightefficiently , " Thomas said .
AIM has also found a strong resemblance between thenoctilucent clouds and tropospheric clouds that hover near Earth 's surface , which suggests that the dynamics of near - space weather may not be incrediblystrange after all .
Researchers speculate that the origin and spread of theclouds is linked to patterns of climate change associated with the modern era .
But they are not ruling out a host of other possible factors , includingmethane , carbon dioxide , the number of meteors seeding the upper atmosphere , and even the 11 - year sunspot cycle .
" I think the jury 's still out on that , " Thomas said .
"
We 're just trying to understand now how clouds form and how they vary . "
A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Saturday ordering Vice President Dick Cheney and the National Archives to preserve all of his official records .
U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar - Kotelly ’s order came in response to a lawsuit filed this month by the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington .
The group , joined by several historians and open - government advocates , warned that Cheney might destroy or withhold important documents as the Bush administration winds down if he interprets the Presidential Records
Act of 1978 as applying to only some of his official papers .
That , in turn , could deprive historians and the general public of valuable records that illustrate Cheney ’s role .
He is widely considered to be the most influential vice president in history because of how he has helped to form U.S. policy in the last 7 1/2 years , they said .
Kollar - Kotelly , who was appointed by President Clinton , issued her order despite assertions from Cheney ’s representatives that he was preserving all the records he is required to under the 1978 law .

“ It ’s a pretty strong opinion , ” said Anne Weismann , chief counsel for the watchdog group .
“ They will be prevented from destroying anything .
It basically means they have to preserve everything in the broadest possible interpretation of what the law requires -- not their narrow interpretation . ”
A spokesman for Cheney said the vice president ’s office would not comment on pending litigation .
Open - government advocates are nervous about the fate of Cheney ’s papers , because the vice president has long resisted revealing any aspect of the inner workings of his office .
Cheney also has argued that he is not part of the executive branch .
In court filings , Claire M. O’Donnell , Cheney ’s deputy chief of staff , offered a narrower definition of vice presidential records than the one in the law .

But that definition excludes many records , including those relating to Cheney ’s work on the National Security Council and those where he acted without instructions from the president , such as his efforts to win reauthorization of a top - secret warrantless wiretapping program , the plaintiffs argued .
Kollar - Kotelly agreed and ordered all records preserved .

Mind over matter : Monkey feeds itself using its brain
A monkey has successfully fed itself with fluid , well - controlled movements of a human - like robotic arm by using only signals from its brain , researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine report in the journal Nature .
This significant advance could benefit development of prosthetics for people with spinal cord injuries and those with “ locked - in ” conditions such as Lou Gehrig ’s disease , or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis .
“ Our immediate goal is to make a prosthetic device for people with total paralysis , ” said Andrew Schwartz , Ph.D. , senior author and professor of neurobiology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine .
“ Ultimately , our goal is to better understand brain complexity . ”
Previously , work has focused on using brain - machine interfaces to control cursor movements displayed on a computer screen .
Monkeys in the Schwartz lab have been trained to command cursor movements with the power of their thoughts .
“ Now we are beginning to understand how the brain works using brain - machine interface technology , ” said Dr. Schwartz .
“ The more we understand about the brain , the better we ’ll be able to treat a wide range of brain disorders , everything from Parkinson ’s disease and paralysis to , eventually , Alzheimer ’s disease and perhaps even mental illness . ”
Using this technology , monkeys in the Schwartz lab are able to move a robotic arm to feed themselves marshmallows and chunks of fruit while their own arms are restrained .
Computer software interprets signals picked up by probes the width of a human hair .
The probes are inserted into neuronal pathways in the monkey ’s motor cortex , a brain region where voluntary movement originates as electrical impulses .
The neurons ’ collective activity is then evaluated using software programmed with a mathematic algorithm and then sent to the arm , which carries out the actions the monkey intended to perform with its own limb .
Movements are fluid and natural , and evidence shows that the monkeys come to regard the robotic device as part of their own bodies .
The primary motor cortex , a part of the brain that controls movement , has thousands of nerve cells , called neurons , which fire together as they contribute to the generation of movement .
Because of the massive number of neurons that fire at the same time to control even the simplest of actions , it would be impossible to create probes that capture the firing pattern of each .
Pitt researchers developed a special algorithm that uses limited information from about 100 neurons to fill in the missing signals .
“ In our research , we ’ve demonstrated a higher level of precision , skill and learning , ” explained Dr. Schwartz .
“ The monkey learns by first observing the movement , which activates his brain cells as if he were doing it .
It ’s a lot like sports training , where trainers have athletes first imagine that they are performing the movements they desire . ”
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Health officials have called off plans for a study examining a controversial type of treatment that some autism activists have touted as alternative medical therapy for children with the condition .
Families from across the U.S. living with autism take part in a rally calling to eliminate toxins from children 's vaccines in Washington June 4 , 2008 .

The National Institute of Mental Health , or NIMH , part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health , said in a statement on Wednesday that it has canceled a study aimed at assessing the effectiveness of a treatment called chelation .
Chelation ( pronounced key - LAY - shun ) is a type of therapy in which a man -made amino acid , called EDTA , is added to the blood , and it has been used to treat heavy metal poisoning .
Some autism activists have advocated it on the theory -- rejected by most scientists -- that autism is triggered by exposure to mercury , a heavy metal , from childhood vaccines .
Many studies and medical experts have dismissed the notion that mercury used in a vaccine preservative causes autism , but some parents of autistic children strongly believe it does .
Since 2001 , with the exception of some influenza vaccines , the mercury - containing preservative has not been used in routinely recommended childhood vaccines , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
“ NIMH has decided that resources are better directed at this time to testing other potential therapies for autism spectrum disorders , and is not pursuing the additional review required to begin the study , ” the institute said .
The study was given initial permission to proceed in 2006 , according to NIMH ’s statement .
“ No subjects were recruited for this clinical trial , ” according to the statement .
“ In February 2007 , based on new scientific data , an NIH Institutional Review Board reassessed the risk - benefit ratio of the proposed study .
The board determined that there was no clear evidence for direct benefit to the children who would participate in the chelation trial and that the study presents more than a minimal risk , ” it added .
The institute said the only way that the study could go forward would be through an additional governmental approval process , and it decided not to pursue this .

Barack Obama ’s now - famous text - message announcement of his VP pick reveals something about the candidate that should really worry the Republicans .
What it reveals is not that he ’s a smart technologist .
If he was , he would have known that sending 10 million SMS messages at the same time is pretty much guaranteed not to work ; it ’s not designed for that .
What it does reveal is that this is probably the smartest marketing campaign we ’ve seen in decades .
It ’s well known that Obama ’s campaign is sophisticated about collecting and cross-referencing voter contacts and using this information to identify two especially important populations : new voters and persuadable voters .
Most elections are won by fewer than 10 percentage points .
Real blowouts are very rare and usually only happen when a popular incumbent is running for re-election .
So the game is all about finding the 5 to 10 percent of the population that can swing the election .
What impressed me about the text - message campaign was that it was an effective device for collecting millions of voter contacts , while also signaling that Obama connects with young people .
This wo n’t do much to persuade 50 - something independents in the Midwest , but this is the type of marketing campaign that will get young people to register and to get to the polls .
Here are just a few examples of things the campaign can now do with these phone numbers :
Conduct non-intrusive surveys ( e.g. are you registered to vote yet ?
what zip code are you in ? )
On a state - by - state basis , send reminder messages about the cutoff dates for voter registration and link to registration forms
On a state - by - state basis , tell people to mail in their ballots to vote absentee
Invite people to campaign events in their area code
Remind people to get out and vote on Election Day ( believe it or not , some people forget , although you ’d need to be hiding in a cave to miss this one )
Promote down - ballot candidates on a zipcode - by - zipcode basis
The first two items alone are probably worth a lot of votes .
It ’s easy to miss the cutoff dates for voter registration , and this is a simple way to make sure everyone gets registered in time .
Encouraging people to vote by mail is another good way to increase participation , especially among populations that find it difficult to take off work to go to the polls .
Elections are all about turnout , which is all about voter contact and engagement .
This means different things for different demographics .
Among older voters , more traditional campaign tactics are key .
Among minority voters , churches and unions are important “ sales channels . ”
This is the first election I can recall where a candidate has really worked to connect with young voters , who are not accessible via the traditional channels .
I think that ’s why youth turnout is historically weak .
Partly it ’s apathy , but it ’s mostly because they ’re harder to reach , which the Obama campaign seems to have figured out this time around .
Since most people who registered to get the VP announcement were under 40 , this should be an opportunity to move the needle a couple of percentage points .
Will he be a good president ?
I do n’t know — you never really do until they get in — but I ’ve been impressed by the campaign , and I am interested to see how they run the remaining two months .
The Republicans should be worried .
John McCain is a good candidate , but his campaign seems tired .
He may win a poll among voters today , but that wo n’t matter if the Obama campaign succeeds in bringing several million new voters out to cast a ballot in November .
It ’s a tight race , and like in 2000 , it will ultimately be decided by who shows up .

The Government is drawing up plans to use unmanned “ drone ” aircraft currently deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan to counter terrorism and aid police operations in Britain .
The MoD is carrying out research and development to enable the spy planes , which are equipped with highly sophisticated monitoring equipment that allows them to secretly track and photograph suspects without their knowledge , to be deployed within three years .
The plans have been backed by the House of Commons Defence Committee but have attracted criticism from civil liberties campaigners concerned about the implications of covert surveillance of civilians .

Sarah Palin has caused the new President of Pakistan to have a Fatwa issued against him after their meeting in New York City was described as ‘ flirtatious ’ [ source ] :
Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari seems to be heading towards fresh trouble as the prayer leader of the Lal Masjid in the heart of Islamabad has issued a fatwa against him .
Maulana Abdul Ghafar , the prayer leader , seems to be irked by Zardari ’s “ you ’re gorgeous ” compliment to US vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin during a meeting .
When Zardari was asked to keep shaking hands with Palin for the cameras , he said , “ If he ’s ( the aide ) insisting , I might hug you . ”
He said the act was un -Islamic and unbecoming of a head of state of a Muslim country .
Maulana also said that Zardari shamed the entire Pakistani by publicly making indecent gestures towards Palin in Washington last Thursday .
In the days after the trial , one juror had a question .
After a week - long trial — sitting with 11 other people in the jury box in Clayton County Superior Court and listening to four defense attorneys , a prosecuting attorney and a string of family members , police officers and experts — she still had a question .
She did n’t bring up the question when the judge read the law , on a Thursday afternoon in May .
It did come up briefly , however , during jury deliberations .
The jury wrote a note asking the judge .
It was the last thing the jury did before court was dismissed for the night .
The question : What is aggravated assault ?
Sitting on the witness stand on Thursday , more than seven months after the trial ended and two men were each found guilty of two counts of aggravated assault , an appeals attorney asked former juror Stacey Sullivan about that question .
“ Did you understand what that charge meant ? ” asked Herbert Adams , Jr. , during a hearing on a motion for the retrial of the two men convicted of shooting and killing 4 - year - old Travon Wilson .
“ I did n’t fully understand , ” Sullivan said .
“ If you had fully understood , would you have voted differently ? ” Adams pressed .
Sullivan chewed gum .
She has streaked blonde hair .
She wore royal blue hospital scrubs and hoop earring and she did n’t want to be there , on the stand .
“ It may have been different , ” she said .
Sullivan was one of a few jurors from the Wilson murder trial who went to the defense attorney ’s office , the week after the verdict , and asked the question .
Xavious Cordera Taylor , 18 , and Christopher Allen Emmanuel , 19 , were each found guilty of two counts of aggravated assault in connection with the child ’s death .
Two other men were found not guilty .
Eleven others pleaded to lesser sentences for their parts .
Wilson was shot while riding his red bicycle , a birthday present , in the park in Riverdale in 2004 .
According to police and prosecutors , two gangs met at the park in 2004 to fight .
The Hit Squad gang , including Taylor , and the Southside Mafia gang , including Emmanuel , met by arrangement around 10 p.m. that spring .
Taylor was sentenced to 35 years .
Emmanuel , who admitted to firing an SKS assault rifle in the park the night Wilson was killed , was sentenced to 40 years .
The jurors wrote out the question about the definition of aggravated assault and gave it to a bailiff to give to the judge , after a few hours of deliberations .
According to state law , aggravated assault is defined as an assault with “ an intent to murder , to rape or rob , ” an assault with “ a deadly weapon , ” or an assault with “ any object when used offensively against a person is likely to or actually does result in bodily injury .
” The judge received a second note written on lined yellow paper before the jury went home for the night telling him to disregard the previous question .
“ The court has a duty , a legal duty , to answer their question , ” Adams said during last week ’s hearing on a motion to impeach the verdict and retry the case .
In the more than 2,000 pages of trial transcripts , the question comes at the end of the ninth volume .
According to Judge Matthew Simmons , he told the four defense attorneys the next morning that the question had been withdrawn .
None of them objected .
A few days after the trial , Sullivan and other jury members went to one of the lawyers and asked why the question had never been answered .
In a sworn affidavit written by Adams and signed by Sullivan , Sullivan said understanding the charge would definitely have led her to a different verdict .
Adams subpoenaed her to testify at the hearing on the motion to retry the case , hoping to use a juror ’s confusion to undermine the jury ’s verdict .
A few days before the hearing , Sullivan walked into the district attorney ’s office crying , saying she did n’t want to testify and she did n’t mean for her question to be a defense of Taylor and Emmanuel , said Deputy Chief Assistant District Attorney John Turner .
The motion for a retrial was routine , Turner said .
The other arguments in the hearing — including the argument that part of Riverdale might not be in Clayton County so maybe the defendants were tried in the wrong jurisdiction — were routine .
The box of trial transcripts sitting on the judge ’s desk , the appeals attorney calling on the defense attorney to testify for their client , the inmates wearing red jumpsuits trying to turn around to see their families sitting in the back of the mostly - empty courtroom — all of this was normal legal proceedings in the years following a long sentence .
What was unusual , in the hearing , was the juror on the witness stand .
“ It ’s legal garbage , ” Turner said .
“ That ’s nonsense , ” Adams said .
“ According to the Georgia legal code and case law , ” Turner said , “ juror confusion is not grounds for impeaching a verdict .
Juror misconduct would be reason for a new trial .
This is not sufficient to grant a new trial .
Georgia law is clear that this is unacceptable .
” On the stand , Sullivan maintained her question but hedged on the importance of the answer .
“ You ’re not sure that anything may have been different ?
Is that your testimony today ? ” Turner asked her .
“ I ’m not sure , ” she said .
When asked about the trial , Sullivan told the court she did n’t remember any specifics .
Defense Attorney Katrina Breeding said she thought the hedging was enough to move for a retrial .
“ That ’s all we need , ” she told Simmons .
“ A ‘ maybe . ’
That ’s not beyond a reasonable doubt .
” Simmons , after listening to more than an hour of criticism of the way he handled the trial , denied the motion to retry .
He told the lawyers that it was an aggressively tried case , and he did n’t think the four defense attorneys were sleeping through the trial , ignoring opportunities to object to the way it was tried .
“ I ’m going to deny the motion and you can take it up with the appeals court , ” Simmons said .
Sullivan left the courthouse frowning when she was done testifying , not waiting for the judge ’s ruling .
Emmanuel ’s mother walked through the double doors into the hallway , sat down and wept .
The Dark Knight keeps surprising us ... first , it was the movie itself .
Now , some products related to the epic are getting some attention .
Hollywood have always got some good merchandising for their movie , specially when the subject is Action Figures .
Action Figures have always been a big PART of our lives .
Not our lives ?
Well , at least MY life .
But if you can relate to that , than you 'll probably get all jumpy when you get to see this sweet Joker action figure .
Different from the first TDK action figures featuring the regular Joker outfit , this one features the Bank Robber version of our favorite villain .
Update : I forgot to post the picture where it shows all the accessories ... there is also an extra head , so that 's why his expression and hair change . ;)
Pretty cool , right ?
Yeah , yeah ... but you just really realize who GREAT this action figure is just when you first get to see Joker 's face .
One problem about action figures of humans , is that most times the artist do n't get to represent the actor 's face perfectly .
There 's always that plastic toy look on it .
But NOT THIS ONE .
I was truly amazed when I saw the Joker 's face .
Not impressed yet ?
Then take a look at these ' portraits ' ... if you 're not impressed easily , this will do just the trick :
Take a good look at the 3rd one of the 2nd row .
It 's like a picture of Ledger 's face .
AMAZING .
And like a good action figure , it comes with MANY extra acessories :
Extra head with other expression and hair .
Clown mask .
Handgun with removable magazine .
MK760 with removable magazine .
Sling Bag
Fragmentation grenade ( x 4 )
Smoke grenade ( x 3 )
2 pairs of gloved hands
Playing Cards
Dollar Bills
This is the secret of the " many faces " .
And for those just getting crazy about it , " The Joker , Bank Robber " version is brought to you by great Hot Toys , the same from " Mark 2 " and " Mark 3 " action figures .
And just to finish this post the right way , if you are still not impressed about the Joker 's AF , just take a look at this picture and think with yourself for a second whether or not this is a still from the movie .
How about a magic trick ? ;)
This is the fourth installment in a series of posts about making highly concurrent software easier to write in Java .
Previous entries are available here : part 1 , part 2 , part 3 .
However , I aim to make it possible to follow along even if you have n’t read the previous posts .
I Have Seen the Future …
If you have used the Java 5 concurrency API at all , you will have come across the Future class .
For example , when you submit a Callable < Integer > to an ExecutorService , what you get back is a Future < Integer > which represents a computation , running concurrently , that will ( hopefully ) result in an integer at some time in the future .
Once you have the Future < Integer > fi , you can later get the integer out of it by calling fi.get ( ) .
That ’s all fine and dandy , but let ’s say you want do do something like add two future integers .
You could do something like this :
int sum = x.get ( ) + y.get ( ) ;
This will block the current thread until both of those integers are available , then add them together .
But why wait for that ?
If you have an ExecutorService , you can create a new Future that computes the sum :
Future < Integer > sum = executorService.submit( new Callable < Integer >( ) { public Integer call ( ) { return x.get ( ) + y.get ( ) ; } } ) ;
Now the current thread can continue , but we ’ve started a new thread that does nothing until the values of x and y have both been calculated by yet another thread .
We ’re beginning to see a problem here .
We want to be able to compose Futures together to form new Futures , but find that the number of threads required to compose n Future values is on the order of O ( n ) .
If we have a fixed - size thread pool , we ’ll run into starvation .
If we have an unbounded thread pool , then we might start more threads than the operating system can handle , most of which will be doing nothing at all but wait for other threads .
This should all sound very familiar .
Threads are a space resource .
What kind of processes are O( n ) in their space requirement ?
If you said “ linearly recursive processes ” , go to the head of the class .
Intuitively , for the same reason that we can find iterative versions of any recursive algorithm , it seems that we should be able to find an algorithm to accomplish the same thing with O ( 1 ) threads .
… and it is a Monad
In the above example , it ’s like we ’re giving seperate instructions , waiting for the results of each in between .
Imagine if we were working in an office with Bob and Alice , and we needed work on something from both of them .
We might go to Bob and say : “ Bob , process this and give me the result ” .
Then we ’d take the result to Alice and say : “ Alice , here ’s a result from Bob . ”
It would be much better , if we could just go to Bob and say : “ Bob , process this and give the result to Alice . ”
This is the essential difference between recursive and iterative processes .
But wait !
We say that kind of thing all the time , in Java :
public Work bob( Work w ) { ... } public Work alice ( Work w ) { ... } public Work bobThenAlice ( Work w ) {
Work b = bob(w ) ; return alice ( b ) ; }
Here , we ’re instructing a single thread to do some work , then use the result of that work to do more work .
What ’s really sneaky here is the meaning of the semicolon .
In this context , what the former semicolon means is “ take the stored value b from the previous statement and bind it to the free variable b in the next statement ” .
You can think of the second semicolon as binding a blank statement over the result of the preceding statement .
Using first - class functions from Functional Java , and using the Callables monad from the first part of this series , you could implement that same behaviour using something like this :
F< Work , Callable < Work >> bob = new F < Work , Callable < Work >>( ) { public Callable < Work > f( final Work w ) { return new Callable < Work > ( ) { public Work call ( ) { ... } } ; } } ; F< Work , Callable < Work >> alice = new F < Work , Callable < Work >>( ) { ... } ; public Callable < Work > bobThenAlice ( Work w ) { return Callables.bind( bob.f( w ) , alice ) ; }
That ’s pretty neat .
Now we have a single Callable that we can run concurrently in a new thread , turning it into a Future .
But would n’t it be cool if we could bind Futures ?
That would let us take already running computations and combine them in exactly this way .
We want a Future monad .
The problem with combining Futures is in the nature of the future .
This is a deliberate pun on “ future ” .
Think about time for a second .
What does it mean to get a value that ’s in the future ?
By the very fact that causality is sequential , it ’s a violation of the nature of reality to have something that does n’t yet exist .
It ’s the future ; you ’re not supposed to get stuff out .
But , we can put stuff in , ca n ’t we ?
Yes we can .
You know those corny time - capsule things where people put their mountain bikes and Nintendo games for future generations to enjoy later ?
We can do that with data values .
And not just values , but computations .
Here ’s One I Made Earlier
The Future class in the standard Java libraries does n’t come with any methods for projecting computations into the future .
But Functional Java comes with a class called Promise < A > which does have that feature .
It makes use of light - weight concurrent processes ( actors ) , and parallel strategies , as described in the previous post , to implement the ability to combine concurrent computations into larger ( concurrently executing ) structures .
Since it is implemented as a monad , the methods it provides are all the usual suspects : unit , bind , fmap , join , etc .
Here ’s a quick overview of what they do and why they ’re useful .
Grasping them does n’t just help you understand the Promise class , but any monad you may come across in the ( ahem ) future .
The unit function , the constructor of Promises , is just called promise .
It has a few overloaded forms , but here is the simplest one .
public static < A > Promise < A > promise ( Strategy < A> s , P1 < A > p ) ;
The P1 class is just a simple closure with no arguments , provided by the Functional Java library .
P1 < A > consists of one abstract method : A _1 ( ) .
Strategy represents a method of evaluating P1s concurrently .
I also talk about Strategies in the previous post , but the long and the short of it is that it has methods to evaluate the P1 value according to some parallelisation strategy , like with a thread pool for instance .
Calling the promise method starts a concurrent computation , in a manner according to the given strategy , that evaluates p .
The resulting Promise value is a handle on the running computation , and can be used to retrieve the value later .
Promise.claim ( ) will block the current thread until the value is available , exactly like Future. get ( ) , but this is generally not what you want to do .
Instead , you want to bind .
The essence of the monad pattern is the binding function .
If you do n’t think you already know what a monad is , but understand this method , then you know more than you think :
public Promise < B> bind( F< A , Promise < B >> f ) ;
This method means that if you have a Promise of an A , and a function from an A to a Promise of a B , you can get a Promise of a B .
I.e. if somebody promises you an A , and I can promise you a B for every A , it ’s the same thing as being promised a B in the first place .
The mapping function :
public Promise < B> fmap ( F< A , B > f ) ;
This method means that if you have an Promise of an A , and a function from A to B , you can get a Promise of a B .
In other words , you can map any function over a Promise , and fmap will return you a Promise of the result .
Behind the scenes , fmap is implemented by calling the bind and promise methods .
The difference between this method and the bind method is subtle but important .
Calling p.bind(f ) is exactly equivalent to calling Promise. join ( p.fmap (f ) ) .
The join function :
public static < A > Promise < A> join ( Promise < Promise <A >> a ) ;
Join is a lot more useful than it looks .
If you have a promised Promise , it ’s the same as just having a Promise .
In practise , that means that if you can start a concurrent task that starts a concurrent task , you can combine those into one concurrent task .
You can think of it as the semantic equivalent of Thread. join ( ) , except that our method returns the joined Promise immediately .
Coming back to Bob and Alice for a second , we can implement bob and alice from the Callables example above , using Promise instead of Callable .
Both bob and alice will construct Promises using the promise method , putting whatever work they do inside a P1 .
That way , when you call bob , he ’s already doing his work by the time you mention Alice ’s name :
final Strategy < Work > s = Strategy.simpleThreadStrategy ( ) ; F< Work , Promise < Work >> bob = new F < Work , Promise < Work >>( ) { public Promise < Work > f( final Work w ) { return promise(s , new P1 ( ) { public Work _ 1 ( ) { ... } } ) ; } } ; F< Work , Promise < Work >> alice = new F < Work , Promise < Work >>( ) { ... } ; public Promise < Work > bobThenAlice( Work w ) { return bob .f( w ) .bind ( alice ) ; }
So now that we can build arbitrarily complex concurrent processes from already - running processes , how do we get the final promised value out ?
Again , you could call Promise.claim ( ) , but that blocks the current thread as we know .
Instead , Promise comes equipped with a method to ( Actor < A > ) which promises to send the value to the given Actor as soon as it ’s ready .
Control is returned to the current thread immediately , and the whole computation continues in the background , including the action to take on the final result .
Actors were discussed in the previous post .
A Fully Functional Example
I think an example is in order .
The following program calculates Fibonacci numbers using a naive recursive algorithm .
This is an algorithm that benefits particularly well from parallelisation ( barring any other kind of optimisation ) .
If we were just using plain old Future instead of Promise , the number of Threads required to calculate the nth Fibonacci number is O ( fib ( n ) ) .
But since we ’re using Promise , we can use a fixed number of actual Java threads .

// This actor performs output and detects the termination condition .
final Actor > out = actor ( su , new Effect >( ) {

}
//
The sequential version of the recursive Fibonacci function
public static int seqFib( final int n ) {
return n < 2 ? n : seqFib(n - 1 ) + seqFib(n - 2 ) ; } } [ / sourcecode ]
For all you Scala fans out there , the Functional Java library comes with convenient bindings for Scala as well .
Here ’s the same thing written in Scala .
Note that this does not use the Actor library from the standard Scala libraries , but the same lighter weight Java implementation that the Java example above uses .
package concurrent

This actor performs output and detects the termination condition .
val out : Actor [ List [ Int ] ] = actor{ ns =>
for ( ( n , i ) %d
” , i , n )
pool.shutdown ( )
}
// A parallel recursive Fibonacci function
def fib(n : Int ) : Promise [ Int ] = {
if ( n < CUTOFF ) promise ( ( ) => seqFib(n ) )
else fib(n – 1 ) . bind ( fib( n – 2 ) , curry ( (_ : Int ) + ( _ : Int ) ) )
}
println ( “ Calculating Fibonacci sequence in parallel… ” )
out !
sequence ( parMap [ Int , Promise [ Int ] , List ] ( fib , range ( 0 , 46 ) ) ) ;
}
//
The sequential version of the recursive Fibonacci function
def seqFib( n : Int ) : Int = if ( n < 2 ) n else seqFib( n - 1 ) + seqFib(n - 2 ) ; } [ / sourcecode ]
Here 's an example run of this program using a pool of 10 threads .
It runs about 7 times faster that way than with just 1 thread on my 8 - way machine .
The Scala version is also very slightly faster for some reason .
$ scala - classpath .:../../../ build/classes/src concurrent .
Fibs 10 Calculating Fibonacci sequence in parallel … n=0 => 0 n=1 => 1 n=2 => 1 n=3 => 2 n=4 => 3 n=5 => 5 n=6 => 8 n=7 => 13 n=8 => 21 n=9 => 34 n=10 => 55 n=11 => 89 n=12 => 144 n=13 => 233 n=14 => 377 n=15 => 610 n=16 => 987 n=17 => 1597 n=18 => 2584 n=19 => 4181 n=20 => 6765 n=21 => 10946 n=22 => 17711 n=23 => 28657 n=24 => 46368 n=25 => 75025 n=26 => 121393 n=27 => 196418 n=28 => 317811 n=29 => 514229 n=30 => 832040 n=31 => 1346269 n=32 => 2178309 n=33 => 3524578 n=34 => 5702887 n=35 => 9227465 n=36 => 14930352 n=37 => 24157817 n=38 => 39088169 n=39 => 63245986 n=40 =>

267914296 n=43 => 433494437 n=44 => 701408733 n=45 =>
1134903170
Massive win !
If we had been using Future instead of Promise , we would have needed at least 55 threads ( since we ’re using a cutoff at 35 and 45 – 35 = 10 and fib ( 10 ) = 55 ) .
Heck , we could even remove the threshold value altogether and calculate all 45 parallel fibs , in parallel .
That would require 1,134,903,170 threads in the absence of non-blocking concurrency abstractions like Promise and Actor .
We can run that in just one thread if we ’d like .
Severe Gas Shortage Continues to Cripple Atlanta
September 30th , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
Motorists are cruising around Atlanta or waiting in long lines looking for gasoline .
Many fueling stations have run dry , while others have extremely long lines .
The result is fewer cars on the road and more carpooling .
Many have unsettling feeling and are concerned as gas prices soar .
Hurricanes Ike and Gustav and Ike caused many refineries to be closed , affecting north Georgia , parts of Tennessee , and west North Carolina .
Metro Atlanta has been particularly hard hit because cleaner fuel standards prohibit gas being diverted from other areas where supplies are more robust .
Gas prices have soared as a result from $ 3.75 per gallon on average in the Southeast just two weeks ago to $ 4.14 .
The Southeast is the only region of the country without extensive oil reserves , leaving it vulnerable to supply dips after natural disasters .
The Gulf pipelines which the Southeast depend on heavily continue to operate at low capacity .
Some might find the experience reminiscent of the 1973 oil crisis .
Others are realizing that public transportation is not ample .
Do such events affect long - term change or merely a short - term panic ?

The Panacea for Putting Things Off
Photo by Cindy Loughridge
Can you recall a time when you wanted to do something important , yet you ’ve managed to make enough excuses to leave it for a later date ?
Putting something off once makes it easier to put it off again , and before you know it , several weeks have past and you still have n’t done it ?
I just cleaned my entire apartment and it ’s almost time for bed , again .
Another day has gone by , and I still have n’t written a blog post for this week .
Two thoughts conflictingly popped up in my head :
Yes !
I ’ve successfully put it off for another day .
Crap !
I feel guilty for putting it off yet another day .
I really should get that done soon .
I ’ve got a lot going on in my life .
But , it ’s just became clear to me that I have spent the past five days unconsciously avoiding writing , while spending mental energy coming up with excuses .
Each time when I ’m about to start writing , I would magically feel hungry , tired , sleepy , thirsty , grumpy , dehydrated , or needing to go ‘ potty ’ .
Or I would suddenly have the desire to read , watch TV , browse the Internet , finish random low - priority tasks , clear out my email inbox , go jogging , sleep early and clean the house .
As you can see , my box of excuses is infinite .
When I recognized this , I sat down and started writing the article you ’re reading now .
A Few Observations
The more we make excuses , the more we buy into them , the easier it is to make additional excuses to support our mind - created beliefs .
These beliefs become our story , and our excuses become our reality .
Delaying is addictive .
Even if your intention is to put it off “ just this one time ” .
The act of putting it off sets a chain of reactions that will make it easier to delay this task again .
In fact , it becomes more likely that the task will be postponed again .
What we repeat in our mind actually exaggerates the scale of the task involved .
It snowballs larger and larger , until the task becomes so big that you will never get it done .
Constantly thinking about doing something but avoiding the actual act of doing it takes energy .
You end up spending more energy pondering about it and making excuses for it than just getting it done .
You ’ll actually save time and attention energy by just doing it .
We can only move on with our lives when we can get past our internal conflict between our story of procrastination and our desire to get it done .
You really start to be productive when you can change your attitude .
When you break the cycle and start , you ’ll be surprised at how quick and easy the task actually takes .
You ’ll be wondering why you did n’t just get it done in the first place .
The Cure
Stop thinking .
Just do it .
The System : Cure Expanded
Manage
It – List out all the things you are putting off .
Or rather , make a habit to write down all the tasks you want to complete .
Write down how long you think each task will take .
Now , double that number , that ’s how much time you should budget for the task .
The act of writing things down instead of holding it in your memory , frees up mental energy .
Make sure , every task is small and achievable within a few hours .
If not , break it down into several smaller tasks .
Take small steps before running down the finish line .

Prioritize
It – Give a number beside each item , starting with 1 being the highest priority , the most important .
– Give a number beside each item , starting with 1 being the highest priority , the most important .
Plan
It – Schedule it .
Make an appointment with yourself to complete the top 3 items on your list .
Do n’t schedule more than 3 in a day , it ’ll distract you .
Schedule other appointments with yourself only when the top 3 have been completed .
This idea of focusing on just the most important items first before doing any other tasks help to improve your personal efficiency , while reducing feelings of guilt from non-productive times .

Prepare to be focused .

Dig Deep In
It – If you find that you are skipping appointments with yourself .
Ask yourself why are you deliberately putting this off ?
What are you avoiding ?
What are you afraid of ?
There ’s always a reason .
If you come up blank , dig deeper within yourself .
Be honest .
Actively ask yourself this question until you have the answer .
Perhaps there ’s pain associated with the doing .
Perhaps , this is n’t want you really want to do .
Perhaps , you are afraid of failure .
Whatever the reason is , dig deep within yourself to discover the why .
Once you find the reason , what can you do about it ?
More Tips to Beat Putting - Things - Off
Language – Watch your language when you speak or think about the task .
Our language can have a powerful influence in the way we view our surrounding situations .
“ I should get that done ” implies that it ’s not something I really want to do but am obligated to do .
As a result , our subconscious mind is telling our conscious mind that we should n’t be spending time on this task , it ’s not what we want .
Is that really how you feel about the task ?
If not , see how you can rephrase the sentence to better reflect what the task means to you .
A more positive wording could perhaps be “ This is important to me , because it contributes towards the wellbeing of others .
I would love to get it done and I have scheduled times with myself to get it completed next week . ”

Commit – Make a decision to commit to getting it done .
A true commitment to doing something will bring with it the energy required to getting it done .
Nothing is as impossible or difficult is it seems .
Once we ’ve committed ourselves to some result and it is a result that we truly want , we ’ll feel the desire and push towards action arising intrinsically out of us , naturally .

Understand the Why – We often get so caught up in our routine of being busy , running from one task to the next that we forget to ask ourselves why we are really doing something .
Ask yourself why this is important to you ?
Understanding the true importance of something and why it matters to you will give perspective to the matter and bring you the encouragement you need to follow through .

Pain vs. Pleasure –
It is well known that we will go to further extent to avoid pain than we will at gaining pleasure .
Understanding the pains and pleasures from doing or not doing something can act as an effective motivator .
What will you lose if you do n’t complete it ?
What will you gain if you do complete it ?
Sometimes , the act of visualizing the pain from not doing something can act as a motivator to help you get it done .

Instant Gratification vs. Long Term Gain –
Thanks to modern conveniences and media , we as a society , especially in the western world , have become accustomed to instant gratification .
With a flick of a remote , we can browse through hundreds of TV channels .
With a phone call , we can have world cuisines delivered to our doors .
With a few clicks of a mouse , the books we wanted will show up at our doorsteps .
Microwave pizzas , bottled egg whites , and pre-packaged anything can be easily accessible with a quick trip to the local store .
These serve as short - term distracters away from what we can gain in the long term .
Spend some time to focus on your long term goal that this task contributes towards .
Is the short - term gratification worth it in risking your long - term gain ?
Is it worth compromising for your potential ?

Visual Reminders – I ’ve found it helpful to have visual reminders to do something that ’s important to me .
One way to do this is writing on a piece of paper what you need to do , and in smaller text why you want to do it .
Tape this paper somewhere you will see it : bathroom mirror , in front of your bed , on your keyboard .
This does n’t work if you have many reminders for different tasks , but for a couple of tasks , it can work magically .
Parting Words
Life is as hard or as easy as we make it .
The more we think about something ( anything , not just tasks ) , the more amplified it becomes from our perception , because we have given it energy by focusing on it .
Let ’s not torture ourselves by adding more stress in our already hectic lives .
It ’s okay to be busy and not have time to finish things .
Schedule it , forget about it and stick to the schedule .
Treat it like an appointment with yourself .
We respect others enough to show up at appointments punctually .
Why do n’t we do the same with ourselves ?
What are some secrets you use to overcome Putting Things Off ?
What works for you ?
See you in the comment section . :)
" this cannot be natural " .
What a dumbass .
Who 's the elitist again ?
When you have seven homes , that 's a lot of garages to fill .
After the fuss over the number of residences owned by the two presidential nominees , NEWSWEEK looked into the candidates ' cars .
And based on public vehicle - registration records , here 's the score .
John and Cindy McCain : 13 . Barack and Michelle Obama : one .
One vehicle in the McCain fleet has caused a small flap .
United Auto Workers president Ron Gettelfinger , an Obama backer , accused McCain this month of " flip - flopping " on who bought daughter Meghan 's foreign - made Toyota Prius .
McCain said last year that he bought it , but then told a Detroit TV station on Sept. 7 that Meghan " bought it , I believe , herself . "
( The McCain campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment . )
Obama 's lone vehicle also is a green machine , a 2008 Ford Escape hybrid .
He bought it last year to replace the family 's Chrysler 300C , a Hemi-powered sedan .
Obama ditched the 300C , once 50 Cent 's preferred ride , after taking heat for driving a guzzler while haranguing Detroit about building more fuel - efficient cars .
Wake up , American drivers !
With gas prices through the roof , you ’re undoubtedly sharing the road with record numbers of cyclists .
And guess what ?
Those cyclists have just as much right to the road as you do .
If you expect them to obey the rules of the road , you ’ve got to understand how to share that road with cyclists .
While on a short , 3.5 mile bike ride in my neighborhood , traversing no major thoroughfares , encountering no stoplights , I had no less than four unsafe cycling experiences .
A car peeled around a corner without slowing or signaling , almost hitting me .
Another driver almost hit me by slowing , not stopping , while I was legally proceeding through a four - way stop .
I was also tailgated so closely by a car that I had to pull over .
Finally , a driver opened up his door as I was right next to his car , causing me to have to suddenly swerve to avoid hitting the door .
I ’ve been riding my bike in much more serious traffic for years , and I ’ve been fortunate to not have a series of events like I had last night .
Cyclists , if you ’re on the road , you ’ve got to both know , and be confident in , the rules of the road .
You ’ve also got to be extremely vigilant , as you have a lot more to lose than a vehicle should the two of you tangle .
But drivers , you ’ve got to hold up your end of the bargain .
You ’re bigger and faster .
You ’ve got to know how to drive with cyclists on the road .
The Rules for Riding With Cyclists –Not Against Them
Be aware of cyclists .
I believe , because of the boom of cyclists , that it ’s imperative that drivers adjust their awareness of cyclists .
You can no longer just look for huge hunks of metal .
You ’ve got to be on the lookout for cyclists , too .
Just being cognizant of bikes on the road , not staring at us blankly wondering , “ What is this strange two - wheeled vehicle ? ” will go a long way .
In fact , a recent study in Australia just uncovered that more bikes on the road actually leads to less car - bike accidents , as drivers who often interact with bikes are more aware than those who do not .
Do n’t drive in dedicated bike lanes .
Please .
And realize that those lanes usually end at some point , and bikes will re-enter the rest of the road with cars .
At intersections , you must yield to cyclists like any other vehicle .
They get their fair turn , too .
Do n’t tailgate .
Either go around , or chill out until there is an opportunity to pass safely .
You CAN pass us ( which is preferable to you just driving right on our tail ) , just make sure you ’re giving us a few feet on our left .
If we wave you on , that means there ’s room .
For goshsakes , do n’t honk .
We already know you ’re there , and horns are much louder outside the car .
When getting out of your car , do a quick check behind you to make sure no cyclists are coming .
Cyclist + car door=FAIL .
Please use your turn signal faithfully .
You should be doing it anyway .
Increased communication , whether or not you believe it to be superfluous , is always a good thing .
We ’re all just trying to get from point A to point B , right ?
If everyone , drivers and cyclists , agree to abide by rules of the road , everyone can stay safe .

Correction to this article
WITH many financial assets in the doldrums and markets spooked by the twin spectres of economic weakness and rising inflation , is it time to head for the hills ?
Barton Biggs , an investment guru , famously suggested that those wishing to preserve their wealth in times of turmoil should consider buying an “ unostentatious farm ” .
And rural land has long been seen as a good inflation hedge .
But now may not be the most opportune time for investors to swap their wingtips for wellies .
After more than two decades in the mire , the value of farmland has soared over the past few years on the back of strong prices for agricultural commodities , low interest rates and urban sprawl .
It has become so fashionable that some wonder if it is a bubble waiting to burst .
Bulls ( of the figurative kind ) point to the biofuels boom and strong demand from developing countries , particularly in Asia , as billions of new consumers adopt more protein - rich diets .
This pushes up demand for crops and livestock : farm animals consume a lot of grain - based feed .
Though food prices have fallen back lately , thanks to supply strengthening as more grain is planted as well as a general easing of commodity values , they remain high .
Stocks of some crops are at their lowest level for many years .
To improve their food security , importing countries have been snatching up farmland overseas — a trend the United Nations ' top agriculture official has likened to 19th - century colonialism .
Hedge funds have become more active too , seeking agrarian alpha .
And finance is flowing : a recent survey by the Federal Reserve found banks still willing to back agricultural investments in America , despite capital woes .
To some , farmland values have now reached scary levels .
The average price of an acre in America has almost doubled since 2004 .
In Britain , the value went up by 25 % in 2007 and by a staggering 47 % year - on - year in the first half of 2008 .
Many poor countries have seen similarly dizzying increases .
Tobias Levkovich , an equity strategist with Citigroup , thinks investors have been seduced by the bulls ' “ everyone 's got to eat ” mantra and are ignoring the warning signs , just as they did with the housing market in 2005 - 06 .
In an uncomfortable echo of that boom - turned - bust , land prices in America have deviated dramatically from their long - term growth rate ( see chart ) .
In relation to farm cash flows , they are now much higher even that they were in the late 1970s , the last golden age for ploughmen .
The ratio of prices to cash - rent rates — the farming equivalent of the price - earnings multiple on stockmarkets — looks frothy too .
In farm - riddled Iowa , it is at an all - time high of 24.2 times rent , well above the previous record , set in 1981 , according to Farmland Investor Letter , a periodical devoted to land - valuation trends .
None of this makes a crash inevitable .
Many still believe that the commodities boom has fundamentally changed the economics of farming .
But the recent cooling - off has sown doubt , and a sharp correction would hurt .
Some investors have borrowed heavily to bet on the bucolic — as have some farmers , whose loan - repayment rates are starting to slip , according to the Fed survey .
Worryingly , property accounts for a very high share of total farming wealth : around 90 % in America , compared with 20 % for households — though of course a farm , unlike a house , is a producing asset .
This is of consequence to investors in the agribusiness firms that have ridden the crest of the commodities wave , such as Potash Corp , CF Industries and Mosaic .
Their shares are either reasonably valued or horrendously expensive , depending on your view of the boom 's sustainability .
Their boosters point out that their shares have come off their highs in the past few months and now trade at a modest seven to 11 times earnings .
But that is no comfort if they turn out to be cyclical stocks , after all , and not the beneficiaries of a “ new paradigm ” , argues Mr Levkovich .
Homebuilders were said to be good value in 2006 when they were trading on similar multiples , and look what happened to them .
Even taking into account their recent share - price falls , moreover , the “ dotcorns ” have gained more as a group in the past five years than internet stocks did in the giddy second half of the 1990s .
So it is still a very long way down , should they really lose their footing .
That , combined with the lofty price of pasture , offers plenty of food for thought .
Correction :
In the initial version of this article , we said the ratio of prices to cash - rent rates in Iowa was approaching the 1979 high of 22 times rent .
In fact it has exceeded that number , which was actually reached in 1981 , and is now at 24.2 times rent .

“ Thirty - eight million people watched Barack Obama at the stadium in Denver .
There were 84,000 full - throated supporters who turned out there at the field .
The Republicans fired back today .

For example , the Superdome during Hurricane Katrina . ' ”

“ This is n’t a presidential ticket , this is a sitcom .
The maverick and the MILF . ” – Bill Maher
“ Are you kidding me , the mayor of Wasilla , Alaska ?
Yeah , that ’s who you want in the White House during a time of crisis .
When she got a phone call at 3 in the morning , it was because a moose had gotten in the garbage can . ”
– Bill Maher
“ I think this is pertinent because McCain has been running this campaign based on ‘ We ’re at war , it ’s a dangerous world out there .
The democrats do n’t get that .
I John McCain am the only one standing between the blood - thirsty Al Qaedas and you .
But if I die , this stewardess can handle it . ' ”
– Bill Maher
“ When they were vetting her for this job , like three seconds ago , she said , quote , I ’m not making this up , ‘ What is it exactly that the VP does every day ? ’
Let me field that for you , Sarah .
They start wars , they enrich their friends , they subvert the Constitution , and they shoot people in the face .
That ’s what the vice president does . ”
– Bill Maher
“ The McCain people believe that Americans will disregard her inexperience because they will fall in love with her story .
She was a runner up in the 1984 Miss Alaska Pageant . , which may sound trite , but you try walking in high - heeled snow shoes . ”
– Bill Maher
“ She ’s not bad looking .
She looks like one of those women in the Van Halen videos who takes off her glasses , shakes out her hair , and then all of a sudden , she ’s in high heels and a bikini .
All of a sudden , I am FOR drilling in Alaska . ” – Jimmy Kimmel
“ Not only is she young , they ’re saying she ’s the prettiest candidate for Vice President since John Edwards . ”
– Jimmy Kimmel
“ There was some breaking news out of Dayton , Ohio today , where Republican presidential candidate John McCain introduced the world to his third wife . ”
– Jon Stewart
“ Now obviously Sen . John McCain has made an enormous amount over Barack Obama ’s lack of experience , so it seems curious that the 72 - year - old , four - to - five time face cancer guy would choose a running mate whose resume appears to be more suited for a Northern Exposure reunion show . ”
– Jon Stewart
“ Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is John McCain ’s choice .
Here ’s what we know about her : her name is Sarah Palin . ” – Jay Leno
“ Actually , it was kind of a smart choice .
McCain went with a woman because he did n’t want to have to be in a position to have to get CPR from Mitt Romney . ”
– Jay Leno
“ Palin and McCain are a good pair .
She ’s pro-life and he ’s clinging to life . ”
– Jay Leno
“ President Bush called Gov. Palin and congratulated her .
Bush told Palin the job of vice president is very important because as vice president , you get to tell the president what to do . ”
– Jay Leno

Under pressure : The Critically Endangered grey - shanked douc langur is one of the primates in peril
In pictures
A global review of the world 's primates says 48 % of species face extinction , an outlook described as " depressing " by conservationists .
The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species says the main threat is habitat loss , primarily through the burning and clearing of tropical forests .
More than 70 % of primates in Asia are now listed as Endangered , it adds .
The findings form part of the most detailed survey of the Earth 's mammals , which will be published in October .
PRIMATES IN PERIL Nations with the highest percentage of threatened species :
Cambodia - 90 % Vietnam - 86 % Indonesia - 84 % Laos - 83 % China - 79 % ( Source : IUCN Red List )
Other threats include hunting of primates for food and the illegal wildlife trade , explained Russell Mittermeier , chairman of global conservation group IUCN 's Primate Specialist Group and president of Conservation International .
" In many places , primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction , " he warned .
" Tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause , but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas , even where the habitat is still quite intact . "
The survey , involving hundreds of experts , showed that out of 634 recognised species and subspecies , 11 % were Critically Endangered , 22 % were Endangered , while a further 15 % were listed as Vulnerable .
Asia had the greatest proportion of threatened primates , with 71 % considered at risk of extinction .
The five nations with the highest percentage of endangered species were all within Asia .
' Depressing ' picture " It is quite spectacular ; we are just wiping out primates , " said Jean - Christophe Vie , deputy head of the IUCN Species Programme .
RED LIST DEFINITIONS
The Tonkin snub - nosed monkey is listed as Critically Endangered Extinct - Surveys suggest last known individual has died Critically Endangered - Extreme high risk of extinction - this means some Critically Endangered species are also tagged Possibly Extinct Endangered - Species at very high risk of extinction Vulnerable - Species at high risk of extinction Near Threatened - May soon move into above categories Least Concern - Species is widespread and abundant Data Deficient - not enough data to assess
He added that the data was probably the worst assessment for any group of species on record .
" The problem with these species is that they have long lives , so it takes time to reverse the decline .
It is quite depressing . "
Although habitat loss and deforestation were deemed to be the main threats globally , Dr Vie explained how human encroachment into forests was also creating favourable conditions for hunters .
" This creates access , allowing people to go to places that they could not go in the past , " he told BBC News .
" Primates are relatively easy to hunt because they are diurnal , live in groups and are noisy - they are really easy targets .
" Many of the Asian primates , like langurs , are 5 - 10 kg , so they are a good target .
Generally , you find that what is big and easy to get disappears very quickly . "
In Africa , 11 of the 13 kinds of red colobus monkeys assessed were listed as Critically Endangered or Endangered .
Conservationists fear that two may already be extinct .
The Bouvier 's red colobus has not been seen for 25 years , and no living Miss Waldron red colobus has been recorded since 1978 .
The authors of the primate Red List did consider downlisting mountain gorillas to Endangered from Critically Endangered because the great apes had recorded a population increase .
But they decided to delay reclassification as a result of five of the gorillas being killed in July 2007 by gunmen in the DR Congo 's Virunga National Park , which is still at the centre of a conflict between rebel forces and government troops .
During 2007 , wildlife rangers in the park recorded a total of 10 gorilla killings .
The rangers have been documenting their struggles in a regular diary on the BBC News website over the past year .
Mountain gorillas have been caught in the crossfire of a land dispute
Diary : Protecting mountain gorillas
" If you kill seven , 10 or 20 mountain gorillas , it has a devastating impact on the entire population , " Dr Vie explained .
" Within the Red List criteria , you are allowed to anticipate what will happen in the future as well as look at what has happened in the past .
" So it was decided not to change the mountain gorillas ' listing because of the sudden deaths , and we do not know when it is going to stop . "
Dr Emmanuel de Merode , chief executive of Gorilla.cd - an EU - funded programme working in Virunga National Park - said the gorillas ' long - term survival was still far from assured .
" Militias have been in control of the Gorilla Sector since September last year , which means the Congolese wildlife authority has been unable to manage the area and protect the gorillas , " he told BBC News .
" Until the war ends and the rangers are able to get back in and patrol the area , we have no idea as to the fate of almost a third of the mountain gorillas left in the world . "
Golden glimmer of hope Despite the gloomy outlook , the Red List did record a number of conservation successes .
The re-introduction of golden lion tamarins is one of the few successes Brazil 's populations of golden lion tamarins and black lion tamarins were downlisted from Critically Endangered to Endangered .
" It is the result of decades of effort , " said Dr Vie .
" The lion tamarins were almost extinct in the wild , but they were very popular in zoos so there was a large captive population .
" So zoos around the world decided to join forces to introduce a captive breeding programme to reintroduce the tamarins in Brazil . "
However the first attempts were not successful and the released population quickly crashed because the animals were ill - prepared for life in the wild , he recalled .
" They were not exposed to eagles or snakes and they did not know how to find food , so a lot of them died .
But some did survive and , slowly , the numbers began to increase . "
Ultimately , the success was a combination of ex-situ conservation in zoos and in - situ conservation by protecting and reforesting small areas around Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo .
" It took time , money and effort at all levels , from the politicians to scientists and volunteers on the ground , for just two species . "
The findings , issued at the International Primatological Society Congress in Edinburgh , Scotland , will be included in a survey described as an " unprecedented examination of the state of the world 's mammals " , which will be presented at the IUCN World Conservation Congress in October .

What are these ?
E’ un po ’ come sparare sulla Croce Rossa , oggi come oggi .
La Cai ha formalmente ritirato la sua offerta , eppure c’è qualcuno ( leggi Cgil e Anpac ) che continua a ripetere che un accordo è ancora possibile , e che è disposto a sedersi al tavolo delle trattative .
Ma non ho capito , quando le trattative c’erano davvero cosa facevano questi signori ?
Hanno sentito la notizia che ormai è praticamente tutto finito ?
Chi dovrebbe trattare a ogni costo , per il bene di chi rappresenta , è il comandante Fabio Berti : l’unica cosa che sta gestendo bene direi che è la sua immagine .
A furia di essere intervistato e di comparire come ospite nei vari salotti televisivi , il comandante è diventato una piccola star , nel bene e nel male .
Forse per questo si sente autorizzato anche a minacciare i passeggeri , insinuando velatamente che le forti , insopportabili pressioni psicologiche a cui sono sottoposti in questi giorni i piloti potrebbero portare a conseguenze anche sulla loro concentrazione durante il volo e quindi a incidenti .
Secondo me ha detto una cosa pazzesca .
Il commissario straordinario Fantozzi pubblica tardivamente un invito a presentare delle altre offerte per la compagnia : mossa comunque inutile , perchè il termine è fissato per il 30 settembre , e in ogni caso quelle presentate sarebbero solo offerte “ esplorative ” , mentre servirebbe un piano industriale serio e completo , prima che finiscano i soldi .
E prima che l’Enac ritiri a quel che resta dell ’Alitalia la licenza di volo provvisoria che le permette di operare .
Intanto arrivano notizie non confermate che l’Ente Aeroportuale Israeliano , preoccupato per le sorti della compagnia italiana , della quale è creditore per 350.000 € , abbia fatto sequestrare conti e proprietà Alitalia nel Paese medio- orientale .
In tutto questo l’unica notizia positiva sembra essere che , se avete un po ’ di fortuna e molta , molta fiducia in una soluzione positiva della vicenda , possiate trovare dei biglietti Alitalia per le prossime settimane a prezzi fortemente scontati , dato che le prenotazioni ovvamente sono in crisi .
Voi comprereste mai un biglietto Alitalia adesso ?
PS : un’ultima considerazione nasce spontanea : colui che convince i potenti di tutta europa a suon di barzellette e di savoir - faire , colui che ha provocato il ritiro dell ’esercito russo dalla Georgia e ha risparmiato all ’
Occidente intero una nuova guerra fredda , colui che ha propugnato con ardore la causa dell ’italianità della compagnia aerea , facendo entrare in gioco la Cai e la cordata di imprenditori ( tutti rigorosamente con puro sangue italiano nelle vene ) ; colui che è capace di tutto ciò , come mai a un passo dal traguardo si fa sgretolare tra le mani il castello di sabbia che con tanta cura aveva costruito ?
Come mai non riesce a convincere i suoi amati imprenditori ( italiani ) a riprendere le trattative ?
Piloti , manager e imprenditori non saranno mica tutti cattivi comunisti ?
WASHINGTON 
The Bush administration formally withdrew an agreement for civilian nuclear cooperation with Russia from congressional consideration on Monday .
" The president has notified Congress that he has today rescinded his prior determination regarding the U.S. - Russia agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation , " the State Department said in a prepared statement .
" We make this decision with regret . "
The step is the most meaningful show of displeasure the United States has yet made over Russia ’s military action in Georgia .
But it stops short of the more aggressive measures that some have proposed .
The White House has stepped up economic aid to Georgia , but it has so far ruled out providing military assistance .
Similarly , the White House has not sought to impose economic sanctions against Russia or to revoke its membership in the Group of Eight , despite the strong warnings tha American officials issued as the crisis was unfolding that Russia would face consequences for its actions .
In the video , Esmin Green , 49 , is seen slumped in her seat just a few from an observation window and then falling to the floor of the psychiatric emergency room at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn .
Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) waves to the crowd as he delivers a speech at Berlin 's victory column July 24 .
Obama promises to ' remake the world '
Addressing more than 200,000 elated Europeans massed in Berlin at twilight , presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama promised Thursday that he would work to unite Christians , Muslims and Jews in a safer , more united world .
His 27 - minute speech at the gold - topped Victory Column was interrupted by applause at least 30 times , with occasional audience chants of “ O - ba - MA ! ”
Advertisement
Billed as a speech about Transatlantic relations , it turned out to be a manifesto for the planet , with an appeal to “ the burdens of global citizenship . ”
Local authorities said the crowd was more than 200,000 — triple Obama 's previous record of 70,000 in Portland , Ore .
Reaching out to skeptics back home , he heralded “ the dream of freedom ” and declared firmly : “ I love America . ”
“ People of Berlin , people of the world , this is our moment .
This is our time , ” he declared , offering himself “ not as a candidate for president , but as a citizen , a proud citizen of the United States and a fellow citizen of the world . ”
Obama ’s speech , the centerpiece of his presidential - style sweep of the Middle East and Europe , set a global agenda as expansive and audacious as any contemplated by a candidate for United States president .
“ In Europe , the view that America is part of what has gone wrong in our world , rather than a force to help us make it right , has become all too common , ” he said .
“ Yes , there have been differences between America and Europe .
“ No doubt , there will be differences in the future .
But the burdens of global citizenship continue to bind us together , ” Obama continued .
“ A change of leadership in Washington will not lift this burden .
In this new century , Americans and Europeans alike will be required to do more , not less . ”
Invoking the fall of the Berlin Wall after the historic call by President Ronald Reagan at the nearby Brandenburg Gate , Obama declared that the greatest danger now “ is to allow new walls to divide us from one another . ”
“ The walls between old allies on either side of the Atlantic cannot stand , ” he said .
The walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand .
The walls between races and tribes , natives and immigrants , Christians and Muslims and Jews cannot stand .
These now are the walls we must tear down . ”
In perhaps the most striking passage , Obama asserted : “ I know my country has not perfected itself . ”
“ But I also know how much I love America , ” he said .
“ We are a people of improbable hope .
With an eye towards the future , with resolve in our heart , let us remember this history , and answer our destiny , and remake the world once again . ”
Obama ’s sweeping vision also includes :
— " This is the moment when we must renew the goal of a world without nuclear weapons . "
— " This is the moment we must help answer the call for a new dawn in the Middle East . "
— " America has no better partner than Europe .
Now is the time to build new bridges across the globe as strong as the one that bound us across the Atlantic .
Now is the time to join together , through constant cooperation , strong institutions , shared sacrifice , and a global commitment to progress , to meet the challenges of the 21st century . ”
— “ My country must stand with yours and with Europe in sending a direct message to Iran that it must abandon its nuclear ambitions . ”
— “ The world should support the millions of Iraqis who seek to rebuild their lives , even as we pass responsibility to the Iraqi government and finally bring this war to a close . ”
McCain 2008 spokesman Tucker Bounds said in response : " While Barack Obama took a premature victory lap today in the heart of Berlin , proclaiming himself a ' citizen of the world , ' John McCain continued to make his case to the American citizens who will decide this election .
Barack Obama offered eloquent praise for this country , but the contrast is clear .
John McCain has dedicated his life to serving , improving and protecting America .
Barack Obama spent an afternoon talking about it . "

New contest gives you the chance to educate millions about the growing threat to freedom of speech on the web
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Tuesday , August 5 , 2008
In response to increasing flagrant attempts to censor political websites , including Infowars and Prison Planet , not in Communist China , but in the U.S. and the UK , we are running a special contest with a top prize of $ 5,000 in order to encourage people to get active and educate others about the growing threats to Internet freedom .
As we reported yesterday , major transportation hubs like St. Pancras International , as well as libraries , big businesses , hospitals and other public outlets that offer wi-fi Internet , are blacklisting alternative news websites and making them completely inaccessible to their users .
On weekly basis we receive e mails from across the US and the UK from people who have attempted to visit our websites yet found them to be blocked by filtration software that lists them as “ hate ” or “ violence ” .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
This precedent is merely the first indication of what is planned for the Internet over the next 5 - 10 years , with the traditional web becoming little more than a vast spy database that catalogues people ’s every activity and bombards them with commercials , while those who comply with centralized control and regulation of content will be free to enjoy the new super - fast Internet 2 , where DVD quality movies can be downloaded in seconds , but at the cost of the Internet losing its role as the last true outpost of freedom of speech .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The necessity to warn people of this agenda is no more pressing than now , and this is why we are launching a contest to create the most powerful video presentation detailing the growing cancer of Internet censorship .
Using the audio of Alex ’s rant at approximately eight minutes into the second hour of the Alex Jones Show on Monday , August 4 , this contest requires you create a video documenting the censorship of Prison Planet , Infowars , TruthNews , the Jones Report and other non-corporatized , alternative media websites .
The video must be under 10 minutes and be posted on YouTube and a secondary video venue on the internet .
Contest deadline is the 19th of August .
Contest videos will also be cross-posted on Prison Planet and Infowars .
Download the video of Alex ’s rant at http://freespeech.vo.llnwd.net/o25/pub/media/20080804_Mon_Alex.wmv
First Prize : $ 5,000
Second Prize : $ 1,000
Third Prize : $ 500
We are also running three other contests in a similar vein with additional prizes .
BEST TRUTH RISING TRAILER
Using video clips from Alex Jones ’ latest documentary , Truth Rising : The 9/11 Chronicles , remix a new trailer for the documentary .
This video must be posted by Sunday evening , August 10 , and the winner will be declared Monday , August 11 , during Alex ’s show .
Winner of Truth Rising trailer contest will receive $ 1,000 .
NEW DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE ESSAY CONTEST
Like the original U.S. Declaration of Independence , the New Declaration of Independence will assert the right of the people to oppose tyrannical , oppressive government , and once again declare the right of all sovereign individuals to pursue “ Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . ”
Winner of the New Declaration of Independence will receive $ 2,000 .
CRIMES OF THE NWO BILL OF PARTICULARS ESSAY CONTEST
In the third section of the original Declaration of Independence , there is a bill of particulars against the rule of George III , such as the imposition of standing armies among the people , taxation without representation , and obstruction of justice , etc .
Our Bill of Particulars will charge the NWO with additional crimes against the people , thus establishing the global elite has no right to rule over us .
Winner of the Bill of Particulars Contest will receive $ 1,000 .

Comment on this article
March 1 , 2008
I received an email today asking about a devotional that had been sent out from liveprayer ministries in Florida .
Here is the link to the devotional :
http://www.liveprayer.com/ddarchive3.cfm?id=3224
You do not need to read it all there because I reprint it below , followed by my observations and debunking .
There is too much at stake in these days to allow anyone to lie with impunity , especially if they are claiming the name of Christ .
It is ironic that Bill Keller uses the scripture about false prophets for this false devotional .
Ironic because Keller apparently forgot that you cannot be a false prophet , if you are not claiming to come in the name of God , something Barack Obama has never claimed , yet Bill Keller does claim .
The Bible says we are to test everything .
Not all who say “ Lord , Lord ” will enter the Kingdom of Heaven .
It becomes clear as we sift through the Keller diatribe that while he claims to come in the name of Christ , there is very little Christian in what he writes .
Keller thus becomes the false prophet he tries to warn us about .
God is good .
Introduction – This “ devotional ” is so vile that it offends me to even continue referring to it as a devotional .
The purpose of a devotional is to use the Word of God to inspire people to greater truths contained in the Word .
To illuminate a principle of God that the reader had not considered .
To spur the reader on to prayer and reflection of a particular subject they are dealing with in their lives .
This is no devotional , it is a political endorsement of John McCain and a character assassination of Barack Obama .
I would go even further ; it is a libelous , inaccurate usage of the Word of God to further a political agenda .
It goes to the very heart of what is wrong with modern Christianity .
It is why people do not wish to partake in the salvation Christ so freely offers .
It reeks of hypocrisy and literally begs to offend people .
That is bad enough but to do so in the name of Christ turns Bill Keller into the very thing he claims to abhor .
He is not doing a service for Jesus Christ ; but rather for John McCain .
No matter how many times he swears this is about “ spiritual matters ” it is clearly about political ones .
But he does n’t even do it in a clever way .
He does n’t try to hide his bigotry and racism .
He does n’t even vaguely disguise his hate which is literally dripping off the pages as you read .
You can tell right away simply by how he refers to Barack Obama .
He refuses to use his first name and instead opts for B. Hussein Obama .
This has been a common trick played by political hacks and operatives on the right as they try to conjure up people ’s fears of Saddam Hussein .
Bill Keller is simply playing off of your fears hoping to equate the Senator to the former dictator of Iraq .
Below is the actual devotional , uncut and unedited with my response in capital letters to differentiate between the devotional text and my words responding .
" For false Christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders , so as to lead astray , if possible , even the elect . "
JESUS CHRIST
KELLER HAS TO START WITH A SCRIPTURE SINCE HE IS PRETENDING THIS IS A DEVOTIONAL .
OF COURSE HE DOES NOT EXPOUND OFF OF THIS AT ALL .
HIS GOAL IS NOT TO USE THE WORD OF GOD TO ILLUMINATE BUT RATHER TO LAUNCH INTO A HATE FILLED RANT AGAINST A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE .
NO WE CAN'T !
The cult of B. Hussein Obama .
Remember I told you there would be a revival in this nation this year .
Well , before we see a true spiritual revival that will bring millions to faith in Christ and help lead this nation back to God and Biblical values , there is going to be a " faux revival ” led by the latest preacher of false hope , B. Hussein Obama .
AND THE HATE EXPRESS IS OFF !
IN THE FIRST SENTENCE KELLER REFERS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO SUPPORT OBAMA AS A CANDIDATE AS A “ CULT ” .
HE ALSO THEN FALSELY REFERS TO OBAMA AS A PREACHER TO SET UP A STRAWMAN FOR HIMSELF TO ARGUE ; THAT IT IS OBAMA VERSUS CHRIST .
YOU WILL SEE THIS IS CRUCIAL FOR HIS CLOSING PLEA .
I ALSO HAVE NO IDEA WHERE HE GETS THIS FALSE REVIVAL THEORY FROM BECAUSE UNLESS HE IS CLAIMING THAT OBAMA IS THE ANTICHRIST , IT IS CERTAINLY NOT IN THE BIBLE .
Obama is running for the Democratic Party 's nomination to try and become the next President of the United States .
He is preaching a gospel of change and hope .
Thousands are flocking to his campaign rallies and becoming emotionally charged as this " political evangelist " preaches about hope and change .
The problem is he is a false prophet and no true follower of Christ can follow or support this " false messiah of hope and change ! "
TRYING TO CONTINUE TO ERECT HIS STRAWMAN , KELLER ASSERTS MORE UNTRUTHS .
OBAMA IS NOT “ PREACHING ” ANY “ GOSPEL ” .
THE USAGE OF THESE WORDS IS TO AGAIN TRY TO MAKE WHAT IS A POLITICAL ISSUE INTO A CHRISTIAN ISSUE .
OBAMA IS NOT A POLITICAL EVANGELIST AS EVEN KELLER IS SO AWARE OF IT THAT HE HAS TO PUT IT IN QUOTES .
OBAMA SPEAKS ABOUT CHANGE AND HOPE , HE DOES NOT “ PREACH ” IT .
THEN WE GET INTO THREE VERY DISTURBING COMMENTS FROM KELLER .
THE FIRST BEING THAT OBAMA IS A FALSE PROPHET .
THIS IS JUST THE FIRST INSTANCE OF THE MISUSE OF SCRIPTURE FROM MR .
KELLER .
A FALSE PROPHET REFERS TO ONE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF GOD AND FALSELY PURPORTS GOD’S POSITION TO THE PEOPLE .
OBAMA HAS NEVER DONE THAT .
HE IS NOT RUNNING FOR POPE , HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT .
HE RARELY EVER DISCUSSES HIS FAITH AND I HAVE NEVER HEARD HIM SAY ; “ THUS SAYETH THE LORD . ” IN ORDER TO BE A FLASE PROPHET , YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST BE CLAIMING TO BE A PROPHET , SOMETHING OBAMA HAS NEVER DONE .
THE SECOND DISTRUBING COMMENT IS THAT KELLER WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH MISREPRESENTING OBAMA AS A PROPHET , HE GOES ON TO REFER TO HIM AS A FALSE MESSIAH AS WELL .
HAS BARACK OBAMA EVER CLAIMED THAT HE IS DELIVERING PEOPLE FROM THEIR SINS ?
HAS HE EVER CLAIMED ANY CONNECTION TO GOD WHATSOEVER ?
THIS IS ANOTHER LIE FROM KELLER IN TRYING TO CONTINUE TO SET UP THE STRAWMAN HE NEEDS ; WHERE IT IS OBAMA OR CHIRST .
THE LAST DISTURBING COMMENT FROM THIS SECTION IS THE ASSERTION FROM KELLER THAT “ NO TRUE FOLLOWER OF CHRIST CAN FOLLOW OR SUPPORT ” OBAMA .
WHAT THIS IS REALLY SAYING IS THAT IF YOU ARE CHRISTIAN YOU CANNOT VOTE FOR HIM ; SO YOU MUST VOTE FOR MCCAIN .
THIS IS A POLITICAL STATEMENT USING CHRIST IN A MOST VILE WAY TO GET YOUR POLITICAL OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED .
Very troubling to me has been watching the " revival - like " atmosphere surrounding B. Hussein Obama 's campaign for the Presidency .
Like all false prophets , it is a false gospel with lots of smoke and mirrors .
I think people would be troubled to know that the flowery rhetoric flowing from Obama is n't coming from his heart , but from a 26 - year - old white man named Jon Favreau .
Favreau is the author of those flowery and dynamic hope
And change messages you hear , not B. Hussein Obama .
Obama has even had some input from legendary JFK speechwriter Ted Sorensen who is now 79 .
STILL BUILDING THAT STRAWMAN , KELLER TRIES TO TURN THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN INTO A “ REVIVAL ” , CALLS HIM A FALSE PROPHET AGAIN AND CLAIMS AGAIN HE IS PREACHING A FALSE GOSPEL .
AS FOR THE REVELATION OF JON FAVREAU , I SAY SO WHAT !
FAVREAU IS THE MAIN SPEECHWRITER FOR OBAMA .
GUESS WHAT FOLKS , ALL POLITICIANS HAVE SPEECHWRITERS , INCLUDING YOUR CURRENT PRESIDENT , BILL CLINTON , EVEN JOHN MCCAIN .
IT IS HOWEVER WIDELY KNOWN THAT OBAMA HAS FAR MORE INPUT INTO HIS SPEECHES THAN MOST POLITICIANS .
THIS IS WHAT AS KNOWN AS A RED HERRING ; AN ARGUMENT THAT SOUNDS GOOD BUT HAS NO SUBSTANCE .
OH NO !
OBAMA HAS A SPEECHWRITER !!!
IT DOES HOWEVER SPEAK TO THE UTTER DESPERATION BILL KELLER IS WRITING IN .
HE KNOWS FULL WELL THAT EVERY POLITICIAN HAS A SPEECHWRITER SO HE IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO INTENTIONALLY DECEIVE HIS READERS .
NOT VERY CHRISTIAN .
Want another interesting fact about B. Hussein Obama .
As someone who has done live TV every night for 5 yrs , if you watch Obama , he only gives those stirring hope and change speeches when he has a teleprompter so he can READ HIS LINES !
This man is a complete fraud !
When he is without a teleprompter , he resorts back to his typical stump speech on the issues .
This " false messiah " of hope so many are clinging to , is n't even the author of his message of false hope and is incapable of delivering those passionate speeches without a teleprompter !
IS BILL KELLER SERIOUS ???
EVERY POLITICAN USES TELEPROMPTERS .
SO DOES THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE GIVES ANY SPEECH , INCLUDING THE STATE OF THE UNION !!!
WHEN YOU WRITE A 10 PAGE SPEECH THAT WILL REQUIRE YOU TO SPEAK FOR 20 MINUTES , IT IS SILLY TO THINK THAT YOU WILL MEMORIZE IT .

By comparison , alcohol is blamed 39 percent of the time , according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
But unlike drinking , which requires the police , breathalyzers and coercion to improve drivers ’ behavior , there ’s a simple way to prevent speeding : quit building cars that can exceed the speed limit .
Most cars can travel over 100 miles an hour  an illegal speed in every state .
Our continued , deliberate production of potentially law - breaking devices has no real precedent .
We regulate all sorts of items to decrease danger to the public , from baby cribs to bicycle helmets .
Yet we continue to produce fast cars despite the lives lost , the tens of billions spent treating accident victims , and a good deal of gasoline wasted .
( Speeding , after all , substantially reduces fuel efficiency due to the sheering force of wind . )
Worse , throughout the various federal documents examining traffic fatalities , the role of speeding is de-emphasized .
Speeding is not even an “ agency priority ” of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in its annual assessment of crashes  only alcohol , seat belts , rollovers and vehicle compatibility make the cut .
Rather it is in the second - tier “ other focus ” category , along with large trucks and “ intersection - related and roadway departure . ”
And unlike the statistical attention afforded alcohol ( 20 pages of a 150 - page document ) , the section devoted to speeding comes in at a measly three pages .
A deeper look at the safety administration ’s report on traffic fatalities in 2005 also reveals a strange fact about how speeding - related traffic fatalities are tallied up .
Consider this : in Texas , in 2005 , 3,504 people died in a traffic accident ; 1,426 ( about 41 percent ) were considered speeding - related .
In sharp contrast , for Florida , 3,543 died yet only 239 were considered speeding - related  about 7 percent .
HATTIESBURG , Miss . --
Three days after a conference call with Packers team officials in which quarterback Brett Favre emphatically expressed his desire to play in 2008 , Favre on Friday formally asked by letter for his unconditional contractual release , sources close to Favre and the team said .
The letter was sent by Favre 's agent , James " Bus " Cook , via overnight mail on Thursday and arrived at the Packers facility Friday morning .
Cook , on behalf of Favre , expressed a desire to have an amicable parting , as the Packers have been reluctant to embrace his return .
Favre announced his retirement in early March .
Packers general manager Ted Thompson and coach Mike McCarthy were n't available for comment Friday .
In a statement , the Packers said : " Brett earned and exercised the right to retire on his terms .
We wanted him to return and welcomed him back on more than one occasion .
" Brett 's press conference and subsequent conversations in the following weeks illustrated his commitment to retirement , " the news release added .
" The finality of his decision to retire was accepted by the organization .
At that point , the Green Bay Packers made the commitment to move forward with our football team . "
Distributed computing has n't folded us a cure for cancer yet , but these projects in which PC users donate their spare processing power to solve scientific problems have unquestionably made major strides in uncovering ridiculously large prime numbers .
Fans of bountiful digits may soon be rocked by the potential discovery of the 45th known Mersenne prime .
Details are still pretty scarce , but on August 23 , the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search ( GIMPS ) said a computer participating in the project has reported to have found the record - breaking number .
Marin Mersenne
Mersenne primes are named after the 17th century French monk , scholar , scientist , mathematician nerd Marin Mersenne .
A Mersenne number is a number that is one less than a power of two , or M n = 2n – 1 .
So , the first few are 1 , 3 , 7 , 15 , 31 , 63 , and so on .
Mersenne primes are Mersenne numbers that are also prime , meaning they are divisible only by 1 and itself .
You can see why finding these numbers have such a cult following .
Distributed computing has been a boon for Mersenne prime discovery , as the digits in the numbers quickly become extremely large and difficult to verify .
GIMPS is presently responsible for 10 record breaking prime numbers , having found the 35th through 44th largest known .
As according to GIMPS protocol , the potential 45th Mersenne prime will not be officially disclosed until it has been verified as a prime .
The leader of the project , George Woltman , unfortunately was on holiday when the number was reported , so the verification process did n't begin until the 26th .
He estimates completion on September 12 and September 16 .
To give an idea of the scale of these latest record - breaking numbers , the 44th Mersenne prime is 232,582,657 - 1 , which works out to be 9,808,358 decimal digits long .
That 's 650,000 digits larger than the previous record and is presently the largest known prime number of any kind .
The 45th Mersenne prime may qualify for a $ 100,000 prize offered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation to anyone who discovers a prime number with at least 10 million digits .
If GIMPS claims the reward , it plans to donate $ 25,000 to charity and give a large portion to the participant that discovered the prime number . ®
Avengers In Galactic Storm
I was checking out a list of arcade games a few months back and discovered this little ditty : Avengers In Galactic Storm from Data East .
The game was released in 1995 and it ’s soooo obvious because ( get this ) the playable characters are : Captain America , Black Knight , Thunderstrike , and Crystal .
Um … Yep .
The 90s were a bad time for everyone , especially comics and especially the Avengers as this motley crew is straight outta the brown bomber jacket era of the Avengers .
Black Knight , Thunderstrike , and Crystal bring me visions of foil - stamped covers .
* shudders *
So the game is a 3D fighting game .
And the graphics are really bad .
Well , maybe they were okay for 1995 , but I still say they ’re pretty laughable .
The game just looks cheaps and I can’t imagine it was any kind of hit because I do n’t even remember it from my days at the Dream Machine arcade .
Perhaps if it was a little bit better and successful , Data East would still be in business and we’d be getting the latest installment of Avengers vs. Fighter ’s History on the 360 and PS3 .
Anyway , there ’s the Versus Mode and the Story Mode , loosely based the Operation : Galactic Storm story from the comics , so we ’re stuck fighting people like Dr. Minerva and Korath .
I ’m perplexed as to who pitched an Operation : Galactic Storm game .
You ’re going to use * these *
Avengers and base a fighting game on Operation : Galactic Storm ?
Really ?
First off , if you ’re going to make an Avengers game , do n’t base it off a storyline where all the characters involved suck .
Data
East should ’ve given us the classic Avengers by taking a page from their 1991 side - scroller beat ’em Captain American and the Avengers .
To rub more salt in the wound by having to play as Avengers b-listers , Avengers mainstays such as Iron Man , Thor , Giant Man / Goliath / Ant - Man / Yellowjacket , and Vision * do * appear , but only as back - up that you can only call in for a special attack once you ’re powered up enough .
How ’bout just making the brown bomber brigade the assist characters ?
And where the flip is Hawkeye ?!
Where are villains like Red Skull , Dr. Doom , Kang or the Masters of Evil ?
Mm hm .
Vision stands , er… floats proud while a victorious Thunderstrikes strikes a pose above the fallen Cap .
One of the games greatest moments – Giant - Man lends a hand !
The final verdict ?
Just stick with Captain America and the Avengers .
The crowd gasped last year at the Urban Challenge robot race in Victorville , California , when the 15 - ton Oshkosh TerraMax cargo truck – largest by far of the 11 racers – pulled into the gate .
The bot had to bow out after minor collision , but its sheer size relative to its SUV - based rivals was most impressive .
Well , you ai n't seen nothing yet .
Carnegie Mellon University , whose team placed first at Urban Challenge , is partnering up with tractor - maker Caterpillar to build the world 's largest ground robot : a 700 - ton robo dump truck capable of hauling 240 tons of earth .
Just to be clear : that 's nearly 50 TerraMaxes crammed together .
( Thanks to Bill Sweetman at Ares for the tip ! )
What 's the big deal ?
Well , you can't just scale up robot technology .
TerraMax , for its part , required special algorithms in order to navigate in a world scaled for smaller vehicles , according to Oshkosh engineer Chris Yakes .
That 's the subject of a chapter in my new book WAR BOTS .
And , as always with robots , there 's a trust issue – another major theme of WAR BOTS .
The bigger a bot is , the more intimidating it is and the less likely people will be to trust it .
Consider the reaction Army soldiers had to the Convoy Active Safety Technologies experiment .
CAST , a robotic autopilot based on Urban Challenge technology , was installed on a couple medium cargo trucks and put through the paces in Virginia last year .
The idea was to give soldiers in Iraq a smart robotic buddy to help them on long supply runs .
The robot could steer while the soldier kept an eye out for attackers .
The system was safe , but according to one Army researcher I spoke to , soldiers still did n't trust it .
But with exposure comes acceptance , and as giant bots like Caterpillar 's find their niches in the civilian world , the military will become more comfortable with them , too .

Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates says that even winning the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan will not end the “ Long War ” against violent extremism and that the fight against al - Qaeda and other terrorists should be the nation ’s top military priority over coming decades , according to a new National Defense Strategy he approved last month .
The strategy document , which has not been released , calls for the military to master “ irregular ” warfare rather than focusing on conventional conflicts against other nations , though Gates also recommends partnering with China and Russia in order to blunt their rise as potential adversaries .
The strategy is a culmination of Gates ’s work since he took over the Pentagon in late 2006 and spells out his view that the nation must harness both military assets and “ soft power ” to defeat a complex , transnational foe .
“ Iraq and Afghanistan remain the central fronts in the struggle , but we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long - term , episodic , multi-front , and multi-dimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the Cold War confrontation with communism , ” according to the 23 - page document , provided to The Washington Post by InsideDefense.com , a defense industry news service .
“ Success in Iraq and Afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict , but it alone will not bring victory . ”
Gates embraces the “ Long War ” term that his predecessor , Donald H. Rumsfeld , invoked to equate the fight against terrorism with struggles against Soviet communism and Nazi fascism .
His strategy , however , departs from Rumsfeld ’s focus on preemptive military action and instead encourages current and future U.S. leaders to work with other countries to eliminate the conditions that foster extremism .
It is unusual for a defense secretary to offer a comprehensive military strategy so late in an administration ’s tenure , and in a foreword to the document Gates acknowledges that a new president will soon reassess threats and priorities .
Gates wrote that he perceives this document as a “ a blueprint to success ” for a future administration .

Star Simpson Receives Pretrial Probation
Star A. Simpson ’ 10 was sentenced Monday to one year of supervised pretrial probation on a charge of disorderly conduct .
The charge stems from a Sept. 2007 incident when she was arrested at gunpoint at Logan International after airport personnel mistook a circuit board on her sweatshirt for a bomb .
The incident — and MIT ’s public relations — incited national and local controversy .
An East Boston District Court judge sentenced Simpson to one year of supervised pretrial probation on a charge of disorderly conduct and ordered her to perform 50 hours of community service , half of which much be completed with veterans , and to publicly announce that she had made a mistake .
“ I want to apologize for the results of my conduct on September 21 , 2007 .
Although I never intended to act in a disorderly fashion , I now realize that the shirt I created caused alarm and concern at Logan Airport , ” Simpson said in a statement released Monday by her attorney , Thomas E. Dwyer , Jr. “ I am appreciative to the Massachusetts State Police for their diligence in protecting our citizens and apologize for the expense that was caused that day . ”
Simpson ’s arrest
On the morning of Sept. 21 , 2007 , Simpson wore a black hooded sweatshirt .
Atop the sweatshirt was a circuit board which contained green light - emitting diodes in the shape of a star , which she had used as a “ name tag ” during that week ’s Career Fair .
That morning , she traveled to Logan Airport to pick up her boyfriend .
When she approached an information booth at Logan Airport ’s Terminal C , an employee questioned her about the device on her sweatshirt , according to Assistant District Attorney Wayne Margolis , speaking at Simpson ’s Sept. 21 arraignment .
She “ said it was a piece of art ” and “ refused to answer any more questions , ” Margolis said .
Simpson then left the building and disconnected the battery that was powering the LEDs , according to a press release provided by Suffolk County District Attorney press officer Jake Wark in September .
Outside Terminal C , Simpson was arrested at gunpoint by state troopers wielding MP5 submachine guns .
“ Thankfully , because she followed instructions as was required , she ended up in a cell as opposed to the morgue , ” said State Police Maj .
Scott Pare at a Sept. 21 press conference before Simpson ’s arraignment .
In a Sept. 21 press release , the MIT News Office said that “ Ms. Simpson ’s actions were reckless and understandably created alarm at the airport . ”
The statement ignited controversy among many at MIT who wished the Institute had not called her actions “ reckless . ”
At the May 2008 faculty meeting , President Susan Hockfield expressed regret over the way her administration had handled the case .
Hockfield was unavailable to comment for this story .
“ It ’s really important to me to thank the MIT community , ” Simpson said in an e-mail to The Tech .
“ I ’ve received a whole lot of support from many fabulous individuals within it . ”
Pretrial probation agreement
Simpson was originally charged with “ possession of a hoax device , ” a charge which would require prosecutors to show she meant to scare people with her circuit board , which contained light - emitting diodes in the shape of a star .
But they “ determined that they could not move forward on that count and dismissed it to the disorderly [ conduct ] charge , ” according to a press release supplied by Wark .
Instead of going to trial , Simpson accepted the pretrial probation offer on Monday , June 2 .
If Simpson performs the community service and does not re-offend in the next year , the charge of disorderly conduct will be dropped .
( Otherwise , the district attorney ’s press release says , “ the case will be returned to the court docket for trial . ” )
Simpson said she does not yet know what the community service will be .
According to the press release , prosecutors weighed Simpson ’s behavior during her trial against her lack of criminal record , her academic involvement , and her experience of arrest at gunpoint in their decision to lower the charge .
During the time between her arrest and the June 2 hearing , Simpson was banned from Massport property , including Logan Airport , and had to fly out of other New England airports .
“ It also meant I could n’t attend the international symposium on wearable computing , as it was held at the Hyatt at Logan Airport , ” Simpson said in an e-mail to The Tech .
It is unclear who issued the ban .
Wark said the district attorney ’s office had not requested this restriction .
Dwyer could not be reached by press time .
According to Simpson , her lawyers worked pro bono .
She paid court fees .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - New York on Thursday began a probe into possible illegal short - selling in the stocks of Wall Street companies such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley , Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said .
A sign can be seen on the street outside of the New York Stock Exchange in New York 's financial district September 16 , 2008 .

Cuomo said on a conference call with reporters : “ I want the short - sellers to know today that I am watching .
If it is proper and legal then there is nothing to worry about . ”
He said his office was concerned about destabilization of financial markets , which are suffering their worst crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s .
The New York State prosecutor said his office also would look back into illegal short - selling that may have occurred in stocks of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc and American International Group Inc , two companies at the heart of the crisis .
In the past week , Lehman has gone bankrupt and the insurance giant was rescued by the U.S. government .
“ This investigation will not only encompass short - selling of Lehman Brothers and AIG but also short - selling in other companies that may be occurring , like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs , ” Cuomo said .
The prosecutor said he believes the SEC should freeze short - selling of financial sector stocks on a temporary basis , perhaps for 30 days .
In a statement , Morgan Stanley welcomed the investigation to uncover improper short - selling of financial stocks .
“ We also support his call for the SEC to impose a temporary freeze ... given the extreme and unprecedented movements in the market that are unsupported by the fundamentals of individual stocks , ” the statement said .
Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas van Praag said that “ if stocks are in fact driven down by inappropriate activities then it is quite right they be investigated . ”
MANIPULATION
Short selling is a legitimate form of trading that can prevent stocks from being overvalued , but often blamed when a company ’s shares fall .
Short sellers arrange to borrow shares they consider overvalued and sell them in hopes of making a profit when the price drops .
Harry Strunk , partner at Treflie Capital Management fund said : “ Anyone who stops lending the stocks may be engaging in market interference in my mind , and that is worrisome . ”
Cuomo said he would use a New York securities fraud law called the Martin Act , which gives the office both criminal and civil jurisdiction .
“ The markets need to be stabilized and the only way to help bring about that stability is to root out and deter short - selling that is based on false information , ” Cuomo said .
From Thursday , U.S. securities regulators tightened rules on traders who profit from stock declines .
UK securities regulators imposed a ban from Thursday through January 16 on the short - selling of financial - sector stocks to help stabilize the market .
A “ naked ” short sale occurs when an investor sells stock that has not yet been borrowed .
Broker - dealers will sometimes accidentally fail to deliver stock to investors who have arranged to borrow it .
If this is done intentionally it is already illegal .
Grow Something Edible Planting seeds , starts or other edible living things in and around your home ( wild yeast cultures or sprouts count too ) are great ways to have fresh , delicious food on hand .
Plus , it ’s cheap .
Seed packages start at less than a dollar , soil or compost can be purchased ( or found ) at pennies per pound , and water in the form of rain or out of the tap are both economical choices .
Aside from an investment of time , growing your own food requires little else .
The rewards of growing your own food are almost endless , but include : less time spent driving to the store , fresh ingredients on hand at all times , an understanding of the seasons , which can help you eat better tasting food ( see # 2 below ) , and carbon sequestration in its most delicious form , food .
No matter what your living situation , it is possible for you to grow some food at a very low price premium .
Do you live in an apartment with no sunlight or fixed windows , or worse yet , a basement apartment ?
Never fear , many cities have community gardens that make it possible for city slickers to grow a little food on the side .
Rent a spot for yourself , or split one with friends .
It ’s a great way to raise some edibles while hanging with your friends .
I ’ve also described how to grow food on your fire escape in a previous post !

Eat Seasonal Food Food is at its most affordable when it is purchased in season .
Not surprisingly , fruits and vegetables are also at their most flavorful and freshest when they are in season .
Find out what ’s in season in your area at which time of year , and harvest !
As this year ’s growing season draws to a close in many parts of the country , people are harvesting their summer and fall crops .
This is a great time of year to preserve , dry and can ( more about that later ) , but it ’s also a great time to taste the bounty of fresh , delicious food that is out there .

Cook at Home Food is more expensive when you eat it at a restaurant .
I know , I know : “ But I ca n’t cook ! ”
In most cases , if you can boil water , you can cook a meal at home that will be satisfying , tasty , comfortable , and cheaper than going out to eat .
Plus , you can keep some leftovers for tomorrow ’s bag lunch .
It ’s true , restaurants have a few things that your kitchen and dining room ( most likely ) do n’t : ambiance , sommeliers ( fancy wine folk ) , draft beer , live music , fancy china , and exotic ingredients .
These things are great for special occasions , or when you just feel like gettin ’ fancy and out of the house .
However , most of us eat our meals out at a burger / pizza / burrito joint , or in the car on the way home .
This kind of eating out usually does n’t have most of the aforementioned luxuries , and has few of the comforts associated with eating at home .
When you cook at home , you decide how spicy your tacos are going to be , or how much chocolate to put in the brownies , or when the spaghetti is al dente .
You ’ve got all of the freedom , and you can eat dinner in your pajamas or a tuxedo if you want to , eat by yourself without feeling embarrassed , or have twenty of your closest friends over to enjoy a meal with you , and watch a movie later with all the money you saved .

Shop at Farmers ’ Markets Local food is fresher than non-local food because it does n’t have to be picked long before its peak ripeness and shipped cross-country .
To boot , if you buy food in season at Farmer ’s Markets , you ’re probably saving money and getting fresher food than if you were to shop at the Big Box Mart ( BBM ) .
In addition , you might be able to form a relationship with the farmer that grows the food you ’re going to eat .
They ’re usually happy to answer questions about their farming practices , and some farmers may even let you in on information about their harvest calendar to give you a jump on when the freshest tomatoes will be ready , or when the corn is coming to market .
Knowing the people that grow your food , on a personal level , also provides a little extra security if , say , jalapenos are not available at the BBM due to an outbreak of foodborne illness , and you ’d like to make salsa that night for a dinner party .
Your local farmer might just have a few spare jalapenos on hand , or know someone who does .

Join a CSA
Developing that personal relationship with local farmers can go one step further with a harvest box from a Community - Supported Agriculture ( CSA ) farm .
In this case , farmers will sell you a share in their produce for the growing season at a flat rate , and you ’ll get a box each week with whatever is freshest on their farm .
CSA ’s have grown in popularity in recent years , and many farms have long waiting lists .
Some people go in on harvest boxes together to save money , and for those who can afford the investment up front , it ensures that you ’ll be able to eat your veggies all year long .
Some farms even have an installment payment plan or plans for low - income folks who are interested .
It may be too late to join up this year , but it ’s never too late to get to know your local farmers , and when signup time rolls around in the spring , you ’ll be on a first - name basis with them .

Cook Simple Meals
If you ’ve been cooking for years from gourmet cookbooks that require 15 to 20 ingredients per dish , simple meals may not be in your habit .
However , if you ’re new to cooking simple dishes may be your ticket to great food at a low price , with tons of flavor .
If you start by selecting foods that are in - season or were preserved in - season , simple recipes show off the delicious , fresh ingredients .
High - quality ingredients do n’t need a lot of dressing up to taste good , so less is more in their case .

Have a Potluck Inviting your friends over for a shared dinner , or meeting at a local spot ( park , Elks hall , church , etc. ) is a great way to share good food and stay on a budget .
There is a bounty when everyone participates , and you can get a much greater variety of good food when you ’re joined by 10 others .
If you all plan to share your leftovers , there may even be enough for a late - night snack or lunch the next day .
Eating together with friends also connects us with our most basic of human needs , harvesting food and sharing it together with those in our “ clan ” .
We ’ve been doing it for thousands of years .
Why not make it a regular event , and act like humans together ?

Buy Local Foods
Getting to know your local producers connects you with your food in a unique way .
When you know what ’s in season in your area , and you know the people who make it on a personal level , the food becomes much more than just sustenance , but is also a community - building event .
Knowing the people that produce local food also builds ties in the local community .
By trading your money ( that you earned in the community ) with local producers of food , you ’re keeping the money in your community , not sending it off to the corporate headquarters of BBM .
You can find local bakeries , coffee shops , breweries , vegetable markets , ethnic food stores , etc. that are owned by individuals in your community by consulting the phone book , local message boards , or a community hall or meeting place .
Look for the local folks , and support your neighbors !

Use the Whole Thing Cook a whole chicken .
Roast for dinner one night , chicken soup from the stock the next , and pulled chicken tacos the third night , chicken salad sandwiches for lunch the third day .
Four meals from one chicken , and that ’s without using the bones !
Seriously though , this is a very economical way to cook , and one that is totally enjoyable .
These things take time , but the holidays are a great time to practice , and the more you do it , the better you ’ll get at it .
The point is , with a few additional ingredients , you can “ stretch ” the meal out to three or four day ’s worth of food and not really feel like you ’re eating the same roasted chicken four days in a row .
This is frugal , and ( as Alton Brown says ) Good Eats .

Milk goes green as eco-friendly cardboard bottles hit the shops
The revolutionary milk bottle is made out of recycled paper
A new environmentally - friendly milk bottle is set to go on sale in supermarkets throughout the UK .
The revolutionary GreenBottle was invented by Martin Myerscough from Suffolk after he saw the impact plastic milk bottles were having on his local landfill .
' The statistics for plastic bottles are just horrible , ' he said .
' I thought that we should be able to do something better and greener . '
Over 18 months , his team based in Framlingham worked on their design .
The outer shell is made from recycled paper that can be recycled again or thrown away to decompose .
It has a thin plastic liner , which takes up less than 0.5 per cent of the space of a plastic bottle if dumped in a landfill .
GreenBottle was first piloted in the Lowestoft branch of ASDA in May last year and sold at the same price as the milk in conventional containers .
It will now be a permanent fixture on the shelves and Mr King said there were plans to offer the product across ASDA 's East Anglia stores within a few months .
Chris Brown , head of ethical and sustainable sourcing at ASDA , said they had been impressed by the concept model .
' The GreenBottle is robust , practical and fit for purpose , meaning there is no danger of spilled milk at breakfast time , ' he added .
An out shell it made from paper .
A loose inner bag is inserted into a paper spout .
The bag is foulded and placed into the outer shell .
The bottle is glued and filled .
An independent lifecycle analysis of the GreenBottle found it had a carbon footprint 48 per cent lower than that of a standard milk bottle .
The bottle is filled locally with milk supplied by Suffolk 's Marybelle dairy .
James Strachan , director of Marybelle Dairy , said : ' The GreenBottle system is the single biggest leap forward in dairy manufacturing technology in years .
' We are thrilled to be able to offer our customers the same high quality milk , in a more sustainable , high quality bottle . '
The Department for the Environment , Food and Rural Affairs predicts that by 2020 half of all milk packaging will be made from recycled materials .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - South Korean activists said on Monday they planned a large candlelight rally to protest U.S. President George W. Bush ’s visit on Tuesday and demand the two countries scrap a widely criticized beef import deal .
Bush is expected in Seoul to shore up support for North Korea ’s decision to disable its nuclear arms program and the trip is likely to be his last as president to East Asia before going to Bangkok and then Beijing to attend the 2008 Olympics .
“ We oppose the visit by Bush who sells U.S. beef with its risk of mad cow disease that threatens the health and lives of the public , ” a coalition of activist groups said in a statement .
The groups have been behind two months of at times violent street protests against the young government of President Lee Myung - bak , sparked by his deal to end a ban on U.S. beef imports .
Lee agreed the deal in April during his first overseas trip after taking office when Bush hosted him at Camp David , only to see it backfire at home .
“ Just as Lee paid a big price to stay at Camp David in April , Bush will be looking to go home with a big catch , ” the protest coalition said .
The street protests have since dwindled as the summer holiday season has arrived but police said they will be on high alert for the short Bush visit .
He arrives on Tuesday and leaves the following day .
The election of Lee , a conservative former CEO , had been expected to mark a fresh start to ties .
Relations had become strained under Lee ’s left - leaning predecessor who won office five years earlier amid a wave of anti-Americanism and differences on how to deal with North Korea , which Bush once dubbed part of an axis of evil .
Lee came to the presidency with promises to get much tougher with the North if it did not give up its nuclear weapons development .
The protesters ’ grievances include a free - trade deal signed last year between South Korea and the United States that some estimates said could lift their annual $ 80 billion two - way trade by as much as a quarter .
Surveys show a majority of South Koreans support the deal .
Neither countries ’ legislature has ratified it .
Lee struck the beef import deal in April after U.S. lawmakers said Congress would not approve the free - trade pact unless Seoul fully opened its market to American beef .

In June , South Korean and U.S. trade officials reworked the beef deal to mollify a Korean public worried about mad cow disease .

It is a leftist terror group that has specialized in kidnapping during its war with the Colombian state and capitalism in general .
After their plane crashed , the captives spent five torturous years hoping to see their families again , at times being locked in boxes at night around rats , pigs and bats .
Sometimes they had weights chained around their neck and were led around at gunpoint with a dog leash .
Upon finally escaping , Keith Stansell emotionally described the moment he laid eyes on his 5 - year - old twins for the first time .
It took a rescue by the Colombian Army to reunite them with freedom and probably save their lives .
The army posed as terrorists , persuading FARC to turn the prisoners over to them , saving 15 innocent victims of the brutal terrorism that has ripped Colombia apart for years .
But how did this happen ?
How did FARC get fooled ?
Colombian
Army members infiltrated the highest levels of the organization , telling FARC they were going to take the hostages to meet an " international mission . "
They landed in a helicopter and spent 22 minutes on the ground collecting the captives and speaking in code to one another before taking off and letting the victims ( who included a former Colombian presidential candidate ) know that they were safe .
So , what is the uniform of choice when fooling terrorists in Colombia ?
Sure , there 's plenty of talk of one intelligence team member , nervous about the mission , who wore a Red Cross symbol against orders .
But other accounts confirm the use of something you can probably pick up at any mall : a Che Guevara T - shirt .
That 's right , the same T - shirts you see Hollywood celebrities , starving pseudo - artists and confused hipster teens wearing around local coffee shops .
To all those who decide that you want to be coffee house communist - chic , remember this :
When you are wearing a Che T - shirt , you 're wearing the same shirt that makes terrorists believe you 're just one of the gang .
I hope that latte is tasty .
How Che became such a revered superhero of the hard - core left is laughable .
First of all , he was n't even a good revolutionary .
He failed in his attempt at world revolution almost as badly as communism has failed in the places it was actually tried .
" This is a history of a failure " is how he himself described his efforts in the Congo .
He was killed in Bolivia , trying to fire up another failure of a war .
Earlier , he even managed to drop his gun and shoot himself in the face .
But more important than his incompetence is the fact that the man was a mass killer .
Hundreds were reportedly executed on his watch , and that does n't include the deaths incurred in the wars he was constantly trying to start .
He described his maniacal lust for war in his writings , saying he savored " the acrid smell of gunpowder and blood of the enemy 's death . "
How this guy is a hero to the anti-war crowd is truly perplexing .
I should also point out what seemingly gets eliminated from the Hollywood movies attempting to glorify him : his bouts with racism .
When describing the differences in the strife between " Europeans " and " the black , " the supposedly progressive - minded Che wrote , " their different attitudes of life separate them completely : the black is indolent and fanciful , he spends his money on frivolity and drink ; the European comes from a tradition of working and saving which follows him to this corner of America and drives him to get ahead . "
Ohhhhh , so the " European " is a hard worker while " the black " is a fanciful drunk .
Now I understand the difference .
I wonder if that quote would inspire the volunteer office of Barack Obama 's Houston supporters to remove their Che flag .
After it was spotted on the wall in a local news video , Obama 's campaign , far from a haven for right - wing nut jobs , went out of its way to make sure everyone knew that it had nothing to do with the flag and did n't approve of its use .
If Che were such a hero , why would that be necessary ?
Revisionist history 's fusion with fashion sense is n't exactly new , but its popularity seems to be growing .
When actress Cameron Diaz showed up in Peru , she thought she had a trendy bag that might garner some jealous stares .
People were staring , sure , but for all the wrong reasons .
The bag , purchased in China , featured a red star and the words " Serve the people " on it .
The problem ?
That was Mao Zedong 's most famous political slogan , and it stirred up memories of the Maoist Shining Path insurgency , which , according to the BBC , was responsible for 70,000 deaths in Peru during the ' 80s and '90s .
Diaz apologized later for " inadvertently " offending anyone .
It 's been five years since the story of convicted abortion clinic bomber and Olympic park bomber Eric Rudolph led the news .
As he was evading police capture for months , stories of townspeople donning " Run Rudolph Run " bumper stickers were correctly greeted with horrified disdain .
With the exception of the fact that Che killed a lot more people , what 's the difference ?
You should n't be wearing an " I heart abortion clinic bombers " T - shirt , and if you have any respect for humanity , you should n't be wearing a Che Guevara T - shirt , either .
Perhaps I should cash in on a Che T - shirt featuring his clichéd image too .
Except this time , instead of glorifying him , it could specifically be designed to point out his pathetic and brutal legacy .
Honestly , though , I 'm afraid I 'd be sued .
The communist revolutionary who dedicated his life to fight capitalism has now become nothing more than a piece of merchandise .
Lesson learned :
In the end , capitalism always wins .
When your only option is a Che shirt , maybe it 's just better to go topless .

Jerry Brown gets tough on medical pot clubs
California Attorney General Jerry Brown comments on the death of Anna Nicole Smith during a news conference in Los Angeles Friday , Oct. 12 , 2007 .
Authorities investigating the death of Anna Nicole Smith raided six locations Friday , including the offices and residences of two doctors , a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney 's office said .

California Attorney General Jerry Brownhas ordered a crackdown on medical pot clubs that are selling the drug for big profits .
The move puts the state a bit more in line with the feds in dealing with the explosion of questionable marijuana dispensaries since the passage of Proposition 215 more than a decade ago .
The first target was Today 's Health Care club in Northridge ( Los Angeles County ) , which agents from the state Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement raided over the weekend .
The club owner and an alleged middleman were booked on drug - dealing charges .
Brown said Tuesday he would " not be surprised " to see similar raids here in the Bay Area .
" The voters wanted medical marijuana dispensaries to be used for seriously ill patients and their caregivers - not as million - dollar businesses , " Brown said .
In recent years , pot club raids have been conducted mainly by federal authorities who do n't recognize Prop.
215 , the initiative California voters passed in 1996 to let patients use cannabis to treat what ailed them .
Although medical marijuana is still illegal under federal law , the feds say many of their targets were actually sham outfits that were dealing marijuana for , shall we say , nonmedicinal uses .
This week , Brown issued an 11 - page directive laying out guidelines that medical marijuana cooperatives must follow to comply with Prop. 215 .
Among them :
Sell only to legitimate patients .
Operate as nonprofits .
Buy pot only from fellow cooperative members at prices that cover cost , as opposed to professional growers out for big bucks .
" We are not out to harass legitimate clubs , " Brown said .
" The targets are those clubs that are part of a larger criminal operation where medical marijuana winds up being sold on the street and contributing to crime and violence . "
Some medical marijuana dispensers , concerned that thuggish dope dealers are giving their business a bad name , welcomed Brown 's guidelines - and the state crackdown .
" It 's something many activists have been looking for since the medical marijuana law passed , " said Kevin Reed of the Green Cross marijuana collective in San Francisco .
He said his outfit had nothing to fear .
" We are a nonprofit , " Reed said .
" We only sell to patients .
We only get our pot in small quantities from patients who grow it and sell it on consignment .
" We 've been on the front page of every major newspaper in the nation and have never been bothered by the feds , because we are an open book , " Reed said .
As for how many of San Francisco 's 26 pot clubs might find themselves in hot water , Reed said : " I expect about 10 will not be with us within a year . "
Mayoral misses : San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsomwill be hosting a free indie - rock concert at a Denver art gallery tonight - which will probably the biggest stage the gubernatorial hopeful gets at the Democratic Party Convention this week .
And he's not the only California up - and - comer relegated to the sidelines .
Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , who has designs on the statehouse himself , was n't offered a speaking role at the convention , either .
The Demo Duo's absence might seem like something of a surprise to some , given that just a couple of years back , they were being touted as two of the party 's shining new lights .
But both mayors backed the wrong candidate in the Democratic primaries - Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton .
And both Newsom and Villaraigosa are coming off rough patches in their personal lives - Newsom for sleeping with his campaign manager 's wife , and Villaraigosa for his affair with a TV reporter while he was still married .
Plus , with California already considered safely in Barack Obama 's pocket this November , there appeared to be little incentive for the Democrats to spend precious TV time on either man .
Instead , the podium slots went to politicos from swing states .
" Why else would they have city clerks from Illinois and other places speak ? " said California state party Chairman Art Torres .
" We need those states to win the White House , " Torres said .
" It 's a smart play . "
It is worth noting , however , that Rep. Mike Honda of San Jose , as well as Southern California Reps.
Linda Sanchez and Xavier Becerra , were all given speaking roles Tuesday .
Honda is a national party chair , and the other two were early Obama backers .
State Controller John Chiang and Sen. Barbara Boxer - both of whom supported Clinton - got face time on the podium as well .
So apparently , Newsom and Villaraigosa just did n't rate .
None of which apparently had either man losing much sleep .
Both figure their careers wo n't suffer too much from not speaking at 3 o'clock in front of a half - empty hall .
Road tour :
How 's this for a presidential joyride ?
When Sharky Laguana heard from an employee of his San Francisco company , Bandago , that one of his $ 65,000 rental tour vans had disappeared Sunday in Allentown , Pa. , he called police .
Officers put out an all points bulletin .
Imagine Laguana 's surprise when he found out the next day that Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , who is on John McCain 's short list for vice president , was riding around in the " stolen " van all day campaigning for the Republican presidential nominee - to - be .
" I do n't know that anybody could have picked my jaw up off the floor , " the professed " political junkie " told The Chronicle 's Tanya Schevitz .
Pawlenty did n't actually steal the van .
It was all a mix - up - and a strange one at that .
Laguana , whose company rents out high - end vans to rock bands , had arranged for an employee to pick up the vehicle at the Allentown Holiday Inn once the group Everclear was done with it .
But when the employee arrived at the hotel , he was told that a man in a blue suit already had driven the van away .
The man in the blue suit was a police officer , assigned to Pawlenty , who was supposed to pick up a rental at the hotel - but he wound up at the wrong Holiday Inn picking up the keys to the wrong vehicle .
" The driver said it was a little weird that there were a couple beers in the van when he picked it up , " Laguana said .
He might also have wondered why the governor needed a 24 - foot - long Dodge Sprinter van , loaded with a 20 - inch LCD video screen with a DVD , an Xbox 360 game system and iPod .
After driving Pawlenty around on Monday , the driver called the number on a contract the band had left in the van .
That 's when he learned he had the wrong vehicle .
Laguana is now negotiating with the McCain campaign to cover the van 's $ 200 - a - day rent .

And that was just as of Jan. 31 .
According to new tallies by the Campaign Finance Institute , the Center for Responsive Politics and the watchdog group Democracy 21 , federal presidential and congressional candidates , the national parties , and the unaffiliated 527 groups have raised $ 1.71 billion during this election cycle .
Well , you better be enjoying all this presidential political theatre because it 's costing America way , way more than any Hollywood blockbuster dud .
their pedals to the metal .
Obama , for instance , has raised close to $ 100 million of his $ 230 million total just since the end of January when all the presidential candidates had raised " only " about $ 800 million .
Remember , that 's all done with limits on personal contributions to presidential candidates of $ 2,300 per person , per year .
As The Ticket noted Tuesday morning , Obama had 218,000 " new " contributors just last month .
There are no such donor limits on giving to 527 groups , those entities regulated by the Federal Election Commission and the Internal Revenue Service that produce issue ads that technically do not support individual candidates .
But , boy , can they go after one candidate .
According to the Campaign Finance Institute , those 527 groups are " alive and well , " even after they were more tightly regulated following the 2004 elections .
( You might remember Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ; John Kerry surely does . )
As of Jan. 31 , 527 groups had raised $ 77 million during this cycle , but they 're just getting going .
In 2004 , they raised $ 424 million and they 're running ahedad of that pace this quadrennial time around .
The institute notes that despite the notoriety of those Swift Boat ads -- to swiftobat someone has even nbecome a widely - used expression for smearing -- 527s remain largely a Democratic phenomenon .
Groups oriented groups oriented toward supporting Democratic candidates are outraising those oriented toward helping Republicans by a 2.5 to 1 margin .
The Democratic - leaning groups are largely fueled by labor unions and wealthy individuals , the institute says in its report .
Giving to the Republicans like Sen. John McCain is lagging all around this cycle .
-- James Oliphant
James Oliphant is a writer for the Swamp of the Chicago Tribune Washington Bureau .
" Some people say " that Barack Obama 's speech of July 1 supporting a new initiative of federal outreach to faith - based good works is pandering .
Even if it were pandering , it would be a good thing .
But it 's not .
For one thing , it may mean that Barack Obama , unlike the Current President , reads things .
His address came nearly as a direct answer to an opinion column in June 28 issue of The Washington Post by former director of the White House Office of Faith - Based and Community Initiatives Jim Towey , " Who ’ll Keep the Faith - Based Initiative ? "
Obama 's plan probably irks
Towey for several reasons , first and foremost that Obama 's name is often followed by a " D " for " Democrat . "
No , this is a bona fide policy offering from Obama , not a political peace offering for his being a Muslim and all .
First of all , Obama does n't do that shit .
He 's The Real Deal , capital R , capital D . He will win but without all the bullshit .
Period .
Second , the proposal as he's laid it out is perfectly consistent with his history beginning as a community organizer in the hardass neighborhoods of Detroit .
There is nothing inconsistent or disingenuous about it .
It is directly in line with something that this blogger argued long and hard during the primary regarding Obama ;s " experience , " that his state and local experience would , to the contrary of his detractors , actually serve to be downright essential to his presidency .
No , this is a genuine policy proposal , unlike some " faith " " based " " initiatives " created by The Current President .
However .
If Presumptive President Barack Obama were to try to speak to the evangelicals , I think it would probably be a good idea .
Really .
Why not ?
We have more to offer them than they do .
If you 're religious in America and are concerned about preserving religious freedom , you are millions of times better off with the liberals than with the " conservatives . "
Liberals are , by dictionary definition , people who , the first time they encounter Voltaire 's most famous quote , " I disapprove of what you say , but I will defend to the death your right to say it , " become weepy and say " That 's beautiful . "
When " conservatives " first hear that sentiment , they often exclaim , " Voltaire ?
Who 's that fag ? "
Many liberals are , indeed , godless no - good communists such as myself .
But we 'd pick up sub- machine guns to stop anyone from forcing or denying worship .
This is true .
" Conservatives " might think about defending your right ot worship , but only if you believe in Jesus Christ and if you read the right Bible and if you underline the correct passages and if you genuflect left to right and if you claim to oppose abortion ( unless it 's YOUR daughter what 's pregnant ) .
It 's liberals , kids , who actually care about religious freedom and who actually understand how to preserve it .
Proof : Look again at failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney 's speech , entitled " Why Mormons Like To Wear Magical Underpants — Look , I'm Wearing Mine Right Now , " delivered on Dec. 6 , 2007 .
He said the following .
In fact , he did n't just say it .
He thought it first , then he wrote it down , and then he actually said this in front of cameras and , presumably , God and everybody .
( Emphasis of stupid things said by Mitt Romney mine . )
We separate church and state affairs in this country , and for good reason .
No religion should dictate to the state nor should the state interfere with the free practice of religion .
But in recent years , the notion of the separation of church and state has been taken by some well beyond its original meaning .
They seek to remove from the public domain any acknowledgment of God.
Religion is seen as merely a private affair with no place in public life .
It is as if they are intent on establishing a new religion in America — the religion of secularism .
They are wrong .
No , asshole .
We 're right .
And we 're right on your behalf and on behalf of all of the faithful in the Untied States of America .
Maintaining a wholly secular public square is the only concrete method ever demonstrated for preserving religious freedom .
Once you require a deity in the public square , it 's only a question of which deity is the government - sanctioned one and how many goose - stepping , pomade - mulletted Joel Osteens it takes to frog - march you to the Official House Of Worship Of The United States Guv'ment .
A secular public square allows your friend Herschel to worship G-d , allows me to sleep in Sundays , and allows Mitt Romney to worship God as a Mormon .
And it 's liberals who understand that , who would gladly take up arms to allow you talk to your imaginary friends in the sky even though we 're all a bunch of godless communists .
Mitt Romney sure as hell does n't understand that .
Nor does his party .
Freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom .
Now , that is some scary shit .
Further evidence that the Democratic Party understands and reveres religious freedom more than does the Republigoat Party : Did you see 60 Minutes Sunday ?
From the time of Jesus , there have been Christians in what is now Iraq .
The Christian community took root there after the Apostle Thomas headed east in the year 35 .
But now , after nearly 2,000 years , Iraqi Christians are being hunted , murdered and forced to flee — persecuted on a biblical scale in Iraq ’s religious civil war .
That is a tinderbox that the Untied States of America ignited .
Under the watch of the Republigoat Party .
Under Sadaam , Christians were fine in Iraq .
His Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz was a Christian for crissake .
Now , after the idiotic meddling of this administration , eh , not so much .
So , tell me , which political mindset again is better for religious freedom ?
Hmmmm ?
This case needs to be made , fervently , to the so - called " values voters . "
The Republigoat Party is in severe disfavor with this voting bloc — which was based on nothing but a cynical , ineffective political alliance anyway — and it 's time for the Democratic Party to get on its knees and ask these folks for their vote .
We can get it , and we should have it , because , honestly , we have much , much more to offer them .
But what about abortion ?
You ask .
Well .
We 're right on abortion , too , and we need to tell them that .
We need to explain that we do n't like abortions any more than they do , but that we understand that it 's not even physcially possible to legislate them away or to rule them away in court ; that women have been trying to " get rid of it " ever since they 've been getting pregnant — it is a little - known fact that an anciently censored passage of the Old Testament has Eve throwing herself down a flight of stairs — and that they 'll continue to do so no matter what a bunch of fat pasty dickheads in the mid-atlantic have to say about it ; that historically , nobody has actually given two farts about abortion in this country until the mid-1800s , when doctors here decided they no longer wanted to allow pharmacists to practice it and so they trumped up " moral " grounds to oppose it .
We need to explain to them that their current regime is not actually interested in solving the problem ; that , in fact , they feel very comfortable with it because it gives them an issue to run against libruhls on .
Those baby - killing , godless communist bastards .
The Democratic Party has an opporunity to seize and could actually benefit by appealing to evangelicals .
Not by pandering to them .
But by piping up and actually talking to them .
Because , truth told , we have more to offer people of faith than they do .
The persistent , loud lies of politically ambitious Republigoats have for years kept Americans in the dark regarding this truth .
It 's time that we started telling it like it is and establishing a 50 - state strategy across the cultural divide as well .

The sister act behind " Barracuda , " the song used by the McCain - Palin campaign in reference to Sarah Palin's " Barracuda " nickname , is none too pleased that their pro-woman anthem is being co-opted by the GOP .
Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart sent a cease and desist letter to the McCain campaign , and , in reaction to last night 's use of it , Nancy sent an angry letter to Entertainment Weekly , tearing Sarah Barracuda a new one .
" I feel completely fucked over , " she said .
" Sarah Palin 's views and values in NO WAY represent us as American women .
We ask that our song ' Barracuda ' no longer be used to promote her image .
The song ' Barracuda ' was written in the late 70s as a scathing rant against the soulless , corporate nature of the music business , particularly for women .
( The ' barracuda ' represented the business . )
While Heart did not and would not authorize the use of their song at the RNC , there 's irony in Republican strategists ' choice to make use of it there . " [ EW ]

HONG KONG ( MarketWatch ) -- OPEC members have agreed to roll back oil production to quotas agreed in September 2007 , a level that will cut output by about 500,000 barrels a day .
An OPEC statement issued at the conclusion of its meeting Wednesday said the organization agreed to produce 28.8 million barrels a day .
An Associated Press report cited OPEC President Chakib Khelil as saying the quota meant that member countries agreed cut back production by 530,000 barrels a per day .
As far as I 'm concerned , that has the hallmark on it .
I hate to have come round to this view , but that 's where McCain has landed me .
" It is shameful and downright perverse for the McCain campaign to use a bill that was written to protect young children from sexual predators as a recycled and discredited political attack against a father of two young girls - a position that his friend Mitt Romney also holds .
Last week , John McCain told
Time magazine he could n't define what honor was .
Now we know why . "
( TPM )
Man .
I used to respect him so much .
Back when he won the primary , I was so happy .
The only decent man in the whole set , and no one ever expected him to win .
Now ?
I do n't recognize him .
He seems to have been replaced by his own evil twin .
The latest lie put out by his campaign is that Obama wants to teach sex ed to kindergartners .
That 's a little pathetic .
He 's apparently adopted the political philosophy of Rove : the person who is willing to do anything to win will pull in all the voters who do n't understand the issues .
He 's also adopted the philosophy of Bush : pick a vice - president the majority of the public will despise even more than they 've learned to despise you as insurance against impeachment .
Well , at least we know the measure of the man 's desperation to be president , which seems quite strange given that he seems to be pulling ahead in the polls .
I actually think the Dems should calm down and focus on getting the word out about what McCain and Palin --- because the choice reflects so badly on him --- really are about .
Bounce ?
Bounce ?
That 'll give him his " bounce . "
Why do you think he 's working so hard at creating a false picture of Obama ?
His campaign has clocked --- a bit too late in the day --- the sort of embarrassments in store for them on the Palin pick .
They want the public to be equally disenchanted with Obama .
Such is my belief .
At TPM , Josh Marshall writes :
One of the interesting aspects of this campaign is watching the scales fall from the eyes of many of John McCain 's closest admirers among the veteran DC press corps .
I 'm not talking about the freaks on Fox News or any of the sycophants at the AP .
I 'm talking about , let 's say , the better sort of reporters and commentators in the 45 to 65 age bracket .
To the extent that the press was McCain 's base ( and in many though now sillier respects it still is ) this was the base of the base .
And talking to a number of them I can understand why that was , at least in the sense of the person he was then presenting himself as ..... [ L ] et 's face it , John McCain is running a campaign almost entirely based on straight up lies .
Not just exaggerations or half truths but the sort of straight up , up - is - down mind - blowers we 've become so accustomed to from the current occupants of the White House .
And today McCain comes out with this rancid , race - baiting ad based on another lie .
Willie Horton looks mild by comparison .
( And remember , President George H.W. Bush never ran the Willie Horton ad himself .
It was an outside group .
He was n't willing to degrade himself that far . )
As TPM Reader JM said below , at least Horton actually was released on a furlough .
This is ugly stuff .
And this is an ugly person .
There 's clearly no level of sleaze this guy wo n't stoop to to win this election ....( TPM )
Conservative Andrew Sullivan --- a former admirer of McCain --- discusses what this final show of irresponsibility , ruthlessness , and reckless disregard of the country 's current urgent needs means to him .
I am going to quote more than I normally would because it's so important and everyone should read it :
For me , this surreal moment - like the entire surrealism of the past ten days - is not really about Sarah Palin or Barack Obama or pigs or fish or lipstick .
It 's about John McCain .
The one thing I always thought I knew about him is that he is a decent and honest person .
When he knows , as every sane person must , that Obama did not in any conceivable sense mean that Sarah Palin is a pig , what did he do ?
Did he come out and say so and end this charade ?
Or did he acquiesce in and thereby enable the mindless Rovianism that is now the core feature of his campaign ?
So far , he has let us all down .
My guess is he will continue to do so .
And that decision , for my part , ends whatever respect I once had for him .
On core moral issues , where this man knew what the right thing was , and had to pick between good and evil , he chose evil .
When he knew that George W. Bush 's war in Iraq was a fiasco and catastrophe , and before Donald Rumsfeld quit , McCain endorsed George W. Bush against his fellow Vietnam vet , John Kerry in 2004 .
By that decision , McCain lost any credibility that he can ever put country first .
He put party first and his own career first ahead of what he knew was best for the country .
And when the Senate and House voted overwhelmingly to condemn and end the torture regime of Bush and Cheney in 2006 , McCain again had a clear choice between good and evil , and chose evil .
He capitulated and enshrined torture as the policy of the United States , by allowing the CIA to use techniques as bad as and worse than the torture inflicted on him in Vietnam .
He gave the war criminals in the White House retroactive immunity against the prosecution they so richly deserve .
The enormity of this moral betrayal , this betrayal of his country 's honor , has yet to sink in .
But for my part , it now makes much more sense .
He is not the man I thought he was ....
He began his general campaign with a series of grotesque , trivial and absurd MTV - style attacks on Obama 's virtues and implied disgusting things about his opponent 's patriotism .
And then , because he could see he was going to lose , ten days ago , he threw caution to the wind and with no vetting whatsoever , picked a woman who , by her decision to endure her own eight - month pregnancy of a Down Syndrome child in public , that he was going to reignite the culture war as a last stand against Obama .
That 's all that is happening right now : a massive bump in the enthusiasm of the Christianist base .
This is pure Rove .
Yes , McCain made a decision that revealed many appalling things about him .
In the end , his final concern is not national security .
No one who cares about national security would pick as vice - president someone who knows nothing about it as his replacement .
No one who cares about this country 's safety would gamble the security of the world on a total unknown because she polled well with the Christianist base .
( The Daily Dish )
If McCain does win--- which , frankly , I do n't believe he will , polls or no polls --- he will be a president like Bush ---- without honor or respect .
From a coldly political standpoint --- a strategic or Rovian standpoint , bereft of my growing anxiety about the GOP 's connivance with our nation 's plunderers and my sense that our chances may be running out ---- I find I do n't care as much as I should , since we are currently in such dire straits that I doubt anyone can dig us out in four years .
And after he fails to make the country better , stronger , safer , or more respected , or to alleviate the misery of individual Americans , people will doubtless finally get the message : it was n't just about Bush .
The entire Republican party now exists to protect the interests of the current holders of wealth and power .
Let him bury his own reputation for honor and truthfulness --- which apparently arose from people taking him at his word --- along with the truth .
But I think he 'll lose .
And what history will remember about him is the last part .
The part where his reputation lay scrambled on the ground , a sacrifice to his ambition .

Back in June , I announced the creation of FsTest , a testing Domain Specific Language for F#.
Since that time , the F# team has released the September 2008 CTP , which finally gives F# full citizenship within Visual Studio with real project files .
I felt it was time to update FsTest , and more in particular , FsxUnit , which uses xUnit. net as the back end for doing assertions .
Go ahead and pick up the latest bits here from the CodePlex site .
What ’s Changed ?
Other than migrating the code to the new F# project formats , the migration was rather smooth .
As I have mentioned before , order still matters in your F# projects .
But luckily Visual Studio now gives you the opportunity to not only add files above and below , but to move files up and down as well , as shown below :
Code changes were pretty minimal .
There were a few instances in which I had to change the method signature slightly in the interface file , such as the following .
Before
/// Determine whether the collection is empty
val Empty : # System .

After

The difference between the two being that the before has a signature which looks like this :
val Empty < ‘a when ‘a : > System .
Collections .
IEnumerable >
And having it specified that way does not work properly , whereas it did in the previous versions of F# .
There were several instances I removed the # in front of the seq and IEnumerable classes .
Note that none of the calling code in any of my tests had to change one bit , so if you ’ve been using it , there should be no issues arising .
Since the time I unveiled FsTest , xUnit.net , my favorite unit testing framework , has released version 1.02 , which covered minor bug fixes .
After updating the references and fixing those slight issues , I ’m able to run the xUnit. net GUI runner and get the green lights which is always joy :
Where to Go From Here ?
So , where do I go from here ?
I ’m still looking to move this more towards a BDD style , instead of just the DSL syntax for the assertions .
Taking some ideas still from RSpec and Scala Specs is my goal to make this a more complete solution .
It ’s still a work in progress , but the real question , what works for you ?
What does n’t ?
Where should it go ?
I have some ideas , but feedback is always appreciated .
LOS ANGELES – What could the creators of * Castlevania * be thinking ?
After a few years of nothing but portable versions of Konami 's classic vampire - hunter action game series , Castlevania made its return to consoles at last week 's E3 .
But instead of a traditional single - player adventure in which your whip - wielding hero plows through levels full of zombies and skeletons on the way to a showdown with Dracula , Castlevania Judgment for Wii is ... a two - player fighting game ?!
Whiskey tango foxtrot , over .
Series producer Koji Igarashi , pictured , had an explanation all ready to go when I asked .
" Fans have been asking me for a while to do a Wii game using the Wiimote as a whip .
But * Castlevania * is the type of game that fans play for hours at a time , and to swing the Wii remote for hours at a time is a very torturous endeavor .
Tiring .
So I thought about it a little bit more and thought that if it was a timed sort of game , that you played for a limited time , that would be a nice fit . "
It all sounds totally logical when you hear the soft - spoken Igarashi describe it like that .
But there 's something that just does n't sit right about it .
1 up 's Jeremy Parish said after experiencing much the same thing :
" The saddest thing is watching Koji Igarashi on the E3 show floor , hovering around the Castlevania Judgment kiosk for half an hour , knowing that everyone hates it , knowing that he knows they hate it , then realizing that it's not the game he really wanted to make anyway because his publisher wo n't give him two dimes to rub together to develop the really awesome games he does want to create . "
True to form , the eccentric Igarashi did indeed stalk the Konami booth at E3 looking like a character out of his games , donning a fedora and brandishing a whip .
This is a man deeply in touch with his fans .
Even so , fans did n't want a Castlevania fighting game , but now we 've got one .
Is it , at least , any good ?
From my 15 minutes of playing it at E3 , it 's ... OK .
Both players have full run of a 3 - D arena , and the gameplay seems inspired by the classic games .
You can select a projectile weapon , attack with your character 's traditional melee weapon of choice , or use super moves that build up over time .
But this is n't Street Fighter .
The characters do n't have a massive array of secret moves and button combos .
They control like characters in a traditional single - player adventure game , like what a true Wii Castlevania would be like if they actually made one .
The difference is n't in the controls , it 's in who you fight and for how long .
Igarashi likens it to the classic Capcom brawler Power Stone .
" It 's not a fighting game , " he says .
" It 's ' 3 - D versus action . '
Unlike a fighting game , which requires very precise timing and button pressing and movements , this one 's more of a pick - up - and - play game , where you 're collecting items as you 're playing . "
Pick - up - and - play .
I 've heard that one before , especially in connection with Wii .
And sure enough , Igarashi says that he sees Judgment as a way of expanding the appeal of the * Castlevania * franchise .
" Up until now , Castlevania has focused mostly on the 2 - D side - scrolling types of games which have made it successful .
But to expand the franchise , I have to try creating other types of things , " he says .
But Igarashi gave a slightly more revealing answer later in the interview , when I asked him about his feelings on the current state of Japan 's game market , and the fact that Wii is outselling PlayStation 3 by huge amounts each week .
" Wii is selling , but the ' gamer 's games ' are n't selling .
That 's what I 'm concerned about , " he says .
" I think there are two roads you can take : Create a game for the core fans with as low a development cost as possible , the other is to just find a different market for these consoles outside the core gamer . "
Emphasis mine .
If Jeremy Parish is right , and this is a description of how Castlevania Judgment truly came to be – that is , Konami did n't give him enough of a budget to do anything else – it is n't especially heartening for series fans .
" I have to adapt to the times , but I can't alienate the core fans , " he concluded .
A few more quotes from Igarashi follow .
On the graphics :
You 'll notice a different style of art that 's being used for this game , because the artist we asked to do the art for this game is a famous Japanese manga artist named Takashi Obata .
You probably think , wow , the characters are n't what I envision them looking like , especially Simon .
But that 's Takashi Obata 's personal flavor added to what he envisions as the gothic version of these characters .
__
On the music :
There is new music , but the way I did it was based on who your opponent is and what game they 're from .
So when you fight against Simon , it 's " Vampire Killer " remixed .
Also for example , when you fight Maria , the song from Rondo of Blood called " Slash " will be in the background .
__
On the series ' future : Another reason why we did this game was ... well , maybe I should have done this for the 20th anniversary of the series , but it 's the 22nd anniversary , which I guess is good enough .
It 's a celebration , bringing different characters from the 22 years of the franchise together .
In that sense , when you mention doing a 3 - D , single player game in the future , that 's definitely a possibility , we could definitely work on that , but right now I 'm really focused on this game .
On Capcom's Mega Man 9 : I 'm watching that very closely to see how it does .
Myself , I 'm a big retro gaming fan , so if it is successful that definitely opens up doors for what I can do .
On whether * Castlevania * just does n't work in 3 - D : Not at all .
It 's not the franchise itself that wo n't go to 3 - D.
I 'm actually very frustrated about that and I want to keep trying because I think the franchise can do well in 3 - D .

Song of the Universal
June , 1874 Camden
# Space

Come , said the Muse ,
Sing me a song no poet yet has chanted ,
Sing me the Universal .
#
In this broad Earth of ours ,
Amid the measureless grossness & the slag ,
Enclosed & safe within its central heart ,
Nestles the seed Perfection .
#
By every life a share , or more or less ,
None born but it is born — conceal'd or
unconceal'd the seed is waiting .
#
Lo !
keen - eyed , towering science !
As from tall peaks the Modern overlooking ,
Successive , absolute fiats issuing .
#

Yet again , lo ! the Soul — above all science ;
For it , the Soul , has entire History gathered
like husks around the globe ;
For it , the Soul , the ^ entire star myriads roll through
the sky .
#
In spiral roads , by long detours ,
( As a much - tacking ship upon the sea , )
For it , the Rea partial to the permanent flowing ,
For it , the Real to the Ideal tends .
#
For it , the mystic evolution ;
Nor the right only justified — what we call evil
also justified .
#
Forth from their masks , no matter what ,
From the huge , festering trunk — from craft and
guile & tears ,
Health to emerge , & joy — joy universal .
#
[ begin leaf 3 recto ]

Out of the bulk , the morbid & the shallow ,
Out of the bad majority — the varied , countless
frauds of men and states ,
Electric , antiseptic yet — cleaving , suffusing all ,
Only the little Good is universal .
#
Over the mountain growths of sin , disease & sorrow ,
An uncaught bird is ever hovering , hovering ,
High in the pure and happy air .
#
From imperfection 's murkiest cloud ,
Darts always fl forth one ray of perfect light ,
One flash of heaven 's glory .
#
To fashion 's , custom 's discord ,
To the mad Babel - din , the deafening oro orgies ,
Soothing each lull a strain is heard , just heard ,
From some far shore , the final chorus sounding .

Republican Rep. Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia has refused to apologize for calling Barack and Michelle Obama uppity .
He has released a statement claiming that he has never heard the term uppity used in a racial way .
He is from Georgia , and has never heard the term used that way .
Does anybody buy this ?
“ Honestly , I ’ve never paid that much attention to Michelle Obama , ” Westmoreland said to CQ Politics .
“ Just what little I ’ve seen of her and Senator [ Barack ]
Obama , is that they ’re a member of an elitist class … that thinks that they ’re uppity . ”
Westmoreland defended his use of the term in a statement , “ I ’ve never heard that term used in a racially derogatory sense .
It is important to note that the dictionary definition of ‘ uppity ’ is ‘ affecting an air of inflated self - esteem —- snobbish . ’
That ’s what we meant by uppity when we used it in the mill village where I grew up . ”
Advertisements
Technically , his dictionary definition is correct .
However words also take on a social context and meaning .
The dictionary also gives an example of how this term is used , “ But maybe also these midwives are just getting too uppity and need to learn their place . ”
We all know that this is what Westmoreland was really saying .
Barack and Michelle Obama need to learn their place .
In this context , he was implying the Obamas are black people with money who think that they are better than what they are .
Believe it or not , Lynn Westmoreland is seriously considering a run for governor in 2010 .
These are the kind of comments that can derail a gubernatorial campaign before it ever starts .
His remark was shameful , but it goes to show that race is still a factor in this campaign .
Should Obama win this election , comments such as Westmoreland ’s , are evidence of why his victory will be so historic and important .

Google Chrome Screenshots
Google announced their browser Google Chrome to be available on Tuesday , but their download page and tour was already partly available at gears.google.com / chrome / just now , as Uval in the forum noticed .
While the download itself did n’t work when I tried , I was able to extract some screenshots , from the frontpage but also the YouTube videos .
And while the product tour videos themselves seemed to require a special group membership at YouTube , the video still previews are public and you can paste the video identifier into a URL like this one to see more high quality stills .
The service ’s logo .
Screenshots of Google Chrome from the service ’s frontpage .
The auto - completion of the so - called “ omnibox ” address bar .
The homepage showing 9 thumbnailed pages to access , along with more pointers in the side - bar , to appear “ [ e] very time you open a new tab ” , as Google says .
This screenshot shows Google Calendar and a dialog reading “ Create shortcuts in the following locations ” , listing Desktop , Start Menu and Quick Launch Bar .
Zooming in on the browser tabs .
The Google Chrome task manager , e.g. to monitor if certain sites cause memory problems .
A screen showing the “ Google incognito ” mode for allegedly more private browsing .
Another auto -completion example .
A star near the address input bar lets you bookmark a page , apparently .
A look into the settings menu .
Google in their tour says with Chrome “ you see your download ’s status at the bottom of your current window . ”
On a related note , I asked Scott McCloud – creator of the comic book introducing Google Chrome – some questions .
Scott now put up a mini-FAQ on his site .
He says he ’d been working on the comic off and on “ from March through August . ”
On the question of who came up with the visualizations , he says there was some “ rough whiteboard sketching during the interviews ” but that most were his though .
Asked about how many of these comics were printed , Scott says it was just a limited run , and that he did n’t sign any yet .
He adds this project was “ a big challenge ” considering he had “ never done such a thing before . ”

Thanks Uval and Scott ! ]
The discussion continues in the existing forum thread .

The federal bailout of the U.S. financial system will be too late to stop more pillars of the global banking business from toppling in the near term .
That will necessitate more mega- mergers , direct government aid , or both .
Wachovia Corp. may be the next U.S. banking giant forced to sell itself , after its shares dived 47 % last week .
Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. were said to be in a bidding war for $ 812 - billion - asset Wachovia this afternoon , according to a New York Times report .
The Treasury and the Federal Reserve were involved in the negotiations , the Times said .
Not surprisingly , the report said both Citi and Wells had " serious concerns " about taking on Wachovia ’s loan portfolio , which is filled with rotten mortgages acquired in Charlotte , N.C. - based Wachovia ’s 2006 purchase of California ’s Golden West Financial Corp .
Meanwhile , the already - bad situation in Europe worsened over the weekend .
This afternoon , Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg agreed to invest $ 16.3 billion in Fortis NV , the Dutch - Belgian financial services titan , to essentially nationalize the company , which has been sinking under the weight of bad loans -- including U.S. mortgage securities .
See the Bloomberg News story here .
Also , Britain today was on the verge of nationalizing Bradford & Bingley , one of the country ’s biggest mortgage lenders .
Bloomberg notes that Bradford & Bingley " is the third major British bank to run into trouble since credit markets seized up last year around the world .
Its shares have fallen 93 % this year .
Northern Rock was nationalized in February , and HBOS PLC sold itself to Lloyds TSB Group on Sept. 18 . "
The British housing market , like the U.S. market , became a massive speculative bubble in recent years , pumped up by cheap money .

Each year , US nuclear power plants prevent 700 million tons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere .
In order to equal that achievement by reducing emissions from personal automobiles , the owners of 96 % of the cars on the road today would have to agree to never drive again .
Why then , are so many people in the “ Environmental Movement ” so firm in their opposition to nuclear power ?
I used quotes and capital letters to emphasize a point – I recognize that there are individual people concerned about the environment who have a more open mind and are willing to accept the notion that nuclear power has a place at the table in any discussion about our reduced carbon energy future .
The officially recognized groups and spokesmen for The Movement seem unimpressed and continue to firmly oppose nuclear development .
The remaining arguments end up being cost , waste and nuclear weapons .
Cost is an issue for another day , but the arguments against nuclear power on the matter of waste and relationship to nuclear weapons rest on shaky ground that is beginning to give way .
More and more people , including some in responsible leadership positions , are beginning to realize that the tired arguments originated in the 1970s no longer apply .
They actually never did .
There are about 55,000 tons of used nuclear fuel resting quietly in cooling pools and dry storage containers on the sites where the fuel was initially used .
That may sound like a large amount , but compared to the fact that a single 1000 MWe coal fired power plant can release 45,000 tons of waste to the atmosphere every single day , 55,000 tons of used material after 50 years of nuclear plant operation seems vanishingly small .
You may have noticed that I have carefully avoided calling that slightly used material “ waste ” .
Unlike the gases , ash and soot released to our common atmosphere from coal , oil , gas and biomass fired power plants , the materials left over from nuclear fission reactors are sealed in corrosion resistant cladding and look a lot like they did when they first entered the reactor .
Inside those tubes , the material is still mostly solid uranium dioxide – only about 4 - 5 % of the initial material has been converted into other elements .
Essentially all of the remainders from nuclear plant operation could be recovered and reused ; some of it would best be used as feedstock for future reactors , other parts should be segregated and used in other material applications for long life batteries , catalysts , and irradiation source materials .
Both of the remaining US presidential candidates seem to be open to the idea that used fuel should be recycled and reused .
That is a welcome position since it looks like there will be a number of new reactors under construction soon and they will provide a ready market for the recycled fuel .
There will need to be a bipartisan effort to establish rules that do not change with political winds , however , before private industry will invest in the system .
ALL of the used fuel has been carefully stored away in a form that is easy to control and easy to keep segregated .
It does not take up much space , does not cost much to watch ( compared to the heat value that it provided ) , and it has never hurt anyone because the people that watch it understand the simple concepts of time , distance and shielding .
As a life time procrastinator , I am actually encouraged by the fact that while we continue to debate and pontificate about the pros and cons of long term disposal , the natural process of radioactive decay continues to make the fuel easier and easier to handle .
That process can reduce the cost of recycling , when we finally get around to it .
Perhaps those of us who are advocates of the increased use of nuclear energy as a clean , emissions free source of reliable , low cost power should thank the people who have prevented the used fuel from being too hastily moved or recycled .
Not only do we have a growing volume of seasoned raw materials , but when we finally do get around to building facilities , we can do so using up to date methods and the lessons learned from the first generation facilities in other countries .
The democratic process really does favor the patient .

According to recent statistics , U.S. motorists have responded to record - high prices at the pump by driving less .
Any hope that this cutback will significantly restrain global oil prices is misplaced , however : fundamental factors of supply and demand in the world economy will keep oil costly for years to come .
The hope that a cutback in driving by U.S. motorists will significantly restrain global oil prices is misplaced .
Although U.S. drivers are a major force in the world oil market — they account for around 14 million barrels per day ( mbd ) out of 85 mbd of worldwide demand — the growth in driving in China , India and other developing countries will easily outstrip any cutback in U.S. demand .
Drilling in protected areas would provide little relief , and at horrendous environmental risks .
Only a concerted move to new transport and energy technologies will relieve the pressures .
The greatest irony about the Bush Administration is that it correctly focused on energy needs at the start of its first term , but then got everything wrong in the strategy .
Viewing the world through the eyes of Texas oilmen , it focused on gaining concessions to Iraqi oil fields and opening U.S. protected areas to drilling , while scorning fuel economy standards , renewable energy sources , and climate change mitigation .
But the simple arithmetic of oil and carbon was always against the strategy .
World demand for conventional oil is outstripping world supply .
Crude oil production in the Persian Gulf has been nearly flat at just over 20 mbd since the early 1970s .
The growth in world supply since that time has come from oil fields outside of the Middle East , but many of them have reached their production limits and important ones are in decline .
There are few prospects for mega - discoveries that could keep up with fast - growing world demand .
The 15 billion barrels or so that is supposedly economically accessible in protected U.S. offshore sites would slake around 6 months of global demand ( 32 billion barrels per year , equal to 82 mbd times 365 days per year ) in 2008 , and of course a much smaller share by the time they reached the market in 10 to 15 years .
And these small gains would come at enormous environmental risks , which helps to explain why California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger gave a thumbs down to the proposal for offshore California oil .
The boom in global driving is likely to be relentless .
Today , China has around 50 million cars , trucks and buses ( roughly 40 per 1,000 people ) , compared with around 240 million in the U.S ( roughly 800 per 1,000 people ) .
If China attains just half of the U.S. per capita ownership of passenger vehicles , it would have some 500 million of them , roughly twice as many as the U.S .
And that prospect is not a silly scenario .
Vehicle production in China has already tripled , from fewer than three million vehicles in 2000 to around nine million vehicles in 2007 , which already makes China the world ’s second largest market for vehicle sales , just behind the U.S.
It is likely to overtake the U.S. market in a few years .
Not only does China have a booming economy , putting hundreds of millions of households within the financial reach of a car , but it also has an insatiable demand for cars reminiscent of the U.S.
With around 100 cities of a million people or more ( compared to around 40 in the U.S. ) , and massive house building on the spreading periphery of city centers , China seems intent on reproducing America ’s metropolitan sprawl and commuter - based society .
A similar , though still less dramatic trend , is getting underway in India .
Engineering advances in automobile production will dramatically accelerate the trend .
Low - cost cars such as the Tata Nano , India ’s newly unveiled $ 2,500 compact sedan , will bring auto ownership within reach of hundreds of millions of newly middle - class households worldwide in the coming decades .
There are currently around 650 million cars , trucks and buses worldwide .
China and India alone could add another 25 million vehicles per year in a decade ; they could easily add another 500 million within 30 years .
Conventional oil has little prospect of keeping up with this soaring demand .
What then will give ?
Of course a grave economic crisis — war , global depression , economic collapse of one or more major economies — would cut oil demand the hard way .
There are two much better alternatives .
The first is a redesigned , far more energy - efficient automobile that uses low - carbon - emitting energy carriers such as electricity or hydrogen .
Several variants of plug - in - hybrid and all - battery cars have been promised by major auto producers as early as 2010 , and several demonstration hydrogen fuel - cell cars are also expected around then .
Many oil - using industrial processes as well could be similarly reconfigured to use other energy carriers .
Many unresolved problems of cost , performance and infrastructure face these technologies , of course .
Public funding for technological research , development and demonstration , and for supporting infrastructure , should certainly be deployed to ensure a timely changeover to new energy efficient ( and low - carbon - dioxide emitting ) vehicles .
Any electric or hydrogen option will require large - scale deployment of new low - emission electricity generation , such as solar , wind , nuclear , and coal plants that capture and sequester carbon dioxide .
The second alternative , equally important , is a gradual reconfiguration of city life , to reduce our dependence on automobiles and raise our reliance on walking , cycling and public transport .
We ’ve learned that sprawl is not good for energy dependence , air quality , biodiversity , human health or quality of life , including commuting time .
We ’ve also learned that despite free - market ideological presumptions , urban sprawl is at least as much a function of zoning and the provision of public infrastructure ( for example , roads versus light rail ) as it is of individual lifestyle choices .
The current energy crisis will most likely worsen before it gets better .
It threatens to create a prolonged period of stagflation , increased oil skirmishes and even oil wars , and further marginalization of the poor , who will find themselves priced out of transport and perhaps even out of food if the U.S. keeps up its dangerous policy of converting corn to ethanol fuel .
Yet it could also be the critical spur to action , prompting vital changes in technologies and lifestyles .
It ’s not too late to take the more productive path , but time is running out .
Note :
This article was originally published with the title , " Coping with a Persistent Oil Crisis " .
I mistakenly posted this on the main board earlier ... When the UEFA cup draw was made a few weeks ago , me and a friend changed some of the information on the wikipedia page for Manchester City 's opponents , AC Omonia .
We included this titbit in the " Fans " section - " A small but loyal group of fans are lovingly called " The Zany Ones " - they like to wear hats made from discarded shoes and have a song about a little potato . " .
Today , the Mirror has used part of this in their pre-match buildup .
Hahahahahahahaha !
Click for readabibilityness
Dear David ( and could the mirrornews email please be forwarded to the sport / football editor ) ,
Thank you for your article in today 's Mirror ( 18th September 2008 ) about Omonia Nicosia .
The bit I enjoyed most was the following paragraph -
" Despite City 's raised profile , they must make do with the UEFA Cup this season and Hughes will not tolerate any slip - ups against the Cypriot side , whose fans are known as the ' Zany Ones ' and wear hats made from shoes . " .
Why ?
Well , shortly after the draw was made , a friend and I made a few alterations to the Wikipedia page for Omonia .
The " Zany Ones " , " hats made from discarded shoes " and the " song about a little potato " are , as you may have discovered in Nicosia , completely fabricated .
The clues were there in the rest of the article .
They have a new sponsor - Natasha Kaplinsky - and their former players include Jean Claude Van Damme and Richard Clayderman .
My favourite is in the Board of Directors section ...

Geological evidence found in Ohio and Indiana in recent weeks is strengthening the case to attribute what happened 12,900 years ago in North America -- when the end of the last Ice Age unexpectedly turned into a phase of extinction for animals and humans – to a cataclysmic comet or asteroid explosion over top of Canada .
A comet / asteroid theory advanced by Arizona - based geophysicist Allen West in the past two years says that an object from space exploded just above the earth ’s surface at that time over modern - day Canada , sparking a massive shock wave and heat - generating event that set large parts of the northern hemisphere ablaze , setting the stage for the extinctions .
Now University of Cincinnati Assistant Professor of Anthropology Ken Tankersley , working in conjunction with Allen West and Indiana Geological Society Research Scientist Nelson R. Schaffer , has verified evidence from sites in Ohio and Indiana – including , locally , Hamilton and Clermont counties in Ohio and Brown County in Indiana – that offers the strongest support yet for the exploding comet / asteroid theory .
Samples of diamonds , gold and silver that have been found in the region have been conclusively sourced through X - ray diffractometry in the lab of UC Professor of Geology Warren Huff back to the diamond fields region of Canada .
The only plausible scenario available now for explaining their presence this far south is the kind of cataclysmic explosive event described by West ’s theory .
" We believe this is the strongest evidence yet indicating a comet impact in that time period , " says Tankersley .
Ironically , Tankersley had gone into the field with West believing he might be able to disprove West ’s theory .
advertisement
Tankersley was familiar through years of work in this area with the diamonds , gold and silver deposits , which at one point could be found in such abundance in this region that the Hopewell Indians who lived here about 2,000 years ago engaged in trade in these items .
Prevailing thought said that these deposits , which are found at a soil depth consistent with the time frame of the comet / asteroid event , had been brought south from the Great Lakes region by glaciers .
" My smoking gun to disprove ( West ) was going to be the gold , silver and diamonds , " Tankersley says .
" But what I did n’t know at that point was a conclusion he had reached that he had not yet made public – that the likely point of impact for the comet was n’t just anywhere over Canada , but located over Canada ’s diamond - bearing fields .
Instead of becoming the basis for rejecting his hypothesis , these items became the very best evidence to support it . "
Additional sourcing work is being done at the sites looking for iridium , micro-meteorites and nano - diamonds that bear the markers of the diamond - field region , which also should have been blasted by the impact into this region .
Much of the work is being done in Sheriden Cave in north - central Ohio ’s Wyandot County , a rich repository of material dating back to the Ice Age .

Tankersley first came into contact with West and Schaffer when they were invited guests for interdisciplinary colloquia presented by UC ’s Department of Geology this spring .
West presented on his theory that a large comet or asteroid , believed to be more than a mile in diameter , exploded just above the earth at a time when the last Ice Age appeared to be drawing to a close .
The timing attached to this theory of about 12,900 years ago is consistent with the known disappearances in North America of the wooly mammoth population and the first distinct human society to inhabit the continent , known as the Clovis civilization .
At that time , climatic history suggests the Ice Age should have been drawing to a close , but a rapid change known as the Younger Dryas event , instead ushered in another 1,300 years of glacial conditions .
A cataclysmic explosion consistent with West ’s theory would have the potential to create the kind of atmospheric turmoil necessary to produce such conditions .
" The kind of evidence we are finding does suggest that climate change at the end of the last Ice Age was the result of a catastrophic event , " Tankersley says .
Currently , Tankersley can be seen in a new documentary airing on the National Geographic channel .
The film " Asteroids " is part of that network ’s " Naked Science " series .
The new discoveries made working with West and Schaffer will be incorporated into two more specials that Tankersley is currently involved with – one for the PBS series " Nova " and a second for the History Channel that will be filming Tankersley and his UC students in the field this summer .
Another documentary , this one being produced by the Discovery Channel and the British public television network Channel 4 , will also be following Tankersley and his students later this summer .
As more data continues to be compiled , Tankersley , West and Schaffer will be publishing about this newest twist in the search to explain the history of our planet and its climate .
Climate change is a favorite topic for Tankersley .
" The ultimate importance of this kind of work is showing that we ca n’t control everything , " he says .
" Our planet has been hit by asteroids many times throughout its history , and when that happens , it does produce climate change . "

A private jet that crash - landed almost one year ago in eastern Mexico carrying 3.3 tons of cocaine had previously been used for CIA “ rendition ” flights , a newspaper report said here Thursday , citing documents from the United States and the European Parliament .
The plane was carrying Colombian drugs for the fugitive leader of Mexico ’s Sinaloa cartel , Joaquin “ Chapo ” Guzman , when it crash - landed in the Yucatan peninsula on September 24 , El Universal reported .
The daily said it had obtained documents from the United States and the European Parliament which “ show that that plane flew several times to Guantanamo , Cuba , presumably to transfer terrorism suspects . ”
( Article continues below )
It said the European Parliament was investigating the private Grumman Gulfstream II , registered by the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation , for suspected use in CIA “ rendition ” flights in which prisoners are covertly transferred to a third country or US - run detention centers .
It also said the US Federal Aviation Administration ’s ( FAA ) logbook registered that the plane had traveled between US territory and the US military base in Guantanamo .
It said the FAA registered its last owner as Clyde O’Connor in Pompano Beach , Florida .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Extraordinary rendition has been harshly criticized since it began in the aftermath of the September 11 , 2001 attacks in the United States .

SAN PEDRO , Paraguay ( Reuters ) - Oil - producing Venezuela promised to provide fuel - deficient Paraguay with all the oil it needs , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said on Saturday .

Chavez , who has used his country ’s oil wealth to spread his influence in Latin America , was visiting San Pedro in the poorest area of Paraguay to sign agreements with Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo , who took office on Friday .
“ We ’ve signed the first agreement to supply Paraguay with all the oil it needs , right to the last drop ... for the development of Paraguay ’s people , industry and agriculture , ” Chavez said at a public event .
One of several agreements signed by the two presidents raised the amount of oil Venezuela supplies Paraguay to 25,000 barrels a day from the current level of 18,600 barrels a day .
Paraguay is a big generator of hydro - power but produces no fossil fuels and consumes about 28,000 barrels a day of oil .
Chavez and Lugo , a former Roman Catholic bishop whose election broke with 61 years of one - party rule in Paraguay , did not mention any price agreement for the oil imports .
Lugo has insisted that he is more moderate than Chavez and his socialist allies in Latin America .
But in his first two days in office the Paraguayan leader showed interest in tightening ties with the region ’s leftist .
On Friday evening he and Chavez held a news conference with Ecuador President Rafael Correa , who celebrated the socialist revolution he said they all belonged to .
Chavez , Correa and Bolivian President Evo Morales have turned back the free - market reforms that swept Latin America in the 1990s and have increased state control of their economies .
“ People say , ‘ Do n’t trust Chavez , be careful with Chavez , be careful with Evo . ’
I ’m not scared of Chavez .
I ’m not scared of Evo. I ’m not scared of anybody ...
We are going to be true Paraguayans and have respectful relations with all countries , ” Lugo said on Friday .
And in San Pedro on Saturday Lugo said again that ties with Venezuela did not mean Venezuela was imposing anything on Paraguay .
Chavez has helped his closest allies -- Ecuador and Bolivia -- with energy investments , sent cheap oil to the Caribbean and fertilizer to Nicaragua and made direct purchases of billions of dollars of bonds from Argentina , which has not been able to access international debt markets since a massive default .
Please guys .
No tit for tat on this .
cdoug has an interesting point if you step out side the great ' Mason ' debate here at ATS .
He provided a link to a website that has scans of seemingly ' old ' images of ' Masonic ' handshakes , etc .
He believes vehemently that these sorts of handshakes are ' Masonic ' because of it , and other sources with similar information .
If that information is not about Freemasonry , which Rockpuck vehemently denies on behalf of himself and his brotherhood , what is it about ?
Obviously someone somewhere linked the two for some reason , and the actions of John McCain and that man seemingly support a weird hand grip sequence , out of the norm for everyday citizens and Masons alike .
We have photographic evidence of something strange , and are spending our time with a spitting contest .
I would think if that is indeed not a Masonic , or Freemasonic handshake , and there is ' evidence ' out there otherwise , Rockpuck , and your fellow ATS Masons would be working their darndest to find who that group is that uses this handshake , and how John McCain plays into their hands so to speak .
Then again , if it is a handshake that is ' Masonic ' , I would expect ATS Masons to tacitly deny the hand grips , and then do nothing to expose the group behind the grips .
Perhaps flat out lying in the process ...
Perhaps the initiated here at ATS can explain why Fox News caught this clip , and then the still of the hand grip was used on the Youtube clip .
If it is the handshake of any secret organization , especially one that is not just the Masons , I do not want John McCain to be our president .
I do n't care if it is the secret handshake of enlightened Buddhists .
I am surprised that this thread has not had more dialogue going on .
You would think that John McCain committing an unknown secret handshake with another man at a Town Hall that was supposed to be for independent voters would get more hype at the number one Conspiracy website on the internet .
Not even one of the paid Obama bashers that have been trolling around has chimed in ...
I would think they would have tried to bury this thread by now .

GOVERNMENT BY TRAITORS AND COWARDS
By Andrew C. Wallace
August 29 , 2008
NewsWithViews.com
Elected and appointed officials at all levels of government are Traitors or Cowards who positively refuse to obey the Constitution and laws of the United States of America taking their orders from the large corporations rather than the people .
Government employees who attempt to serve the people are branded as whistleblowers and persecuted .
Government employees who protect the people are framed and jailed when they interfere with the profitable flow of drugs and slave labor .
How many more Millions of innocent Americans have to be sacrificed by murder , killing , rape , robbery , molestation , kidnapping , loss of jobs , savings , pensions , standard of living , freedom , everything of value and even their country ; because of almost total corruption by government and corporate officials ?
What do n’t you understand ?
Treasonous and Cowardly government officials who allow and support these unconstitutional , unlawful and heinous crimes against citizens and this Republic are the most dastardly traitors in history ; which includes , but is not limited to Presidents G. W. Bush , Bill Clinton , and G. H. W. Bush .
Leaders of both political parties and officials in sanctuary cities also support the treason .
Presidential candidates McCain and Obama arrogantly proclaim their intention to continue the treason .
We must impeach the one elected .
Sorry , you may want to continue ignoring the truth , but you ca n’t for long because I promise , it will destroy you .
It is taking time for Americans to learn the unbelievable truth , but now they are learning at an accelerating rate and the anger is palpable .
Mark W. Lowry , a great writer and patriot said , quote .
“ Let our treasonous elected officials Know , JUSTICE WILL BE DONE .
I try to express myself and let people know I am one American that will not go down without a fight .
I will with my God given dying breath use that last movement to spit in the face of the lying treasonous corrupt public officials who are destroying the USA , one of the greatest gifts
God has given the world since he gave his son Jesus Christ to die for our sins . ” unquote .
Kenn d’Oudney , another great writer and patriot said , quote .
“ The undermining of the ideals , the degeneration of the decent way of life , and the fragmentation of the former general cohesion of Western society , are a long - planned and progressively executed mission , controlled by those few who have , and wield , the power behind - the - scenes to achieve their objective .
They supervise corruptible politicians ( of all political complexions ) and the judiciary to implement their agenda .
To stop their malfeasance , their objective requires to be exposed .
They must be brought to justice , for their crimes are legion and the evidence to the wrongdoing , incontrovertible . ” unquote .
Few can express themselves as effectively as Mark Lowry and Kenn d’Oudney , but the feelings of knowledgeable people toward the traitors are universal and identical , mostly expressed in four letter words of contempt and anger .
Are Americans just lazy cowards who will sit on their posteriors while the criminals reduce them to living and dying homeless , hungry and in pain as slaves ?
Are we really so stupid and blind that we will tolerate this treatment .
I think not .
Are we going to allow these traitors to continue using their privately owned , so called Federal Reserve Bank to steal everything we have as a nation and as individuals , by first inflating the economy , stealing everything they could , bailing themselves out with our money , then deflating the economy and stealing our remaining depreciated assets .
This is a repeat of what they did in the great depression .
For your information they have initiated the first step by taking money out of circulation .
Hell , I can guarantee you what is going to happen , when the pain is more generalized and unbearable , the people will rise up in revolt resulting in much death and destruction .
Do n’t you understand that this means the end of everything ?
This is what we are trying to prevent by defeating the traitors with the rule of law before this happens .
We must have the Rule of Law enforced at all levels and branches of government with no exceptions and most especially in the so called justice system where judges routinely make decisions based on their feelings rather than the constitution and laws .
Judges also deprive jurors of required information and their constitutional powers to the detriment of defendants .
The rule of law must be vigorously enforced in accordance with the constitution , without bribes , or favors .
It is imperative that members of the armed forces and law enforcement adhere to the Constitution and Laws of the United States by refusing to obey Unlawful and Unconstitutional orders from traitors who obtained power by Deceit and Fraud to satisfy their Avarice .
If the military and police violate the Constitutional rights of the people by obeying unlawful orders from traitors they will be no different than the Gestapo and SS criminals who were judged at Nurnberg and hung for their crimes .
In the process unlawful actions would cause a revolution .
As a Christian , I respect the Church , but I have nothing but contempt for the Cardinals , Bishops and Ministers who misuse the word of God to justify their self serving criminal actions to protect illegals at the expense of our citizens .
If I was to give these clerics credit for knowing the facts , then their actions would be truly heinous , rather than just self serving and criminal .
Officials who do not enforce all the laws are corrupt enemies of the people because then we have tyranny .
We can only survive without revolution if we lawfully take back our government and then proceed to impeach and prosecute government officials at all levels and branches of government .

We must use experienced combat troops to remove the criminal illegals from sanctuary cities and wherever they are located , using deadly force as required in any war .
It is a war directed by the usurpers in our government .
Officials in government and corporations who protect these criminal illegals should be arrested and tried by military tribunal with their resources used to compensate citizens who were victims of their treason .
This is the only way to protect our people and our Republic .
We have a corrupt media controlled by traitors that would be the envy of Adolph Hitler .
Most Americans do n’t know that their government was hijacked by the power elite , tax free foundations and corporations because these traitors own the mainstream media that absolutely and positively refuses to report any truth not supportive of their treason .
It is the responsibility of every American who knows the truth to visit their politicians , educate them and obtain a firm written pledge from them to serve the people rather than the corporations and corrupt leaders of either political party .
Anyone who knows the truth and fails to act is a Slacker and guilty of a most grievous sin for which they will suffer on this earth , and answer for later , with god and our patriots .
You do not have to be a Christian to know that the Hedonists among us ignored God ’s word by killing 40 to 50 million babies by abortion , who would otherwise have supported them in their old age .
Corporations replaced these murdered children with uneducated illegals and their children who will always be a financial drain on our country and negatively impact Social Security and all benefits .
Experts interviewed on the Lou Dobbs show ( 8 - 21-08 ) stated that our population would increase by 50 % in the next forty years due mostly to legal and illegal immigration .
No other country is facing such a dramatic reduction in standard of living because of population growth .
This growth would require a 50 % increase in required oil , food , housing and other resources .
They also reported that potable water would be in short supply worldwide .
Now let me put this in perspective for you poor clueless victims of the mainstream media .
Oil , food and most things are scarce resources and 50 % more resources are going to be required to support 50 % more people .
Most illegals will not speak our language , dislike us , are uneducated including a high percentage of criminals , and will never support themselves .
I do n’t hate these people , but all immigration must stop and the illegals must be deported quickly using whatever force is required , otherwise you will be living as a slave in a country like Mexico .
Every bit of this was caused by traitors in government taking orders from large corporations for money .
Make no mistake about it ; anyone who now supports legal or illegal immigration is an enemy of the people .
Ending both legal and illegal immigration with swift and forceful comprehensive deportation of illegals must be accomplished because it is essential for our survival .
If we should fail to take back our government with the rule of law before Americans suffer and revolt , the illegals must run for their lives .
Again I am sorry if you ca n’t accept the brutal truth .
I am predicting , not advocating .
Either educate your politicians now with rule of law while you can still save something , or suffer through a bloody civil war and end up in poverty anyway .
Did you know that when the politicians made it unlawful for us to use all of our energy resources that they were deliberately reducing our standard of living , because cheap energy is the key to our prosperity , and that is not their objective .?
Unless we can stop it , the pain of the people will increase to the point of severe Tyranny and pain , resulting in Anarchy , Revolt , Bloodshed , Destruction and a Pyrrhic victory .
While this would be a direct result of Treason and Cowardice by government officials directed by corporations , it could be avoided if people who know the truth would confront their politicians right now , lawfully , politely , and very firmly .
We could clean house .
Many organizations , protestors and writers dedicated to exposing and stopping the destruction of our Republic are performing a great and perilous service for the people of this country .
For if their efforts are perceived to be effective they will be trashed , attacked , or taken out .
If God allows our work to resonate with the people resulting in defeat of the traitors , I could accept retribution by the traitors .
If there is reprisal by the traitors , there will be retaliation by the people .
Millions of people are actively engaged in this fight .
But , to be most effective , our efforts must be focused on informing , motivating , directing and giving tools to the people so they can take action .
Somehow , everyone ’s work must be seen as part of the big picture to be understood by the people .
The War on our people and country is ruthless , broad based , all encompassing and quite complex .
People must learn how they are being screwed in so many ways by criminals in government and corporations .
There is no part of our society , government , or people , et al that has not been affected adversely .
It is therefore imperative that everyone focus on presenting their parts of the fight as part of the whole treason to be understood .

Mistress ' Family Challenges Edwards to Take DNA Test Rielle Hunter reportedly refuses to participate in genetic testing .
Aug. 9 , 2008  --
The family of John Edwards ' former mistress , Rielle Hunter , is challenging the former senator to take a DNA paternity test after his claim that he did not father Hunter 's 6 - months - old child .
In the first reaction from Hunter 's family , her younger sister Melissa told ABC News that Edwards should immediately follow through on his pledge to take a paternity test .
" I would challenge him to do so , " the sister said .
" Somebody must stand up and defend my sister , " she said .
" I wish that those involved would refrain from bad - mouthing my sister . "
Late Saturday evening , The Washington Post reported that Hunter released a statement through her attorney , Robert Gordon , that she would not participate in a genetic test .
Calls to Gordon were not immediately returned .
In his interview with ABC News correspondent Bob Woodruff acknowledging the affair ( STORY | VIDEO ) , Edwards said he knew the child was not his because of " the timing " of the pregnancy and the affair .
" I would welcome participating in a paternity test , " Edwards said .
" I 'm only one side of the test , but I 'm happy to participate in one . "
Hunter left her Santa Barbara , Calif. , home earlier this week in advance of Edwards '
ABC News interview .
She had been hired in 2006 to produce Web documentaries for the Edwards campaign , at a cost of $ 114,000 , even though she had no filmmaking experience .
Edwards said the affair began only after she was hired .
The two had initially met at a New York city hotel bar , according to friends of Hunter .
Her daughter , Frances Quinn , was born in February in Santa Barbara .
Edwards admitted to ABC News he met secretly with Hunter last month at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills , Calif. , for the purpose of " trying to keep this from becoming public . "
As he left the meeting , at 2:30 in the morning , he was confronted by reporters from the National Enquirer .
Edwards told ABC
News he had not told his wife about the meeting in advance .
He said the meeting was not " the only contact " he had with Hunter since 2006 when he said he ended the affair .
" There have been some other telephone contacts , " Edwards told ABC .
Hunter 's sister Melissa said Rielle was being falsely portrayed as a " promiscuous person " and was not involved in " setting up " Edwards at the hotel meeting .
" She is a good and honest person , the sweetest and most caring woman one could ever hope to meet , " the sister said .
" Do you think it 's easy for us to just sit back and let everyone rip her to shreds and not defend her honor ? "

Peter Bowes tries the Aguru Dome , which captures the human form in detail
By Peter Bowes
BBC News , Los Angeles
Hollywood is on the verge of breaking into an entirely new virtual world .
Scientists have developed systems to make digital doubles of actors which are so realistic that audiences will never notice the difference .
Computer - generated visual effects have long since been used by film - makers to create space ships and monsters .
But the latest technology allows them to create models of real people that can be seamlessly morphed into action scenes featuring human actors .
" We 're just at the cusp of being able to create the actors , the heroes and the stars of the film , using computer graphics as well , " says Dr Paul E Debevec , a graphics researcher at the University of Southern California .
' Compelling and convincing '
The process of creating a digital double starts with the actor subject , posing for an extremely high - tech photograph .
The Aguru Dome , a futuristic - looking photo booth , has been developed to scan a person 's face in extraordinary detail .
" It 's the world 's highest resolution face capture system , " says Paul Carroll , an engineer with Aguru Images .
Transforming a photo into a 3D model " It captures not only the shape of your face but the way light interacts with your face from every angle . "
The actor 's head locked in place , lights flashing from 546 directions and 93 computers operating , the device produces one of the most accurate images of any camera system in the world .
The data is then used on a computer to manipulate the image .
Once animated , film - makers can create action sequences featuring the actor , which never actually happened .
" They are completely compelling and convincing , " says Mr Carroll .
For now , the technology is not designed to replace human performers entirely .
It will be used when film - makers need to re-shoot scenes when the actor is no longer available .
The star of the movie may have moved on to another project or changed their physical appearance for a new role .
Actors ' future
The scientists also believe they have developed a way to mimic that special human faculty to express emotion .
" We have the ability right now to bring the emotions off of a performance that somebody just does on video , " says Dr Debevec .
" If necessary a very good animator can actually move the mouth and eyes around to give a great performance as well .
" They are effectively the puppeteer of one of these photo reel digital actors . "
The Aguru Dome has just gone on the market and will be delivered to the first customers next month .
Some Hollywood studios have already tried out the technology although no movies have yet been released featuring the device 's digital doubles .
In the next couple of years we 'll see it really work and we 're all going to be pretty amazed by it
Graphics researcher Dr Paul E Debevec
" This combination of technologies is just at the brink where in the next couple of years we 'll see it really work and we 're all going to be pretty amazed by it , " says Dr Debevec .
Film - makers are also using motion capture technology to make a relatively cheap rough cut of a movie .
Digital versions of unknown actors are created so they can shoot a full - length ' pilot ' .
" You go through the entire script with digital props and car crashes with digital robots , says Tracy McSheery , an engineer with PhaseSpace , a company that specialises in motion capture systems .
" You can show it to test audiences and vet the entire production to make sure that it 's exactly what you want before you spend the million of dollars and months of time and then find out it did n't quite have the look or feel that you were hoping for . "
But will the technology ever become so sophisticated that it puts Hollywood stars out of a job ?
Mickey Mouse was an early artificial creation who became a star " There 's totally the possibility that you can create something that never existed , that becomes a popular star of motion picture , " says Dr Debevec .
" This has been done with Mickey Mouse , to begin with , and Bugs Bunny and all of these animated characters .
The only change now is that they 'll be able to look like real people instead of cartoon characters . "
But cynics argue that digital characters could never replicate the on - screen nuances of a skilled method actor .
" The best , most powerful and most easily - programmed computer in the world is the one between our ears , " agrees Mr Carroll .
" For a while yet , the cheapest way to make movies will be for real people to follow the directions of the director .
Sure , CGI effects are cool and will advance a lot as the years pass , but actors will be with us a long while yet . "
A report by Peter Bowes on Hollywood 's digital doubles can be seen on E24 , broadcast on the BBC News channel on Saturday 23 August at 1045 BST and Sunday 24 August at 1745 BST .

What are these ?
LinkedIn is a good tool .
But it ’s boring .
When was the last time you found something funny in Linked In ?
Yeah .
There are articles talking how to use LinkedIn .
But most of them are equally boring laundry lists of all Linked In can do .
Not something that will be useful to you .
Some just waste your time .
“ Talk to [ people ] on phone ” lists LinkedIn ’s own blog as one of the things you can do using Linked In .
That list has no meaning for a small business .
As a small business owner , my priorities are simple .
Generating revenue is one of the highest priorities I have .
Can Linked
In contribute to that ?
How ?
Using LinkedIn is about how you get in touch with people , and do business with them in various contexts .
Below are some practical ways to help you in your small business .
Account opening and lead generation
If you have list of target customers ( individuals ) , titles or companies , search them .
You can search by industry , current or previous titles , current or previous companies , within a postal code etc .
Get your target list of individuals in this search .
Then figure out the most trusted route to those individuals .
The most trusted route is the connection
to the target through a first degree connection .
You could preferably ask for a referral and you have a leg - in the company .
Finding the decision makers and influencers
When you sell to large corporations , understanding who you are talking to and who the decision maker / influencer will help you strategize your sale .
There ’s no use selling to someone who ca n’t do much .
Using LinkedIn , you can find out who the decision maker is and could have alternative ways to reach them .
You can do it by looking at job titles in an organization .
But very often , that gives you partial and incorrect information .
You can get more accurate and ‘ tacit ’ information by gathering information from others in the company .
Accumulate reputation and make referrals long lasting
Recommendations feature in LinkedIn has an eBay or p2w2 effect on your reputation .
All your contacts can see it and are on for a long time .
It ’s an accumulation of your online reputation .
When you delight a client , ask them for a Linked In recommendation .
Those who visit your profile can see your reputation .
In the offline world , a referral you get can only fetch you a few contracts .
But here , you can make the recommendation long lasting and touch many more than just a few referrals .
Follow your customers and de-risk from personnel changes
With LinkedIn , when your clients shift from one company to another , they move with you because you connect with the person – not the company .
That ’s good for you .
With your contact ’s move , there ’s a known person in the new company that gets your leg into the company ( that ’s assuming you have good terms with the client .
If you have bad reputation , it moves across companies too . )
Using the same strategy to know the ‘ influencers , ’ i.e. making your connection wide within the company so that when your key contact leaves the company , you have others to fallback on .
You de-risk your account from personnel changes .

Shelley Malil Arrested for Stabbing Girlfriend Kendra Beebe
, known for his bit in the Budweiser " What are you doing ?
Wassup " beer commercials was arrested yesterday at an Amtrak train station in San Diego for allegedly stabbing his ex-girlfriend according to Lt.of the San Diego County Sheriff 's Department .
The couple had been in a dating relationship and had recently parted ways .
Malil showed up at his ex girlfriend 's home in San Marcos where an altercation between the couple took place .
Kendra Beebe , 35 , was stabbed 24 times .
Sadly her children were at home at the time of the attack .
Neighbors heard the woman screaming and called police and an ambulance .
The woman was reportedly taken to Palomar Hospital where she was listed in critical condition with multiple stab wounds and cuts to her face .
Malil 's family members worked with police investigators to capture the fleeing actor , who boarded a train and reportedly headed to meet with his lawyer .
He was apprehended and removed from the train at Oceanside depot on Monday evening after agreeing to surrender .
He is being held in the San Mateo Sheriff 's Department jail on a reported $ 2 million bond .
Shelley was most recently seen on the big screen on the movie 40 Year Old Virgin .
UPDATE : Malil was convicted of attempted murder - see photos and video report below :
In recent years , John A. Gotti , once the acting boss of the Gambino crime family , has become something of an elusive bull ’s - eye for federal prosecutors .
In just over a year , Mr. Gotti was prosecuted three times on charges relating to organized crime , but each time the case ended in a mistrial .
Prosecutors decided in October 2006 to drop the case .
But on Tuesday , Mr. Gotti was arrested on federal conspiracy charges , linking him to the killings of three men in New York in the 1980s and ’90s , federal authorities said .
According to an indictment , handed up in Tampa , Fla. , Mr. Gotti , 44 , is accused of conspiracy to commit murder in the killings of George Grosso in 1988 , Louis DiBono in 1990 and Bruce John Gotterup in 1991 .
He has also been accused of possessing and trafficking in more than five grams of cocaine .
If convicted on all charges , Mr. Gotti could face life in prison .
Mr. Gotti was arrested at his home in Oyster Bay , N.Y. , on Tuesday morning and appeared in the United States District Court in Manhattan in the afternoon .
He is to be formally charged in Tampa , where federal prosecutors are handling the case because , authorities said , some of the Gambinos ’ operations are based there .
Around this time of year , I always have to take a break from pumpkin planning and marvel at bird migration .
How do they find their way around the world without Google Maps ?
We 're not really sure , but research has given us evidence that they use an array of navigation techniques ...
1. Migratory reflex and navigational skills appear to be written in the genes .
Captive birds have been observed getting pretty fidgety and changing their sleep patterns right before their natural migration time .
Ethologists — those who study animal behavior — call the birds ' behavior zugunruhe ( " migratory restlessness "  ) .
Captive birds display zugunruhe even if they 're not exposed to natural light or to seasonal temperature changes .
Even with the restlessness , many of these birds will orient themselves in the direction that they would normally be traveling at that time of year .
Researchers say that the fact that the birds know both when and where to migrate without environmental clues suggests that genes , and a biological calendar written into them , play a role in migration .
2. Genes are all well and good to get them started , but how do birds navigate once they get up in the air ?
The prevailing theory is that the earth 's magnetic field plays a large part .
Over the last few years , scientists have discovered tiny bits of magnetite ( a magnetic mineral ) in the brains of several animal species , including birds , bats , whales and dolphins .
The magnetite could enable the animals to use the earth 's magnetic fields as a migration guide , but the research is just scratching the surface .
Now that we know that birds and other animals could detect magnetic fields and have explored the mechanisms by which they could do it , further research will need to tackle the question of how the animals gather information from the magnetic field , process it and use it to navigate .
3 . A particularly cool study showed that migratory birds also use " celestial navigation "  to find their way around in the dark .
Captive birds placed in a planetarium changed their directional orientation when the star pattern on the ceiling shifted and became confused when the images of stars were dimmed .
The scientists conducting the experiment suggest that birds use the layout of constellations in the sky as a compass .
But why migrate in the first place ?
And why do birds bother flying back north once they 've reached a warmer locale ?
The same reason I have to pull myself away from writing and go to the bodega on the corner : the search for food .
While birds might be hard - wired to migrate at certain times of the year , a recent study concluded birds wo n't make the trip without certain physiological and environmental cues , the most important being the scarcity of food .
Birds fly south in the winter in search of alternate food sources , and even though their summer home might be nicer , they return home in the spring when their usual food stocks are replenished .
If there 's still food to be had at either place , though , some birds will delay migration or wo n't bother leaving at all , choosing instead to band together in flocks to forage .

Here ’s another great piece by one of our newest and most favorite Mudflatters , Alaska Representative Les Gara .
He ’s not only a great legislator , with a real insider ’s perspective on the surreal world of the Alaska Legislature , but he ’s a pretty entertaining read .
Enjoy !
Since Monday the McCain camp has stepped up its personal attacks against Alaskans .
They ’ve continued their D.C. - style tactics against neighbors in this small state .
The game plan is to find an excuse to stop our Legislature ’s Troopergate investigation , and hide evidence McCain ’s folks really do n’t want to surface before November ’s election .
It ’s been a little Karl Rove , and parts Laurel and Hardy .
How else can you explain the following ?
Last week the Attorney general ’s office promised state witnesses would comply with subpoenas the Legislature issued last week .
Tuesday the Governor ’s Attorney General flip flopped , and announced that state witnesses would n’t comply because , well , and I ’m paraphrasing here – he ’s changed his mind .
And in what has to be an idea hatched after a 4th Martini at Chilkoot Charlie ’s , Governor Palin ’s attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the ethics claim she filed against herself two weeks ago .
Yup .
She really filed a complaint against herself .
Tuesday she said she ’s discovered , after a thorough investigation of herself , that she ’s done nothing wrong .
Does anyone know how to get a hold of Jon Stewart and Tina Fey ?
It ’s silly season up here in the far north , but this week ’s moves are aimed at one thing : John McCain ’s effort to find cover for being disingenuous .
See , before Governor Palin ’s nomination for the Republican VP spot , she did the honest thing .
She admitted the evidence – of roughly 20 contacts between her staff and husband with Public Safety officials , seeking the firing of Governor Palin ’s former brother - in - law – might lead a reasonable person to the conclusion that the she misused her office to fire a state employee .
So when Alaska ‘s Republican - led Legislature called for an investigation , she did the honorable thing and said she and her staff would comply .
She denies any wrongdoing .
Things changed on August 29 when Governor Palin was added to the McCain ticket .
Since then his handlers have told her she can’t testify .
They do n’t want the evidence in this case to come out .
They do n’t want her to testify under oath .
They do n’t want other witnesses to testify under oath .
So they have engaged in daily maneuvers to attack , as disloyal to the McCain campaign , anyone who wants the investigation to move forward .
They ’ve now attacked two well respected prosecutors , and perhaps the state ’s most highly regarded law enforcement official – the Public Safety Commissioner she hired , and then fired , Walt Monegan .
Every day this week McCain operatives have sung the same tune .
Today a guy with an East Coast accent , who knows nothing about Alaska , stood in front of a McCain - Palin banner to lead the attacks against people he does n’t know .
At press conferences on Monday and Tuesday campaign staffer Megan Stapleton spit vitriol to repeat her argument that this investigation is really a “ Democratic ” attack on Governor Palin .
See , that ’s easier than just saying their VP has reneged on her promise to testify .
It ’s easier than just saying they do n’t want anyone testifying before the November election .
It ’s easier than admitting they are stonewalling a legislative investigation .
Here are a few things they failed to say .
There are a few small facts that make it hard to style this as a Democratic investigation .
One is that Alaska is a Republican State .
We have a Republican Governor and a Legislature of 34 Republicans and 26 Democrats .
This summer the Legislature ’s Legislative Council voted 12 - 0 ( 8 Republicans and 4 Democrats ) to hire an investigator , and appointed Democratic Senator Hollis French , a well - respected former prosecutor , to find an investigator .
Governor Palin stated she and her employees would comply with the investigation .
French then hired Steve Branchflower , a former DA who most recently was hired by legislative Republicans to run the state ’s Office of Victims rights .
And on Friday the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 3 - 2 ( 2 Democrats and 1 Republican in favor ) ; and the House Judiciary Committee issued a 7 – 0 ( 5 Republicans , 2 Democrats ) advisory vote , to issue subpoenas to witnesses the McCain camp had previously stopped from testifying .
Over the last two days McCain ’s outside operatives have vilified former prosecutor Hollis French – as an Obama supporter who must have called this investigation to hurt the McCain ticket .
But French was appointed to oversee the investigation by a 12 – 0 Legislative Council vote , and is probably the state ’s most respected legislator – by Republicans and Democrats alike .
He ’s so popular the Republican Party could n’t find anyone to run against him this year .
They ’ve called former Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan – a Native Alaskan who has served Republican and Democratic Administrations with honor , and put his life on the line in uniform – “ insubordinate . ”
Odd , given that when Governor Palin fired him she offered him a different job .
I guess being “ insubordinate ” was a job requirement for the new position .
And they ’ve challenged the independence of an investigator and former DA , who has no animus anyone can find .
Those Swift boat ads taught the McCain folks that if you say something untrue enough times , it can stick .
My favorite moment of the week came when Governor Palin ’s attorneys filed a motion to dismiss Palin ’s ethics complaint against herself .
Stay with me .
Her attorneys have been buying the peyote , not me .
See , on August 29 they needed to find a way to stop the Legislature ’s investigation .
They tried asking the Republican leaders to call it off , and take one for the team .
But the Senate President and others honorably said no .
So they came up with an argument that the State Personnel Board – 3 people appointed by Governor Palin and her Republican predecessor Frank Murkowski – had “ exclusive jurisdiction ” to investigate wrongdoing by the Governor .
The Legislature was n’t amused .
So Governor Palin then filed a complaint against herself .
That , they said , put “ jurisdiction ” in the hands of their friends at the Personnel Board .
They argued that since the Personnel Board was now proceeding with an “ investigation ” , the Legislature could n’t .
To put icing on the cake , on Monday the Governor ’s attorneys moved to dismiss the Governor ’s case against herself .
They said , and I loosely paraphrase again – that they tried really hard and just could n’t find any evidence that the Governor did anything wrong .
OK .
I ca n’t believe I just wrote that .
And I wish it were n’t true .
These are the things you have to do when your Presidential candidate does n’t want his VP to honor a promise , and does n’t want evidence to come out before an election .
These are the things you have to do if your folks are n’t going to comply with a subpoena .
That ’s because without spin the headline might read : “ McCain Interferes With Investigation Palin Agreed To . ”
How easy it is to re-write a headline .
They learned that during the Swift boat campaign too .
All we can hope for is that members of the press will remember what they learned in journalism school .
Not to repeat the spin of political operatives without reporting the truth .
Not to write “ he said she said ” stories , and pretend the truth is somewhere in the middle .
But to report the facts .
No matter how you spin it , Governor Palin promised to comply with this Legislative Investigation .
McCain ’s folks got her to change her position .
And the Legislature that voted for the investigation did so on a bi-partisan basis .
End of story .
End of headline .
Over the next few days McCain ’s folks will try to get local legislators to step in line , out of party loyalty , and reverse their vote to investigate Troopergate .
But many local Republicans , like Senate President Lyda Green , have so far refused to play those politics .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- U.S. government employees received improper gifts from energy industry representatives , and engaged with them in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations , according to a report issued Wednesday .
A report says government officials accepted gifts from oil and gas company employees .
The report was issued by the Interior Department 's inspector general after a $ 5.3 million investigation " uncovered recreational marijuana and cocaine use " by " a handful " of Interior Department staff , and found two federal employees " engaged in brief sexual relationships with representatives from companies doing business " with the department .
Two Interior Department employees " received combined gifts and gratuities on at least 135 occasions from four major oil and gas companies with whom they were doing business -- a textbook example of improperly receiving gifts from prohibited sources , " Inspector General Earl Devaney says in a letter to Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne accompanying the report .
Randall Luthi , head of the Minerals Management Service at the Interior Department , said the public had not suffered financial losses as a result of the employees ' behavior .
Some of the government employees tried to hide their close association with the industry they were supposed to be regulating , the report says .
The investigation turned up e-mails in which MMS employees " preparing to attend industry events used such language as ' this trip is to be kept quiet , ' or were asked to RSVP ' in private ' by their supervisor , " the report says .
" When we asked one of these employees why they needed to avoid discussing their social activities with industry , he responded with a slight chuckle , ' They might have , you know , contacted the [ inspector general ] , ' " the report says .
The investigation appears to have been prompted by an internal whistle - blower 's report in 2006 , and concerns activity from 2002 to 2006 by the department responsible for selling the oil and gas the government collects as rent from companies drilling on federal lands .
The report alleges inappropriate behavior by 19 members of the Royalty in Kind program -- about one - third of the department .
Some have since left the department , making it unclear what kind of disciplinary action they could be subject to .
The Department of Justice declined to prosecute two former employees named in the report , the inspector general said , without saying why .
Another pleaded guilty to a criminal charge .
Department of Justice spokeswoman Laura Sweeney said the department did receive " one or more referrals related to matters referenced in the Department of Interior inspector general reports , " but she declined to comment further .
MMS head Luthi said only " six or seven " employees named in the report still work for the department .
He vowed appropriate action by the time he leaves office in January .
Democrats used the report to accuse President Bush 's administration of being too close to the oil industry .
" The Bush administration put an ' America for Sale ' sign on the White House lawn from day one and has been courting Big Oil ever since , " Rep. Louise Slaughter , D - New York and chairwoman of the House Rules Committee , said in a written statement .
" Democrats have been saying it for some time , but this proves it .
This administration is literally in bed with Big Oil .
Little did we know they were such a cheap date . "
Sen . Bill Nelson , a Florida Democrat , said the report should make Congress reconsider plans to expand offshore drilling .
" The rest of the United States government does n't need to jump in bed with " the oil industry , he said .
" Offshore drilling will not solve our energy crisis nor will it bring down prices at the pump , " Nelson said .
" Instead , it will enrich the oil companies and reward the culture of corruption that has been fostered , funded and now exposed by the inspector general . "
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - California , said in a statement :
" This report documents the ' pervasive culture of exclusivity ' that has cheated the American taxpayer out of the billions of dollars owed them by the oil companies , " Pelosi said .
Sen . Dianne Feinstein , D - California , called the allegations in the report " unacceptable . "
House Minority Leader John Boehner , a Republican from Ohio and an advocate of easing drilling rules , said that in 2006 , " our members on the Government Reform Committee were investigating this problem in the department . "
" Our members of the last two years ... have been pushing [ current ] Chairman [ Rep. Henry ]
Waxman to continue this investigation and to have hearings and he 's refused to do it , " Boehner said .
Waxman is a Democrat from California .
Two oil companies mentioned in the report , Shell and Chevron , declined to comment , saying they still needed to review it .
A third , Hess , said in a statement : " We do not believe we are the focus of the investigation and we will cooperate with any further requests from the inspector general 's office that may arise . "
CNN 's Karina Frayter and Carol Cratty contributed to this report .
All About U.S. Department of the Interior • Oil Production and Refining
Maybe modern day books like " One for the Road " can be called travel journals , but I 'm not sure .
Something has changed .
The age of the classical travel journal seems to have passed .
Marco Polo had an easy job amazing his temporary Europeans with tales from the Far East .
He mentions a place " so far to the North that the Polar star shines from the south " , and he talks about a forest inhabited by myriads of unicorns .
To us these claims are clearly just lies .
Back in his time , however , although many doubted him , no one could prove him wrong .
Likewise , few questioned the " slightly biased " reports given by early jungle - bound Europeans who wrote home about the pure , godless evils of cannibals and head - hunters hiding deep in the green wilderness .
Even our own grandparents willingly brag about the dangerous odysseys they went through just to get to school .
Oh , the beauty of accounts that cannot be verified !
Today , however , a trip to remote regions is no longer just for reckless people who are willing to risk their lives to experience something different .
Pretty much anyone with four weeks to spend can find out for themselves what life is like at the Mount Everest Base Camp .
On any given day in January there are almost as many American and European retirees on the beaches of Antarctica as there are penguins .
Even Outer
Space receives its share of flabby , filthy rich tourists these days .
Hence , a travel journal today must do something more than to astound , to glorify and to mystify .
Instead the writing must be both informative and entertaining , and it must just as much take the reader on a journey through the author 's mind as through the locations he or she visits .
If it leads to a more wide - spread understanding of the world still being a diverse and place full of problems that needs to be solved , that 's excellent .
To achieve this understanding , the author must travel at a slow pace , much like the way young and well - off Europeans did when they sought out formative travel experiences a century or two ago .
Their mission was to familiarize themselves with the foundations of their culture , and they did this by going to historical places around the Mediterranean Sea .
The difference between then and now is that we can and must do better .
It is no longer enough to visit the places that shaped our civilization , to where the old Egyptians , Babylonians , Greeks , French , and British performed their art and fought their wars .
To see , describe and realize what we could have become , if history had played out differently , that is the challenge for modern day travel writers .
I put forward that travel writing has turned into a branch of philosophy , or at least that modern day travel book authors should try to dig deeper into what he or she sees than what has typically been the case until now .
My travels have gradually become a way to create some distance to my life at home .
It 's a space that lets me compare my everyday concerns with real problems , problems on a scale rarely seen in my own country .
It 's a wake - up call to see a boy on a skateboard not because he thinks it 's great fun , but because he lost his feet when he stepped on a land mine , and there just is no wheelchair for him .
You learn something from going to a shop where loudspeakers are installed not to play sales - inducing muzak , but because they need to be able to inform customers that the price of bread has risen again , for the third time that day .
It is scary to visit a region where 35 percent is not the share of the population who can't be bothered to vote , but how many of those between 14 and 30 years of age who are infected by HIV .
In surroundings like that , you may discover that your worries are not really problems at all .
To those of us who live in one of the sweet spots of planet Earth , it 's all too easy to think that it 's other people 's faults and our own merits that have made some places good and other places not so good .
After having traveled a bit , I think the most important lesson I 've learnt is this :
Nothing in the world is fair , and just because some of us have won the lottery , it does n't mean we can allow ourselves to ignore all the problems we do n't encounter at home .
Although I certainly prefer a cheery tone and funny observations to tales of doom and gloom , I hope that travel writers now and in the future will point out this unfairness of the world to their readers .
The world is becoming a smaller village every day , and we need to understand what goes on around the increasingly closer corner .
Both travel writing and journeys we make on our own can and should help us improve this understanding .
University of Utah physicist Brian Saam examines tubes of invisible xenon gas that he used to explore the relationship between chaos theory and modern quantum physics .
Photo : Eric Sorte
( PhysOrg.com ) -- A University of Utah study is shedding light on an important , unsolved physics problem : the relationship between chaos theory - which is based on 300 - year - old Newtonian physics - and the modern theory of quantum mechanics .
The study demonstrated a fundamental new property - what appears to be chaotic behavior in a quantum system - in the magnetic " spins " within the nuclei or centers of atoms of frozen xenon , which normally is a gas and has been tested for making medical images of lungs .
The new study - published in the Aug. 8 issue of the journal Physical Review Letters - was led by Brian Saam , an associate professor of physics and associate dean of the University of Utah 's College of Science .
Quantum mechanics - which describes the behavior of molecules , atoms electrons and other subatomic particles - " plays a key role in understanding how electronics work , how all sorts of interesting materials behave , how light behaves during communication by optical fibers , " Saam says .
" When you look at all the technology governed by quantum physics , it 's not unreasonable to assume that if one can apply chaos theory in a meaningful way to quantum systems , that will provide new insights , new technology , new solutions to problems not yet known . "
A Chaotic Dance of Nuclear Spins
Just as atomic nuclei and their orbiting electrons can have electrical charges , they also have another property known as " spin . "
The spin within an atomic nucleus or electron is like a spinning bar magnet that points either up or down .
Saam and graduate student Steven Morgan zapped xenon atoms with a strong magnetic field , laser beam and radio - wave pulse so the nuclear spins were aligned in four different configurations in four samples of frozen xenon , each containing about 100 billion billion atoms [ billion twice is correct ] .
Despite differing initial configurations , the " dances " of the xenon spins evolved so they eventually were in sync with each other , as measured by nuclear magnetic resonance , or NMR .
That took a few thousandths of a second - something physicists seriously call " long - time behavior . "
" This type of common behavior has been a signature of classically chaotic ( Newtonian ) systems , mostly studied using a computer , but it never had been observed in an experimental system that only can be described by quantum mechanics , " Saam says .
As an analogy , imagine billions of people in a huge , unfamiliar city .
They start walking around in different places and directions , with little conversation among them .
Yet , eventually , they all end up walking in the same direction .
Such behavior in nuclear spins had been predicted in 2005 by the study 's third author , physicist Boris Fine of the University of Heidelberg in Germany .
Fine had made the prediction by adapting chaos theory to quantum theory .
Order from Chaos
The evolution of disorder into order by the xenon atoms ' nuclear spins is a signature of chaos theory , which , contrary to the popular notion , does not imply complete disorder .
Instead , chaos theory describes how weather , certain chemical reactions , planetary orbits , subatomic particles and other dynamic systems change over time , with the changes often highly sensitive to starting conditions .
" When you have a [ chaotic ] system that is characterized by extreme randomness , it paradoxically can produce ordered behavior after a certain amount of time , " says Saam .
" There is strong evidence that is happening here in our experiment . "
The sensitivity to starting conditions is known popularly as " the butterfly effect , " based on the fanciful example that a butterfly flapping its wings in South America might set off subtle atmospheric changes that eventually build into a tornado in Texas .
Saam says chaos theory can make predictions about extremely complex motions of many particles that are interacting with each other .
The mathematical notion of chaos first was described in the 1890s .
Chaos theory was developed in the 1960s , based on classical physics developed in the late 1600s by Sir Isaac Newton .
Classical physics says the motion , speed and location of any particle at any time can be determined precisely .
In contrast , quantum mechanics holds that " when things get atom small , our notions of being able to put a specific particle in a specific place with a specific speed at a specific time become blurry , " Saam says .
So a particle 's speed and location is a matter of probability , and " the probability is the reality . "
Details of the Study : ‘ These Guys are Dancing Together '
Technically , spin is the intrinsic angular momentum of a particle - a concept so difficult to explain in lay terms that physicists usually use the bar magnet analogy .
A nonmagnetic material normally has random spins in the nuclei of its atoms - half the spins are up and half are down , so the net spin is zero .
But magnetic fields can be applied so that the spins are aligned - with more up than down , or vice versa .
Physicists can measure the alignment or " polarization " of the spins using NMR 's strong magnetic field .
Nuclear spins also are used medically :
When a patient lies within a magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) device 's large magnet , the spins within atoms in the body generate electrical signals that are used to make images of body tissues .
Doctors are testing xenon as a way to enhance MRI images of the lungs .
Saam and colleagues used xenon because its spins can be aligned relatively easily .
In each experiment , Saam and Morgan used a magnetic field and a laser to align or " hyperpolarize " the spins in a sample of about 100 billion billion xenon gas atoms so a majority of the spins either were aligned " up " or " down . "
Then , they froze the gas into a solid at a temperature of 321 degrees below zero Fahrenheit .
Then they applied a radio wave pulse , which " flips " the spins so they all are perpendicular to the magnetic field instead of parallel to it .
That makes them start circling around the magnetic field axis like spinning tops .
In this manner , the physicists created four frozen xenon samples .
Within each sample , the spins were aligned , but different radio pulses were used to make the initial alignment or configuration of the spins different from one sample to the next .
The scientists then used NMR to watch the spins decay or fade over thousandths of a second .
" Although they are held in place in the crystal structure , the spins can interact with each other and change the direction in which they 're pointed in much the same way that magnets interact with each other when brought close together , " Saam says .
The initial configuration of spins in each xenon sample evolved in extremely complicated ways due to the presence of billions of interacting spins , and each sample rapidly " lost its memory " of where it started .
Such behavior has been known for 60 years .
The surprise was that while each sample 's initial NMR signal was radically different from the other , they displayed " identical long - time behavior , " says Saam .
" Somehow despite the fact these spins have very complicated interactions with each other and started out in completely different orientations , they end up all moving in the same way after several milliseconds , " he says .
" That 's never been seen before in a quantum mechanical system .
These guys are dancing together . "
Saam says the technical achievement was that the huge amount of polarization made it possible for NMR to measure an extremely weak spin signal - only one - thousandth as strong as the original signal by the time the samples appeared to behave chaotically .

From cyborg housemaids and waterpowered cars to dog translators and rocket boots , Japanese boffins have racked up plenty of near - misses in the quest to turn science fiction into reality .
Now the finest scientific minds of Japan are devoting themselves to cracking the greatest sci- fi vision of all : the space elevator .
Man has so far conquered space by painfully and inefficiently blasting himself out of the atmosphere but the 21st century should bring a more leisurely ride to the final frontier .
For chemists , physicists , material scientists , astronauts and dreamers across the globe , the space elevator represents the most tantalising of concepts : cables stronger and lighter than any fibre yet woven , tethered to the ground and disappearing beyond the atmosphere to a satellite docking station in geosynchronous orbit above Earth .
Up and down the 22,000 mile - long ( 36,000 km ) cables — or flat ribbons — will run the elevator carriages , themselves requiring huge breakthroughs in engineering to which the biggest Japanese companies and universities have turned their collective attention .
In the carriages , the scientists behind the idea told The Times , could be any number of cargoes .
A space elevator could carry people , huge solar - powered generators or even casks of radioactive waste .
The point is that breaking free of Earth 's gravity will no longer require so much energy — perhaps 100 times less than launching the space shuttle .
“ Just like travelling abroad , anyone will be able to ride the elevator into space , ” Shuichi Ono , chairman of the Japan Space Elevator Association , said .
The vision has inspired scientists around the world and government organisations including Nasa .
Several competing space elevator projects are gathering pace as various groups vie to build practical carriages , tethers and the hundreds of other parts required to carry out the plan .
There are prizes offered by space elevator - related scientific organisations for breakthroughs and competitions for the best and fastest design of carriage .
First envisioned by the celebrated master of science fiction , Arthur C. Clarke , in his 1979 work The Fountains of Paradise , the concept has all the best qualities of great science fiction : it is bold , it is a leap of imagination and it would change life as we know it .
Unlike the warp drives in Star Trek , or H.G. Wells 's The Time Machine , the idea of the space elevator does not mess with the laws of science ; it just presents a series of very , very complex engineering problems .
Japan is increasingly confident that its sprawling academic and industrial base can solve those issues , and has even put the astonishingly low price tag of a trillion yen ( £ 5 billion ) on building the elevator .
Japan is renowned as a global leader in the precision engineering and high - quality material production without which the idea could never be possible .
The biggest obstacle lies in the cables .
To extend the elevator to a stationary satellite from the Earth 's surface would require twice that length of cable to reach a counterweight , ensuring that the cable maintains its tension .
The cable must be exceptionally light , staggeringly strong and able to withstand all projectiles thrown at it inside and outside the atmosphere .
The answer , according to the groups working on designs , will lie in carbon nanotubes - microscopic particles that can be formed into fibres and whose mass production is now a focus of Japan 's big textile companies .
According to Yoshio Aoki , a professor of precision machinery engineering at Nihon University and a director of the Japan Space Elevator Association , the cable would need to be about four times stronger than what is currently the strongest carbon nanotube fibre , or about 180 times stronger than steel .
Pioneering work on carbon nanotubes in Cambridge has produced a strength improvement of about 100 times over the last five years .
Equally , there is the issue of powering the carriages as they climb into space .

The boy was living with an aunt ; when she tried calling a statewide human services hotline " she got no useful information , " the newspaper said .
Separately , officials with Nebraska 's child welfare division told the aunt the state could n't intervene unless the boy committed a crime .
-- A 15 - year - old boy who would punch holes in the wall at home and throw things in school .
His father is described in court records as " psychotic and a drug user who had been convicted of misdemeanor child abuse , " the World - Herald reports .
The newspaper reports today that families sought help for these violent or out - of - control kids , unsuccessfully .
Several teenagers and pre-teens left by families at Nebraska hospitals over the past several weeks are mentally ill or have severe behavioral problems , according to the Omaha World - Herald .
-- A 13 - year - old girl who'd been diagnosed with bipolar disorder , fetal alcohol syndrome , and severe behavioral problems .
She was prone to fly into rages and and had been living at Boys Town until her great aunt removed her at the beginning of the summer , concerned that the girl was being medicated too heavily .
After the girl smeared her menstrual blood on the walls of her house , the " aunt called agencies for help but said she could not find a program , " the World - Herald reports .
When the girl tried to jump out of a moving car , her great aunt took her to a hospital and asked for help .
" I can't do nothing for her anymore .
It 's too dangerous , " she told the Omaha newspaper .
-- A 15 - year - old boy who'd been diagnosed with depression and using drugs .
Over the summer , the boy had been found carrying marijuana and had run away from home before entering a diversion program .
When police brought him back , he reportedly began to express suicidical intentions .
His uncle , the boy 's guardian , took him to an Omaha hospital for a psychiatric evaluation , but the hospital refused to admit the teeanger when he said he was n't suicidal .
" Fearing for his life , that 's when I made the decision that I made , " said the uncle , who then turned the teenager in under Nebraska 's new " safe haven " law , according to the World - Herald .
-- An 11 - year - old boy who'd threatened to kill his mother and siblings .
The World - Herald reports that the mom arranged for the boy to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital but that he refused to take his medications .
" She has exhausted all of her options , " according to a police report cited by the World - Herald .
Under Nebraska 's new " safe haven " law -- the last in the nation -- seven teens have been dropped off at hospitals over the past several weeks by parents or guardians .
The Nebraska law is the only in the U.S. that does n't set an age limit on children who can be handed over to authorities , no questions asked .
In Nebraska , the debate now centers around the adequacy of services for families with troubled kids .
A lack of resources prevents families from receiving needed help , advocates claim in another story published by the Omaha World - Herald today .
" There 's not enough places to turn , " said Eve Bleyhl , executive director of the Nebraska Family Support Network , quoted in the paper .
Nebraska human services officials dispute that allegation .
According to the World - Herald , the director of the state 's department of health and human services said a review of cases " had not turned up problems with the state 's system for responding to families in crisis . "
The case that 's received the most attention involves a father who deposited 9 of his 10 children , ages 1 to 17 , at an Omaha hospital .
It 's not clear from news reports if any of the children were seriously disturbed .
This is an issue that is resonating with people across the country .
Many of you responded to my Friday post , and it appears many of you think the dad who relinquished responsibility for his nine kids did the right thing , especially if the alternative was abuse and neglect .
Unfortunately , we still do n't know a lot about what happened in this particular case .
Did the father call family members and ask for their support ?
Did he call service agencies and admit that he needed help ?
Did the children have any advance warning ?
Or were they caught by surprise , faced with losing their home and their sole remaining parent after their mother died suddenly a year and a half before ?
Nebraska lawmakers will now consider whether the state 's new law needs to be changed to narrow its scope to babies and infants , the World - Herald reports .
I offended some readers by remarking Friday that the moral of this story is that " safe haven " laws need to be written carefully .
I continue to think that 's the case , especially when older children are involved .
But clearly this story raises other complicated issues .
In particular , are we doing enough to help families with severely disturbed kids , not only in Nebraska but in other states as well ?
( CNN ) -- Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones , the first black woman to represent Ohio in the U.S. House of Representatives , died Wednesday after suffering brain hemorrhaging caused by an aneurysm , medical officials said .
Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones , D - Ohio , suffered an aneurysm Tuesday evening .
Tubbs Jones , a 58 - year - old Democrat in her fifth term representing parts of Cleveland and its suburbs , suffered the aneurysm Tuesday evening while driving in Cleveland Heights , Ohio , her staff said .
She was rushed to East Cleveland 's Huron Hospital , where a team of doctors determined Wednesday morning that she had " very limited brain function , " said Dr. Gus Kious , the hospital 's chief of staff .
Wednesday afternoon , before Tubbs Jones died , Kious said that the aneurysm was in " an inaccessible part of her brain " and that she was in critical condition .
She died at 6:12 p.m. ET
Wednesday after her condition declined " throughout the course of the day and into this evening , " according to a joint statement from her family , Huron Hospital and the Cleveland Clinic .
The congresswoman had a full day of activity Tuesday , according to a statement from her office , including planning for a September 4 forum on electoral reform at Cleveland State University .
President Bush said Tubbs Jones " was an effective legislator who was dedicated to helping small businesses , improving local schools , expanding job opportunities for Ohioans and ensuring that more of them have access to health care .

" After making history as the first African - American woman elected to Congress from Ohio , the congresswoman worked to expand the rights of all Americans , " Bush said .
Tubbs Jones built a reputation in Congress for speaking out .
In 2003 , she was the only Ohioan in Congress to vote against a resolution supporting U.S. troops in Iraq .
Read reaction from the political community »
She said she voted " no " because the resolution connected Iraq to the September 11 terrorist attacks and declared that Iraq poses a continued threat to the United States .
She said that neither of those claims had been proved .
" Our veterans deserve better than lip service , " she said .
She stepped up her national political role in 2004 , assisting the presidential campaign of Sen.
John Kerry , especially in battleground states .
She also helped shape her party 's platform , traveling the country as a co-chair of the Democratic National Committee .
In early January 2005 , Tubbs Jones led an unsuccessful fight against certifying Ohio's tally in the 2004 presidential election , citing voting irregularities .
Lawmakers voted down the challenge , allowing President Bush to carry the state by about 70,000 votes and sealing his 286-251 victory in the Electoral College .
Tubbs Jones was one of the most ardent supporters of Sen. Hillary Clinton 's 2008 run for the White House .
After Clinton bowed out of the race in June , she endorsed Sen. Barack Obama , now the presumptive Democratic nominee .
Tubbs Jones , a superdelegate , had been scheduled to attend the Democratic National Convention next week in Denver , Colorado .
" She was not only a professional , but she could reach into your soul and shake it , " said Rep. Joe Sestak , D - Pennsylvania , who said he met Tubbs Jones at a Clinton rally .
" Hillary Clinton was lucky to have a supporter like her . "
Clinton , in a statement with her husband , former President Clinton , and their daughter , Chelsea , said Tubbs Jones ' friendship " meant the world to us . "

" We could always count on her to be a shoulder on which to lean , an ear to bend , a voice to reassure , " the Clintons said .
" Over the course of many years , with many ups and many downs , Stephanie was right by our side -- unwavering , indefatigable .
" It was that fighting spirit -- safely stowed behind her disarming smile , backed by so much integrity and fiery intelligence -- that allowed Stephanie to rise from modest beginnings , to succeed in public service , to become a one - woman force for progress in our country . "
Born in Cleveland , Tubbs Jones started public life as a municipal judge in 1981 .
She also had been a trial court judge and , for the seven years before her election to Congress , a county prosecutor .
Her husband , Mervyn , died in October 2003 of a heart attack .
The couple had one son .
Tubbs Jones would have turned 59 on September 10 .

Steve Rudnitsky Wyndham Hotel Chief Steps Down
( Steven Rudnitsky is on the Right )
Many of you may be thinking , who isBack in the late 90's he got his 15 minutes of fame by dating former Today Show hostwhen in reality he is much more than that .
This time Steven is in the press because he is stepping down from his post as the Wyndham Hotel Group chief executive , to pursue other interests in his life .
With his hefty severance package of $ 2.2 million he should n't find it too difficult to live footloose and fancy free .
In a statement made by Wyndham exec .
Stephen Holmes , it sounds like whoever they hire to take over the position has some pretty big shoes to fill .
" Steve 's leadership transformed our lodging business from a pure domestic franchise company into a major global franchise and management company through the acquisition of world - class brands , acceleration of international hotel development and the strengthening of our core domestic operations . "
Let 's get back to the Katie Couric part of Steven .
I am not sure why I remember this short lived relationship because I can't even remember last week .
At the time , Rudnitsky was an executive for Nabisco and went on one public date with Couric , and the next thing to come was The National Enquirer pretty much having them married off .
Steven 's last day working for Wyndham is tomorrow - Sept 30th .
Steven , if you are reading this , your old friends at Pillsbury asked me to give you this message .
Since you will now have some free time on your hands , they would love to have you join them at Champs in Minnetonka , MN on October 3rd for ' happy hour ' for their Pillsbury Food Service reunion .
Intel has bad news for software developers .
It 's been hinted at already , but now the company has stated explicitly : it 's not enough for software developers to be targeting dual , quad , or eight cores .
No , the future holds tens , hundreds , or thousands of cores , and developers are going to have to bite the bullet and write programs that will scale to such systems .
This recommendation came in a recent blog post , aptly titled " Unwelcome Advice . "
Having to write programs of that scale on systems with hundreds of processors is difficult and totally alien to the vast majority of developers out there .
The blog post describes two ways that developers are trying to accommodate increasingly parallel processors .
Some are trying to move piecemeal , targeting first two or four cores , then perhaps extending it to eight , maybe even 16 .
Others are jumping headlong into writing software that can run on innumerable processors .
This second approach , Intel says , is the one to go for .
Although it will probably cost more upfront — that kind of design needs to permeate the entire application and be built in from day one — it 's going to yield dividends in the long run , because before too long , the processors we buy and use will have cores almost too many to count .
Trying to tackle the parallel performance problem one core at a time might work at the moment , but this trend will not continue .
This is indeed unwelcome advice .
Writing programs for arbitrarily large numbers of cores is a very different task than writing programs for just a few cores .
Targeting just a few cores can often be done without making wholesale changes to a codebase by making incremental changes to existing functions too .
For example , a single - threaded game engine might be modified to create one thread dedicated to sound playback , one thread dedicated to graphics computations , and one thread dedicated to enemy AI .
Each of these threads could use almost the same code as was used in the single - threaded game , making the cost of the changes quite low .
The performance improvement will also tend to be fairly modest , and most importantly of all , such a scheme will not use any more than three cores .
This can be taken a bit further with the technique of " software pipelining " — breaking down a computation into multiple steps that are performed sequentially , one step on each core — but it 's still limited to a fixed number of cores .
If a function is broken down into four independent steps , it can use up to four cores , but it can never use any more than that .
Intel is saying that instead , the game developer should be splitting up each of those tasks so that they can run on an essentially unlimited number of cores .
So instead of taking the graphics engine , the AI , the sound engine , and simply running them as - is , they each need to be rewritten in such a way that they will spread their workloads evenly across as many cores as are available .
This will require considerable redevelopment of the engine .
For some applications , this is not such a big deal ; the algorithms that split the work up in this way are well - known .
Ray tracing , for example , can easily be subdivided across as many cores as a processor has .
This is one of the reasons that ray tracing is set to become the Next Big Thing in 3D gaming ; as well as offering improved graphical capabilities , it 's easy to accelerate simply by adding more cores .
But many other tasks are not so fortunate , with problems that do not easily scale up to meet the demands of the many - core era .
And when the algorithms do exist to compute in parallel , the tools for actually developing and testing them are much weaker than their single - threaded counterparts ; today 's programming languages are strongly oriented towards single - threaded development .
Even in the HPC world of scientific computation , which has long been developing for clusters with hundreds of thousands of processors , scientists are finding it difficult to get as much performance from their clusters as they should .
Intel and AMD alike have been saying for several years that the days of " free " performance scaling from faster processors are behind us , and that future performance improvements will require software changes to take advantage of the abundance of cores .
This clear message that software will need to be able to scale even onto huge numbers of cores is n't unexpected .
But it is nonetheless unwelcome .
Painful times are undoubtedly ahead .
Google Chrome has taken the browser world by storm .
It makes for an exciting release , no doubt , especially with a brand new JavaScript engine on the table .
However the most important question , to JavaScript developers , is : How will this affect my normal development routine ?
I ’ve done some research , talked to some developers , submitted some bugs and come back with a list of things that you should probably be aware .
In all , there are some exciting tweaks , simple bugs , and baffling removals .
Timer Delay
Absolutely the most exciting change : Timer delays are the value that you set .
For example if you do :
setTimeout ( someFunction , 2 ) ;
then someFunction will attempt to execute in 2 milliseconds ( depending on if there ’s any other extenuating circumstances , naturally ) .
The only exception to the above is if a timer delay of < 1 ms is provided then it will be rounded up to 1 ms .
I chatted with Mike Belshe , the developer who implemented timers in Chrome , and he hopes to completely remove that delay at some point .
In browser development every millisecond counts .
I ’ve done some analysis on this in the past and found that all browsers bottom - out at a certain point .
Generally it ’s around 10 - 15 ms – if you provide a timer delay any smaller than that value it ’ll be rounded up to the browser ’s minimum .
There is no specification stating the level at which a timer minimum should work – and that ’s a good thing – think of a mobile device .
If a processor - limited mobile device wanted to raise the minimum bound for a timer it should be allowed to do so .
At the same time a browser should be able to provide any lower bound that it can .
The obvious question becomes :
Why are n’t other browsers doing this ?
There are a couple reasons :
It will allow the user to peg the CPU , blocking the browser ’s user interface .
This is n’t an issue in Chrome since each site is contained within its own process ( the CPU will still be pegged but only the host site will be affected ) .
It may have some unforeseen side effects .
This is the tricky part that no one is sure about at this point .
It may cause weird problems in some sites – but no one is really sure yet .
Chrome is being the canary - in - the - coalmine on this , keeping track of any new problems .
One muted question existed concerning performance tests .
If a performance test used a timer interval less than 10ms would Chrome get an unnecessary advantage ?
The Chrome team did some research and they were unable to find any tests that did this – but I ’m sure if one such test existed it could be , easily , rewritten to work better across browsers .
No Script Execution Dialog
In most other browsers if you try and run a consecutive piece of JavaScript for too long ( for most browsers it ’s around 5 seconds ) a dialog will pop up asking the user if they wish to stop the execution of script on the page .
No such dialog exists in Chrome .
Since script execution is confined to each process they simply allow it to run unchecked .
If you wish to stop execution you must close the tab and re-open it .
I ’m not sure if this is the right UI for the task ( maybe if a long - running script is executing and the user closes the tab then a dialog should pop up ) .
Personally , I ’ve been having fun with this – keeping a page with a while ( true ) {} open at all times , while running Chrome .
Update : A number of readers have reported that they actually have been able to trigger a long - running script error dialog .
Although there does n’t seem to be much rhyme - or - reason as to when it appears .
( I was n’t able to get it to come up , for example . )
Here ’s a picture from Andrew Hawken :
for loop order
Currently all major browsers loop over the properties of an object in the order in which they were defined .
Chrome does this as well , except for a couple cases ( V8 bug , Chrome bug ) .
You can see the issue in the following demo :
var obj = {first : [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] , second : " blah " } , str = " < b > A property contains an array : </b>< br / > " , count = 1 ; for ( var i in obj ) { str += ( count + + ) + " : " + i + " < br / > " ; } str += " < hr />< b> Properties all contain strings :</b>< br/> " ; obj = {first : " blah " , second : " blah " } ; count = 1 ; for ( var i in obj ) { str += ( count + + ) + " : " + i + " < br / > " ; } window.onload = function ( ) { document.body.innerHTML
= str ; } ;
If an object contains a value which is not a primitive ( as is the case in the first example ) then its properties will be enumerated in a different order from which they were defined .
This is an interesting bug due to one fact :
This behavior is explicitly left undefined by the ECMAScript specification .
In ECMA - 262 , section 12.6.4 :
The mechanics of enumerating the properties … is implementation dependent .
However , specification is quite different from implementation .
All modern implementations of ECMAScript iterate through object properties in the order in which they were defined .
Because of this the Chrome team has deemed this to be a bug and will be fixing it .
Text Node Serialization
This is , currently , causing the only regression in jQuery , for Chrome .
It ’s an odd WebKit bug which causes < and > characters to not be serialized to < and > when put in a text node .
This has already been fixed in WebKit trunk and will be fixed the next time Chrome syncs its source .
Gears / Client - Side Storage
This is a tough nut to crack : Google has opted to bundle Gears directly with Chrome ( which is a whole other discussion ) but has explicitly removed WebKit ’s HTML 5 - compatible Client - Side Storage API .
Gears has its SQL database API bundled ( contained within its own namespace and using its own API – different from the HTML 5 API ) which makes this especially strange .
Why , when there ’s two client - side storage implementations on the table , would you pick the one that ’s less spec-compliant ?
I ’m willing to give them the benefit of a doubt , especially considering that the Chrome FAQ mentions this case explicitly , but it definitely leaves me feeling quite confused .
Honestly , not much has changed in Chrome , over WebKit / Safari 3.1 .
The Chrome team has n’t written any new features ( save for those contained within Gears ) or implemented any new specifications ( quite different from the JavaScript situation in Internet Explorer 8 ) .
I realize that we ’re still very early in the release of this browser and I hope to see many excellent contributions make their way into the Open Source WebKit codebase via the Chrome team .

BOSTON , July 3 ( UPI ) --
A study of gerbils found that food nutrients like infant formula or eggs increase brain synapses and improve cognitive abilities , U.S. researchers say .
Dr. Richard Wurtman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says gerbils were given various combinations of three compounds needed for healthy brain membranes -- choline , found in eggs ; uridine monophosphate , found in beets ; and docosahexaenoic acid , found in fish oils .

The gerbils were checked for cognitive changes four weeks later .
The scientists found that the gerbils given choline with uridine monophosphate and / or DHA showed cognitive improvements in tasks thought to be relevant to gerbils , such as navigating mazes .
After the tests were concluded , the researchers dissected the mouse brains to determine a biological cause for the improvement .
Wurtman finds biochemical evidence that there was more than the usual amount of brain synapse activity , which was consistent with behaviors indicating higher intelligence .
" I hope human brains will , like those of experimental animals , respond to this kind of treatment by making more brain synapses and thus restoring cognitive abilities , " Wurtman says in a statement .
The findings are reported in the Journal of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Home foreclosure filings jumped 53 percent in June from a year earlier , although they were down 3 percent from May , and foreclosures are expected to rise further , real estate data firm RealtyTrac said on Thursday .

White
Foreclosure filings rose on an annual basis in 39 states to a total of 252,363 properties during the month , with Nevada , California , Arizona and Florida posting the highest foreclosure rates .
One out of every 501 U.S. households received a notice of default , auction sale or bank repossession in June , Realty Trac said .
“ June was the second straight month with more than a quarter million properties nationwide receiving foreclosure filings , ” said James J. Saccacio , chief executive officer of RealtyTrac .
“ We have not yet reached the top of this foreclosure cycle . ”
The decrease from May , the first monthly dip since February , was not a fluke but it does not signal a trend , either , said Rick Sharga , vice president of marketing at RealtyTrac , based in Irvine , California , in an interview .
“ We were coming off the highest month we ever had in terms of foreclosure activity so some sort of fall - off was inevitable , ” he said .
It is too early to tell whether the government intervention that slowed the pace of foreclosures will actually prevent foreclosures or merely delay the proceedings , Sharga said .
RealtyTrac sees foreclosure activity peaking at the end of 2008 or the beginning of 2009 .
At that point , all the risky subprime mortgages due to adjust to more demanding terms will have done so , Sharga said .
The increase in foreclosures has contributed to the plunge in home prices .
Prices nationwide fell 3.2 percent in May from April and 20.1 percent from a year ago , according to Integrated Asset Services , a real estate valuation firm that tracks single - family home prices .
Foreclosures add to the supply of homes for sale and also tarnish a neighborhood ’s image , depressing property values in the immediate area .
The home building industry has already built enough homes for the next 10.8 months , up 21 percent year - over - year , wrote JPMorgan analyst Michael Rehaut in a note to clients .
Nevada had the highest foreclosure rate , with one in every 122 households receiving a foreclosure filing in June , up almost 85 percent from last year at this time .
California had the second - highest rate , with one in every 192 households receiving a filing .
Michigan , Ohio , Colorado , Georgia , Indiana and Utah were the other states in the top 10 as ranked by number of foreclosure filings posted in June .
Efforts by banks and lenders to stall foreclosures have had little impact .
Industry alliance Hope Now , which includes big mortgage companies such as Wells Fargo & Co and was created to prevent foreclosures , has helped 1.7 million homeowners in the past year .
In May , mortgage servicing companies negotiated new payment plans with about 100,000 homeowners and changed the terms on another 70,000 , Hope Now said last week .
Metropolitan areas in California and Florida had nine of the top 10 cities with the highest foreclosure filing rates , with seven of those in California .
Stockton and Merced in California had the top two spots , while in Florida the top rate was posted by Cape Coral - Fort Myers .
Las Vegas had the sixth - highest rate of foreclosure activity among cities .
When a major player like Google comes up with a new mobile operating system that 's better than the competition and is totally free , you would certainly expect handset manufacturers to be interested .
But there 's interested , and then there 's interested .
After lingering for nearly a year in the former category Motorola is now firmly moving to the latter , hiring and headhunting in an effort to build up a 350 - person group entirely focused on development of Android phones .
The company was one of the original members of the Open Handset Alliance , but seems to have waited for the release buzz from HTC 's G1 before diving in head - first .
There 's talk that Nokia ( and its " real phones " ) may be feeling the vibrations too , allegedly forming an internal team to do the same -- on the down low .
What is web 2.0 ?
It ’s a term that gives a lot of technology - savvy people a chance to argue about the definition all day long .
One of the reasons that ’s true is because Web 2.0 is the name observers gave to the evolution they ’re seeing , not an actual specification such as HTTP on which the web is fundamentally based .
If you ’re over 40 , Web 2.0 is the stuff your kids use naturally , but you ’re still puzzled about .
It ’s the online material they can spend hours building with , molding it to meet their own needs , expressing their creativity .
It ’s not the newspaper - like web pages that you load and read .
It ’s social networking , ‘ wiki ’ websites , sites that change as you make selections and help you to find and configure an experience that meets your personal needs .
Whether you ’re collaborating on MySpace , sharing photo albums on Flickr , or creating your own iGoogle page with the news , weather , phase of the moon or funny videos that you want , it ’s all part of Web 2.0 .
The technologies used with Web 2.0 range from ancient to born yesterday .
That ’s one reason why it ’s more of a concept than a specification .
Some of the more advanced applications use dynamic web technologies like AJAX , but a community ‘ wiki ’ can be built with the most basic of web programming .
Sometimes the designers are aiming for flashy , responsive interaction , while other times they ’re designing to just make it easier to share information .
Through bookmarking sites like Digg and Technorati , the web becomes even more like a spide ’s web as static , old - style information , evolving websites and personal journal - like ‘ blogs ’ are synthesized through a kind of computerized gossip page , where participants offer links to their favorite sites and check out others , while indicators track the popularity of each suggestion and organize and present them to the participants .
If you have used Amazon.com and enjoyed the ‘ people who read Hamlet also read these other books ’ suggestion feature , you ’ll find the social bookmarking sites are a great way to broaden your horizon .
Web 2.0 means that many applications you formerly had to download and run on your computer are now becoming available online .
In fact , Software as a Service ( SaaS ) is predicted to be an important part of the software industry ’s offerings to consumers and also large businesses in the future .
Software companies will take care of everything , and you ’ll just fire up your web browser and use your application .
An example of this already in place is ‘ Google Apps , ’ where users can work on their documents online from any web browser , even collaborating with others , never downloading specialized software to their computer .
As with many technological revolutions , the beginning is people playing around , then looking for a way to make money with what they ’ve discovered .
In the case of Web 2.0 , the transition from presenting information to truly interactive web sites has fired up many imaginations , and possibilities are growing as companies and enthusiasts create ‘ toolkits ’ and other ways to share technologies that enable interactive websites .
Even some of the features added to Microsoft ’s Windows Vista seem internet - inspired , where applications and operating system features are n’t compartmentalized as before , but are more designed for users and programmers to create the tools and experiences that they want to see .
Web 2.0 resources include open source packages and software from companies like Microsoft ( which provides its own version of AJAX , formerly called Atlas ) , and Sun Microsystems ( creator of Java ) .
It ’s available to software developers to work in programming languages , and on many sites like iGoogle in a form that just allows ‘ drag and drop ’ configuration and a creative touch , so simple that many children are doing it .
Where computers once came with a large set of manuals telling you what you could do and how you must do it , Web 2.0 means users are freed to design their own experiences , and share them with others .
Web 2.0 evolution will likely be in the ‘ application space , ’ as educators , homes , and libraries and other users join the business users already exploring the possibilities .
Regular Web 2.0 conferences are gathering to brainstorm and talk about possibilities , but all it might take for a new Web 2.0 application might be an elementary school student with curiosity .
Here are some people ( brothers in fact ) who know more about Web 2 or social traffic generation than anyone I know at this point .
I know these guys personally so I ’m comfortable with sending you to their site .

Kawasaki Developing 217 MPH
Train for Japan
September 19th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
The Railway Gazette reports that Kawasaki has unveiled a new high - speed train called the Environmentally Friendly Super Express Train ( efSET ) .
The train will travel at a speed of 217 MPH ( 350 km / h ) .
Kawasaki designed the train with a lightweight aerodynamic body to lower vibration and noise .
It will also be equipped with regenerative braking that recycles kinetic energy generated by movement .
The Kawasaki train is even faster than Japan ’s record - holding Shinkansen train , which travels at a speed of 186 MPH .
In order to assure reliability of the new train , engineers will make use of components proven to work in the Shinkansen train network .
But Japanese train - riders will have settle for the Shinkansen train in the near future — the Kawasaki design wo n’t be finished until March 2009 , and engineering verification wo n’t be completed until March 2010 .
Americans — specifically , Californians — have to wait even longer for their 220 MPH high - speed train , which wo n’t be ready until 2030 .

It does not make sense to waste your money buying new when there is such a huge market of gently used items that are just as good as new - - for a fraction of the price .
Here are the top 9 things you will be better off buying used :
Timeshares .
Most people I know regret having purchased a timeshare new .
No wonder .
They are guaranteed to lose 30 to 70 percent of their value right off the bat , says Liz Pulliam Weston , MSN columnist .
If you are convinced that a timeshare is for you , buy it used as a resale .
According to TimeSharesUSAResales.com , a site that deals in the secondary timeshare market , you will save on average 67 percent of the new price .
Pets .
Buy a purebred puppy from a breeder in California and you will spend at least $ 700 , plus vet bills .
Adopt a previously owned puppy from the animal shelter for about $ 175 including spay / neuter , vaccinations and fees .
Savings ?
Oh , about 78 percent , according to SmartMoney.com .
Software and console games .
Games for consoles like the Xbox 360 and Sony PlayStation can often be purchased used for half price .
Ditto for popular software .
Sure you will have to wait awhile after its release , but by then you will know for sure which game or program is a winner , and which are considered losers .
Office furniture .
Sadly , many start - up businesses fail before the second year .
And many of them invested in fancy furniture .
Never buy new office furniture .
Check CraigsList.org or local classifieds to find the goods .
Sports equipment .
Lots of people buy all kinds of sports equipment from basketballs to ski outfits and everything between -- planning to use all of it , of course .
And there it sits gathering dust .
Find a Play
It Again Sports consignment store in your area , ( PlayItAgain Sports.com ) or check out yard sales and newspaper ads .
CDs and DVDs .
Used CDs , DVDs and books are quite available .
Find the latest releases in pristine condition at discounts of 30 percent or more at websites like Half.com and Abebooks.com .
Even if you think you cannot wait , take a look to see if by chance what you want is available used .
Cars .
Want to know what happens the second you drive that new car off the dealers lot ?
Edmunds.com says it loses about 12 percent of its value .
That is horrible because if you just financed it for 100 percent of its value , you are upside down before you can even show it off to your friends .
Why not let someone else take that upfront depreciation hit by buying a used car ?
There are so many good , late - model , used cars on the market .
It makes no sense to buy new .
Toys .
Youngsters grow out of , their toys about as fast as their clothes and that is very good for you and your toddlers .
Yesterdays cast - offs are waiting at a yard or tag sale near you .
Start looking around .
You will be astonished to find nearly new , name - brand toys at a mere fraction of their new price .
Jewelry .
Because gems and fine jewelry are marked up so significantly ( 100 percent is common ) , you can find great bargains on previously owned fine jewelry at pawn shops for half - price , says Weston .
Just make sure you are dealing with a pawn shop that has been in business for a while and has developed a good reputation in the area .

A police officer who abandoned colleagues on a 999 call to visit prostitutes has been sacked .
Sergeant Karl Cliff , 42 , of Merseyside Police , admitted misconduct in a public office last month and was given a suspended eight - month jail sentence .
Cliff , of Flint , North Wales , who had been under surveillance , was caught by his colleagues while he was with a prostitute in his squad car .
A Merseyside Police spokesman confirmed on Tuesday the officer has been sacked .
He had previously been suspended by the force .
Burglary call
Liverpool Crown Court heard last month that Cliff had pestered one prostitute so much she reported him to his already suspicious colleagues , and a surveillance operation was mounted .
He regularly left his base in Wallasey to travel through the Mersey tunnel to fraternise with prostitutes in Liverpool 's city centre red light district .
Cliff was driving to see them one night when he failed to support colleagues dealing with a burglary where it was thought the raiders were still present .
He was eventually arrested after being caught with a prostitute in his car parked behind a B &Q store .

" The Bluetooth devices , which many people are using these days because of health or safety concerns , may not be always so safe .
There is a downside , " he says .
Men who use these hands - free devices tend to carry their cell phones in their pants pocket or clipped to their belts at the waist while in talk mode .
As a result , they may be exposing their testicles to damaging radiofrequency electromagnetic waves , explains Ashok Agarwal , PhD , head of the andrology laboratory and the director of the Center for Reproductive Medicine at the Glickman Urologoical and Kidney Institute at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio .
Sept. 19 , 2008 -- Men , beware : Using a hands - free device with a cell phone may affect your fertility if you keep your phone close to your testicles , Cleveland Clinic researchers warn in the journal Fertility and Sterility .
Cell Phone Radiation Affects Sperm Quality
To arrive at their findings , researchers collected semen samples from 32 men and divided each man 's sample into two parts .
They placed half of the semen samples 2.5 centimeters away from a 850 MHz frequency cell phone in talk mode for one hour .
Most cell phones used in the U.S. are 850-900 MHz .
They chose this distance because it is the typical distance between the testes and the trouser pockets .
Previous research from the same group showed that radiofrequency electromagnetic waves emitted from cell phones can impair sperm quality , and the new study shows why this may occur .
Semen exposed to radiofrequency electromagnetic waves emitted from cell phones had higher levels of damaging free radicals , lower sperm motility ( the ability of the sperm to move and swim ) and sperm viability ( the percentage of live sperm ) , and possibly greater oxidative stress , the study shows .
There were no significant differences in DNA damage between the exposed and unexposed groups .
" Our findings appear to be in line with other concerns that environmental factors such as toxins , pollutants , and materials used in farming play a role in male infertility , " Agarwal says .
Further study is needed to validate the findings .
" We will also test the effect [ of radiofrequency electromagnetic waves emitted from cell phones ] at other distances , " he says .
" We know the radiation impairs sperm quality at 2.5 centimeters , but we do n't know if the effect will continue at 3 , 4 , or 5 centimeters , " he says .
Future studies will determine if there is dangerous emission when the phone is in silent or standby mode .
" The emission may be smaller than when in talk mode , but could it still be harmful if it reaches the testes , " he says .
Hello heartbreak , goodbye good old landline
I often wonder if there should n't be some sort of ceremony , a grand ritual for beloved soon - to - be - defunct tech , something involving fire and tequila and howling laments into the night mixed with lots of hugging and laughter and bawdry tales told by the hoary old - timers who remember it all , albeit hazily .
Currently marked for imminent obsolescence : the landline telephone .
What a time it was ( the old - timers will croak ) , a freewheeling , rose - colored era full of grumpy Pac Bell repairmen and innocent prank phone calls , coupled with multihour chats until dawn with a new lover , sans the slightest thought of silly irritants like minute overages or random signal dropouts or hey wait a sec honey I 'm getting a text message from Brussels and my battery 's about to die and oh my God I think I just pressed " erase all numbers " by accident are you still there are you still there hello ?
Hello ?
Hello ?
There will be anecdotes .
There will be fond memories of , say , calling that beautiful blond girl from high school physics class and hearing her mellifluous absolutely angelic high school voice say " Hello ? " and then hanging up really fast , breathless and riddled with quivering love , safe in the surety that she could never know who kept calling and sighing and hanging up because it was a time before caller ID and before instant callback and well before caller GPS tracking , well before everything changed .
Again .
Ah , change .
It 's happening right now .
If all forecasts and iPhone sales figures are to be believed , the landline phone , this ancient device of your parents ' fondest memories , is going the way of the 8 - track and the cassette , the pull tab and the teletype , the floppy disk and VHS and John McCain 's brain and sad little girls named Edna Lou .
Perhaps you already know .
Perhaps you 're already one of the converts .
Perhaps you have no idea what I 'm talking about because you 're about 22 and have used a cute pink Nokia since you were 4 and got your first domain name at 10 and you can't even spell Led Zeppelin properly , in which case I 'm not sure I can speak to you ever again .
Sorry .
No matter .
The phone companies are adding mountains of wireless customers as fast as they 're losing landliners , as millions of young whippersnappers switch to using their cell phones exclusively ( or , more accurately , never order a landline in the first place ) because , well , why not ?
This is the wireless age , Grandpa .
Besides , whatever your cell can't do , Skype can .
Or IM .
Or texting .
E-mail , even .
Really , who needs a plug ?
A psychological cushion
Truly , almost no one I know has a traditional telephone anymore , and if they do , they maybe only keep it around as a psychological cushion , a false comfort for when the apocalypse hits , perhaps remembering that crazy citywide blackout a few years back when suddenly all your gizmos went dark and you had to fire up all the candles in your house and turn on that portable AM radio to get the news and felt suddenly very cut off and isolated and sad .
And then you remembered , " Hey , wait a sec , can't I still plug this old $ 5 Radio Shack corded phone from 1987 into the wall and have it work just dandy because it requires almost no electricity at all ?
Sure I can . "
And you did .
And you called your parents and they sounded relieved to hear from you and the world was less lonely .
Amazing .
Personally , I 'm getting ready .
Gearing up for the transition , the letting go , the awkward switchover .
It will not be an easy parting .
My flat here in San Francisco is long and has many offshoot rooms , and so I have five little Panasonic handsets scattered throughout the joint , each waiting on its own charging station and each making it absolutely impossible that I wo n't be at least within crawling distance because , well , is n't that important ?
OK , maybe not .
But it 's still an odd notion , switching back to relying on a single tiny phone and the deeply imperfect cellular technology that it runs on , and taking it with me into all those rooms , not so different than 25 years ago when you could get only so many phone jacks in the house and if you wanted to call you had to be where the phone was .
This is the exact same thing , inverted .
The next wave
And what happens when the iPhone breaks ?
Or I lose it ?
Or drop it in this vat of red wine on my desk or hurl it at the wall in a fit of joyous disbelief after winning a Pulitzer ?
Instant isolation , that 's what .
Oh well .
My mental gyrations are , of course , irrelevant .
There is no real justification for the cost of two phone numbers and multiple handsets anymore .
The next wave is here .
Wireless is the new e-mail .
Which was the new fax .
Which was the new teletype .
Which was the new snail mail .
Which was the new Morse code .
Which was the new Pony Express .
Which was the new cave drawing .
Which was the new voice of God in your prehistoric head .
Which really is n't all that different from a call on a Bluetooth headset .
Full circle , really .
Another transition .
Another tech wave , another soon - to - be - obsolete technology that once was king and is now relegated to cultural curiosity , niche product , footnote .
Make a note of it ?
Sigh affectionately ?
Mark your calendar so you can look back someday and say you were there when it happened ?
Raise a toast and yank the cord and pray your next call does n't fizzle and drop out just over that next hill ?
Why not ?

The RIAA is continuing to try coercion to prop up its illegitimate and unethical business model .
First , it is suing attorney Ray Beckerman over the revealing articles on his blog , Recording Industry vs The People .
Beckerman has been instrumental in defending people victimized by the RIAA 's tactics and has supported the DefectiveByDesign campaign .
Second , along with the MPAA , the RIAA has written and is pushing S. 3325 , the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Act of 2008 , through the Senate .
You can tell this bill is trouble just from the propaganda term " intellectual property " in the name , which is an attempt to trick us into thinking about the questions involved in a way most profitable to the RIAA .
In the last five years , the RIAA filed or threatened more than 30,000 suits against alleged infringers .
Apparently they are tired of doing this intimidation themselves and want your civil servants to do it for them , and for you to fund it with your taxes .
This Enforcement bill burdens the Department of Justice with the obligation to pursue civil suits against people the RIAA and MPAA accuse of illegal copying -- with any money involved going back to the media companies !
Even the repressive copyright regime we have now obligates the government to represent the public 's interest in promoting progress in science and the arts through sharing and the dissemination of knowledge .
If the government starts working for the media companies , they will be working against the public interest , and we will surely see attempts to give legitimacy back to Digital Restrictions Management ( DRM ) systems -- unethical restrictions that squash so much useful sharing , education , and communication .
Help stop this bill by calling and emailing key senators including members of the Senate Judiciary Committee , and Presidential candidates McCain and Obama .
It 's critical that we do this as soon as possible -- they are trying to have it pass without a full vote in the Senate .
Please call and write your own senators , as well as :
When you call or write , you might say something like :
Hi there , my name is NAME and I 'm a potential voter in STATE .
I 'm calling in opposition to S. 3325 , " The Enforcement of Intellectual Property Act . "
As a tax payer , I oppose spending public funds for the Department of Justice to take civil actions against the citizens they are supposed to be representing on behalf of the major media companies -- and then turning the profits over to those companies .
Instead , the government should be investigating and condeming the legal tactics already used by groups like the RIAA and MPAA , who are profiting by abusing the legal system .
I understand this bill could pass today and I urge the Senator to oppose and put a hold on this bill .
When you 're calling John Kyl of Arizona , Jeff Sessions of Alabama , Sam Brownback of Kansas , or Tom Coburn of Oklahoma , make sure to thank them for their initial opposition to the bill and ask them to hold their positions .
To do a little extra to get the word out , vote this bill down at OpenCongress .
" People monitoring CCTV images have banks of screens in front of them , and this system helps them by alerting them to something the system has spotted .
The person looking at the screen can then quickly identify if it is a crime taking place , or whether the camera has simply picked up on something innocent , like a child screaming , and act on it accordingly . "
It 's closed !
It 's open !
It 's closed !
It 's open again !
The Chinese government has once again agreed to open the Internet for press during the Olympic Games , apparently after being pressured by the International Olympic Committee , which in turn was pressured by the international journalism community .
The IOC announced today that the press would , again , be able to report on the Games as freely as they have in other countries , and declared the issue " solved . "
The news comes just days after furor over China 's continued Internet censorship reached fever pitch , as journalists began to arrive in Beijing in preparation for the Games ' commencement August 8 .
China had originally promised , as part of its host city agreement , that it would open the Internet so that the press could report on the Games freely , but journalists quickly found that was not the case .
This week , they complained of extremely slow Internet connections in the Main Press Centre ( which some theorized was a deterrent from using the Internet altogether ) , completely inaccessible international web sites , and even " harassment " from Chinese law enforcement .
At the time , the IOC seemed to be both alarmed at the news and resigned to it .
The IOC had told certain news outlets that it was looking into the issue and that the press would still need unfettered Internet access .
On the other hand , the organization admitted that certain web sites and topics would continue to be censored thanks to an agreement with the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games ( BOCOG ) .
This drew the ire of journalists everywhere , many of whom excoriated the IOC for not trying harder to hold China to its promises .
Now , however , things are magically solved .
The IOC said in a statement issued today that the Committee met with BOCOG and the issues are in the process of being fixed .
" Already we put a team together in the IOC to work with BOCOG to begin to open up sites which we believe are absolutely necessary to comply with noncensored reporting of the Games , " IOC Press Commission chairman Kevan Gosper told Reuters .
" We are in the process of getting web sites which were previously blocked unblocked . "
Indeed , it seems as if web sites that the press had previously complained about not being accessible , such as Amnesty International 's website and the BBC's Chinese version , are now accessible through Beijing — at least according to WebSitePulse 's Great Firewall test .
But the IOC warned that while these sites may be accessible to journalists in Beijing , the rest of the country would still be subject to China 's filtered version of the Internet .
Additionally , certain types of sites will remain blocked across all of China , including porn and those that are considered " subversive " or against national interests ( such as sites related to the Falun Gong and many Tibetan organizations ) .
Gosper attempted to justify this by adding , " That 's normal in most countries in the world . "
Um , yeah ... right .
Some organizations that previously criticized China and the IOC cautiously applauded today 's progress , although they remained somewhat skeptical .
Reporters Without Borders , whose web site has been blocked by the Chinese government since 2003 , found that its web site is now not only accessible in various parts of Beijing , but also in some areas of Shanghai .
" This is good news , of course , " the organization noted , " but it continues to be unacceptable that the Chinese government can decide , according to its mood , which web sites are censored and which are accessible .
And how long will these sites be available to the 253 million Chinese Internet users , who continue to be subject to massive online censorship ? "
The NSA Teams Up with the Chinese Government to Limit Internet Anonymity
Definitely strange bedfellows :
A United Nations agency is quietly drafting technical standards , proposed by the Chinese government , to define methods of tracing the original source of Internet communications and potentially curbing the ability of users to remain anonymous .
The U.S. National Security Agency is also participating in the “ IP Traceback ” drafting group , named Q6/17 , which is meeting next week in Geneva to work on the traceback proposal .
Members of Q6/17 have declined to release key documents , and meetings are closed to the public . [… ]
A second , apparently leaked ITU document offers surveillance and monitoring justifications that seem well - suited to repressive regimes : A political opponent to a government publishes articles putting the government in an unfavorable light .
The government , having a law against any opposition , tries to identify the source of the negative articles but the articles having been published via a proxy server , is unable to do so protecting the anonymity of the author .
This is being sold as a way to go after the bad guys , but it wo n’t help .
Here ’s Steve Bellovin on that issue :
First , very few attacks these days use spoofed source addresses ; the real IP address already tells you where the attack is coming from .
Second , in case of a DDoS attack , there are too many sources ; you ca n’t do anything with the information .
Third , the machine attacking you is almost certainly someone else ’s hacked machine and tracking them down ( and getting them to clean it up ) is itself time - consuming .
TraceBack is most useful in monitoring the activities of large masses of people .
But of course , that ’s why the Chinese and the NSA are so interested in this proposal in the first place .
It ’s hard to figure out what the endgame is ; the U.N. does n’t have the authority to impose Internet standards on anyone .
In any case , this idea is counter to the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights , Article 19 : “ Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression ; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek , receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers . ”
In the U.S. , it ’s counter to the First Amendment , which has long permitted anonymous speech .
On the other hand , basic human and constitutional rights have been jettisoned left and right in the years after 9/11 ; why should this be any different ?
But when the Chinese government and the NSA get together to enhance their ability to spy on us all , you have to wonder what ’s gone wrong with the world .

John McCain was asked today about the charge , pressed by some Barack Obama supporters in comments posted to The Ticket and elsewhere , that he intentionally avoided eye contact with his rival during their Friday night debate as a way of expressing his disdain for him .
Here 's what he said on ABC's " This Week With George Stephanopoulos " : “ I was looking at the moderator a great deal of time .
I was writing a lot of the time .
I in no way know how that in any way would be disdainful . "
He also noted that in many of the debates in which he has participated , " I do n't look at my opponents because I 'm focusing on the people and the American people that I 'm talking to . ”
He did not mention what others have postulated -- that the severe injuries he suffered as a prisoner of war make a shoulder pivot awkward for him .
Regardless , the vibe between McCain and Obama -- which , as The Ticket previously noted can be key to public reactions to the debates -- will now be even more closely watched Oct.7 , when the two next share a stage .
It will be a town - hall format for their encounter in Nashville , so there should be lots of body language to analyze .

Chocolate Lovers Pained by Candy Changes
More ' Chocolate ' Candy Bars Now Include Vegetable Oils Instead of Pricey Cocoa Butter
For years , Sharon Leitner 's candy bar of choice was Take 5 .
" I liked that it was a combination of different flavors , " the Cincinnati resident said .
" It was salty and sweet , [ with ] caramel and peanut butter and chocolate , and it had something for everybody . "
But this past spring , Leitner , 24 , noticed a change .
" It just did n't taste like it used to , " she said .
The new taste was " more waxy and artificial . "
A look at the bar 's wrapper helped Leitner understand why : cocoa butter -- which experts say helps give chocolate its smooth , creamy taste -- was n't on the candy 's ingredients list .
" Then I started noticing that there were all kinds of other products that did n't have cocoa butter , " she said .
Changes to the formulations of several candy bars has chocolate lovers like Leitner buzzing -- and not in a good way .
Cybele May , the founder of the candy review Web site Candy Blog , said that in recent years rising cocoa prices have led candy companies like Hershey 's -- the maker of Take 5 and the top chocolate - seller in the U.S. -- to replace cocoa butter with cheaper vegetable oils .
The ingredients list for Take 5 , for instance , now includes " palm , shea , sunflower and / or safflower oil . "
" They just ruined that , " May said of the Take 5 bar .
Hershey , meanwhile , stands by its products .
The company " is committed to making the world 's best chocolate , " said spokesman Kirk Saville .
The Cocoa Question
While a " handful " of the company 's products do include vegetable oils other than cocoa butter , he said , " we continue to make Hershey 's , Hershey 's Kisses , Reese 's peanut butter cups with pure milk chocolate as we have for over a century . "
Ingredients for Whatchamacallit bars include palm kernel and soybean oil and may also include sunflower or safflower oil , according to the candy 's wrapper .
That defense -- that there are Hershey 's products that still contain pure milk chocolate -- is n't enough for Leitner .
" To me , shaving out the cocoa butter in the less - popular products kind of says that if you like Whatchamacallit [ candy bars ] you 're less deserving of quality ingredients than say , someone who likes Reese 's cups , " she said .
Cocoa Butter
Cocoa butter is fat derived from cocoa beans .
Like other commodities , cocoa prices have skyrocketed in recent years .
In 2006 , one metric ton of African cocoa butter cost less than $ 4,000 .
Today , it costs more than $ 8,100 , according to Judy Ganes , the president of J. Ganes Consulting in Katonah , New York .
Ganes , whose company specializes in research on tropical food products , said that a combination of growing global demand for chocolate and problems in cocoa-producing countries -- heavy rains in Indonesia and civil war in the Ivory Coast -- have driven prices to peaks not seen since the 1970s .
" It certainly has hurt manufacturers , " Ganes said .
Ingredients : Truth About Food Labels
In the United States , when a so - called chocolate bar does n't include cocoa butter or includes other oils , it can't actually be labeled chocolate .
" According to the Food and Drug [ Administration 's ] regulations for chocolate , cocoa butter is the required fat for chocolate , " said Susan Smith , the spokeswoman for the National Confectioners Association .
Take 5 used to be Sharon Leitner 's favorite candy bar .
But the Cincinnati resident says that Take 5's current blend of ingredients -- which , according to the candy 's pacakaging , includes " palm , shea , sunflower and / or saffron oil " -- does n't please her taste buds .
In 2006 , there was a challenge posed to this standard and to other standards for U.S. food products .
The Grocery Manufacturers Association , the trade group representing the food , beverage and consumer products industry , petitioned the FDA to " modernize " its regulations .
GMA spokesman Brian Kennedy said that the goal of the petition was to accommodate innovation in the food industry .
He said that under current regulations , for instance , if food companies make pasta out of a blend of whole wheat flour and white flour , they can't officially call it " pasta . "
Made with Chocolate
A blended product , he said , would probably be more palatable to consumers than 100 percent whole wheat pasta .
But if the new product is n't called pasta , he said , people wo n't buy it .
This package of Milk Duds includes the label " made with Chocolate & Caramel . "
Candy critic Cybele May said that words and phrases such as " made with chocolate , " " chocolatey " and " chocolate candy " are sometimes used by candymakers to describe candy that does n't meet the federal government 's standards for chocolate .
" When they want to have pasta , they want to purchase something that actually says pasta , " Kennedy said .
But when the GMA petition came to light , it was its implications for chocolate that got attention :
An appendix to the petition noted that the changes could allow for manufacturers to use vegetable oils other than cocoa butter to make chocolate .
Both consumers and small chocolatiers decried the proposed changes .
In 2007 , Mars Inc. , the No. 2 chocolate - seller in the U.S. and the maker of M&M's , broke ranks with industry peers and also came out against the petition .
Chocolate Wars
Europe has had its own chocolate wars .
In 2000 , after years of heated debate , the European Union struck an agreement allowing for chocolate products to contain up to five percent of oils other than cocoa butter .
" Mr. Goodbar is made with chocolate but is not a chocolate bar , " candy critic Cybele May said .
The ingredients list for the bar does include cocoa butter , but it also includes " palm shea , sunflower and / or safflower oil . "
To date , the U.S. petition has gone nowhere .
" FDA will complete the review of this petition in context of the Center 's priorities , " FDA spokesman Mike Herndon said in an e-mail to ABCNews.com .
' Chocolatey ' Goodness ?
Meanwhile , May said that candymakers can skirt the regulations for what can be labeled chocolate by emblazoning their wrappers with phrases like " chocolatey , " " made with chocolate " and " chocolate candy . "
Hershey 's Kissables , she said , are one example .
May , who blogged about Kissables earlier this month , said that when the candy contained cocoa butter , the candy 's wrapper included the phrase " milk chocolate . "
It 's since been replaced with " chocolate candy . "
On the back of the Kissables wrapper , the vegetable oils used are listed as " palm , shea , sunflower , and / or safflower oil . "
There 's a difference between the old Hershey 's Kissables wrapper ( above , courtesy of www.candyblog.net) and the new one .
Candy critic Cybele May says the new wrapper no longer says " milk chocolate " because the candy 's formula has changed .
Such combinations of oils and that " and / or " conjunction can be found on other candy wrappers too .
It gives candy companies the flexibility to change which ingredients they use when vegetable oil prices fluctuate , said Barry Swanson , spokesperson for Institute of Food Technologists and a professor of food science at Washington State University .
" If one of those fats or oils becomes very expensive , they 'll just use less of it , " Swanson said .
" I think anytime we 're looking at increased costs , you 're going to find more , shall we say , creative formulations to try to reduce the cost involved in producing a product , " he said .
Cocoa Substitutes
May said that Hershey 's is n't the only company that uses substitutes for cocoa butter .
Baby Ruth bars by Nestle -- the third - biggest chocolate - seller in the U.S. -- once contained " real chocolate " but have n't had it for a long time , she said .
Ingredients for Baby Ruth Miniatures include cocoa but also hydrogenated palm kernel and coconut oil .
Nestle also recently introduced a Mexican bar in the United States called Carlos V. May said that the Mexican version of the bar was made of chocolate , but the American version is not .
Attempts to reach Nestle 's Mexican branch were unsuccessful .
Patricia Bowles , the communications manager of Nestle Confections and Snacks for Nestle 's U.S. branch , said that the changes to Baby Ruth 's ingredients took place before Nestle purchased the brand in the 1990s .
Overall , she said , economic conditions have n't led Nestle to change the formulas for its products .
" We are not quick to change something that we know our consumers love , " she said .
Changing ingredients is n't the only way candymakers and other food producers cope with rising food costs ; they can also change the sizes of their products and , most noticeably to consumers , they can raise prices .
Both Mars and Hershey announced wholesale price increases earlier this month .
Nestle , which also sells bottled water , frozen meals and other food products , has reported its 2008 profits were bolstered by price increases for its goods .
It ’s hard to think of anything more heinous than bogus cancer cures .
Yet there is no lack of Internet sites that promise to cure , for a price , any cancer with an elixir , concoction of herbs or systematized program of thinking good thoughts .
Last week the Federal Trade Commission disclosed actions it had taken against several companies that promoted online cancer cures .
The actions were the result of a project started last year to identify websites making unsubstantiated cure claims .
“ We found all of these claims to be nothing short of breathtaking , and not in a good way , ” said Lydia Parnes , director of the FTC ’s Bureau of Consumer Protection .

She announced law enforcement actions against 11 companies .
Six already had reached settlements with the agency ; the rest will be litigated .
Eleven sites is a pittance considering the number of online cancer cure claims that can be readily found .
Putting the words “ cancer , ” “ cure ” and “ miracle ” in a Google search resulted not only in hundreds of thousands of hits ( some of which were about legitimate scientific procedures ) , but also a list of sponsored links paid for by companies that wanted their supposed cures on the first page of results .
There was the “ Miracle Water for Cancer ” website , advertising a treated water that allegedly could curb the disease , plus also aid in weight loss and slow down the aging process .

There was also a site offering a miracle cure “ the drug companies hope you never find out ” that supposedly is also a vitamin that “ will virtually eliminate the chance of getting cancer . ”
Parnes acknowledged that there was no lack of sites that “ sell snake oil to consumers , ” as she put it .
The project originally identified 112 websites making non-medical cancer -cure claims .
They each were sent warning letters “ telling them they must have adequate substantiation for any health claims they make about their products , ” Parnes said .
Within two months , about 30 % of these sites had closed down or removed unsubstantiated claims , she said .

The actions announced last week were the first taken against the rest .
Among those that reached a settlement :
* Ni-Gen Nutrition of Troy , Mich. , which allegedly marketed an electrolyte liquid and apricot seeds as cures .
* Westberry Enterprises of Pineville , La. , which the agency said sold teas that contained algae and other ingredients .
Advertisement
* Jim Clark ’s All Natural Cancer Therapy of Louisville , Ky. , which allegedly sold digestive enzymes and coral calcium as treatments .
In each case , the company settling with the agency promised to no longer make unsubstantiated claims but also did n’t admit wrongdoing .
The companies that have been sued by the agency include :
* Omega Supply of San Diego , which allegedly sold hydrazine sulfate , a substance classified by the government as a potential cancer - causing agent .
Advertisement
* Herbs for Cancer , which allegedly sold 16 types of teas to fight specific cancers , plus a 17th type for “ cancers not on our list . ”
In a statement , the Federal Drug Administration said it also might take action against some sites identified in the Federal Trade Commission investigation .
Parnes said that along with the FTC ’s actions , the agency was launching a website -- www.ftc.gov/curious -- to provide educational materials about spotting and reporting bogus cancer claims .
And she said investigations and legal actions would continue .

“ This is not a kind of once - in - a - blue moon effort , ” Parnes said .
“ We have been on this beat for quite a long time , and we intend to stay there . ”

Cancer scams
The Federal Trade Commission has a new series of Web pages on identifying and reporting sites that sell unsubstantiated cancer cures .
It ’s at www.ftc.gov/curious.
Here are signs that a supposed cure could be a scam :
Advertisement
* If it claims to work on every type of cancer .
All cancers are different .
* If it ’s a “ natural ” cure .
Remedies such as essiac tea and black salve , which are billed as closer to nature than mainstream medications , are unproven and can be harmful .
* If a cure site uses technical jargon in place of plain - language facts .
* If the cure site offers a money - back guarantee .
This hardly substantiates a cure claim .

BELGRADE ( Reuters ) - Bosnian Serb wartime president Radovan Karadzic , one of the world ’s most wanted men for his part in civilian massacres , was arrested on Monday , Serbian President Boris Tadic ’s office said .
Government sources said he had been under surveillance for several weeks , after a tip - off from a foreign intelligence service .
In Sarajevo , scene of a bloody 43 - month siege at the hands of Karadzic ’s Belgrade - backed forces , Croats and Bosnian Muslims streamed onto the streets to celebrate .
The arrest of Karadzic and other indicted war criminals , is one of the main conditions of Serbian progress towards European Union ( EU ) membership .
Richard Holbrooke , former U.S. assistant secretary of state for Europe who negotiated the 1995 Dayton accords that ended the war in Bosnia , welcomed his capture , describing him as the Osama bin Laden of Europe , “ a real , true architect of mass murder ” .
The arrest came on the eve of a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers scheduled to discuss closer relations with Serbia after formation of a new pro-western government led by Tadic ’s Democratic Party .
The EU welcomed the capture , apparently in Belgrade , as a milestone in Serbian EU aspirations .
Karadzic , still seen by militant nationalists as a national savior following the collapse of Yugoslavia , was expected to be transferred quickly to the custody of the Hague court .
Karadzic ’s place of hiding has been a constant subject of international speculation since he went underground in 1997 .
The West had long suspected Belgrade of failing to press the search , but the new government had signaled it wanted to comply .
SREBRENICA MASSACRE
Sources close to the government said Karadzic , distinguished by his characteristic long , grey hair , was arrested in Belgrade .
He was currently undergoing a formal identification process , including DNA testing , and would be meeting with investigators overnight .
“ Karadzic was located and arrested , ” the President ’s statement said .
It gave no details .
The West is also pressing for the arrest of Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic , also in hiding .
Karadzic , was leader of the Bosnian Serbs during the 1992 - 95 Bosnia war .
He was indicted by the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague in July 1995 for authorizing the shooting of civilians during the 43 - month siege of Sarajevo .
He was indicted for genocide a second time four months later for orchestrating the slaughter of some 8,000 Muslim men after Mladic ’s forces seized the U.N. “ safe area ” of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia .
He went underground in 1997 , two years after NATO military intervention ended the war that followed from the collapse of Yugoslavia .
Update ( 09-21-2008 ) : I have a followup to this article here .
You ’ve probably been told that in Ruby classes are always open and any code can come along and redefine your methods in any way it pleases .
Indeed , this is true .
Kinda
What ’s not true , despite every reference I ’ve read saying the contrary , is that you ca n’t prevent this from happening .
Ruby provides a method_added ( ) callback that is invoked every time a method is added or redefined within a class .
It ’s part of the Module class , and every Class is a Module .
There are also two related callbacks called method_removed ( ) and method_undefined ( ) .
This means you could detect when other code has redefined a method , and do something about it !
How about redefining that method ( again ) to point back to your original code ?
Indeed , this works .
I ’ve encapsulated the details of this in a new module I call Immutable .
It provides one class method called immutable_method ( ) .
Provide it a list of methods you do n’t want touched and it ’ll make sure they ca n’t be redefined .
Hence , immutable .
It ’s on GitHub : http://github.com/up_the_irons/immutable/tree/master
Here ’s an example :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 require ' rubygems ' require ' immutable ' module Foo include Immutable def foo : foo end immutable_method : foo end # Now re-open Foo and redefine foo ( ) module
Foo def foo : baz end end include Foo foo # => : foo
foo ( ) returns : foo , not : baz , even though we redefined foo( ) to return : baz .
If this makes you think of Java ’s final method modifier , you ’d be almost right in saying immutable_method is similar .
But there ’s one important difference : with immutable_method you can still redefine methods in subclasses .
This makes sense , as one can argue that if you want to reimplement or extend a method , a child class is the only place where you should be doing that anyway .
I tend to agree , call me a purist .
Why would this be useful to you ?
I do n’t know .
But I can tell you what motivated me .
My motivation for writing something that provides what some may call “ evil ” functionality ( heh , and monkey patching is n’t evil ? ) of closed methods / classes came from my trials of trying to improve Rails loading time by reimplementing some ActiveSupport methods in C ( Ruby extension ) .
I absolutely needed my C versions of certain methods to be present , and not clobbered by ActiveSupport .
So why did n’t I just load my extension after ActiveSupport ?
Because by then it is too late .
Rails is already loaded , along with slow running methods that get called over 10,000 times during initialization .
Run the profiler and see for yourself :
1 ./script/performance / profiler " require ' config/environment ' "
This is a prelude to my next post , when I present the plugin I ’ve built that takes away over 30 % of overhead from Rails loading time .
Stay tuned ( or subscribe :)
But for now , if you want to try Immutable , clone it from GitHub , or if you have RubyGems 1.2.0 or higher , do this :
1 2 3 4 # Requires RubyGems 1.2.0 + ( or so I 'm told ... ) gem sources -a http://gems.github.com sudo gem install up_the_irons - immutable
Then you can run the example above .
You ’re all set .
See the README for further details .
Enjoy ( or flame me for ruining your monkey patching ) .
But apparently Hollywood ran out of the really good disasters a long time ago , because sometimes they end up using disasters that appear to be just barely more than mild inconveniences .
Such as :
Hollywood loves a good disaster and , let 's face it , the end of the world looks cool as hell on screen .
If you show us a bunch of exploding monuments , we 'll buy a ticket .
5 Volcano

The Disaster :
When the La Brea Tar Pits inexplicably turn into a goddamn volcano , it 's up to a plucky geologist ( Anne Heche ) and a Dedicated Emergency Management director who can't fry up scrambled eggs without injuring himself ( Tommy Lee Jones ) to save Los Angeles from the river of lava now flowing down Wilshire Boulevard .
Why They Should Calm The Hell Down :
After a character points out early in the film that some volcanoes can erupt with the force of a nuclear blast , we find out that , wait , no , the one under LA is really small .
It barely erupts at all , really , just oozes lava down the street .
Here 's the interesting thing about lava :
It 's not very fast .
Wait , did we say interesting ?
We meant boring .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
" Hurry , the lava 's gaining on us , we only have three minutes .
And six hours .
And eleven days . "
Sure , on a particularly steep slope , a lava flow might get up past 6 miles per hour but on more gentle inclines it tends to top off at about 1 / 2 a mile per hour , only slightly faster than a turtle can walk .
So of course the movie has tons of scenes on steep inclines , so the lava can come rushing down on the characters , right ?
Not at all !
They even have a scene where a character sets a basketball on the street to figure out which way the ground is sloping , thus establishing firmly that Wilshire Blvd is the safest place on earth to be in the event of a volcano .

That leaves the screenwriters with the uncomfortable task of trying to find ways to make this easygoing safety hazard more exciting .
So , in one scene , a palm tree catches fire and falls over , conveniently trapping the heroes between an overturned bus and the creeping tide of molten death .
Later , a handful of people on a subway train have to be rescued because not one of them is smart enough to figure out how to use the door on a subway car without outside help .
Finally , the lava breaks several laws of physics to race across town via an underground tunnel and spring out of the middle of the road near Cedar Sinai Hospital , but then it just starts crawling along exactly the way it did on the other side of town .

How They Solve the " Problem " :
How do you re-route a lava flow and send it harmlessly into the ocean ?
Simple :
You blow up a huge fucking building !
Seriously , to save the city from a threat that can be easily out - walked , they topple a large building , killing two people in the process .
If they ever make a sequel , they should save a city from a glacier by burning down an orphanage .
" We 'll build a lava blockade using every available fire truck . "
Most Laughable Brush With " Danger " :
An old lady walks away from the lava that 's engulfing her house , but she left her tiny little dog inside !
The dog , realizing that he's in no danger whatsoever , runs over to the lava and barks at it .

Over the past week the media was gripped by the news that the FBI was about to charge Bruce Ivins , a leading anthrax expert , as the man responsible for the anthrax letter attacks in September / October 2001 .
But despite the seemingly powerful narrative that Ivins committed suicide because investigators were closing in , this is still far from a shut case .
The FBI needs to explain why it zeroed in on Ivins , how he could have made the anthrax mailed to lawmakers and the media , and how he ( or anyone else ) could have pulled off the ...
740,000 - year - old ice wedge is the oldest known ice in North America
Tue , 01 Jan 2008 ANI
London , September 19 ( ANI ) : A new study has determined that a 740,000 - year - old wedge of ice discovered in central Yukon Territory , Canada , is the oldest known ice in North America , thus suggesting that permafrost has survived climates warmer than today's .
" Previously , it was thought that the permafrost had completely disappeared from the interior about 120,000 years ago , " said Duane Froese , an earth scientist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton , Canada , who is the author of the study .
" This deep permafrost appears to have been stable for more than 700,000 years , including several periods that were warmer and wetter , " he added .
According to a report in Nature News , the relict ground ice is located in the Klondike region of the Yukon and was exposed by gold mining in the late 1990s .
Froese first identified the site in 2000 , but assumed at the time that the ice and surrounding permafrost were relatively young .
It was n't until 2005 , when a large rainstorm uncovered a layer of volcanic ash , or tephra , on top of the ice that he and his colleagues were able to estimate its age .
Fission - track dating , which quantified the damage done to the tephra 's glassy particles by the decay of the uranium and other radioactive materials they contain , put the ash's age between 680,000 and 800,000 years .
" Based on the exposure , the ash is above the ice and it seems to be a valid date , " said Jim Beget , a tephra expert at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks , who visited the site in 2005 .
If the finding is corroborated and other similar sites are identified , climate modellers could use the information to improve their understanding of permafrost dynamics under warmer scenarios .
Earlier calculations estimated that 48 billion tonnes of carbon could be released from Canadian permafrost over the twenty - first century if the mean annual temperature increased by 4 degree Celsius .
The old - ice finding suggests that some pockets of permafrost may be more resilient to climate change .
According to Vladimir Romanovsky , a geophysicist who is also at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks , " But it does n't mean that we should n't expect very severe changes in permafrost if this predicted warming does happen . "

THE MILITARIZATION OF THE AMERICAN POLICE By Greg Evensen August 13 , 2006 NewsWithViews.com
As a former state police trooper , I can state emphatically , that I oppose the move away from local policing to a heavily armed ï¿½national ï¿½ quasi-military police force policy .
You need look no further than New Orleans after Katrina .
You could watch California Highway Patrol officers and many out of state police agencies going door to door , disarming innocent civilians .
Police officers were on a mission to confiscate firearms from people trying to protect themselves .
Observing this , was to incite a first class riot in my home .
It was bad enough to watch these poor , helpless , but courageous civilians , trying to defend themselves against criminals who spoke ï¿ ½Ebonicsï¿½ and Spanish .
It was horrendous to watch the suffering of old men and women abandoned by families or simply unable to leave before the storm hit .
But it was absolutely heartbreaking to see beefy , skin - headed officers prying shotguns out of the hands of men and women whose only ï¿½crimeï¿½ was that they tried to keep themselves alive while the ï¿½officers ï¿½ could not be found .
We have become accustomed to standing quietly on the sidelines while our local police Chiefs and Sheriffs have accepted huge amounts of federal dollars and military equipment for their special response units .
They are all under a variety of mission specific names and classified standing orders .
Once they take the cash however , they are handcuffed to the Feds for whatever future ï¿½missionï¿½ they may be assigned .
It could come from some whacked out Special Agent from the ABC Bureau who dreamed up a little publicity ( like Waco ) and / or a ï¿½show of forceï¿½ to keep the natives in line .
This is to soften up the American public in case they held thoughts of fending for themselves or decisively telling these servants that they werenï¿½t needed , thank you .
But then , a well armed citizenry doesnï¿½t fit the UN model of a disarmed nation bowing before the machine - gun toting black clad soldiers of the Omaha , Atlanta or Dayton police departments .
Letï¿½s see , black uniforms , coal bucket style helmets , machine - guns at every corner .
Hmm , looks like Berlin in 1942 ?
The excuse being used for starting , equipping and using these ï¿½teamsï¿½ is that we are under siege and cannot let common criminals ( 99.65 % of the unlawful element in society ) take down our cities .
Criminals and gangs have already done that .
The only effective deterrent is citizens carrying concealed weapons with permits .
Statistically 2 - 5 % of crimes in progress never see a police officer .
The beat cop arrives to take a report , afterwards .
The other 35 % of the safety and security issue in the USA is found in terrorist sleeper cells and devotees of world class Jihadï¿½s .
These are thugs truly worth special response teams from an agency that will find and destroy these efforts before they trigger the BIG blast .
I simply do not understand the thinking of upper level criminal justice system directors who have not recently , if ever , read their US or state constitution .
This is especially true in regard to the publicï¿½s right to privacy and self - protection .
Issues regarding the 2nd amendment , due process , limited government , and how far we have strayed from the Founderï¿½s beliefs abound .
They are well known and I will not opine about them here .
Suffice it to say that as a nation , we have stood by while the police forces of the USA have become a force that projects intimidation , fear from the community , and a reputation for excessive force .
Regardless of the needed response , it makes even routine contact with the public a major ordeal .
Now understand , I have not had my head in my uttermost parts during the past several years .
I know that the world is a changed and dangerous place .
The world has ALWAYS been a dangerous place .
However , I simply do not believe that even if local terrorism erupted tomorrow , we would somehow be better off in our wounded cities by the presence of the Anchorage PD in Detroit .
Instead of hyper - reliance on anything state or fed , we should be equipping ourselves and our local neighborhoods for dealing with major security and safety issues on the model of Switzerland and Israel .
Any major event is going to see an immediate breakdown of law and order .
Officers normally committed to protecting the public , could be out of action from injury , death or an overwhelming desire to protect their own families .
There could well be an absence of police leadership at all levels .
If we are anticipating the New Orleans example , we will see rogue officers make the common criminal seem like an old lost friend .
My point is this .
As a nation , we have lost our way on many fronts from the wisdom of our Republic builderï¿½s dreams for a free , independent and courageous American nation .
Most citizens are able to handle most crises situations fairly well .
What ever happened to local ï¿ ½Peace Officers ?ï¿½
You remember .
The cop everyone knew , liked and respected because of his courage , devotion to duty and the citizens of his / her community .
We are moving daily toward reviving the demons of the Waffen SS .
This MUST stop .
We have become nursery school children herded by our ï¿½parentï¿½ government to rely on WHATEVER is said by WHOEVER says it , and you WILL obey , or else !
In all fairness , and to my many friends in law enforcement who know what I am saying is accurate , I appreciate each of you for a job well done .
You are not the problem .
You are the solution .
Stay true to your oath .
If many Americans like a militarized police state future they may well get it .
For me , that is not acceptable .
I choose to work toward my destiny and that of a free America within the constitution , for sure .
I prefer an American future without the unconstitutional agencies , laws , judgeï¿½s rulings , and decrees from many treasonous bureaucrats .
We donï¿½t need threats and intimidation from goons masquerading as local and state lawmakers or brain - washed , gun-toting morons like the New Orleans Chief of Police .
He is the one who ordered honest civilians to surrender their lawful weapons in the face of gangs , to a living hell on earth .
There are many more like him , waiting to impose police dictatorships , just because they can .
The time is coming fast , when millions of Americans who understand what this colossal struggle is all about in the United States and around the world , have severe choices that will be required to be made .
The UN will not simply allow the US to continue as a sovereign nation when the rest of the world is under its domination .
That is not paranoia .
That is simply the deduction one gets from understanding the UN ï¿½s published plans .
Your future actions will determine whether you will go to the re-education camp , or the internment camp for ï¿½troublemakers ï¿½ ( read that constitution supporters ) .
Did you really believe that those ï¿½conservative ï¿½ republicans and ï¿½little guyï¿½ protecting democrats were going to keep you from harm ?
Remember this , they are the ones who allowed this situation to occur and wrote the laws that permit it to continue unabated with avengence .

Since the approval of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccine Gardasil in June 2006 , 28 cases have been reported of pregnant women miscarrying after receiving the vaccine .
Saying that this miscarriage rate is no different than that of the general population , the FDA has said that it will not call for further investigations into the drug 's safety .
The miscarriage reports come from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) , which contains raw data about any event that occurs after taking a medication that might be related to use of the drug .
Gardasil , produced by Merck , protects against two strains of HPV that have been identified as responsible for 70 percent of cervical cancer cases , plus two strains that cause 90 percent of genital warts .
A total of 3,461 negative reactions after taking Gardasil were reported to the database , including eight deaths .
Of the 28 reported miscarriages , several were listed as cause unknown , leading a federal investigator to say that one of these , at least , " may have been caused by Gardasil because the patient received the injection within 30 days of the pregnancy .
"
In clinical trials conducted by Merck , the number of women who had miscarriages after being given the vaccine was not significantly different than the number among those given a placebo .
In addition , the company points to studies on rats in which 300 times the human dose failed to produce reproductive effects .
But the company 's literature on the drug says , " It is not known whether Gardasil should be given to pregnant women .
" Three U.S. states have passed laws mandating HPV vaccines for school - age girls , and 38 other states have considered similar laws .
The American College of Pediatrics and " New England Journal of Medicine , " however , have opposed mandatory vaccination with Gardasil .
Saisie par un salarié d'un supermarché Wal - Mart au Mexique , la Cour suprême de ce pays a dénoncé , jeudi 4 septembre , les pratiques de la chaîne américaine .
La plus haute juridiction mexicaine a annulé une convention établie au sein de Wal - Mart qui prévoyait le paiement d'une partie des salaires des employés en bons d'achat utilisables seulement dans les supermarchés de la chaîne , explique le quotidien mexicain La Jornada .
Les juges ont considéré que cette pratique des bons d'achat est " similaire à celle qui était en vigueur dans les anciennes " tiendas de raya " des haciendas " : ces magasins qui appartenaient au propriétaire de l'exploitation et où les journaliers étaient contraints d'effectuer leurs achats .
Dans ces boutiques qui existaient au XIXe siècle en Amérique du Sud , mais aussi aux Etats - Unis et en Europe , dans les mines notamment , " les travailleurs recevaient aussi le paiement de leur salaire en bons d'achat échangés dans les établissements dont leur patron était propriétaire , avec cette différence qu'ils payaient les produits à un prix élevé " , a poursuivi la Cour à propos de ce système aboli par la Constitution mexicaine de 1917 .
Reste que " les deux cas sont semblables , puisque le coût de ces escomptes ne sont pas assumés par le patron , mais par le travailleur " , ont conclu les juges .
Wal - Mart a déjà connu plusieurs procédures pour violation du droit du travail .
En 2005 , l'entreprise avait été notamment condamnée par la justice américaine pour avoir refusé à ses employés de prendre une pause à l'heure du déjeuner .

The Taleban dynamited the Buddha statues in 2001
A giant statue of a Buddha has been discovered in central Afghanistan , near to the ruins of the world - famous Bamiyan Buddhas .
Archaeologists say the 19 m ( 62ft ) statue is in a sleeping position and dates back to the Third Century .
Other relics such as coins and ceramics were also found .
The Taleban blew up two giant standing Buddhas carved into the mountainside at Bamiyan - once a thriving centre of Buddhism - in 2001 .
The statues , the tallest such standing Buddhas in the world at the time , were considered by the Taleban to be un-Islamic representations of the human form .
Archaeologists are working on restoring the larger of the two Buddhas in a project that is expected to take a decade .

A local official in Bamiyan said the newly found statue had been badly damaged , but some parts of it , such as the neck and right hand , were in a good condition .
He said measures were being taken to protect it , and it was hoped the statue would go on public display next year .
The latest find gives hope to archaeologists searching for a 300 m long statue recorded by a Chinese pilgrim centuries ago .
Iconic Buddhist art works , now thought to be the oldest oil paintings in the world , have also been found in the caves at Bamiyan .

Summary
How do you program a multicore computer ?
Easy - do it in Erlang .
Erlang is a concurrent functional programming language designed for programming fault - tolerant systems .
With share - nothing semantics and pure message passing , Erlang programs scales on multicore computers .
In this talk , Joe introduces Erlang , the ideas of Concurrent Oriented Programming and commercial applications written in Erlang .
Bio Joe Armstrong is the principal inventor of Erlang and coined the term " Concurrency Oriented Programming " .
At Ericsson he developed Erlang and was chief architect of the Erlang / OTP system .
In 1998 he formed Bluetail , which developed all its products in Erlang .
In 2003 he obtain his PhD from the Royal Institute of Technology , Stockholm .
He is author of the book " Software for a concurrent world " .
About the conference JAOO is the premier European developer conference on software technology , methods and best practices .
The conference presents in - depth presentations and tutorials by researchers , engineers and trend - setters in software engineering and technology .
About the author
( NewsTarget ) According to documents released on Thursday , July 17 , 2008 , undercover state troopers in Maryland infiltrated at least three groups peacefully protesting the death penalty and advocating peace .
These troopers illegally sent reports of the activities of these groups to U.S. intelligence and military agencies .
The Maryland chapter of the ACLU was able to obtain these documents through a Freedom of Information lawsuit claiming the state police refused to release the documents proving they illegally spied on peace activists .
This illegal , clandestine reporting occurred from March 2005 to May 2006 .
The officers involved used false names or " covert identities " to open special email accounts in order to receive messages from the groups .
They participated fully in these groups , attending meetings and protests .
Within these 46 pages of documents is an account of an activist 's name being entered into a federal database of This particular database is termed HIDTA for the ( Washington - Baltimore ) High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area and was formed to enable local , state and federal law - enforcement agencies to share information on such suspects .
Activist Max Obuszewski , whose only " crime " was opposition of the death penalty was listed in the database as a terrorist .
His " primary " crime was " terrorism - anti - government " with a secondary crime of " terrorism - anti- war protesters " .
According to ACLU attorney David Rocah , federal laws prohibit departments that receive federal funds from maintaining databases of political activities and affiliations and state police violated these laws .
Mr. Rocah stated :
He called the surveillance " Kafka - esque insanity .
"
The unlawful surveillance of Mr. Obuszewski and his group , Pledge of Resistance - Baltimore , was exposed during his trial for trespass and disorderly conduct in a 2004 protest outside the National Security Agency 's headquarters in Fort Meade , Maryland .
These documents indicate that the undercover state troopers from Maryland 's Homeland Security and Intelligence Division infiltrated 3 groups .
These include Mr. Obuszewski's group : the Coalition to End the Death Penalty ; and the Committee to Save Vernon Evans , a murderer slated for execution .
These pages highlight at least 288 hours of surveillance .
Officers attended at least 20 meetings and a dozen rallies against the death penalty .
Some of these rallies took place at the SuperMax jail in Baltimore .
The documents reference a proposed sit-in at the offices of Baltimore County State 's Attorney Sandra A. O'Connor .
They containreports of violence or even any threat of violence .
In fact , they show how the organizers repeatedly stressed the importance of peaceful and orderly demonstrations .
A report about a demonstration at the jail contains the following : " There were about 75 - 80 protesters at the rally and none participated in any type of civil disobedience or illegal acts .
Protesters were even careful to move out of the way for Division of Correction employees who were going into the parking lot for work .
"
Even though these meetings and protests were carried out peacefully and in full compliance with all laws , the information about the protesters and their activities was sent to seven agencies , including the National Security Agency and an unnamed military intelligence official .
" Americans have the right to peaceably assemble with others of a like mind and speak out about what they believe in , " Mr. Rocah said .
" For state agencies to spend hundreds of hours entering information about lawful and peaceful political activities into a criminal database is beyond unconscionable .
It is a waste of taxpayer dollars , which does nothing to make us safer from actual terrorists or drug dealers .
" When I first read this article , I was completely appalled .
The inferences for all of us are huge .
Are we already living in a police state ?
Are all of us reading this , because we are non-conformists , targeted and in terrorist databases ?
Patty Donovan was in a wheelchair and could only walk around her house with a cane .
She was on over 20 medications .
When told to " take the morphine , get in the wheelchair and learn to live with it " by a neurosurgeon , she knew her life had to change .
She is now almost a fanatic when it comes to healing through the use of " whole foods " and and natural remedies .
Since that time , she has spent countless hours researching nutrtion and alternative health .
After spending 30 years in the allopathic health care industry in both pharmacy and as an RN , she brings a unique perspective to Natural News readers .
Since committing to this new life style , she no longer uses even a cane , has gotten off over 20 medications , lost over 50 lbs and returned to work .
Robin Leach is n’t your usual political pundit .
But the former champagne - toasting host of the TV hit of the mid-'80s to mid-'90s , " Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous , " may be more qualified than most to opine on John McCain 's now - infamous inability to remember how many homes he owns .
In an early morning phone call Friday from his fabulous crib in Las Vegas , Leach told The Times that he is n’t really surprised at McCain 's odd memory lapse given the complex lives that the super - rich lead .
" He probably was confused as to which homes are in his name , his wife 's name , or corporate names , " Leach explained in his familiar , deep British baritone .
" In his attempt to be honest , he put his foot in his mouth . "
Indeed , McCain ’s four homes and at least four other residential properties are held in the name of his wife , Cindy , and her dependent children through a series of partnerships and trusts .
Their combined value is nearly $ 14 million .
Leach said McCain " tends to answer questions very rapidly without thinking of the correct answers .
... I would call it honest confusion . "
The British - born Leach is n't a U.S. citizen and thus can't vote .
But for a man famous for focusing on froth , he took a serious view of America 's latest political fracas .
" This has nothing to do with the issues candidates should be discussing , " he said .
" Let ’s talk about real things , not silly things .
It ’s irrelevant whether the future president has one home or ten . "
" It ’s nothing to get into a kerfuffle about , " he added .
" It ’s silly and ridiculous . "
As host of " Lifestyles , " Leach served as an always - enthusiastic tour guide to the extravagant homes of wealthy entertainers , athletes and business moguls .
He ended each segment with his signature sign - off : " Champagne wishes and caviar dreams ! "
Now 66 , Leach writes books and a blog , travels widely , and owns an HDTV studio in Las Vegas .

We have encouraged our readers to participate in a contest by designing beautiful and creative horizontal lines .
It was necessary , since this design - element was slowly disappearing and was often neglected in web design .
But it is going to change now .
We have received 1290 images and source - files from 384 designers across the globe .
The result is an impressive collection of horizontal lines that designers can use for free without any restrictions whatsoever .
What is < hr />?
Basically , it is an old HTML - tag which has been used since the very beginning of the Web .
hr stands for the horizontal rule and represents exactly what you would expect — a horizontal line or a horizontal divider .
By default , web browsers render hr as a simple horizontal line .
In terms of semantics the tag is supposed to clearly separate content blocks .
This is often used in design of footers , but also makes sense in other situations — for instance , if you want to separate two blog posts or make the divisions within the content structure sharper .
However , the design of horizontal lines is quite simple and not really appealing by default .
HTML offers designers four styling attributes : align , noshade , width and size .
This is the reason why designers often use CSS to make hr ’s look a little bit more attractive .
Alternatively , one can replace hr ’s completely with an image using the background - property in CSS .
Some designers consider horizontal rule to be unnecessary — after all , you can simple assign some border styling to the container which contains the block .
However , hr ’s offer more possibilities as you can do whatever you want with a single , standalone HTML - tag .
And here is where our contest comes into play .

Here is the BIG Gallery of < hr >- Graphics .
Some ideas were more popular than the other ones .
For instance , a zipper , flowers and ornaments , pencils , Pac - Man , birds , scissors .
You can see almost everything from geometrics designs to oriental designs .
Our smashing readers show that even a small tiny line can become a piece of art .
For some users it may be too much , but here the idea counts most .
And you can use as a starting point for horizontal lines in your projects .
Or you can use some minimalistic designs .
Most designs were black / white , and few of them were pretty colorful .

The ideas behind my 3 designs are mainly fresh and happy colours , while I love fresh colours .
And I ’m sure lots of other also does .
But also 2 of them are a little unusual , and would fit nicely in a creative blog ( in my opinion )

I love to experiment and explore the astounding features of Photoshop .
In my green hr entry , I tried using pen tool to create bent vectors and combine it with other objects to see what ’s the outcome .
In my black entry , I just tried to make it simple and elegant by creating circles , lines and label it with binary code .
I think it looks boring but it ’s simple and clean , perfect for websites and blogs that want simple and clean horizontal divider .

I was eager to try out some recently learned techniques in Photoshop .
I ’ve been falling for patterns and textures , and fine brush details .
Heather van de Mark HR Ransom - Cutout letters create an hr divider that is funky and original .
It is an array of colors and yet they all complement each other .
This is definitely for an alternative blog / web site with humor and edge .
I created multiple different backgrounds with jagged edges , so it looks as if they really came from the printed page .
The graphic can easily be manipulated to cut the divider to make it longer or shorter or to rearrange the letter order .
I did n’t want it to spell anything because that would be distracting .

Ardy I have designed the HR keeping in mind the theme of nature and subtle relaxing ideas ( duck in water , clouds , leaves , etc ) .
I feel that these break the monotony of using typical HRs with straight lines .
The colors used are also soft and comforting to the latest in designs .
I hope you like them .
We might plan on making use of the ‘ cloudy HR ’ within our own website which is currently undergoing major revamping .

After doing some research on web standards , I was surprised that none of the sites I found actually included code to create a visual representation of the topic of “ web standards ” .
I imagine it would be easy to work with the text used to code a site for design purposes ( for instance , using the text “ div ” in the background of divs ) .
This hr is a start to realize this approach .

Phoenix data suggests perchlorates in Mars soil
BY WILLIAM HARWOOD
STORY WRITTEN FOR CBS NEWS " SPACE PLACE " & USED WITH PERMISSION
Posted : August 5 , 2008
An instrument aboard NASA 's Phoenix Mars lander has detected what may be perchlorate in the soil of the red planet 's northern latitudes , an unexpected , still tentative discovery that has touched off a flurry of speculation about whether Mars is now , or has ever been , habitable .
While highly oxidizing perchlorates can be toxic , some terrestrial plants thrive on the compound and its presence on Mars would not confirm or challenge the planet 's overall habitability , either now or in the distant past , scientists said today .
" We have substantial evidence that our soil samples contain perchlorate , that 's chlorine with four oxygen ( atoms ) , " said Peter Smith , the manager of the Phoenix lander project at the University of Arizona .
" On the Earth , perchlorates are found in the Atacama Desert�in Chile in association with nitrates that are mined for fertilizer .
The desert is a hyper - arid environment that rarely sees rain and has no vascular plants .
It is often used by scientists , as a matter of fact , as a martian analogue site .
" These compounds are quite stable in soil and water and do not destroy organic materials under normal circumstances .
In fact , there are species of perchlorate - reducing microbes that live on the energy provided by this oxidant .
Therefore , this is an important piece in the puzzle as we attempt to determine if habitable conditions exist for microbes on Mars .
In itself , it is neither good nor bad for life . "
Either way , Smith said , the results have not yet been confirmed by a second instrument aboard the Phoenix lander .
And while perchlorate is defined as a toxic compound " with powerful oxidizing properties , " it is too early to draw any conclusions about the habitability of the landing zone or of Mars in general based on data from Phoenix .
" How this perchlorate in the soil affects habitability is a complex question that we certainly do n't have the final answer on , " Smith said .
" It is a very stable material , it 's not likely to tear apart organic materials unless you heat it to very high temperatures .
It really does n't limit us in our search for habitability in this icy soil .
And if we were lucky enough to see some organic signatures ( in future soil samples ) , it would not be a huge surprise to think they were co-existing with perchlorate . "
The Phoenix lander is not equipped with instruments capable of direct detection of life .
But by analyzing the chemical makeup of soil near now - confirmed ice deposits , scientists hope to draw conclusions about the past and present habitability of the red planet .
That data , in turn , will help NASA planners select landing sites and experiments for future missions .
During a news conference last week , Phoenix scientists reported confirmation that ice has been found in the soil near the lander .
That was not a surprise given earlier photographs from the lander that showed what appeared to be ice sublimating and vanishing in sunlight .
But in a subsequent story , Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine , quoting sources , reported the White House Presidential Science Advisor 's office had been briefed on a new discovery concerning the habitability of Mars .
The story did not say whether those results supported or challenged habitability .
A NASA spokesman said today the agency had not briefed the White House at that time .
But NASA apparently received enough enquiries from the news media in the wake of the Aviation Week story to warrant a follow - up teleconference today to discuss the issue .
" We are here today to announce a non-announcement , " said Michael Meyer , chief scientist of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA headquarters .
" More experiments and time are needed to resolve the interesting findings from the soil chemistry . "
Smith described the teleconference as " an unusual step and break with scientific tradition . "
" Today we 're opening a window into the project to allow the public to see our scientific process in action , " he said .
" Tradition has been bypassed because of the extreme interest that has been exhibited toward Phoenix ... in our search for a habitable environment on the northern plains on Mars .
" Rather than the speculation that has become rampant on the web , I promise you insight into the investigations that are underway inside the operations center .
However , I must caution you that we have not completed our process and ... we 're about halfway through the data collection phase . "
Asked repeatedly about the potential implications of perchlorates if , in fact , the presence of the compound in one or more forms is confirmed , Phoenix officials said they simply did not know .
" I can say they could potentially keep a lot of graduate students busy for a long period fo time , " said Michael Hecht , science lead for the Microscopy , Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer , or MECA , instrument .
Over the past few weeks , two soil samples have been analyzed by MECA 's wet chemistry laboratory .
Results indicate the possible presence of perchlorate in the soil .
Another instrument , called the Thermal and Evolved - Gas Analyzer , or TEGA , uses small ovens to bake out and " sniff " soil constituents .
Scientists are still analyzing data from TEGA to find out if it , too , detected perchlorate .
Along with analyzing data from the MECA and TEGA instruments , the Phoenix team also is working to make sure the spacecraft did not somehow introduce perchlorate , a component of solid rocket propellant , into the martian environment .
" So why all the excitement because our chlorine atoms are surrounded by a few more oxygen atoms than expected ? " asked Hecht .
" Well , in part , because as scientists we 're fascinated by things like that .
That 's why we had trouble getting dates in high school .
But mostly it 's because different types of perchlorate salts have interesting properties that may bear on the way things work on Mars if - and that 's a really big if - the results from our little teaspoon full of soil are representative of the whole planet or even significant portions of the whole planet . "
He said perchlorates would affect " many things , from how land forms to whether in the distant pass there ever was precipitation . "
" There are widespread implications and they may all turn out to be nothing , or they may turn out to be very important , " Hecht said .
" It 's just that this has opened up a whole new research chapter for us .
We could talk about any one of those potential applications at length , I think we are not ready to do so yet . "

Update Friday , 8/15 , 8:05 p.m. ET : Bigfoot Turns Out to Be an Opossum ( the story below remains as originally written ) .
Two Georgia men claim to have found in the northern woods of that state something that has been often reported but never proven to exist : a Bigfoot .
They say they have a body , photos of the body , and DNA evidence — some or all of which will be revealed this Friday , Aug. 15 , at a press conference in Palo Alto , Calif .
If the group does have a Bigfoot carcass ( and if they actually show the body , instead merely displaying photographs of a supposed body ) , then perhaps scientists will take note .
Still , it 's not clear how , exactly , the group will prove that what they have is a Bigfoot .
Because there is no comparison specimen , there is no DNA analysis that can definitively identify Bigfoot tissue .
Readers may recall the much - hyped press conference held on May 30 , where a man claimed he would provide " definitive proof " of alien visitation .
His " proof " turned out to be a short fuzzy video clip of what he said was an alien head outside his window trying to ogle his teen daughters .
Needless to say , top scientists were not awestruck by his evidence .
History repeats ?
This is not the first time a Bigfoot body has been claimed to have been found .
A man named Tom Biscardi , founder of something called the Great American Bigfoot Research Organization , once claimed he had captured a Bigfoot .
On Aug. 19 , 2005 , Biscardi appeared on the radio show " Coast to Coast with George Noory . "
Biscardi claimed his group had captured a Bigfoot a week earlier , a male beast that weighed over 400 pounds and stood 8 - feet tall .
He said he would be presenting photos of it several days later .
It turned out to be a hoax .
Interestingly , Biscardi is also involved in the new Bigfoot body discovery .
Speaking on behalf of the Georgia men this week , Biscardi said , " Extensive scientific studies will be done on the body by a team of scientists including a molecular biologist , an anthropologist , a paleontologist and other scientists over the next few months at an undisclosed location " under armed guard .
If it all sounds very cloak - and - dagger , it is .
Unnamed experts ?
Undisclosed location ?
Sounds more like " The X - Files " than real science .
Marketing scheme ?
In 2005 , Biscardi promoted a pay - per - view cable TV show in which he offered viewers the chance to see a Bigfoot captured on live television for only $ 59.95 .
That never happened , but Biscardi did recently direct and produce a film called " Bigfoot Lives . "
Surely the publicity from this press conference might boost his film 's sales …
Bigfoot researcher Loren Coleman , while stopping short of authenticating the claims , wrote on the Web site Cryptomundo.com , " I feel , in all honesty , this , indeed , may be the real deal , and I say this carefully after reviewing information that has been shared privately with me . "
So has a Bigfoot finally been found , after all these years ?
Or is this just the latest hoax to embarrass Bigfoot believers and bring further ridicule to a field sorely in need of science ?
Apparently we will see .
Benjamin Radford is managing editor of the Skeptical Inquirer science magazine .
He has investigated Bigfoot , lake monsters , and other mysterious creatures for over a decade .
His latest book is " Lake Monster Mysteries : Investigating the World 's Most Elusive Creatures . "
This and other books can be found on his website .
The oral argument before the Supreme Court is fascinating to hear .
Alexander Bickel , the Times ' lawyer , appears as something of a waffler , conceding ground to the government that the Post 's attorney , William Glendon , hastens to recover .
For example , Bickel makes much of the absence of a specific statute passed by Congress to allow prior restraint : " I have conceded , for the purposes of this argument , that some limitations , some impairment of the absoluteness of that prohibition [ the First Amendment ] is possible , and I argue that , whatever that may be , it is surely at its very least when the President acts without statutory authority . " ( p. 49 of the transcript ) One Justice comments , " That is a very strange argument for the Times to be making .
The Congress can make all this illegal by passing laws . "
Justice Stewart ( p. 45 ) asks what Glendon has called a " miserable , brilliant " hypothetical :
What if the disclosure " would result in the sentencing to death of a hundred young men whose only offense had been that they were nineteen years old and had low draft numbers . "
Bickel fumbles : " I wish there were a statute that covered it . " ( p. 46 ) Glendon , in contrast , points out : " The government has not yet brought anything like that case to your Honors , nothing like that .
What we have heard , your Honor , is much more in the nature of conjecture and surmise . " ( p. 54 ) Interestingly , Solicitor General Erwin Griswold conceded a great deal when he highlighted the government 's willingness to do an expedited declassification review of the Pentagon Papers , in " a minimum of 45 days . "
Griswold allowed as how " There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that there has been as long as I can remember , which is quite a while , massive over - classification of materials , and there has been much too slow review to provide declassification . " ( p. 22 of the transcript )
But at the same time , Griswold endeavored to convince the Court that 11 specific items in the Pentagon Papers would cause " great and irreparable harm to the security of the United States " ( p. 30 ) Griswold went on to say , " I have n't the slightest doubt myself that the material which has already been published and the publication of the other materials affects American lives and is a thoroughly serious matter .
I think to say that it can only be enjoined if there will be a war tomorrow morning , when there is a war now going on , is much too narrow . " ( p. 31 ) Some 28 years after these arguments , Griswold recanted his entire position in an op - ed published in the Washington Post ( " Secrets Not Worth Keeping : The Courts and Classified Information , " 15 February 1989 , p. A25 ) : " I have never seen any trace of a threat to the national security from the publication .
Indeed , I have never seen it even suggested that there was such an actual threat .
It quickly becomes apparent to any person who has consideration experience with classified material that there is massive overclassification and that the principal concern of the classifiers is not with national security , but rather with governmental embarrassment of one sort or another .
There may be some basis for short - term classification while plans are being made , or negotiations are going on , but apart from details of weapons systems , there is very rarely any real risk to current national security from the publication of facts relating to transactions in the past , even the fairly recent past .
This is the lesson of the Pentagon Papers experience , and it may be relevant now . "
The only mystery after the oral argument was how the Court 's center would vote .
Chief Justice Burger , along with Justices Harlan and Blackmun , supported the government 's position .
Justices Black , Douglas , Brennan and Marshall opposed the government 's claim .
In effect , then , the swing votes were Justices Stewart and White .
Their two opinions 
Stewart 's with White , and White separately  are worth close attention , because both assumed that real damage would result from publication of the Pentagon Papers , yet they refused to countenance prior restraint on publication , given the First Amendment 's protection of the press .
For example , Justice
White wrote in his separate opinion : " I do not say that in no circumstances would the First Amendment permit an injunction against publishing information about government plans or operations .
Nor , after examining the materials the Government characterizes as the most sensitive and destructive , can I deny that revelation of these documents will do substantial harm to public interests .
Indeed , I am confident that their disclosure will have that result .
But I nevertheless agree that the United States has not satisfied the very heavy burden that it must meet to warrant an injunction against publication in these cases . "
White then went on in his opinion to explore , even encourage , the criminal prosecution of the Times and the Post on grounds of violating several sections of the Criminal Code .
White specifically cited section 793(e ) of 18 U.S.C. , on unauthorized possession of a document relating to the national defense , as well as sections 797 ( graphical representations of military installations ) and 798 ( code and cryptographic information ) , and wrote : " I would have no difficulty in sustaining convictions under these sections on facts that would not justify the imposition of a prior restraint . "
This , of course , is exactly the route taken by the Department of Justice in prosecuting and convicting Navy analyst Samuel Morison in the early 1980s , for leaking a U.S. satellite photo of a Soviet aircraft carrier to a London publication .
Morison was subsequently pardoned by President Clinton in January 2001 .
Justice Stewart 's opinion , joined by White , set the standard for what the Supreme Court would countenance for national security - based restrictions on press freedom  disclosure must " surely result in direct , immediate , and irreparable harm to our Nation , or its people . "
Stewart wrote : " We are asked , quite simply , to prevent the publication by two newspapers of material that the Executive Branch insists should not , in the national interest , be published .
I am convinced that the Executive is correct with respect to some of the documents involved .
But I cannot say that disclosure of any of them will surely result in direct , immediate , and irreparable harm to our Nation , or its people .
That being so , there can under the First Amendment be but one judicial resolution of the issues before us . "
Stewart 's opinion offers profound insights even today , given Congress 's approval last year ( and President Clinton 's veto ) of a bill criminalizing leaks of any " properly classified " information  in effect , an official secrets act .
Justice Stewart described Executive power over security classification , and the uneasy balance between the values of democratic governance and Executive claims of confidentiality in matters of diplomacy and defense .
Stewart wrote : " In the absence of the governmental checks and balances present in other areas of our national life , the only effective restraint upon executive policy and power in the areas of national defense and international affairs may lie in an enlightened citizenry  in an informed and critical public opinion which alone can here protect the values of democratic government . "
Stewart described Executive power over internal security as " an awesome responsibility , requiring judgment and wisdom of a high order .
I should suppose that moral , political , and practical considerations would dictate that a very first principle of that wisdom would be an insistence upon avoiding secrecy for its own sake .
For when everything is classified , then nothing is classified , and the system becomes one to be disregarded by the cynical or the careless , and to be manipulated by those intent on self protection or self - promotion .
I should suppose , in short , that the hallmark of a truly effective internal security system would be the maximum possible disclosure , recognizing that secrecy can best be preserved only when credibility is truly maintained . "

By Giles Ji Ungpakorn
September 2 , 2008 , Bangkok --
For the past two or more years , especially since the September 2006 coup , Thai society has been hypnotised into forgetting about the real social and political issues .
Instead , the whole of society and , most tragically , the social movements have been entranced by a fight between two factions of the Thai ruling class .
On the one side are the deposed Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his disbanded Thai Rak Thai Party , its successor the Peoples Power Party government of Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej .
Opposing them are a loose collection of authoritarian royalists comprising the People ’s Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) , the pro-coup royalist military , the pro-coup judiciary and the Democrat Party .
The authoritarian royalists are not a unified body .
They only share a collective interest in wiping out Thaksin ’s party .
The two sides mirror each other .
Both are firmly in the camp of the Thai capitalist elite .
They both are nationalistic and are prepared to abuse human rights .
While the Thaksin government and Samak ’s Peoples Power government support extrajudicial killings and a hard - line murderous position on the Muslim insurrection in the south , the opposing side cares little about such killings and counts the former Thai commando and assassin who took part in several coups and is called the butcher of Krue Sae Mosque , where Muslims were massacred , among its leadership .
Both factions are associated with people who have a record of corruption .
It is common knowledge that all Thai politicians are engaged in corrupt practices , whether legal or illegal .
The military have a long record of corruption and the 2006 junta was no exception .
After the illegal coup in 2006 , the military themselves to boards of state enterprises and forced through increased military spending .
Yet the courts have clearly been used to single out Thaksin ’s faction on corruption and “ abuse of power ” charges .
While Thaksin was still in power , the courts bent to his wishes .
There is no justice in Thailand .
The judiciary are not accountable to the electorate and always support the rich and powerful .
In labour courts they always rule against trade unions .
No jury system exists in Thailand .
There are differences between the two factions .
While the Thaksin faction is committed to its strategy of winning power by elections , parliamentary democracy and money politics , the PAD and its friends are in favour of military coups , reducing the number of elected parliamentarians and senators , and increasing the power of unelected bureaucrats and the army .
The justification for this is the belief that the poor majority of Thailand are too stupid to be given the vote .
The PAD faction are also fanatical royalists .
They want a new coup and were happy to whip up hatred of Cambodia and risk a war over an ancient Khmer temple .
The PAD strategy , as outlined by Pipop Thongchai , a core leader of the party , is to create enough political chaos that institutions and parties are destroyed and a “ new order ” arises from the ashes .
Needless to say , this new order will not be democratic nor committed to social justice and equality .
In terms of economic policy , the Thaksin faction try to use a dual - track strategy of mixing neo-liberalism with grassroots Keynesianism .
They believe that the poor must not be left out and have a record of real pro-poor policies such as the health care scheme .
However , they are not remotely socialist and are against taxing the rich and building a welfare state .
The PAD / Democrats / royalists are hard - line monetarists .
They propose interest rate hikes to cut spending on the poor and to squeeze wages .
The Thai king is one of the richest monarchs in the world and he supports this economic policy and has also advocated the “ sufficiency economy ” in which everyone needs to curb their spending according to their means .
Income redistribution is ruled out .
That is why the poor have consistently voted for the Thaksin faction .
The major reason why democracy and social justice have fallen off the political agenda into the stinking canals of Bangkok is the total disarray of the social movements , NGO networks and trade unions .
After the collapse of the Communist Party in the mid-1980s , the new slogan of the people 's movements was “ the answer is in the villages ” .
This was an NGO strategy to turn to rural development along single - issue lines .
The slogan reflected a respect for villagers which contrasted greatly with the attitude of the government .
Now the slogan of those people ’s movement networks supporting the PAD has changed to “ the villagers are stupid and do n’t deserve the vote ! ” , “ the answer is with the military , courts and the king ” .
Sections of the NGO - Coordinating Committee , some Thai staff in Focus on Global South , HIV + networks , Friends of the People and some farmer groups have lined up to support the PAD and the demand to decrease democracy .
The Railway Workers Union and the Thai Airways union have also shown support .
The rail union leaders have never campaigned for hundreds of rail employees who have been on temporary contracts without welfare for decades .
The Thai Airways union has ignored military corruption in the airline and in the Airports Authority .
Both unions have turned their backs on serious attacks on trade unions in the private sector and are only prepared to take action when people in high places give them the green light .
Other activists who cannot stand the PAD have allowed themselves to be pulled into supporting the government .
This is just as bad as those supporting the PAD .
Some have even cheered when the police tried to break up PAD protests .
The lack of independent class politics in the Thai peoples ’ movement is a result of years of rejecting overall “ politics ” and “ political organisation ” .
It is a result of the anarchistic ideas that were popular after the collapse of the Communist Party , a reaction to the party ’s Stalinist authoritarianism .
The problem is also a result of the “ lobby politics ” of NGOs .
Neither strategy leads to building an independent position for the trade unions and social movements .
They reject “ representative democracy ” but have no concrete democratic proposals to put in its place .
Even at this late hour , we can still build political independence .
We must campaign for more democracy and more control of institutions from below .
We must advocate a root and branch reform of the justice system , a reduction in the role of the military and the building of a welfare state through cuts in the military budget and progressive taxation of the rich .
Yet there are still those who say that we must take sides in the current elite dispute and leave such reforms until later .
The problem with that is that the dispute will not be quickly settled and if it is settled on the terms of one or other elite grouping it will result in a smaller democratic space and less bargaining power for social movements .

Ever since former White House spokesman , Scott McClellan wrote his tell - all memoir ; through his numerous interviews ; he has revealed more about the inner workings of the Bush Administration than any other book or documentary to date .
The secret is out : the Bush / Cheney Administration regularly fed talking points to Bill O’Reilly , Sean Hannity , Rush Limbaugh and their acolytes .
For years , we the French Expatriate community and Miquelon.org , strongly suspected Anti-French Talking Points were handed down from the White House to their favored media pundits .
We can now say this is in fact how things transpired , thanks to a revealing interview of Scott McClellan by Chris Matthews .
Confirmation of the Trickle - Down - Hatred Model
Anti-French talking points were passed down from the White House to the usual suspects , and then amplified by minions of favorable “ journalists ” and columnists only to be parroted by compliant entertainers , comediens and talk show hosts like Jay Leno .
Let ’s never forget French Bashing was the brainchild of George W. Bush , Richard Cheney and their entourage , not some popular uprising as we were led to believe by Bush himself : “ An interesting phenomena taking place here in America about the French … a backlash against the French , not stirred up by anybody except the people ” [ March 2003 ]
French Bashing was the ultimate sideshow thrust upon the American people with complete and utter disregard to a centuries old friendship .
QUOD ERAT DEMONSTRANDUM
Australians .
They ’re just like us , only brasher , freer and stronger right ?
We 're all nanny - state and worrying about feelings , they 're all ' whadaaaaarya ' and biting the heads off snakes .
Except apparently Australians can't go on the internet without someone holding their hand .
Like a lot of people around here I was pretty happy with the result of the last Australian election .
Yet amidst all the apologising and signing up for Kyoto , Kevin Rudd 's shiny new government did something that slipped under my radar .
Probably a lot of things , really , but this is what bothers me now : the Aussie Clean Feed .
They ’re intending to filter all content at an ISP level , to remove child pornography .
And other pornography .
And R-rated content .
And violence .
And ‘ inappropriate content ’ .
Let ’s be fair .
The British started it .
As of the beginning of this year , the British ‘ voluntary ’ clean feed has now been applied by all ISPs .
Because the filtering is n’t mandatory there ’s been no legislation , no vote and no debate .
If British users try to access blacklisted pages , they will be shown a soothing 404 error , to avoid the distress of being informed that the content has been censored .
Even in Australia this is n’t really the Labor Party ’s baby .
This is policy that the Australia Institute and the Family First Party were pushing back in 2003 .
The Liberals were in on the act by 2005 , though reading their speeches , you can understand the concern .
Apparently , the internet works differently in Australia :
Even in our own homes , you go home , turn on your home computer and bingo - out come the pornographic sites .
You are hit again and again .
~ Senator Guy Barnett , Lib , Tas
you have only got to press P on the Internet and all this stuff appears free of charge in front of you
~ Senator Paul Calvert , Lib , Tas
I can only hope I never work out how to ‘ press P on the internet ’ so I can avoid getting punched in the face by bingo - porn .
The Rudd government is getting the job done .
There ’s AU$ 75 million set aside in the Federal budget over the next two years for implementing the compulsory clean feed scheme .
Some of this funding will come from the now - defunct NetAlert filter scheme , which provided filtering software free of charge to Australian households .
In July , the government ran a trial of various filtering systems in Tasmania .
There ’s an excellent round - up of the results here .
In brief :
- while load testing was based on thirty users and only blocked 3930 sites , network degradation was as high as 75 % .
The more accurate the filter was , the worse the effect it had on performance .
One filter caused a 22 % degradation in speed when it was n’t actually filtering .
- at best , sites were correctly blocked 92 - 95 % of the time .
At worst , more than one in ten got through .
- at best , sites were incorrectly blocked ( blocked when they contained no objectionable content ) 1 % of the time .
That does n’t sound too bad , but imagine that ’s your business , one of the one in a hundred sites blocked from the entire Australian market when you ’ve done nothing wrong .
At worst , over - blocking hit over 6 % .
- the only way to filter content on instant messengers or peer to peer protocols was to block them completely .
- The filters do nothing to protect children from actual dangers such as cyber - bullying or stalking .
This has been touted as a success , and the project is powering on to its next step , a real - world pilot program .
Now , let ’s assume that protecting children from child pornography is a pressing need .
Let ’s assume that it ’s easy to define pornography and Kevin Rudd is inarguably correct when he calls this picture ‘ disgusting ’ .
Let ’s assume that Telecommunications Minister Stephen Conroy has people ’s best interests at heart and his opponents can justly be characterised thusly :
Labor makes no apologies to those that argue that any regulation of the internet is like going down the Chinese road .
If people equate freedom of speech with watching child pornography , then the Rudd - Labor Government is going to disagree .
Worried about free speech ?
Concerned that nobody seems to know what ’s on the blacklist , but that it will cover legal material ?
You ’re obviously a pervert .
They ’re thinking about the perverts too , though .
You may be able to opt out of filtering by contacting your ISP and asking to be put on the ' filthy uncensored internet ' list .
Though as the filtering software will still be running on your connection , it ’ll be filthy uncensored slow internet .
This system will be applied to every public and private net connection in the country .
It will be applied to every household , even though only a third of Australian households have children and only a third of those have filtering software installed – even though it ’s free .
Oddly the policy is being aggressively pushed despite it being very unpopular with internet users - 51.5 % strongly oppose the plan , while only 2.9 % strongly support it .
But even if you assume that pre-chewed baby - food internet for adults is an acceptable sacrifice for protecting children , the simple fact is that filtering does n’t do that .
All filters both over - block and under - block .
They do n’t protect children from chatting to people they should n’t , putting silly things on their MySpace pages , or being bullied by other kids .
They do n’t help children learn to make good decisions about using the net .
Yes , some parents want their children ’s internet filtered .
They were able to do that , using the previous government ’s NetAlert free filter program , which is being discontinued and having its funding diverted to the CleanFeed .
Obviously not enough parents were Thinking of the Children , so now it ’s the Federal Government ’s job .

We 'll warn you in advance , this is only for those who dig the weird , all things Stephen Hawking or clock - making in general .

Bloomberg is reporting Treasury Seeks Authority to Buy Mortgages Unchecked by Courts .
The Bush administration sought unchecked power from Congress to buy $ 700 billion in bad mortgage investments from financial companies in what would be an unprecedented government intrusion into the markets .
" He 's asking for a huge amount of power , " said Nouriel Roubini , an economist at New York University .
" He 's saying , ` Trust me , I 'm going to do it right if you give me absolute control . '
This is not a monarchy . "
Paulson is seeking an expansion of federal influence over markets that has n't been seen since the Great Depression , said Charles Geisst , author of " 100 Years of Wall Street " and a finance professor at Manhattan College in New York .
" This is going to be a big package because it's a big problem , " Bush said following a meeting with Colombian President Alvaro Uribe at the White House .
" We need to get this done quickly , and the cleaner the better . "
Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama said in a radio address that he " fully supports " Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke 's efforts to stabilize the financial system .
The plan , however , should benefit both main street and Wall Street , he said .
Republican Presidential nominee John McCain " looks forward " to reviewing the proposal while focusing at least in part on " minimizing the burden on the taxpayer , " said Jill Hazelbaker , communications director for the McCain campaign .
The Bush administration seeks " dictatorial power unreviewable by the third branch of government , the courts , to try to resolve the crisis , " said Frank Razzano , a former assistant chief trial attorney at the Securities and Exchange Commission now at Pepper Hamilton LLP in Washington .
" We are taking a huge leap of faith . "
Unreviewable Dictatorial Power
Democrats Want To Expand The Bailout
" We 're going to be buying up a lot of mortgage paper , " said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank , a Massachusetts Democrat .
" Between Fannie Mae and Freddie now owned by the federal government and the mortgage paper we 'll be acquiring here " and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. running failed bank IndyMac Bancorp Inc. , " we should now be able substantially to reduce foreclosures , " he said .
My Comment
The Treasury plans to hire asset managers to purchase the assets through so - called reverse auctions , seeking the lowest prices , one of the people said .
Congress will need to raise the limit for the federal debt to allow the government to borrow enough to fund the program , the person said .
Senator Richard Shelby , an Alabama Republican who has advocated that markets should be allowed to penalize bad bets , warned that bailout could saddle taxpayers with large debts .
" This could be the biggest bailout in the history of the country and could ultimately cost $ 500 billion to $ 1 trillion , " Shelby , the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee , said in a Bloomberg Television interview today .
" Congress is not going to rubber stamp something . "
My Comment
Senator Christopher Dodd , the Banking Committee chairman , said the plan 's framers should consider the full debt load of U.S. consumers , possibly including credit cards .
My Comment
The temporary plan is likely to include a " second stimulus " proposal with infrastructure funds , low - income energy aid and Medicaid assistance , Frank said .
My Comment
Officials devising the plan " need to make sure that they keep that hard - headed approach so that people are not profiting off this , " said Martin Baily , who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Democratic President Bill Clinton .
My Comment
" To some extent that 's unavoidable , " said Baily , now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington .
" Anytime you do something like this you have the problem of bailing people out and creating moral hazard .
That 's the reason why you hold your nose .
But it 's better than the alternative . "
Perfectly Avoidable
Contact Your Senator Today !
Urge your senator to Filibuster any bailout legislation .
Emphatically state you do not want a bailout of any kind for anyone .
No Dictatorial power for Paulson or Bernanke
Taxpayers should not have to bail out banks making bad loans
Tell them that " The Fed " and Paulson are systemic risk " .
Email AND Phone Senators Shelby , Bunning , Kyle , Ensign , Hagel
Specifically ask for a filibuster and tell them to vote no to any bailout .
Tell them that anyone who votes for this bailout will never get your vote again .

Solar - Powered Plane Flies for Nearly 83 Hours , Doubles World Record
August 25th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
DailyTech reports that defense firm QinetQ has set the unofficial world record for the longest continuous unmanned flight with the Zephyr , a British - built spy plane .
The Zephyr stayed in the air for 82 hours and 37 minutes , besting the previous record of 30 hours and 24 minutes held by Northrup Grumman ’s Global Hawk .
The plane , which can be launched by hand , has a carbon fiber skeleton that weighs under 70 lbs and an 18 m wingspan covered with silicon solar cells .
It is powered by a lithium sulfur rechargeable battery that is twice as efficient as any other battery in the world .
Despite the Zephyr ’s record - smashing speed , it will not set any official world records .
According to the World Air Sports Federation , the plane ’s flight did not fulfill the requirements of a world record attempt since it was performed to test the Zephyr ’s ability to relay ground radio messages .
But that does n’t mean the test flight was for naught .
The Zephyr ’s designers believe that the plane could potentially fly continuously for weeks or months , and the technology has countless military uses .
Even more exciting , the Zephyr ’s exhibition of solar energy used in flight opens up the possibility of manned solar - powered planes — a development that would revolutionize the aircraft industry .

What Is a Toll - Free Number ( And Why Does Your Business Need One )
Even in a time when long - distance calls cost the same as local calls for most people , toll free numbers are still popular .
There are a number of reasons for this , but most of all , businesses with toll free numbers find that their business is more successful with them than without them .
What are toll free numbers , and in what ways do they help the businesses that have them ?
Read on to find out how these phone numbers have n’t waned in popularity even in the present day .
There ’s good reason that more than eight thousand toll free numbers are registered each day in the United States .
The History of Toll Free Numbers
Long ago , any time you made a phone call you would have to call the operator and have her put you through to the person you were trying to call .
If you wanted to avoid paying for that call , you could tell the operator that you wanted to call collect and she would reverse the charges to the caller on the other end of the line .
For a long time , this was the only way to make a phone call without paying for it .
Toll Free Calling Begins
In 1967 AT&T launched an automated calling system called InWATS that allowed people to call businesses for free .
This service was very expensive and was only available to and used by large , major , national companies .
A federal judge ordered the breakup of the “ Ma Bell ” nationwide telephone monopoly into a dozen regional companies in 1984 .
This move encouraged competition , and as a result , the cost of toll free numbers dropped ; finally , smaller companies could afford to use 1-800 numbers for their businesses as well .
The concept of the “ vanity ” number became popular during this time .
More and more businesses chose phone numbers with their business name or some other memorable words in it that could be spelled out using a telephone ’s alphanumeric keypad .
Popularity Grew
In the late 1990s , there was an explosion in the use of toll free numbers .
In fact , the demand for these numbers became so large that the ten million number supply of them was depleted .
To expand the pool of numbers to meet the demand , new toll free prefixes were introduced .
In 1996 , the prefix 888 was rolled out ; it was followed by 877 and 866 in 1998 and 855 in 2010 .
Toll Free Numbers Today
The demand for toll free numbers somewhat decreased as cell phones gained in popularity but they are still in high demand .
Today , toll free numbers are a mark of professionalism .
Any business that wants to be taken seriously on a large local or national scale has one .
Although they are available to everyone , a toll free number on business materials tends to give any business some extra prestige and clout .
What Are Toll Free Numbers Used for Today ?
You may be wondering why your company needs a toll free number for in this day and age .

Think about it .
Imagine you are looking for a company to do work on your house .
You find several different local businesses online that seem like they could do the job .
Two of them have local numbers with area codes , but one has a toll free number .
Which one do you imagine is the larger , more established business ?
Which one will you choose ?
3. Marketing
Further , a toll free number gives you great opportunities to promote and market your business .
Toll free numbers are easier to remember in general , but if you also choose a vanity number that spells something , your customers will never forget it .

As 2008 begins its slow descent towards 2009 , the viability of online music experiences like Pandora are struggling to scale .
The company has grown to roughly 40,000 new visitors a day , with a yearly revenue of about $ 25 million .
Generating money it seems , is not a problem .
What 's crippling Pandora ( and a lot of other online experiments ) are the royalties .
About 70 % of that $ 25 million is going to the licensing of that music , making Pandora iincredibly popular but not very profitable .
It also means that they 'll have trouble scaling the business into something larger , as the more popular they become , the more they pay in royalties .
All of this means that Pandora is facing a decision on whether or not to go on .
It 's 2008 and we 're witnessing the Achille 's heel of what some once heralded as a free music revolution : costs .
In an interview with the Washington Post , founder Tim Westergren said " We 're approaching a pull - the - plug kind of decision .
This is like a last stand for webcasting . "
There 's an attempted negotiation going on this week between SoundExchange and webcasting groups in their long standoff over royalty rates , and the result of that may make a decision very easy for Pandora .
" We 're losing money as it is , " said Westergren .
" The moment we think this problem in Washington is not going to get solved , we have to pull the plug because all we 're doing is wasting money . "

This weekend 's Hideout Block Party had quite a few arresting images -- Monotonix anyone ? -- but the unholy meeting of Michael Jackson songs , Robbie Fulks , Rhymefest , and a whole mess o' zombies threatens to be one of the weirdest and most enduring mixture of sound and images of the whole weekend .
The choreographed dancing to " Thriller " was pretty durn impressive , and the make - up and costuming was absolutely terrific .
Where DO they come up with these ideas ?
We 'll have a full photo set spanning the weekend up here soon , but for now , bring on the zombies !

Carey Hart 's Brother Anthony Hart Died in Motorcycle Accident
Tragedy struck the family ofwhen his brother died yesterday in a motorcycle accident .
The wreck happened at Stafford Motor Speedway in Connecticut during a practice session .
The 21 year old , from Henderson , Nevada , was getting ready for a race in the Doug Henry New England Grand Prix which is part of the American Motorcyclist Association 's XTRM Supermoto Championship series .
Tony , as he was known in racing circles , was flown by Life Star medical helicopter to Hartford Hospital where he later died .
Autopsy results are not expected until Monday , according to the Chief Medical Examiners office .
We will continue to look for more details on the crash and update as soon as possible .
The Federal Government 's decision to sign the Protocol to the UN's Convention Against Torture has the potential to put Australia 's police in a difficult position .
The UN Committee Against Torture says the use of Tasers " causes acute pain , constituting a form of torture " .
The Taser is an electronic stun gun with a 50,000 - volt punch , that paralyses its target .
They are used by police in several Australian states and one high - profile lawyer says the Government 's decision to sign up to the UN protocol could make their use illegal .
Australian Council for Civil Liberties president Terry O'Gorman says Tasers are now being used by police in Western Australia , Queensland and New South Wales .
Police in Victoria are campaigning for them too .
Mr O'Gorman says they are used every day .
" [ There was ] an incident on the Gold Coast recently where the police were chasing a fellow who had n't stopped for some mundane reason , " he said .
" They could n't catch up with him so they Tasered him .
The use of the Taser , which is touted as an alternative to the police drawing their gun and shooting , is being used in ordinary , everyday , mundane , policing situations . "
He says very little parliamentary scrutiny has been applied to the decision to issue police with Tasers , but the signing of the protocol against torture could change that .
" It clearly is extremely painful .
The United Nations have said that it is a form of torture so the Federal Government has got to grab this whole issue with both hands and address the widespread growing use of Tasers in at least three of the eight state and territory police services in this country , " Mr O'Gorman said .
He expects the signing of the UN protocol will strengthen the legal argument against Tasers in Australia , and says it puts the onus on the Federal Government to take action on the issue .
" Deaths in Australia are inevitable .
There is clear evidence that the use of Tasers leads to death , " he said .
" The fact that Australia is now signing up to the UN protocol , which describes Tasers as a form of torture , just means that this has a degree of urgency which needs to be addressed by at least the Standing Committee of Attorneys - General , which is an overarching body which looks at these sorts of issues over the country .

Former UN weapons inspector says attack on Iran ' virtual guarantee ' John Byrne
Published : Monday May 5 , 2008

This US denies again on Monday Former UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter , who was among the original experts to question Bush Administration claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction , now says he believes an attack on Iran is a " virtual guarantee . "
" We take a look at the military buildup , we take a look at the rhetoric , we take a look at the diplomatic posturing , and I would say that its a virtual guarantee that there will be a limited aerial strike against Iran in the not - so - near future or not - so - distant future , that focuses on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Command , " Ritter said last week in a little - noted interview with Amy Goodman 's Democracy Now .
" And if this situation spins further out of control , you would see these aerial strikes expanding to include Irans nuclear infrastructure and some significant command and control targets . "
The Pentagon denied the claim again Monday .
" I actually am very hopeful that we do n't get into a position where we have to get into a conflict , " Adm .
Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told Israel 's Channel Ten television when asked if he might recommend that U.S. forces strike Iranian nuclear facilities preemptively .
" It would be a very significant challenge for the United States right now to get into a third conflict in that part of the world , " Mullen added , referring to the Bush administration 's long - running military commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Ritter , who led the UN mission to inspect Iraqi weapons from 1991 to 1998 , also questions Administration claims that Syria was developing a nuclear weapon in concert with North Korea .
RAW STORY has written in detail regarding concerns from intelligence officers , who say that satellite photographs of the alleged site offer no formal proof , and officials are internally skeptical of such claims .
" We have to be concerned about the evidence , " Ritter said .
" We have interior photographs and exterior shots and nothing that links the two .
And so , on the surface , I would say that if you re bringing this evidence to a court of lawits a strange dimension , the rule of law , when we speak of American foreign policy lately you would have trouble having anybody say yes , this is definitive evidence that links the allegations to this specific site in question . "
" And this notion that the reactor was on the verge of becoming operational , again , is absurd , " he adds .
" You know , there would have to be literally thousands of pounds of pure graphite that would have to be introduced to this facility , and theres no evidence in the destruction .
You know , there were a number of reporters who went to the site after it was blown up .
If it had been bombed and there was graphite introduced , you would have a signature all over the area of destroyed graphite blocks .
There would be graphite lying around , etc .
This was not the case . "
US intelligence officials told RAW STORY they found no radiation signatures after the bombing , so there was no uranium or plutonium present .
 We do n't have any independent intelligence that it was a nuclear facility -- only the assertions by the Israelis and some ambiguous satellite photography from them that shows a building , which the Syrians admitted was a military facility .
The site of the alleged reactor was bombed in 2007 .
The UN is currently probing US claims .
" I dont know what was going on at this site , " Ritter said .
" If the images are accurate , it appears that Syria was producing a very , very small research reactor .
But it is not a reactor usable in a nuclear weapons program .
Syria was not violating the law . "
The interview was highlighted by a diarist on Daily Kos .
Report fingers new Pentagon planning Ritter 's remark about Iran comes on the heels of a report Sunday in the UK Sunday Times ' which alleges that the Pentagon is drawing up plans for a " surgical strike " against an alleged insurgent training camp in Iran , and a CBS report that suggests US forces are prepared to launch small - scale attacks .
Attributing the assertion to Western intelligence officials , the Times ' Michael Smith asserts that US officials have become increasingly frustrated with Iran 's Republican Guard force -- an elite corps of the country 's military -- which the Bush Administration has designated a terrorist group .
Western officials have accused Iran of helping arming rebel militias in Iraq , and have accused Iran of supplying IEDs .
Smith was the first to reveal the Downing Street Minutes , an account of a secret 2002 meeting between Bush Administration officials and British intelligence surrounding Iraq , in which MI6 director Richard Dearlove remarked that facts around Iraq were being " fixed " around a policy for war .
" US commanders are increasingly concerned by Iranian interference in Iraq and are determined that recent successes by joint Iraqi and US forces in the southern port city of Basra should not be reversed by the Quds Force , " Smith writes . "
' If the situation in Basra goes back to what it was like before , America is likely to blame Iran and carry out a surgical strike on a militant training camp across the border in Khuzestan , ' " he quotes a defense official as saying .
Nuclear facilities ' not targets ' Seymour Hersh in the New Yorker and RAW STORY 's Larisa Alexandrovna revealed internal Pentagon planning in a buildup to a potential Iran conflict .
Since the reports ran , however , rhetoric about Iran has been toned down and concerns of a potential all - out war have diminished .
American officials are opposed to any attack on Iranian nuclear facilities , Smith says .
They believe , however , that an attack on a militant camp could send a message to the Republican Guard .
CBS
News reported last week about a potential strike on Iran .
" Targets would include everything from the plants where weapons are made to the headquarters of the organization known as the Quds Force which directs operations in Iraq , " they wrote .
" U.S. officials are also concerned by Iranian harassment of U.S. ships in the Persian Gulf as well as Iran 's still growing nuclear program , " CBS adds .
" New pictures of Iran 's uranium enrichment plant show the country 's defense minister in the background , as if deliberately mocking a recent finding by U.S. intelligence that Iran had ceased work on a nuclear weapon . "
Sources told Smith that no attack was planned on Iranian nuclear facilities .
Such attack plans have been criticized , because many of Iran 's facilities are located underground and not all locations might be neutralized by an airstrike .
" If an attack happens it will be on a training camp to send a clear message to Iran not to interfere , " one intelligence officer said .

Maev Kennedy takes a look at a startling new clock before its official unveiling tomorrow
The hour approaches .
The beast 's jaws gape , its tail quivers and then snap !
Another minute has been devoured , and the hour strikes with the ominous clonk of a chain dropping into a coffin .
The creature blinks twice in satisfaction .
" It is terrifying , it is meant to be , " said John Taylor , the creator and funder of an extraordinary new clock to be unveiled tomorrow by Stephen Hawking at Corpus Christi College in Cambridge .
" Basically I view time as not on your side .
He 'll eat up every minute of your life , and as soon as one has gone he 's salivating for the next .
It 's not a bad thing to remind students of .
I never felt like this until I woke up on my 70th birthday , and was stricken at the thought of how much I still wanted to do , and how little time remained . "
Christopher de Hamel , an expert on medieval manuscripts and Fellow Librarian at Corpus Christi , described the clock as " hypnotically beautiful - and deeply disturbing " .
Hawking , celebrated as the author of A Brief History of Time , is returning from the launch of the particle accelerator at Cern in Switzerland to unveil Taylor 's sinister vision of his subject .
Taylor is an inventor whose thermostat switch is incorporated in 600 m electric kettles all over the world .
He first gave £ 2.5 m for a new undergraduate library at his old college , and then offered to create and donate the £ 1 m Corpus clock to the library .
The work has involved 200 people , including engineers , sculptors , scientists , jewellers and calligraphers .
Taylor regularly flew over in his own plane from his home on the Isle of Man to keep an eye as beady as his creature 's on the work .
For all its apparent eccentricity , the clock is based on solidly traditional clockwork - unusual in these days of digital electronic clocks .
It has taken seven years ' research and construction , incorporates six patented inventions , and is predicted to run for at least 250 years assuming the world lasts that long .
Engineer Stewart Huxley refuses to reveal the secret of its tricks , which include the pendulum occasionally apparently catching and stopping for a heartbeat , and then swinging faster to catch up .
The rippling gold - plated dial was made by exploding a thin sheet of stainless steel onto a mould underwater : none of the team actually saw it happen because the only place in the world which could make it was a secret military research institute in Holland .
The monster momentarily stops the turning dial with its foot to mark the minutes , shown as blue LED lights shining through slots .
It was originally conceived by Taylor as a literal interpretation of the grasshopper escapement invented by his hero , the Georgian clockmaker John Harrison whose fabulously accurate mechanisms solved the problem of establishing longitude at sea .
The creature , modelled by sculptor Matthew Sanderson , was inspired by medieval armour and gradually became more ominous : part - lizard , part - stag beetle , a Chronophage – time eater .
Although the entire mechanism can be swung inside the building for cleaning and maintenance , from next weekend it will be a public clock on a street corner in the old doorway of the former bank , a listed building which became the shell of the library .
As the clock was installed over the last few weeks , any time the door in the hoarding was left open crowds gathered , transfixed by the sight of time passing .
The Corpus Clock will be officially unveiled by Stephen Hawking at Corpus Christi College tomorrow
15 months ago I wrote a blog post about Building a Huffman Tree with Perl 6 ( German ) .
Back then I used pugs to test it .
Now I tried it with Rakudo Perl revision 29736 , and to my delight I discovered that it worked nearly without modification .
( Actually it needed a small modification because I made a mistake in the testing originally , I compared hashes with string semantics .
That works in pugs even though it is not specified ; in rakudo it does n't ) .
I updated my script a bit to do the testing correctly , and used a few more typical Perl 6 idioms :
Editor 's note : Sen .
Ted Kennedy will be honored tonight at the Democratic Convention in Denver , Colorado .
His nephew , Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council and president of the Waterkeeper Alliance , was named one of Time magazine 's " Heroes for the Planet " for helping lead the fight against Hudson River pollution .
Robert Kennedy describes his uncle Ted as " the most reliable leader in the Senate on energy and environmental issues .
He 's a guy I always go to for advice and support when we 're working on federal legislation . "
This is one in a series of commentary pieces on CNN.com from both McCain and Obama supporters attending party conventions .
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says the U.S. has tremendous energy resources , including wind and solar .
( CNN ) -- Barack Obama is a transformational figure in American history who 's been able to excite the same intensity of feeling among Americans as I saw during my father 's 1968 campaign and my uncle John F. Kennedy 's 1960 campaign .
As a six - year - old , I attended the Democratic Convention in 1960 and traveled across the country in the Caroline K [ the Kennedy campaign plane ] .
The excitement I saw then is echoed today as Barack Obama outlines his plans to get the nation moving in the right direction , to restore America 's role as an exemplary nation .
America 's dependence on carbon to produce energy has eroded our economic power , destroyed our moral authority , diminished our international influence and prestige , endangered our national security , and marred our health and landscapes .
It is subverting everything we value .
A sophisticated , well - crafted energy policy designed to de-carbonize America is the centerpiece of Sen. Barack Obama 's domestic economic package .
It will sharpen our competitiveness by reducing our energy costs , dramatically reduce our national debt , stimulate our economy far more effectively than tax cuts by putting conservation savings in the hands of every American , and be the engine for creating millions of green - collar jobs that cannot be outsourced .
Obama understands , as John McCain does not , that an intelligent energy policy is also the natural fulcrum for U.S. foreign policy and national security .
As Obama has warned , " One of the most dangerous weapons in the world today is the price of oil .
We ship nearly $ 700 million a day to unstable or hostile nations for their oil .
It pays for terrorist bombs going off from Baghdad to Beirut . "
See McCain and Obama energy plans
Obama 's policy , which anticipates eliminating imports by 2012 or earlier , is feasible and desirable .
Respected economists and energy industry entrepreneurs , high - level business representatives from Fortune 500 companies and large investors are already enlisting to invest in the infrastructure to facilitate the transition .
Every nation that has taken serious steps to de-carbonize its energy portfolio has reaped immediate economic growth .
Sweden announced in 2006 the phase - out of all fossil fuels ( and nuclear energy ) by 2020 .
In 1991 , the Swedes enacted a carbon tax -- now up to $ 150 a ton -- closed two nuclear reactors , and still dropped greenhouse emissions to 5 tons per person , compared with the U.S. per-capita rate of 20 tons .
Thousands of entrepreneurs rushed to develop new ways of generating energy from wind , the sun and the tides , and from wood chips , agricultural waste and garbage .
Growth rates climbed and the heavily taxed Swedish economy is now the world 's eighth richest by gross domestic product .
Iceland was 80 percent dependent on imported coal and oil in the 1970s and was among the poorest economies in Europe .
Today , Iceland is 100 percent energy independent , and according to the International Monetary Fund is now the fourth most affluent nation on Earth .
There are many other examples : Brazil 's efforts to de-carbonize its transportation system has resulted in the largest and most robust economic expansion in its history .
The United States has far greater domestic energy resources than Iceland or Sweden .
We sit atop the second - largest geothermal resources in the world .
The American Midwest is the Saudi Arabia of wind .
Solar installations across just 19 percent of the most barren desert land in the Southwest could supply nearly all of our nation 's electricity needs even if every American owned an electric car .
Obama 's vision of de-carbonizing our economy begins with a market - based carbon cap - and - trade system designed to put downward pressure on carbon emissions .
He will invest billions to revamp the nation 's antiquated high - voltage power transmission system and press for cost - saving building and appliance standards that would cut our energy demand by half .
For a tiny fraction of the projected cost of the Iraq war , we could completely wean the country from carbon .
Homes and businesses will become power plants as people cash in by installing solar panels and wind turbines on their buildings , and selling the stored energy in their plug - in hybrids back to the grid at peak hours .
By kicking its carbon addiction , America will increase its national wealth .
Everyone will profit from the green gold rush .
We will create a decentralized and highly distributable grid that is far more resilient and safe for our country ; a terrorist might knock out a power plant , but never a million homes .
And for the first time in half a century , we will live free from Middle Eastern wars and entanglements with petty tyrants who despise democracy and are hated by their own people .

The sun has reached a milestone not seen for nearly 100 years : an entire month has passed without a single visible sunspot being noted .
The event is significant as many climatologists now believe solar magnetic activity – which determines the number of sunspots — is an influencing factor for climate on earth .
According to data from the Solar Influences Data Center ( SIDC ) , the last time such an event occurred was June of 1913 .
Sunspot data has been collected since 1749 .
When the sun is active , it ’ p begins .
But this year — which corresponds to the start of Solar Cycle 24 — has been extraordinarily long and quiet , with the first seven months averaging a sunspot number of only 3 .
August followed with none at all .
The astonishing rapid drop of the past year has defied predictions , and caught nearly all astronomers by surprise .

According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) ,
Following a record rate of ice loss through the month of August , Arctic sea ice extent already stands as the second - lowest on record , further reinforcing conclusions that the Arctic sea ice cover is in a long - term state of decline .
With approximately two weeks left in the melt season , the possibility of setting a new record annual minimum in September remains open .
A record was set for Arctic sea ice melt in 2007 .
Much was made of the sea ice “ recovery ” over the ensuing winter of 2007 / 2008 .
However , while the Arctic sea ice returned to an extent similar to that of the winter prior to the record melt , much of the new ice was very thin .
Thus even though 2008 has been a cooler year than 2007 ( partially due to a strong La Nina cycle ) , the new , thinner ice has proven to be more susceptible to melting , as the graphic following the jump illustrates .
Because the new , thinner ice is more susceptible to melting , the Arctic sea ice melt this year has deviated from the normal pattern .
Usually the melt rate slows by mid-August , but this year it continued to melt rapidly , which allowed August of 2008 to break the record rate of melt for that month .
Ironically , the August melt was greater than the size of Alaska , a state very close to the Arctic from which Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin hails , who does not believe that humans are causing global warming .
While this summer ’s melt wo n’t leave the North Pole ice free as a few scientists predicted was a possibility , it may break the record melt of 2007 despite 2008 being a significantly cooler year .
This suggests that in the next few years when we inevitably have warmer temperatures , the North Pole will indeed be ice free .
The long - term trend is quite clear :

Incidentally , there are no seats on the Floor , none that this correspondent ever saw .
The Exchange is already an anachronism , like Broadway .
Everything is done by computer today .
Hanging out on the Floor of the Exchange is like hanging out at OTB .

That ’s Broadway and Wall Street today .
It may dash your hopes for that nice warm feeling called Schadenfreude , but the Masters of the Universe are smarter than the people they left behind at the investment banks .
Their hedge funds have blown up here and there , but unlike the investment banks , they are still very much in business .
They have hurriedly pulled themselves into defensive positions inside their shells , like turtles .
Their Armageddon , if any , will not come for two more days , which is to say , Tuesday , Sept. 30 .
Most hedge funds open up a crack on Sept. 30 , Dec. 31 , March 31 and June 30 to give investors the chance to “ redeem ” their investments , meaning take their money out .
These moments are called gates , like a series of gates in a prison .
The gate is the limit , the fixed percentage of your money , that the fund will allow you to take out at one time .
Even with these strict caps on withdrawals , some funds may end up nothing but shells .

A universal flu vaccine which could mean an end to the annual jab is being tested on UK volunteers .
It targets a different part of the virus to current vaccines , which means it does not have to be altered every year to match circulating strains .
If successful , the vaccine developed by Oxford University researchers would also be a key weapon in a flu pandemic .
Experts said such a vaccine was the " holy grail " for flu researchers but there was still a long way to go .
Study leader , Dr Sarah Gilbert , said traditional influenza vaccines are designed to prompt an immune response to H and N proteins on the outer shell of the virus .
With this vaccine , we could end up having pretty much everyone vaccinated - a situation more like measles where you do n't really see it anymore
Dr Sarah Gilbert
But these proteins are prone to mutation - and every year the vaccine has to be reformulated on the basis of the strains likely to be most prominent .
So instead , the researchers have developed a vaccine on the basis of proteins inside the cell , which are far more similar across different strains .
The vaccine uses a weakened smallpox virus to carry the proteins into the body - a technique that has already been used in malaria and TB vaccines .
Once the virus has invaded the cell and starts to multiply , these inner proteins called matrix protein 1 and nucleo - protein , are revealed to the immune system .
A specific type of immune cell , called a T cell , then learns to recognise and destroy cells containing the proteins the next time it encounters them .
Tests Initially 12 people will be vaccinated to test the dose before further studies are done to check its effectiveness in people exposed to flu .
HOW FLU VACCINE WORKS
New universal flu vaccine is injected into the arm and is taken up by healthy cells .
Cells containing vaccine attract immune cells which multiply and move around the body .
Immune cells now trained to recognise proteins inside virus , which enters body via airways .
Killer immune cells recognise flu - infected cells and destroy them along with flu virus .
BACK NEXT 1 of 4
Dr Gilbert said if they were successful it could drastically change the way flu vaccine is used .
" With having to make new vaccine every year there 's never enough to go around .
" With this vaccine , we could end up having pretty much everyone vaccinated - a situation more like measles where you do n't really see it anymore . "
In the case of a pandemic , stockpiles of the vaccine could be made in advance instead of having to wait for an outbreak to then identify the particular strain of flu .
Potentially , once people had received the vaccine they would only need a booster once every five to10 years .
But she added the research team had five to 10 years of further tests ahead of them .
However , it is hoped a similar approach might eventually also be used to combat HIV , TB , malaria and even cancer .
Professor John Oxford , a flu vaccine expert at Queen Mary , University of London said such a vaccine would be the " ultimate prize " .
" But it 's a fairly difficult prize to get - it may just be a question of luck .
" There are people trying all kinds of strategies . "
He added that having to manufacture different flu vaccines every year was a " huge burden " on pharmaceutical companies .
" This team have experience with this type of vaccine so they may well get there . "

What are these ?
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. heating oil dealers are using new software to weed out clients who may not pay their bills as Americans gear up for another winter of high fuel costs in the world ’s top consumer .
Heating oil dealers in New York City , Long Island , and Connecticut have turned to data - sharing software to track delinquent clients -- a more common problem with the rise in prices .
“ In many cases , delinquent oil bills do n’t get posted to the large credit - reporting agencies , ” said John Maniscalco , executive vice president of the New York Oil Heating Association .
“ Given the current situation of the industry where bills are large and consumers are getting shut off , they tend to jump from one company to another . ”
U.S. heating oil futures have shot up more than 60 percent from the same time last year , from $ 1.98 per gallon to $ 3.21 .
The data - sharing software , called “ OilWell , ” allows dealers to share information with each other about clients who do not pay their bills on time .
“ We ’re not a credit reporting agency -- we do n’t tell you to take them on or not to take them on .
It ’s up to you to assess the risk , ” said Larry Smith , the founder and chief executive of Risk Assessment LLC , the company that designed the software .
John Knief , owner of East Coast Petroleum , looked up a potential customer in OilWell last week and found that he owed about $ 1,200 to two other companies , and then turned him down .
OilWell comes just as oil dealers -- particularly small “ mom and pop ” operations -- are confronting hard times , as banks are more parsimonious with credit .
“ Back in the day , we were never pressed for money like we are now , ” said Maniscalco , noting that some dealers have had to close shop because of customers who can not pay up .
At the same time , banks have tightened credit just as higher oil prices send dealers to the bank for larger loans .
“ You have a credit crunch on one end .
On the other end , you have high oil prices , ” said Paul Conley , chief financial officer of Castle Oil .

I was fast asleep when suddenly I was awoken by a pounding on the door .
This was not a knock like , “ Hey , what ’s up ? ” or even , “ I really need to talk to you . ”
This was a knock that said , “ I am going to get in there , and when I do , it ’s gonna suck to be you . ”
The person outside the door was screaming for my roommate .
I looked over to him .
" Do n't open the door ! "
I asked who it was .
" Just do n't open the door . "
I 've never been so terrified in my life .
My roommate called the cops , but it took a while for them to get there .
The knocking stopped — a ploy .
We could still see the shadow of two feet under the door .
He stood out there , stark still and silent .
Then the knob started to slowly turn .
He was trying to get in .
A few minutes before the cops arrived , he left .
Honestly , that night had been coming
a long time .
When I first met my roommate freshman year , I was cautiously optimistic .
He seemed nice enough .
I thought I could chill with him , even after he starting talking about drugs the first week of class .
I had never done any .
The first time he had ever smoked weed was during senior week , and he began to smoke more regularly over the summer .
When I met him he smoked twice a week .
Eventually , he was smoking almost every night out the window of the men ’s bathroom .
He would come back giggling and stay up all night playing online poker .
He also experimented with other substances , like Adderall — to help him stay awake for gambling and more weed .
He and his buddies would even strangle each other to the point of passing out to get high off the oxygen deprivation .
I ’m not exactly sure when he started dealing .
He would get visits from strange girls , beautiful girls who he would bang that night then never see again .
Most of them brought little gifts : cigarettes , teddy bears , etc .
I thought he just had serious game .
During the third month of school I talked to the resident assistant ( RA ) and , without naming specifics , told him that I was very uncomfortable with my roommate .
My RA told me my only recourse was to file a formal complaint , but my roommate was popular on the floor .
I did n’t want to be the one getting him thrown out .
Not to mention the paperwork ; finals were coming up .
Then , one night , early in the spring semester , he and his buddies were in my room again , high , watching the movie Blow .
Then , “ Let ’s get some coke ! ” I told him no way , no way are you doing coke in my room .
He ran out of the room with his “ connection ” on the phone and did n’t come back that night .
One day I came back from class and he and his buddies were doing lines off one of his textbooks and asked if I wanted a hit .
It was the first time I had ever seen cocaine in real life , and it was far from the last .
He continued to deal weed , coke too for all I know , even to strangers from the neighborhood .
Many times during the next weeks I would corner him and demand that he stop doing drugs and stop dealing .
The answer was always the same : “ Yeah , man .
I know .
These drugs are really messing up my life .
I ’m going to stop this week .
I really need to stop . ”
And , within a few days , he ’d be snorting in my room again .
He never even made an effort .
He just gave me the same speech to get me off his back , and it worked .
Honestly , he had a good racket , getting laid by a different beautiful girl every night , money rolling in .
He did n’t even have to go to class because he had ringers going and taking his tests for him in exchange for drugs .
But the low point came the night of the knocking on our door .
Days after the incident , the RA pulled me aside .
He told me he knew what was going on in our room .
He told me my roommate was smoking out of the floor ’s bathroom window .
He had strangers coming to our room at all hours .
He told me that it was only a matter of time before my roommate got busted , and he told me if my roommate went down and I knew about his activities and had n’t
reported them , I ’d be expelled with him and probably subject to legal action .
report this ad
Then I was approached by the cops , who told me the same thing .
But they also told me they wanted to catch him in the act .
And they wanted me to be the rat .
I did n't want to be a snitch .
Not because of some “ Stop Snitching ” code , but because I knew what would happen to me .
I would be completely ostracized from the campus community , hated in the entire building .
And my roommate might send someone after me .
But the cops were persistent , and eventually wore me down .
We worked out this elaborate plot , seemingly straight from the movies .
When a deal went down in the room I ’d call the cops on speed dial and hang up .
Minutes later , cops would burst into the room and bust both of us .
I would be thrown into a cop car , taken to jail and fill out paper work .
I would spend the night in jail , just enough time to convince my roommate and the other residents that I was n’t in on it .
Then they ’d slip me out the back door and home .
I sat through several deals , but was too scared to make that call .
Once , I had my finger on the button , but the buyer left too quickly .
And I never did get the chance .
His parents somehow caught wind of his addiction and pulled him out of housing to get him into rehab .
He had put me through hell my freshman year .
He went from a casual user , to a dealer , to a completely dependent addict and near convict in less than a year .
And I had front row seats to the whole episode .
D.A.R.E. can never give you an education like that .
My ex-roommate called me a few months ago .
Of course I never returned it .
But I ’ve heard he ’s dropped out of school to play cards in Baltimore .
College Drug Busts
The sale of illicit substances on college campuses nationwide is more prevalent than you might think .
That point was made shockingly clear by the May bust of a massive drug ring at San Diego State University .
Ninety - six people , including seventy - five students , were arrested in the largest campus drug bust in U.S. history .
While this was the largest bust , the raid on SDSU was far from an isolated incident .
The Intempo Rebel is a music recorder with two major features .
First , it will record the most - played tracks from any FM radio station , and save the tracks as MP3 files onto an SD card minus the adverts and DJ prattle .
Secondly , it is probably the first ever consumer electronics product which aims to use a music industry lawsuit as part of the marketing strategy .
Why else call it ‘ Rebel ’ , eh ?
Our advice , grab one of these fast , before those big black boots stomp down on their tiny little heads .
£ 69.99 .
The Intempo Rebel is a breakthrough product that allows consumers to explore new music recorded from the radio , free of charge .
The first of its type in the world , Rebel is a music sampling system which records the most - played tracks from any FM station then saves these tracks as MP3 files , cutting out hyperactive DJs and adverts as it goes .
You can then effortlessly download these songs onto your iPod , MP3 or mobile phone , liberating your favourite tracks to your pocket without paying a penny .

The JET lab has helped pioneer fusion
Scientists say an understanding of how the Twin Towers collapsed will help them develop the materials needed to build fusion reactors .
New research shows how steel will fail at high temperatures because of the magnetic properties of the metal .
The New York buildings fell when their steel backbones lost strength in the fires that followed the plane impacts .
Dr Sergei Dudarev told the British Association Science Festival that improved steels were now being sought .
The principal scientist at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority ( UKAEA ) said one of the first applications for these better performing metals would be in the wall linings of fusion reactors where temperatures would be in a similar range to those experienced in the Twin Towers ' fires .
' Not melting '
The key advance is the understanding that , at high temperatures , tiny irregularities in a steel 's structure can disrupt its internal magnetic fields , making the rigid metal soft .
" Steels melt at about 1,510C , but lose strength at much lower temperatures , " explained Dr Sergei Dudarev , principal scientist at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority ( UKAEA ) .
Iron atoms in steel : Black balls show irregularities that disrupt magnetic fields , weakening steel
At room temperature , the magnetic fields between iron atoms remain regular , but when heated , these fields are altered allowing the atoms to slide past each other , weakening the steel .
" [ The steel ] becomes very soft .
It is not melting but the effect is the same , " said Dr Dudarev .
He said blacksmiths had exploited this property for hundreds of years - it allows iron to become pliable at temperatures much lower than its melting point .
The peak in this pliability is at 911.5C , but begins at much lower temperatures , at around 500C - a temperature often reached during building fires .
The steel backbone of the Twin Towers was probably exposed to temperatures close to this , when insulating panels - meant to protect the buildings ' structural frame - were dislodged by the impacts of the hijacked planes .
The roaring fire mid-way up the building heated the steel struts , and once temperatures rose above 500C the structure became plastic , and collapsed under the force of the floors above .
Tuning up
The interest of Dr Dudarev and the UKAEA is to find steels that can withstand the intense heat of being inside a fusion reactor .
UKAEA has helped pioneer fusion power - deriving energy by forcing together atomic nuclei - at Europe 's JET lab in Oxfordshire ; and is now assisting the development work on the world first large - scale experimental reactor known as Iter .
The extended periods over which Iter will run means the reactor must have robust materials built into the vessel where the fusion reactions will occur .
Dr Dudarev said it should be possible to tune the properties of suitable new steels by adding a mix of other elements .
" We need to look at the magnetic properties of steel , [ and ] vary their chemical composition in a systematic way in order to get rid of this behaviour , " he suggests .

It 's clearly " Star Trek Comes Nearly True " time , first with the life - signs detector , and now a tiny NMR machine that 's effectively v1.0 of the medical tricorder .
Scientists at Harvard Medical School have come up with a neat way to coat bacteria and viruses with nanoparticles , and have simultaneously shrunk all the detector electronics for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy into a 2 mm - square chip .
Their prototype device uses a microfluidics network and eight of these chips inside magnetic coils to detect specific nanoparticles : future versions will use more and be portable .
It 's apparently 800 times more sensitive than standard NMR machines , and is able to detect just 10 bacteria in a single sample .

This story reads like something out of a hard boiled , detective novel .
He met her in the bar of the swank hotel and invited her to his room .
Once there , the woman fixed the drinks and told him to get undressed .
And that , the delegate to the Republican National Convention told police , was the last thing he remembered .
When ( Gabriel Nathan Schwartz ) awoke , the woman was gone , as was more than $ 120,000 in money , jewelry and other belongings .
The thief 's take stunned cops .
" It 's very , very , very rare , " Minneapolis Police Sgt. William Palmer said .
" I can think of a couple of burglaries where we had that much stolen , but it 's the first time I 've heard of this kind of deal . "
" It 's embarrassing to admit that I was a target of a crime .
I was drugged and had about $ 50,000 of personal items stolen , not the inflated number that the media is reporting from an inaccurate police report , " he said .
Those Republicans sure know how to get involved in some very wild sexual situations .
I 'm changing my mind now and think that Republicans should go to Hollywood and make movies .
They have very active imaginations .
Schwartz was interviewed repeatedly and was a real wise guy .
During the convention , Schwartz was n't shy about talking to the media .
In an Associated Press article about Sen . John McCain 's acceptance speech , Schwartz was quoted as saying that as far as oratorical skills go , McCain " has more experience in his little pinkie " than Democratic nominee Barack Obama .
In an interview filmed the afternoon of Sept. 3 and posted on the Web site LinkTV.org , Schwartz was candid about how he envisioned change under a McCain presidency .
" Less taxes and more war , " he said , smiling .
He said the U.S. should " bomb the hell " out of Iran because the country threatens Israel .
Asked by the interviewer how America would pay for a military confrontation with Iran , he said the U.S. should take the country 's resources .
" We should plant a flag .
Take the oil , take the money , " he said .
" We deserve reimbursement .
Sure , just bomb Iran and take their oil .
Just brilliant .
Well for brilliant republicans like him , there happened to be a story book ending .
Now that the statute of limitations has lifted on many of his crimes – as well as a seven - year court ban prohibiting him from writing about them ( the ban ended midnight on January 28 , 2007 ) – former hacker Kevin Mitnick is telling his story in a book to be published next year .
Mitnick , the Mumia Abu - Jamal of the hacker world who inspired a " Free Kevin " movement , was imprisoned for four and a half years , beginning in February 1995 , before he was finally sentenced to 46 months in 1999 , with some credit for time already served .
Part of that time he was held in solitary confinement and without bail because the government feared he had the ability to detonate a nuclear weapon simply by whistling a tone through a phone .
He was released in 2000 .
But do n't look for Mitnick to whine in his book about the government 's unfair treatment of him or his long - standing feud with New York Times scribe John Markoff , whom Mitnick accused of inflating stories about him to get a book deal .
Instead , he tells Forbes , he plans to set the record straight about his hacking spree .
Kevin Mitnick :
It 's pretty much my autobiography , the story of my years as a hacker and a fugitive told from my point of view–starting out from my younger years in telephone phreaking when I was 11 - years - old , to my arrest , to my post - arrest career as a security professional .
There 's going to be a lot of information revealed about hacks I pulled off .
The statute of limitations has lifted on a lot of that stuff , so now I can talk about it publicly .
Forbes :
Can you give us a preview of the exploits you 're going to recount in the book ?
I 'm trying to save that all for the book .
What I can tell you is what wo n't be in the book –I wo n't be whining about my trial or my mistreatment by the government or [ Mitnick - chronicling ] John Markoff .
This book is going to be a kind of Catch Me if You Can in cyberspace .
It 's going to be what 's real in my history and what is n't , what I did and how I did it and how I 've since turned my life around .
Forbes :
What are some of the myths about Kevin Mitnick that just are n't true ?
I never wiretapped the FBI , though I did wiretap an informant who was working with the FBI and chasing me for the bureau .
Some other myths : that I hacked into the National Security Agency , that I hacked into NORAD .
Forbes :
And some things you did do ?
Well , I compromised all the phone companies , essentially .
Even when I was a kid I had the capability to disrupt the telephone systems for entire states .
I hacked into the systems of all the major software companies at the time : Digital Equipment , Sun Microsystems , IBM , Silicon Graphics .
Also most of the companies that made cellular phones at the time , like Nokia , Motorola , Fujitsu .
Mitnick , whom the government had deemed " the most wanted computer criminal in United States history " was charged with 25 counts of wire and computer fraud and causing nearly $ 300 million in damages .
He eventually pleaded guilty to 7 counts and was ordered to pay only about $ 4,000 in restitution after his release .

Airport security found a jar of pasta sauce in my luggage last month .
It was a 6 - ounce jar , above the limit ; the official confiscated it , because allowing it on the airplane with me would have been too dangerous .
And to demonstrate how dangerous he really thought that jar was , he blithely tossed it in a nearby bin of similar liquid bottles and sent me on my way .
There are two classes of contraband at airport security checkpoints : the class that will get you in trouble if you try to bring it on an airplane , and the class that will cheerily be taken away from you if you try to bring it on an airplane .
This difference is important : Making security screeners confiscate anything from that second class is a waste of time .
All it does is harm innocents ; it does n't stop terrorists at all .
Let me explain .
If you 're caught at airport security with a bomb or a gun , the screeners are n't just going to take it away from you .
They 're going to call the police , and you 're going to be stuck for a few hours answering a lot of awkward questions .
You may be arrested , and you 'll almost certainly miss your flight .
At best , you 're going to have a very unpleasant day .
This is why articles about how screeners do n't catch every – or even a majority – of guns and bombs that go through the checkpoints do n't bother me .
The screeners do n't have to be perfect ; they just have to be good enough .
No terrorist is going to base his plot on getting a gun through airport security if there 's decent chance of getting caught , because the consequences of getting caught are too great .
Contrast that with a terrorist plot that requires a 12 - ounce bottle of liquid .
There 's no evidence that the London liquid bombers actually had a workable plot , but assume for the moment they did .
If some copycat terrorists try to bring their liquid bomb through airport security and the screeners catch them – like they caught me with my bottle of pasta sauce – the terrorists can simply try again .
They can try again and again .
They can keep trying until they succeed .
Because there are no consequences to trying and failing , the screeners have to be 100 percent effective .
Even if they slip up one in a hundred times , the plot can succeed .
The same is true for knitting needles , pocketknives , scissors , corkscrews , cigarette lighters and whatever else the airport screeners are confiscating this week .
If there 's no consequence to getting caught with it , then confiscating it only hurts innocent people .
At best , it mildly annoys the terrorists .
To fix this , airport security has to make a choice .
If something is dangerous , treat it as dangerous and treat anyone who tries to bring it on as potentially dangerous .
If it 's not dangerous , then stop trying to keep it off airplanes .
Trying to have it both ways just distracts the screeners from actually making us safer .

Lesson From the DNS Bug : Patching Is n't Enough
When you snap pictures at the fireworks display on Friday , you 'll either wind up with immensely rewarding photos or frustration that makes you wish you 'd left your camera at home and just enjoyed the show .
The outcome has everything to do with the preparation and knowledge you take to the event .
Before you go , arm yourself with a few tips and tricks that will prepare you to capture fireworks in all their brilliant glory .

Stabilize Your Camera
Foremost , when photographing fireworks , stability is key .
Like butterflies and lightening strikes , fireworks are fickle subjects .
An absolutely stable shooting platform is a must .
Whether you use a full fledged tripod or you clamp the camera onto a solid fence with a mount , the camera must be steady .
Leaning against a tree or trying to grip the camera on the top of a post just wo n't cut it .
You can further increase the stability of your tripod by hanging weight from the cross brace .
Without a stable platform to shoot from you are nearly guaranteed blurry photos .

Shoot Hands - Free
Right behind stabilizing the camera with a tripod or mount is keeping your hands off the camera while shooting .
The most common way to go hands - free is a shutter release cable .
Many modern digital cameras have the ability to get triggered by an infrared remote .
If you have neither , check the manual of your camera to see if you set a shutter delay .
Setting a delay on the shutter will achieve the same vibration - reducing effect as a remote release , but unfortunately it gives you less control over the timing of the exposure since you have to predict the best time to shoot by a few seconds .
A cable or remote release is ideal .

Control Your Exposure
The length of the exposure is pivotal to capturing fireworks .
Fireworks are large bright distant light sources that " bloom " over the course of several seconds .
To capture the the full effect of the firework 's burst it is necessary to use a longer exposure .
One to four seconds is usually enough to capture the most beautiful moment of the bursts .
Shorter than that and you end up with dark partial bursts , longer and you often end up with an over exposed picture without much focal interest .

Location , Location , Location
Firework displays draw large crowds , so it is n't always possible to secure a perfect location to shoot from .
Arriving early and scoping out the scene is well worth your time .
You want to have as clean and unobstructed a view of the skyline as possible .
Make sure to reference the skyline through the viewfinder of the camera to make sure you and the camera are seeing things the same way .
Shooting from much higher or lower than the rest of the people watching the show can yield interesting results .
If possible select a location that is upwind of the fireworks display .
Fireworks generate enormous amounts of smoke and if you 're upwind your pictures will have a hazy quality like you were taking them through a fogged up window .
The picture at left highlights the effect smoke can have on fireworks photography .

Do n't Flash The Fireworks

Turn off your flash .
If you can't turn off the flash , black it out with electrical tape .
If you 've ever seen photographs taken from the 78th row at a rock concert with the flash left on , you know exactly how poorly low light long distance flash exposures turn out .
If your camera does n't have a manual mode that allows you to turn off the flash , try out Landscape mode which almost universally turns off the flash to avoid washing out the foreground in landscape photography .
The only exception to the no flash rule is when you want to expose the foreground to highlight objects or people .
In the photo above , the young women in the corner are properly exposed because of a flash .
Without the flash they would have been dark blurs against the background .

Focus On Infinity
Pre-focus the camera .
Do n't let an overzealous auto - focusing system ruin good shots ; the brightness of the fireworks and the haze of the smoke confuses many auto focus systems .
Set the focus manually on the infinity setting to guarantee that the fireworks bursting on the skyline will be in focus .
The only time the focus - to - infinity trick would n't work is if you were close enough to the fireworks explosion to have bigger problems to worry about than blurry pictures !
If your camera does n't allow manual focus , set it to landscape mode which will have the same effect .

Cut Out Noise By Controlling ISO
You do n't want the nice crisp black skyline to come out looking like a pixelated camera phone picture .
If your camera allows you to do so , set the ISO setting as low as you can .
Turn it off auto and set it to 50 or 100 if possible .
Left to chance , your camera may well try to shoot the fireworks at 200 , 400 , or higher .
Lower ISO , less noise .

Handy Odds And Ends
Have a small light handy for checking and altering settings on the camera and tripod without having to fumble in the dark .
A small red LED key chain flashlight is perfect for this task .
Red light is less disruptive to your night vision than white light .

Once you 've covered the basics of using a tripod , setting your exposure , and so forth the next best thing you can do to ensure capturing that magic moment is to shoot tons and tons of pictures .
Make sure your memory cards are cleaned off and ready to go .
Remember not to get too carried away early in the event , the grand finale of every fireworks show always yields large and colorful displays .

McCain camp criticism rife with errors
Sen .
John McCain ’s top campaign aides convened a conference call today to complain of being called “ liars . ”
They pressed the media to scrutinize specific elements of Sen. Barack Obama ’s record .
But the call was so rife with simple , often inexplicable misstatements of fact that it may have had the opposite effect : to deepen the perception , dangerous to McCain , that he and his aides have little regard for factual accuracy .

The errors in McCain strategist Steve Schmidt ’s charges against Obama and Sen .
Joe Biden were particularly notable because they seemed unnecessary .
Schmidt repeatedly gilded the lily :
He exaggerated the Biden family 's already problematic ties to the credit card industry ; Obama ’s embarrassing relationship with a 1960s radical ; and an Obama supporter ’s over - the - top attack on Sarah Palin when — in each case — the truth would have been damaging enough .
“ Any time the Obama campaign is criticized at any level , the critics are immediately derided as liars , ” Schmidt told reporters .
But as he went on to list a series of stories he thought reporters should be writing about Obama and Biden , in almost every instance he got the details wrong .
Schmidt criticized the press for the relatively sparse coverage of the fact that one of Biden ’s sons , Hunter , is a registered federal lobbyist .
“ His son is a lobbyist for the credit card and banking industry , ” Schmidt said .
But Hunter Biden ’s lobbying clients do n’t include any banks or credit card companies .
He did work , as a vice president and then as a consultant , for MBNA , a Delaware - based bank and credit card giant to which Biden had close ties .
But he does not appear to have lobbied for the firm .
“ Steve Schmidt lied — or just got it flat wrong , " said Biden spokesman David Wade .
" Hunter Biden has never — never — been a lobbyist for the credit card or banking industry . "
Schmidt attacked Obama for his ties to William Ayers , who has spoken of his role in 1960s anti-war bombings committed by the Weather Underground .
" What we know for sure , and is beyond debate and argumentation is this : Senator Obama said that William Ayers is a guy that lives in his neighborhood .
We know that that is a disingenuous and untruthful answer , ” Schmidt said .
“ Senator Obama began his political career in its early stages raising money at Ayers ’ house , ” he said .
Obama did hold a 1995 campaign event at Ayers ’ house .
It was not , however , a fundraiser , and Ayers did not contribute money to Obama ’s first campaign , according to Illinois records .
Schmidt also complained of Obama backers ’ attacks on McCain ’s running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
“ As soon as Gov. Palin was nominated , one of … Obama ’s chief campaign surrogates , [ Florida Rep . ]
Robert Wexler , went out and accused her of being a Nazi sympathizer , ” Schmidt said .
“ Where is the outrage to that aspersion on the part of some of the biggest newspapers in the country ? ”
But Wexler did n’t call Palin a Nazi sympathizer .
He called former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan a Nazi sympathizer , and attacked Palin for allegedly having endorsed him .
“ John McCain 's decision to select a vice presidential running mate that endorsed Pat Buchanan for president in 2000 is a direct affront to all Jewish Americans .
Pat Buchanan is a Nazi sympathizer with a uniquely atrocious record on Israel , ” Wexler said .
( Wexler was apparently wrong : Though Buchanan claimed that Palin had supported him , she said she backed Steve Forbes in 1996 and 2000 , and no evidence has emerged to the contrary . )
Asked about the series of errors , McCain aides could not provide evidence to back up Schmidt ’s assertions .
One McCain aide , Michael Goldfarb , said Politico was “ quibbling with ridiculously small details when the basic things are completely right . ”
Another , Brian Rogers , responded more directly :
“ You are in the tank , ” he e-mailed .
When I first began my study of
magick , almost thirty years ago , I was fascinated and bewildered by the
numerous , often conflicting , systems for cataloging entities .
Every school of
thought and every religion offered a pantheon of entities , avatars , teachers ,
and earthly representatives .
There were catalogs filled with icons , pantheons
crowded with gods and goddesses , angels organized in hierarchies more complex
than government offices , and demons lined up behind their bigger ,
badder brethren .
Even the most ostensibly monotheistic religions still had
lists of saints , prophets , teachers , legendary characters , and further subdivisions
of their One True , yet nonetheless divisible , God .
All these systems were fascinating ,
of course , and I spent many days , weeks , months and years focused upon exploring them .
I studied
Jungs Man and His Symbols , pored
over Crowleys 777 , spread tarot
cards on my living room floor , tossed coins among the piles of tarot cards , and
created magic marker enneagrams , veves , and hieroglyphs .
I soon found that a
few of these entities had the ability to affect me in surprising ways .
Some I
found I was inexplicably drawn to  I wrote short stories and created tarot
cards for the god Pan for many years , performed rituals involving Aleister
Crowleys triumvirate of Nuit , Hadit , and Ra-Hoor - Khuit and placed candy , rum and cigars on altars for
Voodoo loas , for instance .
Similarly some entities repelled me–although most simply did
not touch me in any immediately significant way .
But ultimately my question
about all of these was ,  Why this
stuff ?
The teaching was that these entities were symbols , archetypes from the
collective unconscious–from a Platonic dreamworld in which the proper
shapes of all things were stored .
I 'm fine with the idea that our unconscious minds intersect someplace and that
we share the common implicit information that is the world beyond our immediate
awareness .
It makes sense to me on a very practical level  that everything in
the universe influences everything else , no matter how slightly or
significantly and that information about everything is available everywhere ,
if we have the ability to decode it .
That still doesnt offer an answer as to how
we came up with this particular stuff from among all the potential
shapes and forms , gods , angels , demons and symbols of the unperceived world .
What is it about that memetic complex that we call a god that makes it a god ?
How was this stuff first derived ?
I wanted to understand the
nature of the gods and goddesses from books and esoteric lore that I had come
to love  ultimately , I wanted to find a pantheon within my own life and experience .
After some years of contemplating
this issue of the origin of archetypes , I decided that the emphasis on the
" stuff " was only half the equation .
The stuff  the names , shapes , clothing and
bedroom habits of the gods  represents the content , the collection of ideas
and perceptions that we circle in a metaphysical Venn diagram to delineate
exactly what constitutes a particular entity .
The answer to my question lay as
much within the circle as in the hand that pushes the pen to draw it  or rather in the mind
that guides that hand .
The question became ,  What is
it about a particular collection of stuff
that fires off the part of my brain that recognizes it as something
meaningful ?
What makes the character of Ganesh recognizable to worshipers as a
god , for instance ?
It s a more complex question than it might appear on the
surface .
The first level to be peeled back
deals with how we recognize anything as conscious , as something with which we
can communicate .
An intuitive Turing Test performed by the
unconsciousness mind seems to immediately categorize things into conscious
entity  and inanimate lump .
We look at each other and , hopefully , we
recognize one another as human and conscious and at least reasonably intelligent .
Some very simple visual patterns , for instance , seem to fire off this sense of
recognition  a smiley face , have - a- nice day symbol is recognizable to us as a
human face ; a South Park cartoon character can be identified with –for a half hour at a time –as a conscious entity with the ability to communicate ,
make decisions , and act– however stupidly –upon the world .
Linguistic patterns
also seem to have a similar ability to reveal the conscious state of an entity .
A sentence formed with proper syntax
suggests that its writer or speaker is possessed of some measure of
intelligence .
Based on such unconscious intuitions , we recognize writers
as conscious entities when we read their well - formed sentences .
We recognize other
humans as such when we communicate with each other in text environments such as
Internet forums .
And we even recognize fictional characters as entities for
whom we might predict behavior and sympathize .
( What would Captain Kirk do ? )
There are many behavioral patterns and cues that help us to ,
unconsciously , tell the difference between a conscious entity and a brick of
cheese .
This all made much more sense to me
when I came across the concept of mirror
neurons .
These are
physical structures in the brain which enable us to build predictive models of
intelligence or consciousness .
In effect , mirror neurons build models of entities
and use our own consciousness as computing power to run those models .
We look
at another person and we a ) recognize them as another person , and b ) try them
on for size to some degree .
This suggests that mirror neurons are not only the
operative force behind empathy , sympathy , and most forms of communication , but
may also explain some of the phenomena involving gods and demons with which I
was struggling to understand .
First , let s demonstrate how mirror
neurons work .
The following exercises are excerpted from the Meta - Magick Invocation Workdbook ( © 2008 Philip H. Farber , used with permission ) .
Watch Yourself Relax :
Imagine that
you can see yourself , or hear yourself , or feel yourself , as if observing
another person .
Make it like looking at a movie or a picture of yourself .
If you are better at hearing or feeling , then hear yourself talking or
making sounds , or feel where your presence would be .
Imagine that
this other self that you are observing is in a place that is very
comfortable and very , very relaxing .
It s not necessary to see , hear
or feel the place , just keep your attention on this other self .
Watch , listen ,
and / or feel as this other self becomes more and more relaxed , more and
more comfortable , and exhibits the effects of relaxation : softer muscles ,
different posture , different facial expression , and so forth .
Make changes
to the structure of the image ( but not the content ) :
Make the image larger or smaller Make the colors brighter or more muted Emphasize the foreground as opposed to the
background , and vice versa
Make the sounds or speech louder or quieter ( if the
emphasis is on hearing rather than seeing )
Speed up and slow down the action ( works for all
senses )
Move the image closer or farther away ( works for
all senses )
Give the image a soft glow or sparkles
Notice any
changes to your state as you experiment with these changes .
The above exercise deals not
just with our ability to recognize entity - hood in our dealings with external stuff ,
but also with the things that we imagine , the dissociated images and entities
that we create in our minds .
The very ( im ) material that gods , demons , and
imaginary friends are made from .
Also notice how subtle changes in the form and
quality of our internal image have the ability to change our response to the
entity .
Different configurations affect our consciousness in different ways .
Making the representation larger or smaller , brighter or dimmer , etc. , will
often continue the process of making us more or less relaxed .
Hopefully you
found a configuration that was wonderfully relaxing .
Although the above excersise was about our self - image , it gives us a start towards finding clues
to the anatomy of entities of any kind .
And even better , we may notice some
direct connections between the anatomy of an entity and our own states of
consciousness .
Lets consider for a moment our
criteria for recognizing something as god or goddess , demon or angel .
There are ,
generally , two major magical operations that involve these critters : invocation and evocation .
Invocation is the drawing into oneself of a quality or
entity ; evocation is the externalization of a quality or entity .
In a
traditional invocation of Hermes , we might visit a temple of Hermes and
contemplate his image , or recite a descriptive poem in his honor , or create a
magick circle and bring into it only those things of Hermetic nature , so that
we might become more Hermetic ourselves .
In a traditional evocation we might
summon a Goetic spirit into a triangle and question it about what would make
life better for us or constrain it to perform some task for us to that same
end .
We perform these operations quite naturally in daily life , outside the
context of magick or mysticism .
When we are inspired by another person or a
work of art , that is a kind of invocation .
When we imagine conversations with
people who arent present , or attempt to verbally convince our computer
connection to go faster , we are engaging in mild forms of evocation .
Lets say that , for the purposes of
this discussion , our entities become useful when we can use them to perform invocation
and evocation willfully and with well - defined intent .
An entity suitable for
invocation could , ideally , change you in some desired way by contemplating the
entity and drawing it into yourself .
An entity suitable for evocation would be
able to impart information or perform tasks according to your will .
In our
Meta -Magical explorations , we hope to discover entities in relation to our own
states and our consciousness , rather than necessarily learning some previous
explorers version of a pantheon .
( And when we all do this , perhaps well find
that we have many of these entities in common . )
As in the preceding exercise , we
begin with an image of the self .
Our hypothesis here is that a self image is
the very essence of entity - recognition .
It is our basic reference point for
consciousness and can also help to reveal our own innate pantheons , the
entities who already inhabit our world of consciousness .
To change that image
from our human self to that of a god , we have to tweak the parameters in order
for that image ( or voice or feeling ) to rise to the level of something useful
in invocation or evocation , something with the potential to change us through
interaction .
Instant God( dess ) :
Decide on a
quality that you either have and would like to enhance , or one that
you dont have and would like to acquire .
For instance , creativity ,
compassion , patience , strength , assertiveness , financial skill ,
adaptability , understanding , concentration , flexibility , love , sex appeal ,
or whatever you decide upon .
Make sure this quality is a positive one ,
that is , it is one that stands on its own and is not expressed as a lack
of something else ( for instance , reduced stress  might be expressed here
as relaxation , no more bad luck might be expressed for these purposes
as good luck and so on ) .
Breathe and
banish .
Imagine a circle around yourself , at about the diameter of
your spread arms .
Sit or stand in the center of that circle .
Fill your
lungs completely , with a slow , even inhalation .
As you inhale , allow your
attention to expand to fill the circle .
As you exhale , slowly , evenly , and
completely , allow your attention to contract to a single point in the
center of your chest .
Repeat at least three times .
Create a
dissociated image of yourself ( an image , voice or feeling of you as if
perceived by another person or in a recording ) , standing or sitting .
Eliminate background and any accessories , objects , props , and so on that
might be in your image , so that the image is just you .
Begin to
adjust the physiology of the imagined person to include more and more
of your desired quality .
Pay attention to and adjust facial expression ,
posture , breathing , movements , skin tone , muscle usage and anything else
that might pertain .
Adjust the
structure of the image ( submodalities ) for greater impact .
Experiment
with image size , color depth and quality , image location , and special
effects such as glows , sparkles , shimmers .
Take each of these to its
greatest intensity  for instance , the image could be increased to much
greater than life - size .
If this image were a god of that particular
quality , how would these submodalities manifest ?
Just how big , bright ,
loud , strong and sparkly is a god( dess ) of x ?
Begin to add
in extra features and aspects from other humans , from animals ,
machines as appropriate to a god( dess ) of this quality .
For instance , if
cunning and strength are useful to this entity , give it some qualities of
a tiger or other animal that might represent those qualities ( head , body ,
teeth , eyes , whatever ) .
If enhanced intelligence or processing speed is
important , then maybe a computer chip or having a computer as an accessory
might work .
Take as much time as is necessary to test out some of these
qualities .
Notice which ones feel the best and keep them .
Have fun with
this and make your image fantastic .
Adjust
physiology to account for the additions .
If you added a computer chip
to the brain , how would that be reflected in facial expression , breathing ,
posture , etc.?
Contemplate
the image for at least 30 seconds .
Pull the image
into the circle with you and draw it into you .
Wear it like clothing ,
wrap it around you , let it interpenetrate your body and mind .
Let your own
body , posture , breathing , facial expression , etc. reflect what you saw in
this image .
Let the memories of this ( future ) self who has already
resolved this basic need be your memories .
Breathe and
banish .
Be open to
thoughts , epiphanies , and suggestions from your unconscious mind that
may occur throughout the day as a result of this practice .
This exercise and the early one are offered
here for demonstration purposes , to give some practical experience of the
relationship between entities and consciousness .
For the most part , entities
produced or contacted in this way are personal ones , not necessarily god or
goddess archetypes familiar to us from the astral storehouse of sacred images .
However , sometimes they do rise to that level and first - time practitioners
occasionally find themselves face - to - face with deities who offer names and
abilities drawn from known pantheons and belief systems .
The exercises demonstrate an extremely stripped - down and basic mode of working .
There are
endless modifications and enhancements to these processes of deriving personal
pantheons from our unconscious minds .
At some point , they become much more than
simple demonstrations of a point  but Ill leave that , for now , to your own
imagination and experience …
( … And before you re off to read the
next article , Ill just note that to fully understand the point that this piece
dances around , no matter how well you think you get it on an intellectual
level , it is most likely necessary to actually perform the experiments .
You
have to look through the microscope and adjust the focus before you really know
what a micro-organism is like .
And it likewise helps to change the focus of
your mind before you really understand the nature of the entities all around us ,
including gods , goddesses , demons , angels , imaginary friends , ideologies ,
corporations , schools of art , mass movements and those mysterious bipeds we
call human .)

The recent The New York Times story about two high school students who did DNA testing on fish shines a light once again on one of the seafood industry ’s dirty little secrets — fish fraud .
They found that one fourth of 60 samples of seafood taken in New York City restaurants and seafood markets were mislabeled .
But with lax FDA regulations and virtually no enforcement , the practice is more common than one would hope .
In recent years , there have been numerous reports of fraud occurring around the country .
Three years ago , a Times investigation also found that fish sold as wild Alaskan salmon by high - end New York City markets was mostly cheaper farm - raised salmon , selling for as much as $ 29 a pound .
( See my previous post Plenty of Safe , Eco-Friendly Fish in the Sea . )
The U.S. Food Drug and Drug Administration , which oversees the safety of our seafood supply , defines fraud as the substitution of a less expensive fish for a more expensive kind , for example , tilapia for red snapper , farmed salmon for wild from Alaska , or basa or tra ( Vietnamese catfish ) for grouper .
Checklist :
How to spot fish fraud
Being informed and knowing your seafood is the best way to arm yourself against fraud .
Some things that should raise red flags are :
A price too good to be true for a highly desired , expensive ( and often depleted ) fish like red snapper or grouper .
for a highly desired , expensive ( and often depleted ) fish like red snapper or grouper .
Out - of - season fish , like wild salmon from Alaska being sold “ fresh ” in winter months .
( It may have been previously frozen , or it may be farmed salmon . )
, like wild salmon from Alaska being sold “ fresh ” in winter months .
( It may have been previously frozen , or it may be farmed salmon . )
Wacky labels you know not to be true , such as “ farmed Chilean seabass ” ( only caught in the wild ) or “ wild Atlantic salmon ” ( an endangered species and not commercially available ) .
If you think you ’re being served a less desirable substitute or a mislabeled fish , press the chef or fish seller for answers .
A good purveyor will be familiar with this issue and should be comfortable addressing your concerns .

Metadata found on Microsoft 's creative copy used in its ' I 'm a PC ' ad reveals that the graphics were actually produced using Macs running Adobe Creative Suite 3 .
After the details were published on the Flickr photo sharing site , Microsoft scrambled to polish off the embarrassing details last night
Microsoft 's new ad features contrasts a " stereotyped PC user " dressed up like John Hodgman in Apple 's Get a Mac ads with a number of people who say , " I'm a PC " apparently to affirm that they run Windows .
However , not even Microsoft itself can wean itself off the Mac , as the metadata discovered by Flickr user LuisDS points out .
Microsoft was not only using Macs but also Adobe 's software in place of its own Expressions Studio , which the company bills as software that " takes your creative possibilities to a new level . "

( CNN ) -- Sarah Palin : politician and mother .
iReporters weigh in on the difficulty of balancing those two roles .
i Reporter Christina
Walker says its very challenging to balance work and caring for her 1 - year - old child .
Since Sen. John McCain named Alaska Go. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential pick , she has been closely scrutinized by both the public and the media .
Palin has served as governor of Alaska for almost two years .
She also has five children , including a 4 - month - old son with Down Syndrome and a 17 - year - old daughter who is 5 - months pregnant .
Her choice to run as the Republican vice presidential nominee has drawn both praise and criticism from the left and right alike .
Now iReporters are asking : Was it the right decision ?
Some feel that Palin 's choice to run shows poor judgment .
" I think she made the wrong call .
It 's not her time , " said Andy Stably of Salem , New Hampshire .
" Given her personal situation and her special circumstances , it does seem more important than the nomination she 's accepting .
I do n't think that should be blanket statement for all moms .
But the job she 's about to interview for is the job of jobs , and it 's going to require her to sacrifice what she has at home . "
Stably has children of his own , and his wife works full - time .
He says this experience has helped shape his views on Palin : " Does n't everyone , male or female , think about the impact a job offer would have on their personal life before accepting the offer ? "
" It 's not a sexist thing , " said Jeanette Lee , who is raising a 15 - month - old baby of her own .
" If my family was having these sorts of issues , I would n't be putting them in the spotlight and making them go through this publicly .
For her to walk away from her baby with special needs just shows her character .
I feel like she should pay more attention to her whole family . "
" If her children were older , it would n't be an issue , " Lee added .
Others feel Palin 's family situation would have a negative impact on her effectiveness as vice president .
" I want my president to be my president .
It is a difficult , sometimes thankless , and emotionally devastating job that requires 100 percent resolve at all times , " said Carlton Madden , from West Monroe , Louisiana .
" I think she has a lot on her plate ... I have no problem with a woman being president , but I 'm going to hold her to the same standards I 'd hold a man .
If [ Obama ] had a pregnant teen daughter and a child with special needs , I 'd have serious reservations about his ability to make a split - second decision , too . "
Christina Walker , of Austin , Texas , who has a 1 - year - old daughter , says her experience as a mom has led her to the same conclusion .
" I opted to change my career path so I could spend more time with my child , and I 'm trying to manage both the career and the child , " she said .
" It 's very challenging , and I 'm not in nearly the type of stressful role that she would be in . "
But some think Palin 's experience as a mom would only make her a better vice president .
Carolyn Jasper of Shreveport , Louisiana , says Palin 's experience as a mother makes her a better candidate because she knows what it 's like to balance life and work and can understand the lives of " regular " Americans .
" I can tell you one thing about being a mom .
You learn real quick how to work through all of life 's huge problems and bring them down to a manageable size , " said Jasper , who has three children of her own .
" I do think she 'll be more capable of understanding what the regular American people need from their government because she is a mom and a family person . "
So is there a double standard at work ?
Some iReporters think so .
" Why are n't we questioning how Obama can raise his kids ? " asked Shawn Strode of Orlando , Florida .
" Mind you , having a Down Syndrome child is going to be more challenging , but are we assuming the dad can't step in and be a parent ?
We automatically assume that first ladies can be great parents and that it wo n't take away from the father being the president .
I do n't think it will affect her job that much . "
" I'm a little tired of hearing about Bristol and her pregnancy , " said Katy Brown , a freshman at Kent State University in Ohio .
" This has nothing to do with the campaign .
It has nothing to do with how well Sarah Palin will lead the country .
... This just shows that they 're a normal family . "
Lisa Stiles , of Richmond , Virginia , has been involved in grassroots campaigning for nuclear energy throughout her career and says Palin inspired her to consider running for office in the future .
She thinks this discussion would never have come up if Palin was a man .
" Are people forgetting that she has a husband ? "
Stiles asked .
" I would think people would be applauding the fact that such a reversal of traditional gender roles is possible . "
And Jordan Saver of Athens , Georgia , believes there is a different kind of sexism going on in the race : " We 're giving [ Palin ] credit for being a mother and a politician , but Barack Obama does n't get credit for being a father and a politician , " he said .
" It 's reverse discrimination .
But if they mentioned it , it would be seen as sexist . "
" It 's the wrong conversation to be having , " added Kathryn Ova of New York City , who describes herself as a " die - hard feminist . "
" Our overall belief system of putting work ahead of family for both men and women is kind of dominating right now .
It 's coming up because she 's a woman , but putting work ahead of family is a major issue regardless of gender . "
Steve Benen over at Political Animal / Washington Monthly notes that McCain ’s recent confusion , thinking Spain was located in Latin America and run by a dictator , is only the most recent of McCain ’s increasingly odd foreign policy gaffes :
Let ’s also not lose sight of the broader pattern .
McCain thinks the recent conflict between Russia and Georgia was “ the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War . ”
He thinks Iraq and Pakistan share a border .
He believes Czechoslovakia is still a country .
He ’s been confused about the difference between Sudan and Somalia .
He ’s been confused about whether he wants more U.S. troops in Afghanistan , more NATO troops in Afghanistan , or both .
He ’s been confused about how many U.S. troops are in Iraq .
He ’s been confused about whether the U.S. can maintain a long - term presence in Iraq .
He ’s been confused about Iran ’s relationship with al Qaeda .
He ’s been confused about the difference between Sunni and Shi’ia .
McCain , following a recent trip to Germany , even referred to “ President Putin of Germany . ”
All of this incoherence on his signature issue .
I ’m curious .
What do you suppose the reaction would be from the political establishment if Barack Obama had made these mistakes over the course of the campaign ?
What would reporters , pundits , and Republicans have to say about Obama ’s ability to lead a complex world in a time of war and uncertainty ?
I think an intellectually honest person would agree that if Obama had made these same mistakes he’d be labeled “ clueless ” on foreign policy .
So , why the double - standard ?
Ed Miliband , the Cabinet Office Minister , told the House of Commons at the time of the loss that there was no evidence national security interests had been damaged or that any individuals or operations were at risk .
Using remarkably sensitive new instruments , seismologists have detected minute geological changes that preceded small earthquakes along California 's famed San Andreas Fault by as much as 10 hours .
If follow - up tests show that the preseismic signal is pervasive , researchers say the method could form the basis of a robust early warning system for impending quakes .
" We 're working with colleagues in China and Japan on follow - up studies to determine whether this physical response can be measured in other seismically active regions , " said Rice University seismologist Fenglin Niu , the study 's lead author .
" Provided the effect is pervasive , we still need to learn more about the timing of the signals if we are to reliably use them to warn of impending quakes . "
Today 's state - of - the - art earthquake warning systems give only a few seconds ' warning before a quake strikes .
These systems detect P - waves , the fastest moving seismic waves released during a quake .
Like a flash of lightning that arrives before a clap of thunder , the fast - moving P - waves precede slower moving but more destructive waves .
Findings from the new study indicate that the stresses measured by the new instruments precede the temblor itself , so a warning system using the new technology would be fundamentally different from current warning systems .
" Detecting stress changes before an earthquake has been the Holy Grail in earthquake seismology for years and has motivated our research , " said study co-author Paul Silver of the Carnegie Institution of Science 's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism .
" Researchers have been trying to precisely and continuously measure these velocity changes for decades , but it has been possible only recently , with improved technology , to obtain the necessary precision and reliability . "
In experiments near Parkfield , California , in late 2005 and early 2006 , Niu , Silver and colleagues from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( LBNL ) gathered two months of measurements at the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth , or SAFOD , a deep well seismologists use to make direct measurements of the fault .
The team installed a high - precision seismic source made by a stack of donut - shaped piezoelectric ceramic cylinders that expand when voltage is applied -- a sophisticated device akin to a stereo speaker -- about one kilometer beneath the surface .
At the same depth in an adjacent well , the scientists set up an accelerometer to measure the rhythmic signals from the source device .
When rocks are compressed , the stress forces air out of tiny cracks in the rock .
This causes seismic waves to travel slightly faster through the rock .
Niu said the variations are so slight they can be measured only with very precise instruments .
For example , though the Parkfield instruments were more than a half mile below ground , the setup was sensitive enough to measure fluctuations in air pressure at the Earth 's surface .
" Scientists tried as early as the 1970s to measure changes in wave speed that are associated with the stress changes that precede seismic activity , " Niu said .
" For a variety of reasons , their measurements were inconclusive .
Using the precision instruments built by our collaborators at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , along with new signal enhancement techniques , we were able to reach the fine level of precision required . "
In analyzing the seismic data , Niu and colleagues found that a distinct change occurred in the rock before each of the minor earthquakes near Parkfield during the test period .
A measurable change preceded a magnitude 3 quake on Christmas Eve 2005 by 10 hours .
This was the largest local event during the observation period .
A smaller but closer magnitude 1 temblor five days later was preceded by a signal about two hours before the quake .

The Telegraph is reporting Sharp US money supply contraction points to Wall Street crunch ahead .
The US money supply has experienced the sharpest contraction in modern history , heightening the risk of a Wall Street crunch and a severe economic slowdown in coming months .
Data compiled by Lombard Street Research shows that the M3 ' ' broad money " aggregates fell by almost $ 50 bn ( £ 26.8 bn ) in July , the biggest one - month fall since modern records began in 1959 .
" Monthly data for July show that the broad money growth has almost collapsed , " said Gabriel Stein , the group 's leading monetary economist .
On a three - month basis , the M3 growth rate has fallen from almost 19 pc earlier this year to just 2.1 pc ( annualised ) for the period from May to July .
This is below the rate of inflation , implying a shrinkage in real terms .


A business owner convicted of defrauding customers seeking male sexual enhancement products and a variety of herbal supplements was sentenced Wednesday to 25 years in prison .
Steve Warshak , 42 , founder of Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals , also was ordered to pay $ 93,000 in fines .
He was convicted in February on 93 counts of conspiracy , fraud and money laundering .
Federal prosecutors accused the company of bilking customers out of more than $ 400 million with deceptive ads , manipulated credit card transactions and refusal to accept returns or cancel orders .
U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel ordered Warshak , his mother , the company and another defendant to forfeit more than $ 500 million , including whatever was available from bank accounts , cars and homes , a grand piano and a membership in a California spa .
Spiegel said it was impossible to calculate exactly how much money was lost by customers , so he accepted a figure based on how much Warshak and the company took in from offenses alleged in the indictments .
Berkeley distributes various products alleged to boost energy , manage weight , reduce memory loss and aid sleep .
The company 's main product , Enzyte , promises sexual enhancement .
" This is a case about greed , " Spiegel said as he reviewed the case .
" Steven Warshak preyed on perceived sexual inadequacies of customers . "
Spiegel said one aspect of the fraud relied on the reluctance of customers to come forward , which would mean admitting they ordered the sexual enhancement pills .
" I do n't see any evidence of remorse or concern for anyone but himself , " Spiegel said .
Warshak told the judge that was not true .
" I do feel deep remorse and would like to apologize to any customer who ever had a bad experience with my company , " he said .
" I apologize to all the great people , the employees of Berkeley — they 've given their heart and soul .
I let them down . "
Spiegel said the company , which likely will be hit with the majority of the forfeiture , will be allowed to remain in business .
Spiegel denied Warshak 's request to remain free on bond pending appeal , but gave him 30 days to wrap up personal business and report to prison .
Warshak 's mother , Harriet Warshak , was sentenced to two years in prison .
She was convicted of conspiracy , bank fraud and money laundering .
Spiegel allowed her to remain free pending appeal and acknowledged that she is 75 , has cancer and likely will never be incarcerated because of the time it takes appeals to work through the courts .
Two other company employees were convicted on related charges and were to be sentenced Thursday , along with some former employees who pleaded guilty to other charges and cooperated with prosecutors .
They testified that the company created fictitious medical endorsements , fabricated a customer - satisfaction survey and made up numbers to back claims about Enzyte 's effectiveness .

Herpes HSV - 1 & HSV -2
" GOOD " VIRUS / " BAD " VIRUS
The Truth about HSV - 1 and HSV-2
How alike are HSV - 1 and HSV - 2 ?
In this feature , we look at the latest scientific facts about the two types of herpes simplex virus , as well as social attitudes toward oral and genital herpes .
When many people first tell someone they have genital herpes , they start by comparing the infection to oral herpes , or cold sores .
How apt is the comparison ?
In spite of scientific facts , the social stigma and emotional attitudes surrounding genital herpes can make it hard to compare it objectively with an oral infection that most people casually accept .
Following the unspoken assumptions of our society , many people still believe there is a " good " herpes virus - HSV - 1 , the usual cause of cold sores - and a " bad " herpes virus - HSV - 2 , the usual cause of genital herpes .
In this feature , we take a look at HSV - 1 and 2 to see how alike and different the two viral types really are .
We asked leading researchers how the two compare in terms of severity , recurrences , and transmission rates .
We asked how often each occurs outside its usual site of preference , and how each behaves in the genital area .
We questioned how much immunity having one type orally or genitally provides against getting the second type .
In addition , we looked at the way our society views oral and genital herpes .
What ’s behind the very different images the two types carry ?
And what can we do about it ?
In an interview , counselors at the National Herpes Hotline suggest ways to help replace judgmental social assumptions with a healthy attitude .
Under a microscope , HSV - 1 and 2 are virtually identical , sharing approximately 50 % of their DNA .
Both types infect the body ’s mucosal surfaces , usually the mouth or genitals , and then establish latency in the nervous system .
For both types , at least two - thirds of infected people have no symptoms , or symptoms too mild to notice .
However , both types can recur and spread even when no symptoms are present .
The primary difference between the two viral types is in where they typically establish latency in the body - their " site of preference . "
HSV - 1 usually establishes latency in the trigeminal ganglion , a collection of nerve cells near the ear .
From there , it tends to recur on the lower lip or face .
HSV - 2 usually sets up residence in the sacral ganglion at the base of the spine .
From there , it recurs in the genital area .
Even this difference is not absolute either type can reside in either or both parts of the body and infect oral and / or genital areas .
Unfortunately , many people are n’t aware of this , which contributes both to the spread of type 1 and to the misperception that the two types are fundamentally different .
" People do n’t understand that you can have type 1 genitally or orally , that the two types are essentially the same virus , ’ says Marshall Clover , manager of the National Herpes Hotline . "
One type is associated with stigma , the other is " ’ just a cold sore " - our society has a euphemism for it so we do n’t even have to acknowledge that it ’s herpes . ”
The common myth is that HSV - 1 causes a mild infection that is occasionally bothersome , but never dangerous .
The reality ?
HSV - 1 is usually mild , especially when it infects the lips , face , or genitals .
However , in some cases type 1 can recur spontaneously in the eye , causing ocular herpes , a potentially serious infection which can lead to blindness .
In very rare cases HSV - 1 can spread spontaneously to the brain , causing herpes encephalitis , a dangerous infection that can lead to death .
HSV - 1 is also the usual cause of herpes whitlow , an infection on the finger , and " wrestler ’s herpes , " ( herpes gladiatorum ) a herpes infection on the chest or face .
The range and potential severity of HSV - 1 infections lead some experts to view the virus as more risky than usually perceived .
" This is heresy , but I think type 1 is a more significant infection than type 2 , " says Spotswood Spruance , MD , an oral HSV specialist at the University of Utah .
" Type 1 , and the morbidity associated with it , are underestimated . "
By comparison , HSV - 2 is widely believed to be a painful , dangerous infection that affects only people with very active sex lives .
The reality ?
Some 22 % of adult Americans from all backgrounds , income levels , and ethnic groups have HSV - 2 . Like HSV - 1 , type 2 is usually mild - so mild that two - thirds of infected people do n’t even know they have it .
Type 2 rarely causes complications or spreads to other parts of the body .
It is the most common cause of neonatal herpes , a rare but dangerous infection in newborns ; however , type 1 causes up to one - third of neonatal infections .
The two types do behave somewhat differently depending on whether they are residing in their site of preference - the mouth and face for HSV - 1 , and the genital area for HSV - 2 .
But both types are quite common , and under most circumstances neither is a major health threat .
That ’s one reason medical professionals tend to dismiss HSV - 2 despite the emotional trauma a diagnosis can cause for a patient .
While HSV can be a frustrating and painful condition for some people , in general the virus is less a medical problem than a social problem .
For most of us , genital herpes is no more dangerous than a cold sore .
How Many Outbreaks ?
Just how much of a physical problem HSV poses for a person depends largely on three factors .
The first is how well the person ’s immune system is able to control the infection .
Differences in immune response may be the main reason that some people are bothered by frequent cold sores or genital herpes outbreaks while others are not .
It ’s also the reason that both HSV - 1 and 2 can pose serious challenges for infants , who have a limited immune response ; and for people with compromised immune systems , including people with cancer , AIDS , severe burns , and people taking immunosuppressant medications .
The second factor affecting outbreaks is how long a person has had the infection .
Over time , recurrences of both HSV - 1 and 2 tend to decrease , for reasons that are n’t entirely clear .
In the case of oral HSV - 1 , many of the approximately 100 million Americans who are infected acquired the virus when they were children .
By the time they ’re adults , only some 5 % of people are bothered enough to consider oral HSV - 1 a medical problem , according to Spruance .
On the other hand , almost all of the approximately 40 million Americans infected with HSV - 2 acquired the virus as teenagers or adults .
In the first year , those who have recurring outbreaks experience an average of four to six episodes .
Over time , as with oral infections , the number of outbreaks usually drops off .
A third factor influencing the frequency of HSV - 1 and 2 outbreaks is whether the virus is established in its site of preference .
While HSV can infect both genital and oral areas , both types cause milder infections when they are away from " home " territory .
Outside their site of preference , both type 1 and 2 lose most of their punch .
For example , most people infected with HSV - 1 in the genital area have few , if any , outbreaks after the initial episode , far fewer than is typical with either oral HSV - 1 or genital HSV - 2 .
While experts estimate that some 30 % of genital herpes infections in the United States may be caused by HSV - 1 , only 2 - 5 % of recurring genital outbreaks are caused by HSV - 1 .
Research conducted by Lawrence Corey , MD , and colleagues at the University of Washington in Seattle shows that genital HSV - 2 recurs 10 times more often than genital HSV - 1 .
According to a study by Wald et al .
( New England Journal of Medicine , 1995 ) , among 110 women with genital herpes , the average number of recurrences per year for those with genital HSV - 1 was zero .
Other studies have shown an average of about one outbreak per year ( Benedetti , Annals of Internal Medicine , 1994 ) .
Similarly , HSV - 2 infection in theoral area - outside its site of preference - very rarely causes problems .
First of all , oral , HSV - 2 infections are rare , for reasons discussed below .
But even when an infection occurs , recurrent outbreaks are uncommon .
In one study ( Lafferty et al. , New England Journal of Medicine , 1987 ) , oral HSV - 2 recurred an average of 0.01 times a year in newly infected people .
" I ’ve never convincingly seen an oral type 2 recurrence , " says Spruance .
A possible fourth factor affecting recurrence rate is viral type .
According to the Lafferty study , genital HSV - 2 infections were the most frequently recurring herpes infections , followed by oral HSV - 1 , genital HSV - 1 , and last of all , oral HSV - 2 .
How Easily Spread ?
As a number of readers have attested over the years , many people with genital herpes are at least as concerned about transmission - the likelihood of spreading the virus to a partner - as about their own health .
On the other hand , few people with oral herpes , share this concern .
Is this because one type is more contagious than the other ?
The short answer is no .
Both viral types are easily transmitted to their site of preference , and can also be spread to other sites .
Both are most contagious during active outbreaks , but are often spread through viral shedding when there are no recognizable symptoms .
According to Spruance , people with recurrent oral HSV - 1 shed virus in their saliva about 5 % of the time even when they show no symptoms .
In the first year of infection , people with genital HSV - 2 shed virus from the genital area about 6 - 10 % of days when they show no symptoms , and less often over time .
( Both of these figures reflect shedding as detected by viral culture . )
From here , however , the question of transmissibility gets more complicated .
Acquisition of one type is more difficult - though certainly possible - if you already have the other type .
This is because either type , contracted orally or genitally , causes the body to produce antibodies , some of which are active against both HSV - 1 and 2 .
This acquired immune response gives some limited protection if the body encounters a second type .
When a person with a prior HSV infection does contract the second type , the first episode tends to be less severe than when no prior antibodies are present .
On a practical level , this means oral HSV - 1 is often the most easily acquired herpes infection .
Usually the first herpes simplex virus that people encounter , oral HSV - 1 , is typically spread simply by the kind of social kiss that a relative gives a child .
Because children have no prior infection with any HSV type , they have no immune defense against the virus .
By the time they ’re teenagers or young adults , about 50 % of Americans have HSV - 1 antibodies in their blood .
By the time they are over age 50 , some 80 - 90 % of Americans have HSV - 1 antibodies .
By comparison , almost all HSV - 2 is encountered after childhood , when people become sexually active .
Those who have a prior infection with HSV - 1 have an acquired immune response that lowers – though certainly does n’t eliminate - the risk of acquiring HSV - 2 .
According to one study ( Mertz , Annals of Internal Medicine , 1992 ) , previous oral HSV - 1 infection reduces the acquisition of subsequent HSV - 2 infection by 40 % .
A prior infection with oral HSV - 1 lowers the risk of acquiring genital HSV - 1 even further .
Studies show that genital HSV - 1 infections almost always occur in people who have no prior infection with HSV of either type ( Corey , Annals of Internal Medicine , 1983 ) .
In the absence of prior oral infection , however , HSV - 1 spreads easily to the genital area , usually through oral sex .
In some countries , such as Japan and parts of Great Britain , genital HSV - 1 is as common as genital HSV - 2 , or more common .
" Prevalence rates of genital HSV - 1 differ based on the practice of oral sex and on the percentage of people who are HSV - 1 positive from childhood , " explains Anna Wald , MD researcher at the University of Washington at Seattle .
Finally , the question of immunity and HSV types is complicated by an additional issue .
Some studies suggest that the ganglia themselves may acquire some immunity to HSV after they are exposed to one viral type .
In the laboratory , infection of ganglia with more than one virus is difficult , suggesting that it may be more difficult to acquire a second HSV type in a location where you already have HSV .
A prior genital infection with HSV - 1 , for example , may give more protection against genital HSV - 2 than a prior oral infection with HSV - 1 .
What does all this mean on a practical level ?
Let ’s look at some examples to find out .
Say you have genital HSV - 1 and your partner has genital HSV - 2 .
If you have unprotected sex , there is a small but real risk that you will get HSV - 2 , resulting in more outbreaks and more shedding .
" We have documented cases where a person acquires HSV - 2 after a prior genital HSV - 1 infection , " says Wald .
" I do n’t think it happens often , but it does happen . "
On the other hand , it ’s very unlikely that your partner will get genital HSV - 1 from you .
" I ’ve never seen a case of a person acquiring HSV - 1 on top of HSV - 2 , " says Wald .
" It ’s possible , but it would be unusual . "
What if your partner has genital HSV - 2 and you perform oral sex on him or her ?
Will you get HSV - 2 in the mouth ?
Given the widespread practice of oral sex ( some three - quarters of all adults practice it , according to The Social Organization of Sexuality , 1994 ) and the prevalence of genital HSV - 2 infection , you might expect oral HSV - 2 to be relatively common .
It ’s not .
According to one study , almost 100 % of recognizable HSV - 2 infection is genital ( Nahmias , Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Diseases Supplement , 1990 ) .
One reason is that most adults are already infected with HSV - 1 orally , which provides some immunity against infection with HSV 2 .
Another reason is that oral HSV - 2 rarely reactivates , so even if an infection does exist , no one knows .
So far we ’ve been talking about transmission of HSV - 1 or 2 from its site of preference .
What about transmission from another site ?
Say you acquire genital HSV - 1 through oral sex .
Can you spread the virus to a partner through genital sex ?
The answer is yes , but probably not as easily as it was spread through oral sex .
The main reason is that the virus reactivates and sheds less often outside its site of preference .
Only about one quarter of people with genital HSV - 1 shed virus at all in the absence of symptoms , while 55 % of people with HSV - 2 do ( Wald , New England Journal of Medicine , 1995 ) .
" Shedding data appear to parallel recurrence data , meaning that people who have a lot of recurrences also have a lot of shedding , " says Wald .
While HSV - 1 can be spread from genitals to genitals , " we think it is spread more easily through oral sex because HSV - 1 reactivates more frequently in the oral area , " says Wald .
However , she warns , " transmission of genital HSV - 1 during asymptomatic shedding has been documented . "
In other words , genital HSV - 1 can be spread through genital sex , even when there are no symptoms .
" Good " Virus / " Bad " Virus
If HSV infection is as easily transmitted from the mouth as from the genitals , then why do people take steps to prevent genital but not oral infection ?
Why do n’t we kiss through dental dams ?
" It ’s ironic , is n’t it ? " says Wald .
" It ’s not about health , it ’s about social acceptability . "
Scientists can tell us all day that the main difference between the two viral types is simply their site of preference - whether they typically occur above the waist or below .
But the unspoken attitudes of our society send a different message .
That ’s just the problem , social attitudes whisper .
Below the waist is bad .
" People think of oral herpes as the " good " herpes and genital herpes as the " bad " kind , " says Glover of the National Herpes Hotline .
" It ’s partly that they do n’t understand the similarities between HSV - 1 and 2 .
But it ’s also that good and bad is how our culture views sex and our bodies . "
The inescapable fact is that HSV - 1 is usually spread through contact with infected lips , while HSV - 2 usually spread through contact with infected genitals .
From a social point of view , the problem is not the disease ; it ’s how you got it .
Whether we like it or not , the social prejudice against genital herpes , no matter which virus causes it , is a reality .
" People have more trouble explaining to a new partner that they have genital herpes , even if it ’s HSV - 1 , than if they have a cold sore , " says Glover .
" Just saying the word " genital " is like an anvil that pulls the sentence down " .
Is this topic making you crazy ?
For people who have trouble dealing with social attitudes toward genital herpes , the blatant double standard society applies to oral herpes can be frustrating , to say the least .
" Talk to a wise friend , " suggests Rebecca , a health communication specialist on the National Herpes Hotline .
" Join a support group .
Find Someone you respect and exchange ideas them .
It ’s always reassuring to see that not everyone lives inside the walls our society builds around sexual issues and realities . "
It ’s also worth hoping that new research on the similarities between HSV - 1 and 2 , as well as increased public education about genital herpes , can help lower the level of misunderstanding about both types of the virus .
Today , the greatest difference between HSV - 1 and 2 appears to be the way we think about them .
Tomorrow , that may change … .

Google Gears is a clever technology that allows social media applications like Google Reader , WordPress , and Remember the Milk to work offline in a browser , no Internet connection required .
Gears has been around in the form of a Firefox plug - in for some time now , but the search giant just posted a beta that brings this functionality to Safari .
Quietly announced in a Google Groups post ( free Google Account required ) , Google wants to make sure that guinea pigs potential users understand that this is a " BETA " ( Google 's caps , not ours ) , as if a Google product has ever been released as anything else .
Once installed , you should be able to visit any Gears - compatible site ( which Google unfortunately does n't keep a running list of ) and click its " Offline " option to , well , go offline .
Each site offers different offline functionality , but with Google Reader , for example , going offline will download the most recent batch of headlines and the associated content for all your subscribed feeds .
At Remember the Milk , a popular web - based and Getting Things Done - inspired task management service , you 'll be able to take your tasks with you , as well as create and manage tasks ( though obviously not e-mail them to friends or coworkers ) .
The popular web - based blogging and CMS software WordPress also incorporated support for Gears in a recent 2.6 release , which facilitates both offline blogging and a zippier UI experience altogether .
A Gears dialog you 'll see when visiting a compatible site
As Google Operating System notes , the list of Gears for Safari issues includes a hint that offline Gears access for Gmail may soon be possible .
While this feature has been talked about almost as long as Gears has existed , it 's nice to see another hint that it 's coming .
Users running at least Safari 3.1.1 on Tiger 10.4.11 and Leopard 10.5.3 can grab the Gears for Safari beta ( direct .DMG link ) , but we 'd like to echo Google 's warning of the perils of beta .
It 's usually easy or even trivial to test beta software on the desktop due to the ease of backing up or simply duplicating Application Support folders and other crucial data , but many of these Gears - compatible web services do n't offer any kind of fail - safe mechanism that you can control .
While there 's very little chance that Gears for Safari could bug out and mark all your RtM tasks as complete , do remember that " beta " truly means " it could very well break and cause your Mac to collapse into its own iBlack hole : beta . "
Even in Google 's world .
ST . PAUL , Minn . |
The McCain campaign , acting through the Republican National Committee , has been negotiating with Rep. Ron Paul to win his support and acquire the names of his sympathizers among the 4,607 delegates and alternates at the Republican National Convention , according to a senior aide to the Texas congressman .
The aim is to try to win support for the John McCain - Sarah Palin ticket from Paul sympathizers , some of whom formally committed to Mr. Paul during his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and others of whom are closet sympathizers of his libertarian brand of Republicanism .
Sen . McCain and national party strategists worry that Mr. Paul ’s sympathizers will vote for Bob Barr , the Libertarian Party candidate and former Republican congressman who shares many of Mr. Paul ’s views .
Mr. Paul has refused to endorse Mr. McCain , and Mr. McCain ’s operatives have refused to let him address the Republican National Convention .
As a result , Mr. Paul decided to hold a rally of his own Tuesday billed as the “ Campaign for Liberty . ”
Initially set to be held at the University of Minnesota ’s 11,000 - seat Williams Arena , it has been moved to the far - larger Target Center in Minneapolis .
Mr. Paul said in an interview that he expects to attract up to 18,000 people .
See Ralph Z. Hallow ’s exclusive interview with Mr. Paul here :
Earlier this year , the congressman shocked the party establishment by twice setting single - day fundraising records during his quest for the Republican presidential nomination .
He has a donors list of about 180,000 people that Paul spokesman Jesse Benton said would do the McCain campaign no good because the loyalty of those donors is not transferable .
Mr. Benton said Mr. Paul is negotiating with convention officials - who are in effect McCain campaign representatives - for permission to make the rounds on the convention floor Wednesday in the company of his personal security guard , communications director and political aides .
Mr. Paul has said he will speak respectfully about Mr. McCain in return for the convention granting the entourage access to the floor of the Xcel Energy Center .
Mr. Paul , as a member of Congress and a member of the Texas delegation , automatically has floor access for himself .
Earlier negotiations to have Mr. Paul address the convention fell through because the congressman would not change his position on the war in Iraq , which he opposes as needless and self - defeating for the United States .
He also was denied permission to address the Republican Platform Committee last week in Minneapolis , Mr. Benton said .
He said Mr. Paul wanted to discuss the foreign - policy planks in the platform , but the McCain forces who controlled the platform proceedings , as well as the Rules Committee and the Credentials Committee , objected .
The McCain campaign is concerned about the impact of Mr. Paul ’s rally Tuesday , which is expected to attract many young , first - time voters and is being referred to in much of the press as a “ counter - convention . ”
Mr. Paul , in an interview with The Washington Times , said he does n’t regard the event as a counter - convention so much as a big - stage training session for future cadres of the party - cadres who see the world Mr. Paul ’s way .
Asked whether he really thinks he can influence the party to be less hawkish on war , he said , “ No , not at the upper level .
You know , I ’m not going to convert [ Vice President ] Dick Cheney .
He ’s going to be always a neoconservative . …
“ But what we are also doing here is training thousands of people and encouraging them to be involved in precinct work , and then getting involved in the Republican Party and have an influence that way . ”
Some conservatives , including several prominent Republicans , privately support Mr. Paul ’s aim , which they see as taking the party back from its neoconservative wing and restoring it to a tradition of limited - government conservatism .
He was asked why he was holding “ training events ” - one of which consists mostly of music groups performing - during the convention ..
“ Because this is where the action is , ” Mr. Paul said with a smile .

Less than two weeks after legalizing same - sex marriages in California , the state Supreme Court had some tough questions Wednesday for a lawyer defending doctors who refused on religious grounds to provide artificial insemination for a lesbian .
The case of Guadalupe Benitez presents the justices with issues of civil rights and discrimination from a different perspective than the one they addressed May 15 , when they overturned the state 's opposite - sex - only marriage law .
Benitez sued North Coast Women 's Care , a fertility clinic in Vista ( San Diego County ) , and two of its doctors who refused in 2000 to provide intrauterine insemination .
She said Christine Brody , her treating physician , and Douglas Fenton , the clinic 's medical director , told her their Christian beliefs prohibited them from furnishing the infertility treatment for a lesbian couple .
Benitez 's lawyers said the doctors gave the same explanation in sworn declarations but asserted in later depositions that they would refuse the treatment to any unmarried couple .
The distinction is potentially important if the case goes to trial because , at the time , California courts had ruled that state law barred businesses from denying service to gays and lesbians but had not yet decided whether the law also prohibited discrimination based on marital status .
The state Supreme Court outlawed such discrimination in 2005 .
It has not said , however , whether it was illegal before then .
The issue at Wednesday 's hearing in San Francisco was whether the doctors , or any business owners or employees , can invoke their religious beliefs to justify refusing to provide service to a particular person or group .
The doctors in Benitez 's case are asking the court to let them rely on their religion as a defense in her pending damage suit .
" The law should not allow one side to trump another side 's rights , " said Kenneth Pedroza , lawyer for the doctors and the clinic .
Arguing that California 's Constitution contains an ironclad guarantee of religious freedom , Pedroza said the rights of doctors and patients can both be served as they were in this case , when his clients referred Benitez to a physician elsewhere who was willing to provide artificial insemination .
The treatment did not succeed in impregnating her , but she later became pregnant through other means and is raising three children with her partner .
Pedroza was questioned skeptically by Justice Carol Corrigan , who dissented from the court 's 4 - 3 marriage ruling and argued that the rights of gays and lesbians to wed should be conferred by the people and not the courts .
On Wednesday , Corrigan suggested there are only two legal options for doctors with strong religious beliefs :
Choose a field of practice that does n't conflict with those beliefs or provide their services to anyone who needs them .
Corrigan said Pedroza 's clients had told Benitez , in effect , " I am not going to do it for you because of who you are . "
No , Pedroza replied , each doctor had simply let Benitez know that " I am not going to compromise my sincerely held religious belief . "
Chief Justice Ronald George , author of the majority opinion on same - sex marriage , also challenged Pedroza , asking whether he would claim a right for doctors to deny service to ethnic minorities on religious grounds .
Pedroza said he that knows of no religious doctrine that forbids any type of medical treatment for minorities but that the law must accommodate any doctor who sincerely holds such a belief .
A ruling is due in 90 days .
After the hearing , Benitez , 36 , said she was n't trying to interfere with the doctors ' religious beliefs .
But she said they needed to be reminded that they are in the business of practicing medicine , " not abandoning the patient . "
It hurts " to be told you 're not worthy of being a mother or having a child , " said Benitez , standing alongside Joanne Clark , her partner of 18 years .
The court has rejected others ' claims that they are exempt from civil rights laws because of their religious beliefs .
In 1996 , the justices required a landlady to rent to an unmarried couple despite her religious objections , saying she must follow the law or find another vocation .
A 2004 ruling required Catholic Charities to abide by a state law that required company - sponsored health plans to offer contraception for women .
The court said Catholic Charities , which serves and employs many non-Catholics , did not qualify for the exemption the law provides to religious employers .
Benitez 's lawyer , Jennifer Pizer of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund , said Wednesday that those rulings provide ample authority for the court to require all doctors to abide by the state 's Unruh Act , which protects business customers against discrimination .
She said doctors who have religious or moral objections to a certain procedure or treatment - abortion , for example - can refuse to provide it to anyone but can not be selective .
" Doctors can choose their procedures , " Pizer told the court , " but they can't pick and choose among their patients . "
The case is North Coast Women 's Care Medical Group vs. Superior Court ( Benitez ) , S142892 .
Shadegg : GOP leaders made " stupid claim " by blaming Pelosi speech
Republican Rep. John Shadegg said Tuesday that House Minority Leader John Boehner and other Republican leaders made a “ stupid claim ” by alleging that Nancy Pelosi ’s speech changed any minds on the bailout .
“ I do believe that we could have gotten there today had it not been for this partisan speech that the speaker gave on the floor of the House , ” said Boehner after the failed vote on the bailout package .
His leadership colleagues endorsed the opinion .
Rep. Eric Cantor waved a copy of Pelosi 's speech and said the bailout went down because of Pelosi .
Shadegg said that he does n't know of a single GOP vote that shifted because of the speech .
On Monday evening , Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - Calif. ) , a lead opponent of the bailout , told the Crypt that the notion was " nonsense " and mocked the possibility that a Republican would be shocked or offended by the partisan nature of a Democratic speech .
However , Shadegg was optimistic that Congress would soon pass some version of the bailout .
“ The Jewish holiday intervened or we would pass this bill today , ” he said .
UPDATE : Via Roll Call , Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) also douses the GOP leadership rationale .
Her rebuttal makes three members so far rejecting their own leadership on the record -- though it 's not quite as sharp a rejection as the vote itself .
Democrats are having fun with it , too .
Witness Rep. Barney Frank 's ( D - Mass . ) response .
Told of the Pelosi - speech explanation , he challenged Republicans to tell him who the 12 offended members of their party are and he will " talk uncharacteristically nicely to them and tell them what wonderful people they are " -- in exchange for them switching their votes back .

This will give you a better idea as to which ones work the best .
The fact is that not all of these products are effective , so you ’ll have to do this research .
Avoid any products or websites that have a ton of negative reviews .
Keep an eye out for negative reviews that all say the same things .

Take some time to look for these coupons so you can get exactly what you need for less .
You will be able to use the coupon codes you find when checking out on a certain site .
Make sure that the codes you collect are not expired .
You also need to know what the terms and / or limitations of each one are .
Most coupons come with a catch of some kind that you ’ll want to know about .
The more time you spend looking for these coupons , the more money you can expect to save .

Compare Deals
When you are shopping for CBD online , make sure that you compare deals on the same products from various retailers .
This is a great method of getting what you need at the lowest possible price .
Some businesses sell these products for more than others .
You do n’t want to get the absolute cheapest stuff you can find though .
You typically get what you pay for with CBD , but there is always a way to save money on it .
Take as much time as you need to compare what different retailers have to offer before buying anything at all .
The internet is a truly great resource for purchasing Cannabidiol , but you must take your time and follow these tips .
It can be too easy to get ripped off or purchase an inferior product if you are in a hurry and do n’t do what you have to .
If you know anyone else who buys these products , ask them where they get theirs .
A personal referral can be a great way to find a reputable business to get your CBD from .
As long as you follow this advice , you should be able to get what you need without any hassle or regrets .

Opening Up I am currently in an open relationship and both my partner and I find it immensely satisfying .
We are best friends of the quintessential “ call up at 4 am about anything ” kind .
We can turn to each other for anything we need , physically and emotionally .
I thank the fates every day for bringing this wonderful , beautiful woman into my life .
We connect so well that people often comment that we are exact duplicates of each other .
We love each other , but not in the traditional sense–rather in a ‘ best buds ’ kind of way .
We enjoy our intimacy and our mutual desire for one another , but we both have a very healthy sex drive and do not limit ourselves .
We both sex outside our relationship .
It ’s all well and good , and we have a nice , cozy arrangement in place .
What could possibly be the problem ?
Recently her parents found out about this arrangement of ours , on account of family friends of hers who had no business poking their nose into our affairs .
While her parents are fairly liberal in matters of love and sex , they have expressed strong misgivings about the kind of relationship their daughter and I have .
Me ?
I do n’t give a damn about what anyone thinks of my personal life .
But my partner is very close to her parents and wants them to approve of our relationship .
She has convinced her parents to have a sit - down with both of us and talk things over .
I can see her parents ’ point of view — I guess they want to make sure that I do n’t hurt their “ little girl ” in any way .
But I ’m also terribly flustered at the thought of discussing our relationship with them .
I ’ve never met them before and , quite frankly , I do n’t know what I could possibly say to them to make them feel better about this .
Her parents live in Hyderabad and they are coming down to Chennai in a couple of weeks to meet with us .
I ’m usually a big fan of the “ be yourself ” model of living , but I ’m not entirely sure that being myself is such a good idea in this particular case .
Any suggestions as to how I should go about this ?
– Being Myself Could Cause Trouble
I have to say , it ’s rare for me to get letters where it truly seems like everyone involved has the best of intentions and is approaching the situation with maturity and grace .
You and your partner seem to have a lot of mutual respect and her parents also appear to be willing to at least try to understand their daughter ’s relationship decisions .
When everyone is coming to the table as caring adults and not hysterical , judgmental harpies , then I think it ’s safe to say that half the battle has already been won .
Way to go , letter - writer .
That being said , you and your partner both have to acknowledge the limits of what reasonable discussion accomplish .
It ’s very clear from your letter that the two of you have a healthy and trusting relationship and that you figured out how to the non-exclusivity thing really well .
However , it ’s also natural for people who care about you both to be concerned — open relationships are not the most common romantic arrangement , and realizing that your child has a loving , romantic partnership that is n’t sexually exclusive can be a very disconcerting thing .
My advice ?
I think your partner should have this pow - wow with her parents alone .
As it is , they ’re going to feel discombobulated and wrong - footed about the whole thing discussion , and it ’s best not to add to their confusion by asking them to meet the man behind the myth before they ’ve even had a chance to digest the particular ins - and - outs ( so to speak ) of your relationship .
Also , these are her parents , not yours , and if she cares so much about their approval then she needs to take responsibility for seeing that she has it .
I would also advise you two to be patient and not get your expectations too high ; this kind of disclosure can take a long time to settle in , and her parents are not going to be accepting and happy - go - lucky about this after just one sit - down .
Getting them to accept and approve of your relationship is going to require a whole series of conversations , and the more easygoing you both are about this , the more likely it is that the ‘ rents feel reassured .
I highly recommend checking out the message boards at the website Opening Up for more advice on handling families as part of an open relationship .
( Opening Up is a support and resource website for people in non-monogamous relationships , run by sex columnist , writer , and sex education Tristan Taormino . )
On a final note , you mentioned that your partner ’s parents found out about your relationship through nosy family friends ?
Do you mind my asking how exactly the family friends got in the loop ?
The only reason why I ’m wondering is because it ’s just possible your partner told them about it .
If that ’s the case , then I suggest have an honest conversation with her about how you ’re both feeling about the non-monogamous nature of your relationship .
If indeed your partner did tell them , it ’s entirely possible that your she was seeking their approval or their advice , and that she might not be feeling as positive about your relationship as you do .
I do n’t at all doubt the sincerity of your regard for her , but it ’s a good idea to make sure you ’re both on the same page before moving forward .
Good luck , you crazy cut-ups !

The Virgin Spring I am a 21 - year - old man .
How do I know if a girl is really a virgin ?
My girlfriend has told me she ’s a virgin , but I ca n’t be sure .
Thanks , and be cool .
– Inquiring Mind
You do n’t know , my inquiring young friend .
That ’s kind of the point : virginity is irrelevant .
The traditional evidence that a woman is a virgin is the presence of the hymen , a piece of membrane that covers the external opening of the vagina .
The hymen tears during a woman ’s first sexual intercourse ; hence , the tradition in many conservative religious families of displaying the bloody sheets after a newly - married couple has consummated their relationship for the first time .
However , there are innumerable ways for a woman ’s hymen to tear before she ’s ever had intercourse — during sports activities , using a tampon , random jostling — and some women are n’t even born with a hymen .
There are also endless ways to fake the first bleeding ( inserting a pouch of goat ’s blood being among the more gross methods ) , and with the popularity of hymen - reconstruction surgery on the surge in Europe , there ’s just no way of knowing what the hymen even means anymore .
( I point you to the 2006 case in France where a Muslim man had his marriage to a Muslim woman annulled the next day because he discovered she was not really the virgin she claimed to be before the wedding .
This court decision was initially supported by France ’s justice minister — a Muslim woman– and sparked a wave of requests in hymen - reconstruction surgeries in Europe . )
All this just goes to show that virginity is n’t really important and it ’s damn near impossible to prove anyway .
Honestly , why do you care ?
So what if your girlfriend may have had premarital sex ?
If she ’s lying , it ’s probably because she correctly suspects that you ’re the kind of dude who ’d freak out about it , which is totally lame on your part .
If she ’s telling the truth , well , there it is .
I have n’t noticed any great assertions of virginity on your part , so why does it matter if she ’s one or not ?
All I can say is , be cool .

Noodles !
I am 26 and a happily married housewife with a 6 year - old son .
My husband and I share a very passionate relationship .
He is very experimental and liberal about sex .
During oral love making sessions he often asks me to swallow his semen .
He says that semen is full of vitamins and nutrients and is very good for the health .
But recently , one of my girlfriends told me that semen contains a lot of fat content .
I am a little overweight so I ’m concerned about this .
My second doubt is regarding my attire at home .
Although my husband wants me properly dressed in public , he wants me to be very sexy at home , especially at night when nobody else is at home other than our son .
He wants me to go topless after nine , sometimes doing the cooking and serving of food in the semi-nude .
As I said above , my son is very young so I ’m a little reticent about this .
My husband says that there is nothing wrong in letting my son look at my breasts and that it will help him develop a healthy attitude towards females and the human body .
What is your opinion on these matters ?
– Hot In The Kitchen
To address your first question , semen is perfectly harmless to ingest , provided it ’s STD - free .
Semen does n’t have high fat content , but it ’s definitely protein - rich and contains trace amounts of zinc , amino acids , vitamin C , and other good stuff .
The amount of semen that the average male ejaculates is between 1.5 and 5 milliliters .
( To put that number in perspective , the average chicken egg — another excellent source of protein — contains 43 milliliters of fluid . )
So yes , semen contains a number of nutrients and has a lot of protein , but the amount you ’d be ingesting is so small that it would n’t affect your diet or health anyway .
As long as you do n’t personally mind swallowing , I would n’t worry too much about it .
As for your other concern , girl , are you nuts ?
Let me just ask you this simple question : if your mother or father made a habit of walking around the house with their dangly bits waving around , would n’t you feel a little , I do n’t know , weird about the whole thing ?
Especially after you ’d hit adolescence ?
There ’s a reason why parents and children are supposed to maintain sexual distance , and it ’s because you start getting into very creepy territory when you close that gap .
Parents should definitely talk to their children about sex in an honest and non-judgmental way by providing information , answering questions , and being supportive of their kids , but I guarantee you that no child ever wants to hear or know about the down - and - dirty details of their parents ’ sex life .
Instilling a healthy respect for sex and the body is very different from actually parading your noodles around .
Your husband is asking you to make your child an unwilling and non-consenting observer of your sexual activities , and saying it ’s for his own good is completely disingenuous .
If your husband wants you to make the rotis in the buff when no one else is around , more power to the both of you .
But when your kid is in the house ?
That ’s a definite no go .

Lesbians On
The March I have noticed that you rarely publish letters by lesbian or bisexual women in your column .
What ’s up with that ?
– Represent Excellent question , grasshopper .
It ’s absolutely true , I do n’t print very many questions from lesbian and bisexual women , primarily because I do n’t get very many questions from lesbian and bisexual women .
A good ninety percent of the e-mails I get are from men .
I ’ve wondered about this for a while , and my feeling is that despite the fact that I promise anonymity for all letter - writers , most women are simply too uncomfortable to send even a confidential letter to my column .
And with good reason — if a woman sends me a letter about her sex life , she ’s taking much more of a risk than a man .
The consequences for a woman admitting to not always having pure , heterosexual thoughts and desires are far graver than for men , and I think the fear of being judged and punished is so ingrained in women that very little can make us feel safe .
So let me put this out there for all you women readers , particularly the lesbian and bisexual ones : your letters are safe with me .
I do not reveal names , I usually try to remove all identifying markers from letters , and I will never show your letter or share your contact information with anyone else .
I invite your letters and I will do everything I can to represent your concerns in the column .
Also , I invite all my women readers to weigh in : why do you think that women do n’t send in questions as frequently as men ?
Send in your responses and I ’ll print them in next week ’s column .

Anarchists who had threatened to “ crash the convention ” wreaked havoc Monday in downtown St. Paul as the Republican National Convention opened , shattering windows , throwing rocks , slashing tires and blocking traffic .
Their violence on the first day of the convention overshadowed an anti-war march that drew a fraction of the number expected .
The march , which sparked at least three free - speech court challenges , came off without a hitch .
But breakaway groups of anarchists — some clad in black and others dressed as colorfully as clowns — kept police busy .
Nearly 300 people had been arrested as of late Monday night .
Spasms of violence erupted throughout downtown as tear gas was fired and protesters — some angry , some insistent on dancing amid the chaos — played a game of cat - and - mouse as police , backed up by 150 Minnesota National Guard soldiers , alternately accommodated , confronted and chased roving bands intent on disrupting the convention .
Organizers of the Coalition to March on the RNC and End the War estimated 30,000 people showed up to march from the state Capitol to the Xcel Energy Center .
They had expected 50,000 .
Police put the crowd at about 10,000 .
Signs spoke to every cause at the march : “ 9 - 11 was an inside job , ” “ Bush lied , thousands died ” and “ I love my country but fear my government . ”
Sue from Alexandria ( she would n’t give her last name ) held the last sign : “ We ’re going in the wrong direction , ” she said .
“ I ’m so totally fed up .
I do n’t know why there are n’t a million people here protesting . ”
A group carrying an Industrial Workers of the World banner directed its message to officers in riot gear lining the side streets along the route on Seventh Street .
“ No justice , no peace , police off the streets , ” they shouted .
“ Tell me what a police state looks like .
This is what a police state looks like . ”
Kelly Moreno , of South St. Paul , carried a sign that read , “ Unjust war : What would Jesus do ? ”
“ It was beautiful .
It was peaceful , ” Moreno said of the march .
CHAOS DOWNTOWN
Off the main march route , though , rogue protesters sporadically caused chaos , making good on their slogan to “ crash the convention . ”
Impromptu roadblocks , slashed tires and broken windows kept phalanxes of police on the move as the protesters — many in dark clothes with bandanas over their faces — weaved through the streets .
Some of the most violent protesters left broken windows , overturned garbage containers and trash - strewn streets .
About 1:20 p.m. , a group blocked John Ireland Boulevard between Kellogg Boulevard and 12th Street .
They danced and sang , “ We ’re not gonna take it anymore ! ”
Several started heading toward 12th Street and tried to block police vehicles with a trash bin .
As they continued down 12th Street , they picked up traffic signs , sandbags and garbage and threw them into the street .
Police squads followed , blaring horns and sirens .
About 3:25 p.m. , at Kellogg Boulevard and Minnesota Street , protesters stopped traffic , dancing in the street and playing music .
Some dumped trash and threw plastic news boxes .
“ Delegates on the bus , delegates on the bus ! ” protesters shouted as they crowded in front of a bus .
A Bloomington police officer got on a bullhorn and told the group , “ This is your final warning . ”
Officers in riot gear stood in a line on Kellogg .
They were backed by National Guard troops with riot shields .
As some demonstrators threw glass bottles , law enforcement responded with tear gas , pepper spray and even a concussion grenade to break up the crowd .
Bystanders on a nearby sidewalk gagged and coughed .
A half - hour later , a group headed down Robert Street , then east toward Mears Park .
Police followed close behind .
“ The whole world ’s watching , ” protesters shouted .
Police shouted , “ Move ! Move ! ”
At Seventh and Jackson streets , officers on horses and on foot cornered protesters and ordered them onto the ground , spraying pepper spray .
Some lay on the ground and were arrested .
Witnesses said 40 to 50 people were arrested , including Amy Goodman , host of the left - wing radio show “ Democracy Now ! ”
She was later released .
Also arrested Monday was Associated Press photographer Matt Rourke .
However , the AP reported that he was being released and Ramsey County prosecutors did n’t anticipate charges .
Downtown workers and visitors often were caught in the shifting melees .
Employees at the parking lot at Fourth and Minnesota streets , for example , complained of burning eyes and skin from a police confrontation at Kellogg .
Jared Kronberg , working the Joe ’s Hot Dog stand in Mears Park , said he was gassed as police confronted protesters about 2:30 p.m .
“ The park board told us the protests were never going to get this far , ” he said , closing his cart for the day .
“ This is ridiculous . ”
Jim Meehan , of St. Paul , was sitting down for a beer at Alary ’s Bar when he saw a group of protesters running past him on Seventh Street .
“ They were being chased by cops on bikes and on horses , ” he said .
Meehan said a protester on a bicycle was tackled by a Minneapolis officer on a bike , then shocked with a Taser repeatedly .
“ You could just hear him shrieking .
It was ugly .
The guy was not fighting back , ” he said .
In the late afternoon , officers encountered an “ organized group ” of people on Shepard Road who had shields and gas masks and were throwing rocks , bottles and bags of feces at officers , St. Paul police Cmdr. Doug Holtz said .
Officers shot bean bags at the group , Holtz said .
About 100 people were arrested .
As of 10:15 p.m. Monday , the arrest tally had reached 284 , authorities said , and the figure was expected to climb .
Those arrested so far included cases of 130 felonies , 51 gross misdemeanors and 103 misdemeanors .
DELEGATES HASSLED
Some delegates were confronted on their way to the Xcel Energy Center .
A rock was thrown through the windshield of the Alabama delegates ’ bus , showering the driver and retired Alabama Supreme Court judge Terry Butts with glass .
Masked protesters confronted the Connecticut delegation , and several delegates were spat upon , roughed up and doused with a mixture of water and bleach .
Heath Fahle , director of the Connecticut Republicans , said the incident happened on Kellogg Boulevard about 2 p.m .
“ It was frightening , ” he said .
He said the delegation of more than 100 got off their chartered buses near the X .
As they walked on the sidewalk , masked protesters chanting anti-war slogans appeared in front of them .
They linked arms , trying to create a human barricade .
As police on horseback arrived , Fahle and other delegates tried to push through .
Most of them escaped unscathed , but the protesters splattered the last group of delegates with the liquid .
Former U.S. Rep. Rob Simmons was hit in the face with the liquid .
He was outraged .
“ We were attacked by a mob , ” he said .
“ We were subjected to violent and anarchist behavior by a bunch of thugs . ”
The area was supposed to be secured , he said , “ but this was a breach in security , obviously . ”
INTERRUPTIONS
Buses were canceled , uncanceled and then re-canceled .
Bridges across the river were abruptly closed , leading to confusion as families tried to walk to a Labor Day festival on Harriet Island .
Detour and traffic plans were useless , and downtown businesses and residents lost access to their buildings during confrontations .
In addition , the city ’s only detour south of the Xcel Center , Shepard Road , was closed for hours during a mass arrest .
Metro Transit temporarily suspended bus service in downtown St. Paul for about three hours in the afternoon because of traffic congestion caused by protest activity .
Still , police said the day went as planned .
St. Paul Police Chief John Harrington said the anarchists ’ “ mission by their own words ” had been to block the delegates from getting to the convention , “ storm the gates to the convention ” and to keep the convention goers from being able to leave .
Those things did n’t happen , Harrington said .
The “ first salvo ” was about 11 a.m. , when a group of people set a trash bin on fire and pushed it into a squad car near Grand and Smith avenues , Harrington said .
At various times , people threw liquid , “ gas of their own ” and rocks at officers , Harrington said .
“ Unfortunately today , a very small handful of individuals decided to break the law , damage property and put people ’s safety at risk , ” Mayor Chris Coleman said .
“ We saw years of training on the part of our police officers that have paid off today .
They were well trained , well deployed , they were skilled , they were restrained and they kept the situation from getting out of control . ”
There were about 10,000 peaceful protesters , Coleman said .
“ As we ’ve said before … we will not allow that activity to take place , to the extent that we can prevent it .
We ’re going to continue to maintain control in the city of St. Paul , ” he said .
Coleman said he watched on police security cameras as officers were assaulted from behind and protesters broke the windows of businesses and police cars .
“ That wo n’t stand in the city of St. Paul , ” he said .
Plans today include :
The RNC Welcoming Committee will hold a 9 a.m. meeting at 400 N. Western Ave. in St. Paul .
The Poor People ’s Economic Human Rights Campaign will march from Mears Park in downtown St. Paul to the Xcel Energy Center at 4 p.m .
( CNN ) -- Monday I did an interview in the Election Center with Sen. John McCain 's campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds .
The interview was about Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's experience and readiness to be commander in chief .
The interview became a bit of a lightning rod .
CNN 's Campbell Brown interviews McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds .
Over the last few days , I have received thousands of e-mails .
For those who did n't see the interview , you can read it or view it below .
McCain 's campaign got upset about that interview .
McCain officials told CNN I had crossed a line and they canceled a scheduled appearance by McCain on " Larry King Live . "
I do n't think the interview was over the line .
Neither does CNN .
And neither do most of you who e-mailed me this week .
Thank you , all of you who e-mailed me , including those who disagree .
We 're always interested in getting past talking points and exploring the issues in any political interview .
You have a right to know the people you are voting for .
Our pledge to you on this program is to ask the tough but fair questions and to try to get answers .
REAL answers .
Here is a transcript of the interview : Watch Brown interview Bounds »
BROWN : We have Tucker Bounds joining us who is a spokesman for the McCain campaign .
We want to have an opportunity to talk to him a little bit about this .
And , Tucker , you there ?
BOUNDS : Yeah , Campbell .
Can you hear me ?
BROWN : Good .
Yeah .
We got you in the chair .
I 'm glad you 're with us .
Thanks so much for taking time and joining us tonight .
I want to begin by asking , you know , what we 've been discussing before you sat in the chair , Gov. Palin sharing a difficult personal story today , the news her unmarried teenage daughter is pregnant .
She plans to have the baby , to marry the father .
Explain to us when John McCain first learned about this .
BOUNDS : He learned about it during the vetting process before his selection .
He did not consider it a disqualifier .
Gov. Palin has a long record of reforming Alaska , taking on the establishment for 13 years .
She started out as a civic activist in the PTA , went to the city counsel , on to the mayor of her small town , took on big oil in the oil and gas commission in Alaska then to the governor 's office where she 's made serious bipartisan reforms .
That 's the reason she was selected .
Certainly her personal family matters never disqualified her from serving public office , serving a higher office in a cause greater than herself .
That 's John McCain 's message .
She fits it perfectly and we 're happy to have her .
BROWN : Tucker , though , this obviously putting this young woman , Bristol Palin , smack in the media spotlight at what 's already got to be a very challenging time in her life , I mean , how do you respond to people who wonder why her mother would have subjected her to this kind of scrutiny by accepting this high - profile position ?
BOUNDS : I think Gov. Palin understands that these are serious times .
We have serious challenges and it's time to shake up Washington .
It was the reason she was happy to take John McCain 's invitation to go to Washington , make the changes that Americans needs and Americans depend on .
She 's an expert on energy .
She understands we need an all of the above energy approach that includes the alternatives and the renewable fuels .
This is an important decision .
I think it 's dangerous to confuse her civic decision to get involved and make a difference in the country with a family matter --
BROWN : I understand that .
I recognize that .
In an ideal world , it would be private .
You know , this is a presidential campaign .
Nothing is private .
The world is watching .
And if we , you know , as much as everyone might want to give this young woman her privacy , you know that 's not going to happen .
And so you do risk putting her through an incredibly difficult process by accepting this job if you 're her mother .
You can't deny that , right ?
BOUNDS : The Palin family made clear in their statement that they were hoping and continue to hope that this will be a private family matter .
That was their intention from the very beginning .
Media inquiries and attention are going to happen in the campaign .
They understand that .
It 's important for us as we have a conversation with voters of how we can change Washington , how we can move forward and take on the big challenges that Americans expect of their public officials that we keep a private matter private among their family .
Certainly all of us , certainly the members of the media would expect that from Americans .
That 's the way we 're proceeding .
BROWN : Tucker , foreign policy experience has been a huge issue in this campaign because you guys made it a big issue , pointing out John McCain has far more experience than Barack Obama and nothing in your view is more important than the campaign .
I do n't have to tell you there 's a feeling out there by some that you 're not holding your VP pick to your own standard , the standard you define .
So explain to us why you think Gov. Palin is ready to be commander in chief .
BOUNDS : Gov. Palin has the good fortune of being on ticket with John McCain who there is no question is the most experienced and shown proven judgment on the international stage .
He understands foreign affairs .
BROWN : We know all that about John McCain , Tucker .
I asked you about her .
We all know the role of the VP as John McCain defined it is to be able to step into the job of the presidency on day one .
I 'm asking you about her foreign policy experience .
BOUNDS : Yeah , Campbell , there are a number of people supporting Barack Obama 's candidacy and feel he 's experienced enough to take on the Oval Office .
Our feeling is --
BROWN : You 're not answering my question --
BOUNDS : Just as much experience as Barack Obama .
BROWN : OK .
So does she -- you -- what I 'm saying is that you set a different standard by arguing how important it was with John McCain .
No one 's arguing with you he has much more experience than Barack Obama , so I 'm trying to get someone from the campaign to explain to me what foreign policy experience or qualifications she has that would allow her to be ready to be commander in chief if something should happen to Sen. McCain .
BOUNDS : Well , Campbell , let me be clear .
I do n't think there should be problem explaining her experience .
She has executive state level experience .
She 's been in public office reforming Washington .
She 's been in executive office longer and in a more effective sense than Barack Obama 's been in the United States Senate .
She 's been the commander of the National Guard of the Alaska National Guard that 's been deployed overseas .
That 's foreign policy experience .
BROWN : If I can interrupt for one second because I 've heard you guys say this a lot .
Can you tell me one decision that she made as commander in chief of the Alaska National Guard , just one ?
BOUNDS : Yeah .
She 's made -- any decision she has made as the commander of the National Guard that 's deployed overseas is more of a decision Barack Obama 's been making as he 's been running for the president for the last two years .
BROWN : So tell me .
Tell me .
Give me an example of one of those decisions .
I 'm curious , just one decision she made in her capacity as commander in chief of the National Guard .
BOUNDS : Campbell , certainly you do n't mean to belittle , every experience , every judgment she makes as commander --
BROWN : I 'm belittling nothing .
I want to know one judgment or one decision .
I want to know what one decision was .
I 'm not belittling anything , I am curious .
BOUNDS : As she makes a decision how to equip or how to command the national guard in Alaska , that is more --
BROWN : But Tucker , those are the Pentagon 's decision , that 's Gen .
Petraeus , that 's the White House .
BOUNDS : Pardon me ?
BROWN : No governor makes decisions how to equip or deploy the National Guard .
When they go to Iraq , those are decisions made by the Pentagon .
BOUNDS : Campbell , on factual basis , they certainly do .
In Alaska , if I have an emergency in your state , the National Guard is under the command of the governor .
That is more of a command role than Barack Obama has ever had .
I would argue John McCain and Gov. Palin between the two of them have far more command experience in military than either of the candidates on the Democratic side .
I do want to argue this is about the top of the ticket .
Ultimately when people go into the ballot box and decide between Barack Obama and John McCain , they will decide between John McCain 's record of reforming Washington and Barack Obama 's rhetoric on the campaign trail , does n't have a lot of experience , certainly has no command or military experience , which both our candidates have .
That 's an important distinction I think voters will make the right call in November .
BROWN : All right .
Tucker , I 'm just going to give it to you , baby .
We 'll end it there .
BOUNDS : Appreciate it .
BROWN : I appreciate you coming on and taking the time to have this debate .
I think it 's important .
People do n't know a lot about her .
They want to understand her qualifications as much as possible .
We 're not beating you up here .
We 're not trying to .
We 're just trying to educate ourselves and educate our viewers .
So I really do appreciate your time and thank you for your time coming on .
Google 's persistent interest in ensuring that the US ' 700MHz spectrum would give rise to a network open to any and all devices reinforced its belief that carriers can and should be nothing more than the proverbial " dumb pipes " -- leave the content and hardware to the people who know how to do it and do n't necessarily have a vested interest in the carriers ' bottom line .
That attitude foretold that it had some interesting ideas up its sleeves ( this is Google , after all ) , and while it 's never been entirely clear what those ideas are , Android 's " please use it , it 's free " attitude certainly plays a role .
Here 's another piece of the puzzle : rather than be tied down to any one carrier , why not keep changing carriers in real time based on whomever 's going to give you the best deal ?
A new patent filed by Mountain View 's finest proposes exactly that , bringing together heterogeneous technologies -- " community - wide " networks like WiFi and WiMAX along with GSM , CDMA , and so on -- and an " auction system " that would let the user select ( or allow the phone to automatically select ) the best deal at the moment depending on their needs ( available features or minimum speeds , time limits , and so on ) .
It 's an amazing idea that totally turns the contract concept on its head , and it's an idea that carriers would fight to the death .
We 're not seeing it happening , but hey , Google , we like the cut of your jib .

Asus has shipped recovery DVDs with some of its notebooks that reportedly have software cracking applications and confidential Microsoft documents in directories on the DVDs .
The software resides in a folder on the disc conveniently labeled " Crack . "
The software cracking application is for WinRAR compression software , and PC Pro reports that one of its readers ' anti-virus software was triggered by the key cracker for WinRAR .
Other items that showed up on the recovery DVD included a large number of confidential Microsoft documents intended for viewing by PC manufacturers only .
The Microsoft documentation included program files and associated keys , and various bits of internal Asus documents and source code for Asus software were also thoughtfully included .
One interesting piece of software on the DVD is a PowerPoint presentation that outlines major problems Microsoft has identified , including problems with application compatibility .
The same files have been found on other recovery DVDs included with Asus computers .
PC Pro reports that its reader even found personal files of Asus employees — including resumes .
Several other users are also now reporting the same files on Asus DVD recovery disks ;
Asus apparently has a widespread problem on its hands .
Asus , best known for its
Eee netbooks , has responded telling PC Pro , " We will be investigating this at quite a high level .
Once the investigation is complete , we will ensure it does n't happen again . "
We ’re in an exceptionally difficult time in our nation ’s political history .
A combination of economic stagnation , partisan polarizations , and demographic change has brought us to the point of losing our national consensus on what it means to have a United States .
Is there any hope ?
Professor Jack Balkin says yes .
In his new book , The Cycles Of Constitutional Time , he argues that in some ways , we ’ve been here before .
He cites the Gilded Age , a period of corruption , polarization , and economic change .
He argues for the potential for a future Progressive Age – if we can make it through the next 5 - 10 years .
It ’s a terrific book .
Over at his group blog , Balkinization , I was invited to be part of a Symposium on the book .
In the first of two contributions , I show how these problems are echoed in electoral math : partisan gerrymandering and our old friend the Electoral College .
Like him , I think there can be better days ahead .
It helps to know how we got here – and that we ’ve been here before .
Muslim faithful throughout the world are currently observing the holy month of Ramadan .
Observant Muslims participate in fasting ( sawm ) , one of the five pillars of their faith , this entire Lunar month ( this year it extends from September 1st to the 30th ) .
Eating , drinking , smoking and sexual activity is prohibited from dawn until sunset , when the fast is broken with the evening meal called Iftar .
Local customs define varying traditions , including differing types of food used to break the daily fast .
The fasting is meant to teach a person patience , humility and sacrifice , to set aside time to ask forgiveness , practice self - restraint , and pray for guidance in the future .

In the second of two pieces on organised crime accompanying his Radio 4 series
How crime took on the world , Misha Glenny reveals the details of a cigarette - smuggling scam that funded many of the paramilitary killing machines in the Yugoslav wars .
The first counterfeit cigarettes appeared on the markets of the former Yugoslavia just days after the war broke out in June 1991 .
These were fake Marlboros , Rothmans , Winstons and other well - known brands that had been manufactured in different parts of the Balkans and beyond .
I was a smoker at the time ( readers may be pleased to know I 've since given up the dreadful habit ) and so I was a willing customer for these staggeringly cheap products .
The cigarettes often arrived in the Balkans via Rotterdam and Asia
There was only one drawback - when you drew your first puff , instead of the familiar blend of Virginia tobacco , the back of your throat was assaulted by a taste akin to a mixture of sawdust and goat 's dung .
It took a restless Serbian entrepreneur called Vladmir " Vanja " Bokan to provide the market with an improved product a couple of years later .
In a darkened cafe in Belgrade , a former business associate of Vanja's , Mr X , told me how it was done .
My interlocutor warned me that if I identified him , he would soon be dead .
" And they 'll probably kill you , too , " ' Mr X added for emphasis .
But after this sombre introduction , he warmed to his subject .
Speedboats
Mr X explained how Bokan would buy cigarettes direct from factories in Western Europe and the United States for export into Europe 's two main free - trade zones , Rotterdam in Holland and Zug in Switzerland .
This meant they attracted none of the high purchase taxes imposed on cigarettes in most countries .
An Italian crime syndicate distributed the Balkan cigarettes through Europe The billions of cigarettes were then flown to countries in Central Asia and North Africa before being flown back into the Balkans .
Criminals and intelligence services from all the former republics of Yugoslavia co-operated in the logistics of this trade but the cigarettes ' physical destination was the tiny coastal republic of Montenegro that borders on Croatia , Serbia , Kosovo and Albania .
The leading politician in Montenegro - then as now - was the former President Milo Djukanovic .
He went on record long ago explaining that Montenegro did not consider these goods to be contraband and that he was justified in imposing what he styled a " transit tax " on the cigarettes .
In Podgorica , the Montenegrin capital , I heard from Daliborka Uljarevic how as a schoolgirl she watched lorry after lorry trundle out of the factory near her school .
This was the weigh station between the airport where giant Ilyushin transporters dropped off the contraband and the harbour just down the coast at Bar .
Here the goods were loaded on to super - fast speedboats and for almost a decade , 20 of these vessels travelled across the Adriatic to Italy every single night - weather permitting .
The cigarettes were dumped on the coast of Apulia to be picked up by members of one of Italy 's youngest organised crime syndicates , the Sacra Corona Unita ( SCU ) .
Bullets
The SCU distributed the smuggled goods all over Europe - Britain was a particular target because legally - sold cigarettes are subject to very high taxes in the United Kingdom .
The man alleged to be the biggest cigarette smuggler of all is in a Russian jail awaiting extradition
Over a seven - year period , the European Union estimates it lost $ 8bn in revenue to the Balkan cigarette trade .
Instead , the profits went to a variety of criminal groups often associated with some of the most murderous paramilitary operations that became notorious during the wars in the former Yugoslavia .
Italy and the European Union are still investigating the trade .
Meanwhile , Stanko Subotic " Cane " , the man alleged to be the biggest cigarette smuggler of all is in a Russian jail awaiting extradition to Serbia .
He may be facing many years in jail but at least he has so far avoided the fate of the man who invented the whole trade , Vanja Bokan .
In the mid-nineties Bokan had fled to the Athens from Belgrade in fear for his life , after an assassination attempt in broad daylight on the streets of the Serbian capital .
He swiftly secured Greek citizenship and once again prospered as a master smuggler .
But on 7 October 2000 , as he emerged from his Mercedes 500 in front of his villa , Bokan 's face was obliterated by 29 bullets fired from a couple of semi-automatics .
The killers were never brought to justice .

What are these ?
NOT until 2004 could the 9/11 commission at last reveal the title of the intelligence briefing President Bush ignored on Aug. 6 , 2001 , in Crawford : “ Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S. ”
No wonder John McCain called for a new “ 9/11 commission ” to “ get to the bottom ” of 9/14 , when the collapse of Lehman Brothers set off another kind of blood bath in Lower Manhattan .
Put a slo -mo Beltway panel in charge , and Election Day will be ancient history before we get to the bottom of just how little he and the president did to defend America against a devastating new threat on their watch .
For better or worse , the candidacy of Barack Obama , a senator - come- lately , must be evaluated on his judgment , ideas and potential to lead .
McCain , by contrast , has been chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee , where he claims to have overseen “ every part of our economy . ”
He did n’t , thank heavens , but he does have a long and relevant economic record that begins with the Keating Five scandal of 1989 and extends to this campaign , where his fiscal policies bear the fingerprints of Phil Gramm and Carly Fiorina .
It ’s not the résumé that a presidential candidate wants to advertise as America faces its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
That ’s why the main thrust of the McCain campaign has been to cover up his history of economic malpractice .
McCain has largely pulled it off so far , under the guidance of Steve Schmidt , a Karl Rove protégé .
A Rovian political strategy by definition means all slime , all the time .
But the more crucial Rove game plan is to envelop the entire presidential race in a thick fog of truthiness .
All campaigns , Obama ’s included , engage in false attacks .
But McCain , Sarah Palin and their surrogates keep repeating the same lies over and over not just to smear their opponents and not just to mask their own record .
Their larger aim is to construct a bogus alternative reality so relentless it can overwhelm any haphazard journalistic stabs at puncturing it .
When a McCain spokesman told Politico a week ago that “ we ’re not too concerned about what the media filter tries to say ” about the campaign ’s incessant fictions , he was channeling a famous Bush dictum of 2003 : “ Somehow you just got to go over the heads of the filter . ”
In Bush ’s case , the lies lobbed over the heads of the press were to sell the war in Iraq .
That propaganda blitz , devised by a secret White House Iraq Group that included Rove , was a triumph .
In mere months , Americans came to believe that Saddam Hussein had aided the 9/11 attacks and even that Iraqis were among the hijackers .
A largely cowed press failed to set the record straight .

Somewhere on the world 's waterways , a pirate will try to strike today .
Another will tomorrow .
And another the day after that .
Piracy is on the rise , across the globe – up nearly 75 % , from last decade to this one , according to a new report from the RAND Corporation .
There 's now at least an attempt at a pirate attack nearly every day .
Why ?
Mainly , the RAND report says , because there are now more targets to loot .
" First and most fundamentally , there has been a massive increase in commercial maritime traffic .
Combined with the large number of ports around the world , this growth has provided pirates with an almost limitless range of tempting , high - payoff targets . "
And while some governments ( and some reporters ) have worries about pirates and terrorists teaming up , " the presumed convergence between maritime terrorism and piracy remains highly questionable , however .
To date , there has been no credible evidence to support speculation about such a nexus emerging . "
There were " a total of 2,463 actual or attempted acts of piracy were registered around the world between 2000 and the end of 2006 .
This represents an annual average incident rate of 352 , a substantial increase over the mean of 209 recorded for the period of 1994 – 1999 , " the report notes .
" The concentration of pirate attacks continues to be greatest in
Southeast Asia , especially in the waters around the Indonesian archipelago ... which accounted for roughly 25 percent of all global incidents during 2006 . "
The post -9/11 environment has also made some shipping lanes more vulnerable .
Since then , governments have been pressured to " to invest in expensive , land - based homeland security initiatives " – often ignoring maritime security , as a result .
In addition :
... lax coastal and port - side security have played an important role in enabling low - level piratical activity , especially harbor thefts of goods from ships at anchor .
... corruption and emergent voids of judicial prerogative have encouraged official complicity in high - level pirate rings , which has impacted directly on the “ phantom ship ” phenomenon .
*... the global proliferation of small arms has provided pirates
( as well as terrorists and other criminal elements ) with an enhanced means to operate on a more destructive and sophisticated level .
*
ALSO :
The divide between presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama does n’t end with years and ideology .
It also exhibits itself through the Internet .
According to an MIT Technology Review article written by David Talbot , Barack Obama has managed to create the best online political machine the nation has ever seen .
John McCain , on the other hand , does n’t use email .
Highlights from the article :
Many of the 2008 candidates had websites , click - to - donate tools , and social - networking features .
But the Obama team put such technologies at the center of its campaign–among other things , recruiting 24 - year - old Chris Hughes , cofounder of Facebook , to help develop them .
( During the crucial Texas primaries ) , 104,000 Texans had joined Obama ’s social - ¬networking site , www.my.barackobama.com, known as MyBO .
The month before , the freshman senator from Illinois had set a record in American politics by garnering $ 55 million in donations in a single month .
McCain ’s site is ineffectual for social networking .
In late June , when ( the author ) tried to sign up on McCainSpace –the analogue to MyBO–he got error messages .
When he tried again , he was informed that he would soon get a new password in my in - box .
It never arrived .
“ His social - networking site … was very insular , a walled garden .
You do n’t want to keep people inside your walled garden ; you want them to spread the message to new people . ”
Social networking has already proven itself to be the early 21st Century ’s great equalizer .
Could it effectively be expanded to the White House ?
I hope so .
I also hope that big corporations like GE and AT&T embrace social networking as a means to dialogue with their customers .
Can you imagine a customer service desk where issues and solutions are displayed on Twitter ?
Or a government that networks in its citizens above and beyond sterile updates ?
It could be a different world .
But in the meantime , it ’s all about politics .
Talbot covers it best :
“ In 1992 , Carville said , ‘ It ’s the economy , stupid , ' ” ( campaigning veteran Joe ) Trippi says , recalling the exhortation of Bill Clinton ’s campaign manager , James Carville .
“ This year , it was the network , stupid ! ”
The Federal Bureau of Investigation recently released its " Financial Crimes Report To the Public Fiscal Year 2007 , " ( available here ) which contained an extensive summary of the staggering increase in mortgage fraud prosecutions , investigations , and incident reports for the last government fiscal year ( October 1 , 2006 to September 31 , 2007 ) .
Here are some highlights :
-- The extensive securitization of mortgages that were the hallmark of the subprime lending era " has created opportunities for organized fraud groups " and " the sale of the mortgages [ in the secondary market ] in many cases conceal or distort the fraud , causing it not to be reported . "
-- Reports of potential mortgage fraud increased from 35,000 in 2006 , to 46,000 in 2007 , to an estimated 60,000 reports in 2008 .
-- 80 percent of all reported fraud losses involve collaboration or collusion by mortgage industry insiders , and so the FBI focuses its resources on these cases rather than borrowers committing " fraud for housing . "
-- Pending mortgage fraud cases in the courts nearly doubled from 2005 to 2007
-- The top 10 mortgage fraud states for 2007 were Florida , Georgia , Michigan , California , Illinois , Ohio , Texas , New York , Colorado , and Minnesota .
-- The report also notes in the Insurance Fraud section , the increased incidents of distressed homeowners , property flippers , and / or real estate investors have resorted to arson to avoid foreclosure .

What passes for food at Kennedy Airport may sometimes seem criminal , but only observant Jews were actually at risk of breaking the law – dietary law , that is – by grabbing a bite at one of the terminals .
But all that has changed , thanks to the mess - hall messiah that ’s arrived in the form of kosher vending machines .
In a matter of seconds , the “ Hot Nosh 24 / 6 ” machines cook up hot dogs , knishes , pizzas , onion rings and a slew of other offerings that have been satisfying Jews and gentiles alike since they were installed in April at the food court in Terminal 4 .
“ I did n’t bring my own food , since I am coming from camp , so I was very surprised and happy to see these machines , ” said Sean Zaghi , 14 , an Orthodox Jew who was awaiting a flight to California .
“ I thought I was going to have to have pretzels or something , but now I can get a pizza instead . ”
The machines have turned heads at the airport , and some folks even stop to pose for pictures in front of them , before grabbing a $ 4.50 hot dog .
“ This is wonderful , ” said Susan Berger , who snapped a photo of the machine on her way back to Florida .
“ We really could use these back home . ”
Despite the “ 24/6 ” name , the machines are not programmed to shut off Fridays after sundown in observance of the Jewish Sabbath .
“ That ’s because you do n’t have to be Jewish to want a kosher hot dog , ” said Ruby Azrak , of Kosher Vending Industries .
One hundred of the machines – which take credit cards – have already been installed in hospitals , a Wal - Mart and even Boston ’s Fenway Park – all places where there are usually no kosher options , said Azrak .
“ We are also talking to schools and prisons , ” partner Alan Cohnen said .
While it may not sound kosher to eat a hot dog from a vending machine , the company ’s patented technology can grill a perfect frank .
It takes about 90 seconds from Genesis to Exodus .

What replaced it was the unipolar moment of the West , with the American eagle perched victorious on its mountain lair .
That victory , by some coincidence , also came with the full onset of globalisation .
The opening of borders to goods and flows of funds with its concomitant intensification of trade and financial interdependence .
As it turned out : a globalisation of economic growth annealed by a globalisation of peace .
The first of a kind since that which followed the Napoleonic Wars .
The key question now and the central one of this address is , can that two thirds of humanity , in those high income and high growth countries , assimilate that growth and prosperity , or will the condition itself corrode or hollow humanity out , slaking us of those earnest values and high convictions that have stood by us down through time .
Perhaps , more than that , will the seduction of secularity and self absorption lure us into a bubble of spiritless contentment , sustained only the inability of others to organise themselves effectively to disrupt or appropriate it ?
Is it a case , as Pope Benedict recently remarked , that the Western world is a world ' weary of its own culture ' , a world ' weary of greed , exploitation and division , of the tedium of false idols and the pain of false promises ' ?
That is , a world without a guiding light ; one without absolute truths by which to navigate .
John Stuart Mill made much the same point , seeing the great struggle of life as being between creativity and the ' despotism of custom ' or perhaps , we could say , between originality and tradition , of authenticity trying to breach those tedious moulds of contemporary culture , replete with their false idols and chimeras of an idealised happiness .
Benedict told us in Sydney that ' life is a search for the true , the good and the beautiful ' and we know that whenever those objectives become subordinated , we become lost , in a morass of preferences and experiences uninformed by truth or ethics .
Experiences , he went on to say , which detached from what is good or true , ' lead to moral and intellectual confusion and ultimately to despair ' .
Are we capable - those of us in that opportune two thirds of humanity - of forging a second Enlightenment ?
One not solely dependent on science but one leavened by understanding and virtue , making the most of science .
One which goes to the profound and innate dignity of every human life , transcending the old barriers of ethnicity and creed .
In a world shrunk by transport and communications , vulnerable to shifts in climate and natural disasters and subject of devastating weapons and armouries , can a higher framework of co-existence obtain other than one governed by self interest or nationalism or indeed by a misplaced sense of superiority ?
Benedict told us in Sydney that the State cannot be ' the source of truth and morality ' .
That that source can only be a set of truths and values which devolve to what it means to be human , one to each other , society to society , state to state .
In Benedict 's terms , one of God 's creatures .
We are currently living through one of those rare yet transforming events in history , a shift in the power in the world from West to East .
For five hundred years Europe dominated the world , now for all its wealth and population it is drifting into relative decline .
Will our understanding of this transformation and our acceptance of its equity for the greater reaches of mankind , lead us to a position of general preparedness of its inevitability , or will we cavil at it in much the same way as Europe resisted the rise of Bismarck 's creation at the end of the nineteenth century ?
We can see with this the twenty ninth Olympiad , the questioning of China and the resentment at its pretensions about being one of us .
Even , becoming one of us !
The Western liberal press featured , generally in critical terms , the world - long torch relay , juxtaposing all that it represents and is good about it , with what it sees as China 's democratic defects , viewing it almost exclusively through the prism of Tibet .
Saying , almost , that the aspirations of this massive nation , a quarter of humanity , a legatee of a century of misery , dragging itself from poverty , is somehow of questionable legitimacy , because its current government 's attitude to political freedoms and in specific instances , human rights are not up to scratch .
Ignoring the massive leaps in progress , of income growth , of shelter , of the alleviation of poverty , of dwindling infant mortality , of education , of , by any measure , the much better life now being experienced by the very great majority of Chinese .
In a Western and elitist way , we have viewed China 's right to its Olympic Games , to its ' coming out ' , its moment of glory , with condescension and concessional tolerance .
The Western critic feeling the epicentre of the world changing but not at all liking it , seeks to put down these vast societies on the basis that their political and value systems do n't match up to theirs .
Henry Kissinger made the point recently , when he said 'we cannot do in China in the twenty first century , what others thought to do in the nineteenth - prescribe their institutions for them and seek to organise Asia ' .
And he went on to pose the question ; do we split the world into a union of democracies and non-democracies , or must there be another approach key to regional and historic circumstance ?
How workable would the world be if it was divided into democracies and non-democracies , along a demarcation line set up by self - approving , Jeffersonian - style liberals ?
There is a view that should China become a democracy , a real one , many tensions in the global system would go ; that democracies find peace with other democracies ; that the former political - military state first turns itself into a trading state and as wealth and opportunity rise , so too do democratic values .
But what we must remember is that even if all the states of the world became democratic , the structure of the international system would remain anarchic .
India and Pakistan are democracies but this fact has not lowered tensions between them .
Democratic Germany took on the rest of democratic Europe in 1914 .
Some would say that Wilhemine Germany was not a pristine democracy but can we divine our way to peace in the international system by a beauty contest as to whose democratic fabric is finest or better than another .
The propagation of democracy is a fraught business but with the end of the Cold War , the liberal interventionists got right into their stride and , Iraq was one of the outcomes .
RH
Tawney , the British historian and sociologist , once remarked that war is either a crusade or a crime .
Woe betide the rest of us if the crusaders enjoy an open writ to underwrite military adventurism in the name of democracy in states which have not even developed organic domestic political structures to take it , much less grow it .
Perhaps we should also consider John Stuart Mill 's preference for progress before liberty .
Or liberty at least in tandem with progress .
The fact is that for the first time in human history , we now live in a global system .
Aviation and telecommunications have underwritten a connectedness which past generations could only have dreamt of .
Television news and the digital age mark the events of day to day life in real time .
No longer do we concentrate our affairs in our own parts of the world , rather we calibrate all we do against the rest of the world as a whole .
Our mindset is now global .
From here on , we have to synchronise whatever we do within an overarching global strategy .
A strategy which has to have as its basis the progress of human existence and not simply the propagation of democracy .
And it is not as if we have been denied a new canvas to paint out a better picture .
For the first time since before the First World War , the dissolution of the Soviet Union opened the potential for a new era of peace and cooperation .
Russia , humiliated but intact , let the bits fall away from its former Union of Soviet States .
Wise men like George Herbert Bush , Helmut Kohl , Brent Scowcroft and James Baker saw to it that the bits came away other than in an outburst of triumphalism : that the bits were strategically parked in the quietest and least celebratory way to underwrite an orderly transition from Gorbachev to Yeltsin .
And an orderly transition to the independent functioning of those Warsaw Treaty states outside Russia itself .
Gorbachev even agreed to a reunited Germany within NATO , after twenty six million of his countrymen and women had died releasing the grip of Nazism on their homeland .
George Herbert Bush talked about a New World Order then lost to Bill Clinton .
And what happened then ?
Well , nothing happened then !
The Americans cried victory and walked off the field .
The greatest challenge we face , whether for managing incidents or easing the new economic tectonic plates into place , will be to construct a truly representative structure of world governance which reflects global realities but which is also equitable and fair .
For two Clinton presidential terms and two George W Bush terms , the world has been left without such a structure .
Certainly one able to accommodate Russia and the great states like China and India .
Instead President Clinton and President George W Bush left us with the template of 1947 ; the template cut by the victorious powers of World War Two , the one where Germany and Japan were left on the outside , and still are sixty years later , and in which China and India are tolerated and palely humoured .
Sixteen critical years have already been lost .
And it is not as if we are dealing with a world where things are the same now as they were sixteen years ago .
The world is dynamic : sixteen years ago China was not a world power ; today it is .
Sixteen years ago , Russia was collapsing ; today it is growing and strongly .
We are now sitting through , witnessing , the eclipse of American power .
Yet for those sixteen critical years , two American Presidents did nothing to better shape the institutions of world governance .
To shape it for the day , for that moment in history when the United States becomes another power amongst equals ; or near equals .
And there has been no help from the old powers ; Tony Blair 's Britain and Jacque Chirac 's France .
After all , they had box seats to the event , courtesy of being on top in 1947 .
But Blair 's contribution was not anything new or free - thinking , rather he thought being an American acolyte was all that was required .
Chirac was simply incapable of adding any strategic value to the equation .
The fact is we are again heading towards a bipolar world .
Not one shaped by a balance of terror like the old one , but certainly not a multipolar one .
In fact , one heavily influenced by two countries ; the United States and China .
This will face us up to a number of major decisions and soon .
For a start , will we regard China as a force for stability and good , a partner in the world , or will we continue to treat China as an upstart economic adversary to be strategically watched ?
Some will say , but what about Europe ?
Do n't forget Europe ; Europe is a pole .
I do not think it is .
Europe , in settlement of its twentieth century conflicts , has opted for a cooperative regionalism where the prerogatives of each of the former sovereign states have been blended or subsumed to a homogenous whole .
But a whole lacking that most crucial of all strategic ingredients - the political ability to conscript and direct a population ; to respond militarily and do it decisively .
To do it in its own terms and the terms of its population .
In the long history of Europe this homogenisation is actually a welcome change but the challenge for Europe is to extend that supranationalism to others .
States like China and Russia still enjoy a power of galvanic action , politically and strategically , of the kind Europe had and used in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries .
There may come a time when the young people of these countries refuse to be conscripted for military service by their respective polities .
But that time is not now .
As Chinese military power grows in lockstep with its economy , it is reasonable to assume that the only other major economic and strategic force on the landscape will be the United States .
Just the two of them .
But let us not leave out the Russians .
Russia 's economy , while growing in strength from the burned out wreck it was in 1990 , will not be in the league of that of the United States or of China .
But Russia will still be wealthy ; wealthy enough to continue to field its massive arsenal of nuclear weapons .
So whether you attribute to Russia full ' pole ' status or not , you can certainly attribute to it huge strategic standing .
It is more the pity then , that following that unexpected epiphany in 1989 , the Clinton Administration rashly decided to ring - fence Russia by inviting the former Warsaw Treaty states of Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic to join NATO .
By doing so , the United States failed to learn one of the lessons of history ; that the victor should be magnanimous with the vanquished .
In this case , the victor and its agent , NATO , gave those former Soviet Bloc countries an invitation to actually jump camp .
And in doing so , strategically occupying the territory that formerly belonged to the Soviet Union which came within the control of Russia .
At some time the United States will be obliged to treat Russia as a great sovereign power replete with a range of national interests of the kind other major powers possess .
In the meantime , the great risk of this sort of adventurism is that with NATO 's border now right up to the western Ukraine , the Russians will take the less costly military option of counter - weighing NATO 's power by keeping their nuclear arsenal on full operational alert .
This posture automatically carries with it the possibility of a Russian nuclear attack by mistake .
The years of Russia 's economic poverty , certainly since the collapse of its economy in the first half of the 1990s , has meant the Russians have allowed their surveillance and early warning systems to ossify .
To compensate , they are keeping their nuclear arsenal on full operational alert .
No need to stand by if you are not , in fact , standing by .
This leaves the rest of the world relying more on Generals , battlefield commanders , and intelligence assessors to restrain a nuclear response than it does the Russian President or his government .
This means that while the Cold War is over , the risk of a mistaken pre-emptory response has increased .
Russia is the only country in the world with the capacity to massively damage the United States to the point of seriously maiming it .
And ditto for Western Europe .
Would n't you think that when the Russians surrendered their empire in 1990 , US policy would have been adept enough to find an intelligent place for them in the overall strategic fabric ?
That is , to have Russia as part of an enlightened framework of intelligent co-existence , thinking back beyond the Cold War to when we partnered with them to defeat Hitler .
But even more than that , in people terms , to invite their 160 million , battered by the twentieth century , into the comity and wealth of nations .
Instead , the US conducted itself as unrivalled powers have done throughout time ; unchecked , it exploited its position .
It has ring - fenced Russia treating it as a virtual enemy with its west European and central European clients egging it on .
This week the United States signed Poland up to build a missile intercept system on Russia 's border .
Nominally , the system is designed to protect Europe and the Middle East from Iran .
But even the Polish are now talking about having it to deter Russian aggression .
NATO , an organisation rendered moribund by the collapse of the Soviet Union , has been re-fashioned by the United States as an organisation to extend American power and policy to the security order of Europe .
You could be excused for thinking that when the Wall came down the major states of Europe , Germany and France , along with Britain , would have developed their own security order ; responding to their own national interests and culture .
Certainly with reference to the United States but not mandated by it .
But however likely that might have been , the end result is that the key decisions about European defence and security are made in Washington .
Hence Europe 's strategic impotence .
One of the negative aspects of these developments is that they play into the hands of Russian nationalists while making the hand of those Russians prepared to give liberal democratic principles a go , much weaker .
The old West then complains about Vladimir Putin being a poorly disguised Russian autocrat and nationalist when the West has played a large role in creating him .
All of this serves to underline the most pressing problem of all and that is the continuing existence of nuclear weapons .
Nuclear weapon proliferation is the single , most immediate threat hanging over the world today .
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty entered by compliant States in 1970 is on the verge of collapse .
The Treaty represents perhaps the most egregious example of international double dealing of any international regime .
In a nutshell , the nuclear weapon States signed up to the elimination of their nuclear weapons while , in the meantime , other signatory States undertook to forgo their development .
But now , most of the nuclear weapon States are developing new nuclear weapons .
Not only have they not ridded themselves of their old ones , they are actually making new ones .
Tony Blair announced the New Trident Submarine Program in 2006 while the Bush Administration has turned its hand to new bunker busting nuclear weapons designed to attack underground facilities .
The Russians , quick on the uptake , are also refining their arsenal .
The old nukes had the dubious advantage of existing solely for self defence .
This new variety of US weapons is actually being designed for use ; for intended wartime deployment and operation .
And ditto for the Russians .
What sort of future compliance can we expect from States already signatories to the NPT , let alone non-signatories , when the promoters of the Treaty reserve the right to ignore their obligations as to elimination , while designing and building new devices ?
In that strategic quiet after the thunderclap that ended the Cold War , as Prime Minister of Australia , a non-weapon NPT signatory , I established the Canberra Commission for the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons in 1995 .
I did it taking the opportunity of the strategic vacuum to move weapons states down the path of lengthening the fuse or time on their warheads while proposing to completely dismantle and destroy weapons no longer operationally deployed .
Robert O'Neill , the Australian professor of war and strategic policy who was on that Commission , recently wrote of his experience in approaching the five weapon States upon the report 's publication .
He said of the five , only the Chinese ' seemed willing to talk seriously about the changes recommended by the Commission ' .
He said the reaction of the other four weapon States - the United States , Russia , Britain and France - was completely defensive .
The Americans and the Russians made clear they were prepared to talk to each other but Britain and France , O'Neill said , saw nuclear weapons as desirable levers of political influence , devoid of which their Governments would forfeit leverage in Washington and Moscow and within the corridors of NATO .
The Prime Minister , John Howard , and his foreign minister Alexander Downer , who received the Report which I had commissioned , dropped it like a hot cake .
The foreign minister then labelled it a stunt by the previous Government .
They did not want to be in the business of taking the issue to the United States as I certainly would have .
All the more pleasing therefore , for those of us who know that the ' have ' and ' have not ' policy of the NPT is not sustainable , to see in January 2007 , the former US Secretaries of State , Henry Kissinger and George Schultz , along with former Defence Secretary Bill Perry and Senator Sam Nunn , publish a joint call for the elimination of all nuclear weapons .
In October 2007 , those four statesmen led a conference at Stanford University on ways of taking their proposal forward .
Robert O'Neill believes momentum is building ; and he said ' on re-reading the Canberra Commission 's report today , I believe it makes more sense than it did in 1996 ' .
The plain fact is , there can be no non-proliferation without de-proliferation .
If the weapon States are not prepared to rid themselves of nuclear weapons , why would other States continue to deny themselves the kind of leverage that these weapons bring .
Look at India and Pakistan or even North Korea .
None of these States are NPT signatories , yet India by having these weapons , is now pulling a deal from the United States for nuclear technology .
Pakistan 's possession of them saw the regime of General Musharraf treated very favourably by the United States while North Korea continues to be handled with kid gloves .
And what a dicey proposition Pakistan is .
Another one of those trustworthy ' democracies ' .
Bhutto has been murdered , like her father , while Musharraf himself is now gone .
Who is to contain and manage Pakistan 's nuclear weapons for the long term benefit of the rest of us ; another flimsy coalition of political parties ; another General ?
It seems if you have nuclear weapons and flaunt them , you are more likely to be noticed and treated concessionally .
North Korea is the exemplar in this respect .
Many people will think and some will say that with communications and the globalisation of economic wealth being what it is , an outbreak of the major conflict seems more and more remote .
That global interdependence and the shrinking of the world makes war a decidedly unproductive way of resolving foreign policy differences .
People should be reminded that that was said at the time of the last great intensification of trade between Britain , France and Germany along with the growing US economy before 1914 .
The lesson is that when the strategic bits go wrong , the economic bits soon follow .
Certainly not the obverse : when the trade goes well , the strategic wrinkles get ironed out .
As I remarked earlier , the structure of the international system is anarchic .
Was anarchic ; remains anarchic .
This condition cannot be remedied but structures to mitigate its most violent manifestations can be put into place .
Against this backdrop remains the open question about ' the West ' and its fibre .
The question which was resoundingly answered by that generation who suffered the Depression and the Second World War and who delivered us into a new era of peace and prosperity .
Is our culture a culture made compliant by too much coming too easily ; producing a state of intellectual and spiritual lassitude which can only be shaken by the gravest threats ; be they economic , environmental or indeed strategic ?
As that pendulum swings from West to East , are the motivations for the West 's former primacy swinging with it ?
Has the bounty of science and industrialisation with its cornucopia of production and wealth , encouraged us too far away from simpler requirements and concern for the needs of all ?
Was the twentieth century a psychological age as Roger Smith in his History of Human Sciences pointed out , in which the self became privatised , while the public realm ; the realm critical to political action for the public good , was left relatively vacant ?
As societies , have we taken our eye off public affairs for way too long ?
Let me return to the theme I touched at the beginning of my remarks .
Can we , all of us , assimilate ; adjust ourselves to a constancy of peace and prosperity without lessening our regard for those enlivening impulses of truth and goodness ?
The search , as Benedict said , for what is good , beautiful and true .
A new international order based on truth and justice founded in the recognition of the rights of each of us to live out our lives in peace and harmony , can I believe , provide the only plausible long term template .
The old order of victorious powers , of a compromised UN , a moribund G8 with major powers hanging on to weapons of mass destruction , is a remnant of the violent twentieth century .
It can not be the basis for an equitable and effective system of world governance .
Just as world community concern has been ahead of the political system on issues such as global warming , so too world community concern needs to galvanise international action to find a new template for a lasting peace .
One embracing all the major powers and regions .
This can be done but it requires leadership and imagination .
It can not be done without understanding and virtue .

The philosopher Emmanuel Kant said some day there will be a universal peace , the only question , he said is , will it come about by human insight or by catastrophe , leaving no other outcome possible ?
Humankind demands that that proposition be settled in the former and not the latter .

It is easier to destroy than to create .

Last night , Texas State Senator Kirk Watson , an Obama supporter , was embarrassed on national TV when he could n't name any of Obama 's legislative achievements .
( He wrote what I think is a pretty decent and disarming account of it here . )
David Kurtz , for whom I normally have enormous respect , writes :
" I suspect this is a bit of a Rorschach test .
Depending on your perspective , it 's proof that Obama is a lightweight , just goes to show what a gasbag Matthews is , or appeals to the same voyeuristic instinct that makes you slow down and gawk at a car accident . "
I think it 's only a Rorschach test for people who do n't bother to find whether or not Obama actually has any actual legislative achievements .
If he does , then of course this just shows that this one supporter did n't know what they are .
If he does n't , it might show something more , e.g. that Obama is a lightweight .
As it happens , Obama does have substantive legislative achievements .
I have written more about them here .
A few highlights , all of which became law :
* Ethics Reform : Obama was the Senate 's point person on ethics reform , and sponsored or co-sponsored the bills that made up what the Washington Post called " the strongest ethics legislation to emerge from Congress yet . "
I 'm also a fan of this bill , which I think of as the Journalists , Bloggers , and Citizens ' Muckraking Empowerment Act : it creates a searchable database of recipients of federal grants and contracts .
* The Lugar - Obama initiative to strengthen the Nunn - Luger framework for securing loose nukes , and to extend it to securing and destroying stockpiles of conventional arms .
( For instance , shoulder - fired missiles that could be used against passenger airlines , fired at our forces , or used to make any number of ongoing conflicts more deadly . )
* Various bills concerning the response to Hurricane Katrina , including an amendment putting strict limits on the use of no -bid contracts after disasters , requiring planning for the evacuation of people with special needs and senior citizens , creating a National Emergency Family Locator System , etc .
There are also a lot of good bills he worked on that did not make it , including the compromise immigration bill and a proposal to create an independent Congressional Ethics Enforcement Commission , and some that are on the Senate calendar now , like a bill to criminalize various deceptive election tactics , like deceptive robocalls , providing misleading information about where to vote or what conditions you have to meet to be eligible to vote , etc .
There 's a lot more .
Honestly , there is .
I wrote a summary here ( and an earlier one here ) , and provided lists ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) of all the bills and amendments sponsored or co-sponsored by Clinton and Obama in the 109th and 110th Congresses , just so it would be as easy as possible for people to see for themselves .
( Fun fact about each side 's legislative records : during the 109th and 110th Congresses ( which is to say , the time that both Obama and Clinton have been in the Senate ) , only one sponsored a substantive bill that became law .
Guess who it was ?
Hint : the bill concerns the ongoing conflict in the Congo . )
Which brings me to my larger point :
I did this because I had heard one too many people like Chris Matthews talking about Obama 's alleged lack of substance , and I thought : I know that 's not true , since I have read about Obama 's work on non-proliferation , avian flu , and a few other issues .
And if people are saying he lacks substance , then surely I , as a citizen , should try to find out whether I just hallucinated all this interesting legislation , or whether this talking point was , in fact , completely wrong .
So I sat down with Google and Thomas and tried to find out .
But I 'm just an amateur .
I have a full - time job doing something else .
Chris Matthews , by contrast , is paid large sums of money to provide political commentary and insight .
I assume he has research assistants at his disposal .
He could have done this work a lot more easily than I did .
But he did n't .
He was more interested in gotcha moments than in actually enlightening the American people .
So here 's a challenge for Chris Matthews , or anyone else in the media who wants to take it up .
Go over Clinton and Obama 's actual legislative records .
Find the genuine legislative accomplishments that each has to his or her name .
Report to the American people on what you find .
Until you do , do n't accept statements from either side about who has substance and who does not , or who traffics in " speeches " and who offers " solutions " .
That 's lazy , unprofessional , and a disservice to your audience .
Do your jobs .
Do n't leave it to bloggers like me to do it for you .
So we all know how planes fly , right ?
The top of the wing is rounded and the bottom of the wing is more straight .
Air takes longer to travel over the top of the wing than the bottom , which results in more pressure on the bottom , hence the lift .
Right ?
As it turns out , no .
This is what I was taught , and it ’s what I ’ve always believed ( it ’s even in most lower - level text books ) , but it ’s simply not true .
This concept , called the Equal Transit Time
Theory does not generate nearly enough lift to keep a plane in the air .
The main reason planes fly is far simpler : wings force air downward , which in turn force the wing ( and therefore the plane ) upward .
The primary actor at play here is called the Angle of Attack ( AoA ) , and it ’s easy to conceptualize .
We ’ve all put our flattened hand outside a car window while the car was in motion .
You noticed that if you angled it straight on you could hold it steady , but if you angled the front edge upward you created massive lift that forced your arm up in the air .
The same concept works for kites , helicopter blades , sailboats , ceiling fans , and planes .
In fact , winglike surfaces can generate lift almost regardless of the shape of their top and bottom surfaces .
Notice that ceiling fan and helicopter blades are basically symmetrical , yet they create a downward columns of air just fine .
You can actually use a barn door to generate lift … if you were so inclined .
In other words , lift simplifies nicely to Newton ’s third law of equal and opposite reactions : air goes down , wing goes up .
Finally , if you ’re still harboring any fond feelings for the equal transit time theory , ask yourself a simple question :
If the top vs. bottom wing shape is so important , how can planes fly upside down ?
Alas , there are actually multiple ways of describing , and calculating with varying degrees of precision , the way in which lift is generated .
There is the mathematical / engineering approach , and there is the physical approach , which is what I ’ve described above .
John D. Anderson said it best :
It is amazing that today , almost 100 years after the first flight of the Wright Flyer , groups of engineers , scientists , pilots , and others can gather together and have a spirited debate on how an airplane wing generates lift .
Various explanations are put forth , and the debate centers on which explanation is the most fundamental .
The one thing the experts agree on , however , is that the way most have been taught about how planes fly ( the Equal Transit Theory ) is absolutely incorrect . ::
[ There are , of course , other factors at play other than angle of attack , e.g. the Coandă Effect .
The point of this piece is to illustrate that the primary factor with flight is the forcing of air downward ( to which Coandă contributes ) rather than equal - transit . ]

GOP hack Joe Scarborough has n't been on the air for nearly two weeks thanks to the Olympics and a lot has happened in that time .
He and the Morning Joe crew will have a lot of ground to cover when they return to the airwaves , but unfortunately for Joe , one of his favorite wingnut memes has been blown to smithereens while he was away -- the stereotypical , elitist , latte sipping liberals .
Now that we 've learned from the LA Times that John McCain ditched reporters and dragged a 9 car motorcade to Starbucks to snag a large cappuccino on Friday , I think it 's time for Joe to let it go .
Hell , McCain was probably wearing his $ 500 Italian loafers at the time ( I bet he has more than one pair ) and probably had a hard time deciding which home to return to .
It 's time to give it up , Joe .
I think we all know who the real latte - sipping elitist is now .

ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - A suicide truck bomber attacked the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad on Saturday , killing at least 43 people , wounding nearly 250 and starting a fire that swept through the building in the Pakistani capital .
Internal security in nuclear - armed Pakistan , a country vital to the war against al Qaeda and other Islamist militant groups , has deteriorated at an alarming rate over the past two years .
The bombing bore the signs of an attack by al Qaeda or an affiliate , a U.S. intelligence official said .
It came hours after new President Asif Ali Zardari , widower of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto , made his first address to parliament a few hundred meters away , calling for terrorism to be rooted out .
As flames engulfed the tightly guarded hotel , part of a U.S. - based chain and popular with foreigners , diplomats and rich Pakistanis , police said there were still people trapped inside .
Zardari made a televised address to the nation on Sunday and said the bombing was cowardly .
“ This is an epidemic , a cancer in Pakistan which we will root out , ” he said .
“ We will not be afraid of these cowards . ”
Pakistan ’s army is in the midst of a major offensive against al Qaeda and Taliban fighters in the Bajaur region on the Afghan border , while the U.S. military has intensified attacks on militants on the Pakistani side of the border , infuriating many Pakistanis .
Militants have launched bomb attacks , most on security forces in the northwest , in retaliation for the strikes on them .
“ They ’re giving a very clear , unambiguous message that if the government pursues these policies , this is what ( they ) will do in response , ” Talat Masood , a retired general and defense analyst , said of the attack .
“ They are saying ‘ we can strike anywhere , at any time regardless of how good you think your security is ’ , ” he said .
An al Qaeda video , released to mark the seventh anniversary of the Sept 11 , 2001 , attacks in the United States , included a call for militants in Pakistan to step up their fight .
“ You must stand with your Mujahideen brothers in Afghanistan and ... strike the interests of Crusader ( Western ) allies in Pakistan , ” Mustafa Abu al - Yazid , an al Qaeda commander in Afghanistan , said on the tape .
20 - FOOT CRATER
Saturday ’s attack was the worst yet in the capital .
It came six months after a civilian government took power and a month after it forced former army chief and firm U.S. ally Pervez Musharraf to step down as president .
A crater up to 20 feet deep was in the road in front of the gates of the hotel , which had been bombed twice before .
The Interior Ministry said the bomb probably contained more than 500 kg ( 1,100 lb ) of explosives .
Hospitals reported 43 dead and the Interior Ministry said 236 people were wounded .
Two foreigners were killed , one an American , a security official said .
At least five foreigners were wounded .

The Danish Foreign Ministry said a Danish diplomat was missing and one was wounded .
Up to six Saudi Arabians were missing , the Saudi ambassador said .
Flames and smoke poured out of the 290 - room , city centre hotel .
Dozens of cars were destroyed and windows shattered hundreds of meters ( yards ) away .
Soldiers cordoned off the area .
After six hours , the fire was out and investigators and rescuers were going through the ruins .
A wounded hotel security official said a truck had been stopped at the hotel ’s security barrier and two small explosions had gone off minutes before the main blast .
Slideshow ( 25 images )
The owner of the Marriott , one of two five - star hotels in the capital , said guards at the security gate had exchanged fire with the attacker before he set off the explosives .
Clemens Steinkanp , a German who was slightly wounded , said hotel security men had warned guests to move to the back of the building shortly before the bomb went off .
“ Nothing happened for five minutes ... but then there was a huge blast , ” he said .
U.S. CONDEMNATION
The explosion brought down the ceiling in a banquet room where up to 300 people were at a meal to break the fast during the holy month of Ramadan .
Zardari is close to the United States and has vowed to maintain Pakistan ’s commitment to the U.S. - led campaign against violent militants , even though it is deeply unpopular .
The United States , Britain and the U.N. secretary general condemned the bombing .
“ This attack is a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by Pakistan , the United States , and all those who stand against violent extremism , ” U.S. President George W. Bush said .
In his address to parliament , Zardari said Pakistan must stop militants from using its territory for attacks on other countries .
He also said Pakistan would not tolerate infringement of its territory in the name of the fight against militancy .
Zardari , who won a presidential election this month , is due to leave for the United States on Sunday , and is scheduled to meet Bush in New York on Tuesday before the U.N. General Assembly .
Dan McTeague , the longtime Liberal MP for Pickering - Scarborough East , is best known for his Private Member 's bill on tax - deductible RESPs that caused the government a fair share of heartburn and was ultimately not supported by his own party which did not want to risk an election on the issue .
McTeague has been a longtime advocate for many consumer issues , including campaigning against high gas prices and fighting for more consular support for Canadians abroad .
Notwithstanding this record , McTeague is rapidly emerging as a vocal voice on another issue – U.S. - style DMCA copyright reform .
Indeed , while McTeague may be the Liberal Party 's Consumer Affairs critic , he is decidedly anti-consumer when it comes to the issue of copyright .
Last November , McTeague formed the Parliamentary IP Caucus , which has held regular , private meetings with those advocating tougher copyright reforms including the Canadian Manufacturing Assocation , CRIA favourite Deborah Spar , and ACTRA .
On the Industry Committee , where he sits as Vice - Chair , he pushed heavily for the anti-counterfeiting report that includes a WIPO ratification recommendation .
Yet McTeague 's emergence as the new Sam Bulte only became crystal clear at a panel session I attended in Toronto yesterday on copyright and IP , which raises critical questions about where the Liberals stand on copyright .
The panel included representatives from CRIA , CMPDA , and the ESA , whose positions were no surprise ( though the ESA waded into a net neutrality discussion by noting its conflicted position on the issue given that some of its members use of BitTorrent for distribution ) .
McTeague opened his remarks by calling on the government to act immediately on the copyright file .
He stated that his interest in the issue comes from the counterfeiting experience of Bayly Communications , a networking company in his riding .
The Canadian Anti-Counterfeiting Network cited Bayly in a 2006 report , where it stated that it found its products being copied in China and that " Bayly has been unable to identify the company in China that is manufacturing copies of its products or the markets in which they are being sold ; the company simply does not have the resources to address
this serious threat to its business . "
Interestingly , Bayly itself tells a somewhat different story .
In a February 2008 interview with Export Canada , Gary Johnson , Bayly Communication 's Vice President of Sales and Marketing , reflected on the company 's China experience .
When asked if going into the Chinese market was worth it , Johnson responded :
Oh , absolutely yes .
When we went into China , we were selling in 25 countries .
Bayly Equipment is now installed in telecom networks in over 67 , and China is key to us today , and it was key in our experience in expanding globally .
It really helped us , and is a constant reminder in the need to be properly prepared and to do our due - diligence going into these markets .
When asked about counterfeiting concerns , Johnson stated :
In the research we did subsequent to finding out that our product was copied , I found a report that showed that China was n't number one of the Asian countries that copy .
And as we got into counterfeit issues , it 's not unique to Asia by any stretch .
It 's in Canada , it 's in the U.S. , it 's in Latin America , it 's everywhere .
The extent to which it was there was quite something , but the fact that China was n't the number one of the IP [ intellectual property ] theft countries , as rated by the article I read was quite interesting as well .
We thought we were too small and too niche to be copied ; I think China is probably overstated as a market where this could possibly happen .
I think it can happen anywhere you go , and that 's where the due - diligence is key .
And there 's been no evidence of copied product outside of China , and in fact it was only that one instance where we received that one back .
They seemed to have been able to control what they were doing .
In other words , the company has faced some counterfeiting problems in China , none of which have harmed them outside that market , and the company views doing business in China as a key to its success .
I have absolutely no idea how this story provides the impetus for Canadian WIPO ratification , but McTeague is now quick to repeat the claims frequently promoted by groups like CRIA and CMPDA .
Over the course of the discussion , he :
strongly supported the property rights of IP holders with claims of theft being theft ( the property rights of consumers apparently are less of a concern to the Liberal Consumer Affairs critic )
stated that Canada 's international reputation has been harmed by its copyright laws ( only the U.S. has been very vocal about the issue and the World Economic Forum recently ranked our IP laws ahead of both the U.S. and Japan )
claimed that since we signed the WIPO Internet treaties , we must now implement them ( a position inconsistent with international law )
argued that we need to introduce the legislation and stop threats against MPs who support the legislation ( presumably a reference to the Copyright MPs )
equated Canadian and Chinese counterfeiting by arguing that " we should clean up our backyard before lecturing others " ( never mind that there is no credible evidence to support equating the two countries )
While McTeague is obviously entitled to his own views ( though errors about copyright – he incorrectly claimed that commercial use was the litmus test for fair dealing – are a problem ) , I do n't think that any MP , much less one focused on consumer affairs , should be so completely dismissive of consumer concerns .
Yet that was precisely what McTeague did , as his parting shot on the panel was to emphasize the need to restore Canada 's international reputation and not be derailed by a " handful of individuals lobbying grenades into the policy process . "
With all due respect , the tens of thousands of Canadians who have spoken out on the need for fair copyright are not a handful of people .
The musicians , film makers , educators , librarians , and businesses that have promoted balanced copyright are not lobbying hand grenades .
And the Supreme Court of Canada , which has ruled on the need for a balanced approach , is not seeking to derail the policy process .
I believe that McTeague is wrong on copyright policy and wrong about the copyright reform process .
As a new bill looms on the horizon ( rumours have it coming before the summer break ) , the big question is whether his views are his alone or if represent those of his party .
If the latter , they represent a marked departure from the Liberals ' previous Bill C- 60 and open the door to significant public opposition on the issue .
Update : Further panel coverage from ITWorldCanada .
SEPTEMBER 5-- So why did an associate of Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin 's husband file an emergency court motion Wednesday to seal all the documents in his divorce case ?
As followers of the Palin feeding frenzy know , the National Enquirer this week reported the ' incredible allegation ' that Palin had an extramarital affair with an unnamed former ' business partner ' of her husband .
Once the politician 's husband Todd learned of the purported affair , an Enquirer source claimed , he ' quickly dissolved his friendship and his business associations with the guy . '
So when the blogosphere discovered today ( via an online court docket ) that Scott Richter , a Palin associate , personally filed a sealing motion in Alaska Superior Court , well , conclusions were jumped to .
Was Sarah Palin named as the other woman in a messy divorce action ?
Well , since Richter 's September 3 motion , a copy of which you 'll find here , was denied yesterday , his divorce filings remain open to the public .
And a TSG review of the 98 - page file shows that the Palins are only mentioned in Richter 's sealing request .
According to the filing , Richter wanted the documents deemed confidential in a bid to cloak details about his home , workplace , and phone numbers because ' reporters and news agencies ' were using that information to contact him .
Richter , a 39 - year - old contractor , noted that he is ' friends and land owners in a remote cabin ' with the Palins and , as a result , journalists were intruding on the ' cabin life and private life ' of him and his 11 - year - old son .
The petition to dissolve the marriage was filed jointly last July by Richter and his ex-wife , who were not represented by lawyers .
A judge granted the dissolution less than two months after the couple filed to end their marriage .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Pressure is building on the pristine “ AAA ” rating of the United States after a federal bailout of American International Group Inc , the chairman of Standard & Poor ’s sovereign ratings committee said on Wednesday .
The $ 85 billion bailout of AIG on Tuesday by the U.S. Federal Reserve “ has weakened the fiscal profile of the United States , ” S&P ’s John Chambers told Reuters in an interview .
“ Lack of a pro-active stance could have resulted in further financial stress and put pressure on the U.S. triple - A rating , ” Chambers said .
“ There ’s no God - given gift of a ‘ AAA ’ rating , and the U.S. has to earn it like everyone else . ”
The cost of insuring 10 - year U.S. Treasury debt against default rose on Wednesday to a record high , a day after the government rescued insurer AIG with an $ 85 billion loan .
At one time , AIG was the world ’s largest insurer , ranked by market value .
At midday on Wednesday , AIG ’s stock was down 33 percent at $ 2.50 on the New York Stock Exchange .
Ten - year credit default swaps , or CDS , on Treasury debt widened 3 basis points to 26 basis points , according to data from CMA DataVision .
This means it costs $ 26,000 per year to insure $ 10 million of U.S. Treasury debt against default .
Five - year credit default swaps on Treasury debt were steady at 21.5 basis points .
That compares to 9.8 basis points on German 5 - year CDS and 13.2 basis points on German 10 - year CDS , CMA said .
Earlier this month , S&P affirmed the “ AAA ” sovereign rating of the United States , noting risks to the U.S. credit profile , including the deteriorating credit profiles for most U.S. financial institutions over the past 12 months , S&P said in a September 3 statement .
AIG BAILOUT ‘WITHOUT PRECEDENT ’
Potential upfront costs to the government of maintaining financial stability could reach 24 percent of gross domestic product in the case of a “ deep and prolonged recession , ” the S&P report said .
On Wednesday , Chambers compared the U.S. rating to a lobster cooking in a pot of cold water .
“ The lobster is still in the ‘ AAA ’ pot and still moving , ” Chambers said .
“ The heat is turning up , but the water is still ‘ AAA ’ stable . ”
Chambers also called the AIG bailout “ a signal event without precedent , ” adding : “ This will be case studied for decades to come . ”
Moody ’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also have top ratings and “ stable ” outlooks for the United States .
“ The federal government ’s debt ratios still look comfortable , and the amounts involved in the case of AIG are small , despite their large absolute amount , in comparison to federal government ’s already outstanding debt of more than $ 5 trillion , ” Moody ’s analyst Steven Hess said in an e-mail .
Hess said loans from the Fed are not on the federal government ’s balance sheet .
“ Ultimately , they could become so , but that depends on the performance of AIG in the next two years , ” he said .
In a Moody ’s report on September 9 , the rating agency said :
“ As an advanced economy with almost no foreign currency debt -- and with the ability to continue to borrow in its own currency -- the U.S. ratings face little threat in the foreseeable future . ”
Fitch analysts did n’t immediately return phone calls seeking comment .
For 60 years , happy diners at the now - shuttered Homestead tacked dollar bills to the walls , dated and inscribed with a line or two to mark the occasion .
A tradition in the high - desert hamlet of Inyokern , it made the cozy , wood - paneled restaurant a place to remember .
So when a man last week used 10 of the bills -- some inked with the word “ Homestead ” -- to pay part of a court fine , a clerk remembered .
The man and four alleged accomplices were arrested on suspicion of stealing as much as $ 8,000 in the hanging currency .
About $ 1,000 has been recovered , including several hundred dollars that the group had exchanged for bigger bills at local banks , police said .

“ Part of the place ’s charm was all the old bills , all the memories , ” said Michael Scott , senior deputy in the Kern County sheriff ’s office .
“ Everybody in town knew exactly where they came from . ”
Closed for about a year , the Homestead has been up for sale .
The bills and furnishings have been kept in place for prospective buyers -- and for locals in the sparsely settled area midway between Los Angeles and Mammoth Mountain .
“ There are people who would put up a dollar bill on every one of their anniversaries , ” said Mary Lundstrom , a Ridgecrest real estate agent who lists the property .
“ When the owners mentioned taking down the dollar bills , the town said , ‘ Do n’t you dare ! ’ ”

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The private sector shed jobs in August , dragged down by heavy losses in the manufacturing sector , according to a report released Thursday .
The private sector lost 33,000 jobs in August on a seasonally adjusted basis , according to payroll manager ADP .
A consensus of economists surveyed by Briefing.com had expected a loss of 30,000 jobs .
" The decline in August continues the recent trend in employment that is consistent with an economy that is growing slowly but has not fallen into recession , " said Joel Prakken , Chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers , in a written statement .
The August decline was lead by a drop of 78,000 jobs among goods - producing companies , the 21st monthly decline in a row , according to ADP .
The service sector , however , gained 45,000 jobs in August .
Large companies , defined as those with 500 or more workers , lost 28,000 jobs in August and medium - sized companies , with between 50 and 499 employees , lost 25,000 jobs .
Small businesses , with less than 50 workers , gained 20,000 workers in August , after adding a revised 46,000 jobs in July .
The report showed a sharp drop - off from July , when the private sector gained 1,000 jobs , spurred by a boost in small business employment .
The July reading was revised down from an increase of 9,000 jobs .
The data used in the ADP National Employment Report was taken from ADP payroll data which averaged 399,000 payrolls for 24 million U.S. employees in the first six months of 2008 .
The data set used for this month 's report was approximately the same size .
The U.S. Department of Labor will release its August employment report Friday .
A consensus of economists surveyed by Briefing .com expects the unemployment rate to hold steady at 5.7 % , while nonfarm payrolls are seen declining by 75,000 after a 51,000 drop in July .
In another separate read on the labor market released Wednesday , employers said they would cut 377,325 jobs from May to August , according to employment consulting firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas , Inc .
That is the highest level of summer job cut announcements since 2002 and represents nearly 30 % more cuts than during the first four months of the year .
Gangmaster who raped journalism student in Calais may have fled to Britain
A gangmaster believed to have raped a journalism student in a squalid Calais migrants ' camp could be on the loose in Britain .
Police say they think the people smuggler has already left the area and may have fled to the UK to avoid detection .
As horrific details emerged of the 31 - year - old student 's ordeal , detectives issued a photo e-fit provided by the victim to all UK ports , as well as British and European police .
Refugees in Calais , France .
The student was a journalist reporting on illegal immigration from Calais to Britain
The student - who cannot be named for legal reasons - had travelled to the French port to interview migrants sleeping rough before trying to sneak into Britain .
As she took photographs of a group of Afghan refugees , she was lured into a makeshift hut in the notorious unofficial camp called The Jungle by the gang leader , who told her he wanted to show her something inside .
There he held her down , repeatedly hit her around the face and body , and subjected her to a half - hour rape , police said .
Although she screamed for help , no one came to her aid .
French state prosecutor Philippe Muller said he believed the man was a French - speaking people smuggler in his 20s of Afghan or Iraqi appearance .
The human traffickers charge other immigrants up to £ 800 a time for a place in a truck or train to get to England .
Mr Muller said : ' We think he is a people smuggler because he spoke good French .
We have two photo - fit pictures based on her evidence and on that of a third party who saw her with the rapist before the attack . '
The petite brunette had been warned by local police not to go to the camp as it was a dangerous place for lone females .
Squaler : Asylum seekers in the wooded area of ' The Jungle '
She arrived in Calais last Sunday to produce a report ' to highlight problems surrounding clandestine immigration ' .
Although it appears one man raped her , police said others may face charges of aiding him , or failing to help the victim , whose screams are said to have been audible throughout her ordeal .
The woman , who was born in Canada but has lived most of her life in London , is being treated for physical injuries and undergoing counselling for mental trauma in Calais .
Referring to the alleged rapist , Mr Muller said : ' The logical route for him to have taken out of France is to England .
We are targeting Britain , Belgium and Holland but with people - smuggling contacts he could be as far away as Italy . '
Investigators have traces of the rapist 's DNA and also his fingerprints to help identify him .
It is believed he is not a French national but this possibility is not being ruled out , Mr Muller added .

Yesterday , it also emerged that the camp should have been razed to the ground only last month .
A section of the Calais riot squad was given orders to clear out the shelters in mid-July after the council feared its reputation as a no - go area was allowing serious crimes - including drug abuse and stolen property dealing - to carry on unhindered .
Ordeal :
The wood where the unnamed journalist went to photograph refugees
Up to 500 migrants - mostly claiming to be from war - torn areas such as Afghanistan and Iraq - live in the damp wood , in a disused part of The Dunes industrial zone .
Although officers carrying mini flamethrowers and armed with batons moved in on a number of no - go areas , fears that the migrants would move to the nearby Tioxide chemical plant meant they held back .
A local council source said : ' The feeling was that is was safer to keep them in The Jungle for the time being . '
Charities and even the local police admitted it was not safe to go near the area after 6 pm - a fact the rape victim ignored .
A police spokesman said : ' She was working alone , and admits going into The Jungle by herself was naive .
She has been through a terrible ordeal and is determined to bring those responsible to justice . '
Police yesterday released ten men , including six who claim to be Afghan refugees , who were being questioned in connection with the attack .
Around two hundred have been rounded up for questioning since the rape on Tuesday evening .

We live in a nice neighborhood .
Of the galaxy , that is .
The sun is about halfway toward the outer edge of the Milky Way .
But the sun may have migrated vast distances through the galaxy to wind up where we are today .
That ’s according to computer models published in the September 10th Astrophysical Journal Letters .
By about nine billion years ago , the material for the galactic disk had mostly come together , but the actual disk formation had n’t started .
Scientists simulated the formation and evolution of the galaxy from that point , using over 100,000 hours of time on a University of Texas supercomputer and a computer cluster at the University of Washington .
Turns out that while a star is orbiting around the center of the galaxy , a spiral arm can intercept the star and radically alter that orbit .
Which would explain a long - standing problem — the stars in our region have a much more varied chemistry than would be expected .
Stellar migrations could thus be responsible for making our neighborhood within the Milky Way a much more diverse and interesting place .

We hear again and again from Washington that we have turned a corner in Iraq and are on the path to victory .
If so , it is a strange victory .
Shiite religious parties that are Iran ’s closest allies in the Middle East control Iraq ’s central government and the country ’s oil - rich south .
A Sunni militia , known as the Awakening , dominates Iraq ’s Sunni center .
It is led by Baathists , the very people we invaded Iraq in 2003 to remove from power .
While the US sees the Awakening as key to defeating al - Qaeda in Iraq , Iraq ’s Shiite government views it as a mortal enemy and has issued arrest warrants for many of its members .
Meanwhile the Shiite - Kurdish alliance that brought stability to parts of Iraq is crumbling .
The two sides confronted each other militarily after the Iraqi army entered the Kurdish - administered town of Khanaqin in early September .
John McCain has staked his presidential candidacy on his early advocacy of sending more troops to Iraq .
He says he is for victory while Barack Obama is for surrender ; and polls suggest that voters trust McCain more on Iraq than they do Obama .
In 2006 , dissatisfaction with the Iraq war ended Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate .
This year , in spite of being burdened with the gravest financial crisis since 1929 and the most unpopular president since the advent of polling , the Republican presidential nominee is running a competitive race .
The US sent more troops into Iraq in 2007 and violence has declined sharply in Anbar , Baghdad , and many other parts of the country .
Sectarian killings in Baghdad are a fraction of what they were in 2006 , although that city remains one of the world ’s most dangerous places .
In recent months , US casualties have been at their lowest level of the entire war .
While it is debatable how much of this is the result of the “ surge ” in US troop strength , as opposed to other factors , the decline in violence is obviously a welcome development .
Less violence , however , is not the same thing as success .
The United States did not go to war in Iraq for the purpose of ending violence between contending sectarian forces .
Success has to be measured against US objectives .
John McCain proclaims his goal to be victory and says we are now winning in Iraq ( a victory that will , of course , be lost if his allegedly pro-surrender opponent wins ) .
He considers victory to be an Iraq that is “ a democratic ally . ”
George W. Bush has defined victory as a unified , democratic , and stable Iraq .
Neither man has explained how he will transform Iraq ’s ruling theocrats into democrats , diminish Iran ’s vast influence in Baghdad , or reconcile Kurds and Sunnis to Iraq ’s new order .
Remarkably , neither the Democrats nor the press has challenged them to do so .

In January 2007 , President Bush announced that he was sending 25,000 additional troops to Baghdad and Anbar province .
Under a military strategy devised by the newly appointed Iraq commander , General David …
Britain wanted to fuel false rumours of an invasion British spy chiefs drew up secret plans to use pigeons to spread false rumours about the impending D - Day landings .
The plot in 1943 to drop the birds into German - occupied France is revealed in newly declassified MI5 files released by the National Archives .
Germany had been intercepting pigeons carrying Allied notes , the files say , so MI5 moved to drop false information .
It planned to put extra pigeons over the west coast of France to give the impression the invasion would be there .
The revelations come in newly - released files on World War II called  Channels for deception .
' Quite delighted '
One letter to a Capt Guy Liddell said :  On average about 10 % only of the birds dropped on the Continent return to their lofts in this country - it must be assumed that a great number fall into German hands .
 During the past few weeks I also understand there has been a great concentration on the Brest and Brittany areas .
 It might therefore be possible to deduce that we have considerable interest in this region . 
It must have seemed like a really good idea at the time but possibly not the next day
Professor Christopher Andrew
MI5 's official historian
Secret deal with fascist
The deception operations surrounding the Normandy landings are considered by some historians to be the most important of World War II .
Codenamed Operation Fortitude , they were overseen by the London Controlling Section ( LCS ) , a special unit formed in 1942 within the Joint Planning Staff at the War Cabinet offices .
LCS controlling officer Col John Bevan was said to be quite delighted  with the pigeon plot , according to the files .
The first mention in the documents of using pigeons to thwart the enemy comes from MI5s Lt Col Tommy Robertson .
He said :  The pigeon is sent in a cardboard container - which can quickly be buried or burnt  with a little bag of corn and a questionnaire .
 These birds are dropped over a chosen area in the hope at least some of them will fall into the hands of ... supporters of the Allied cause .
 It occurs to me that this is a possible means of putting deception over to the enemy by the careful framing of the questionnaires as presumably the Germans must , if they capture some of these birds , take notice of the type of question asked . 
Letters can be viewed at the National Archives in Kew , west London
The documents make it clear arrangements were made to go ahead with the plan , but it is unclear if it was carried out .
The official historian of MI5 , Cambridge Professor Christopher Andrew , told BBC News :  Because pigeons are used to pass on messages , its understandable someone thought of this .
 It must have seemed like a really good idea at the time but possibly not the next day . 
The use of pigeons in intelligence has its origins in World War I when the British dropped pigeons inside baskets attached to parachutes and balloons to gather intelligence .
The D - Day invasion of German - occupied France took place on June 6 , 1944 and marked the start of a major Allied counter offensive in Europe .

What are these ?
Static .
Faint voices .
Seven slow , monotonous tones .
A pause .
Suddenly , you hear music–one of those wind - up songs played by a child ’s toy .
The melody repeats three times .
A pause .
Suddenly , you hear a female voice counting off the numbers 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 0 in German .
A pause .
She repeats the numbers .
A pause .
The children ’s toy melody returns .
This is the beginning sounds of a series of recordings called The Conet Project , which is one of the most amazing collections of found art ever made .
It ’s art , it ’s archive , it ’s a fascinating and a voyeuristic look into the world of spies and espionage .
The recording is based on the idea of Numbers Stations .
The shortwave radio stations transmit coded messages from all over the world but are strikingly similar .
They might start with a female ( sometimes synthetic ) voice and possibly a short , simple song like a children ’s melody or old folk song .
They usually repeat series of numbers and / or words and almost always start exactly on the hour and are repeated continually throughout the day .
No government or private body has actually admitted to sending coded messages in these transmissions , but the generally accepted theory is that the messages are all linked to spy networks .
They have been heard for so long that they are actually some of the earliest transmissions on shortwave .
Cuban numbers station espionage has actually been publicly prosecuted in a United States federal court .
One might think that these espionage activities should have wound down considerably since the official end of the cold war , but nothing could be further from the truth .
Numbers Stations ( and by inference , spies ) are as busy as ever , with many new and bizarre stations appearing since the fall of the Berlin wall .
Listening to these tracks is a wonderful exercise in imagination , as the brain constantly speculates that the messages being heard are instructing someone to kill someone , steal documents , or set up clandestine meetings .
The transmissions remain a mystery because messages such as these can only be decoded with a one - time pad key , which is destroyed after use .
The Conet Project recordings are not simply an archive of recordings , but they are a work of art .
The recordings are chosen based on listening interest and not necessarily on clarity .
Static fades in , a faint melody is heard … the sounds are muddled , then clear .
The experience of being a spy feels recreated and it ’s simply a fascinating and evocative journey to listen to the recordings , or just leave it on while you sleep and induce the finest nightmares available .
Below are some sample recordings .
The first transmissions are a 100 % complete ( ie longer ) recording of The Lincolnshire Poacher , a recording of the now off the air OLX and MOSSAD stations .
Like most numbers stations transmissions , it is not known for sure who is responsible for them , The recordings of ‘ NNN ’ , ‘ The Russian Man ’ , ‘ English Man ’ and ‘ English Lady ’ are all shorter examples .

The recordings ( find them here ) are somewhat pricey ( keep reading below if you ’re broke ) , but they are well worth it .
It ’s 4 CD ’s ( 150 tracks ! ) and an 80 - page booklet full of VERY interesting information n the Numbers transmissions .
You ’ll never find anything else like it .

The fallout from the FBI raid on EliteTorrents in 2005 continues .
Today , 26 year - old Daniel Dove has been sentenced to 18 months in prison and a $ 20,000 fine for the work he put in on the private BitTorrent tracker Elitetorrents .
During 2005 , Federal Agents assisted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) , first infiltrated and then shutdown EliteTorrents , a BitTorrent tracker with more than 130,000 members .
In a May they took down the server and left this message , which was viewed more than 500,000 times in the week following the raid .
Daniel Dove , one of the arrested administrators of the Elitetorrents tracker initially opted for a ‘ not guilty ’ plea , but his gamble did n’t pay off .
The jury was told that Dove was responsible for managing and recruiting the crucial ‘ uploaders ’ on the site ( original seeders ) and that he also operated a server which was used to distribute pirate material .
The jury believed this version of events and found Dove guilty on one count each of conspiracy and felony copyright infringement .
Today , Dove has was sentenced to 18 months in prison , three years of supervised release and a $ 20,000 fine .
Dove is the only administrator of Elitetorrents to plead “ not guilty ” .
In 2006 , Scott McCausland pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement and one count of criminal copyright infringement for his uploading of Star Wars : Episode III .
McCausland received jail time and home confinement and on his release told TorrentFreak : “ After 5 months in prison , and another 5 months on home confinement , I have just one obstacle left : my 1.5 years left of probation . ”
Fellow site admin Grant Stanley , then aged 23 , pleaded guilty to the same offenses as Scott and received the same sentence with the addition of a $ 3,000 fine .
Other admins and uploaders who pleaded guilty include Sam Kuonen , then aged 24 , 22 year old Scott D. Harvanek and An Duc Do , aged 25 .
Dove ’s sentence is the eighth resulting from Operation D - Elite but this federal crackdown did n’t end up causing a decrease in overall private BitTorrent tracker availability .
Instead , soon after the raids the Elitetorrents members spread out to other trackers , the major difference is that most of them are now hosted outside the US .

World War II Graves US Military Searches German Battlefields for Fallen Soldiers
Experts with the United States military expend enormous resources to search for the bodies of missing soldiers .
A team is currently at work in the northern Eifel Mountains region of western Germany , where tens of thousands of Americans died during World War II .
The collapse of a crane at an Upper East Side construction site on Friday morning killed two workers and severely damaged several high - rise apartments .
And it left many New Yorkers pondering an unsettling question :
This again ?
It was the second time in two months that a familiar urban fear came to stunning fruition : a similar incident in March killed seven people and prompted officials to enact more stringent safety regulations and assure the public that they should not be afraid of construction sites around the city .
But Friday ’s deadly accident has turned up the debate among citizens and politicians about whether the city acted forcefully enough to address those concerns  and whether New Yorkers still felt unsafe .

" I always look up at that crane , ” said Linda Taylor , 49 , a traffic officer who worked in the neighborhood near the site of Friday ’s collapse .
She said she had developed a habit of checking the crane , especially after the incident in March .
“ I ’m afraid to drive under it , ” she said .
The city could not immediately account for the cause of the collapse , which occurred moments after 8 a.m. at a construction site at the corner of 91st Street and First Avenue .
Witnesses said the horizontal , unloaded arm of the crane began to circle and then snapped off , propelling the cab and the upper portion of the arm onto a white - brick residential building across the street .
The cab demolished part of a top - floor penthouse and then plunged down the north facade , shearing off balconies and leaving a trail of pockmarks in the brick .

The operator of the crane , Donald Leo , 30 , of Staten Island , was sitting in the cab as the structure fell .
He was pulled from the wreckage by rescue workers and pronounced dead at the scene .
A second man , Ramadan Kurtaj , 27 , of the Bronx , was also killed .
No one in the building was injured , and one pedestrian was treated for a minor injury and released , according to the mayor .
The collapse occurred just two days after the city relaxed some of the rules it had put in place after the March accident .
Instead of requiring inspectors to be on hand at construction sites when a crane is erected or made taller , the Buildings Department said on Wednesday that it would switch to a system of spot checks and “ safety meetings ” where workers would be briefed on proper procedures .
Queensland scientists have successfully turned synthetic material into an embryonic stem cell , in a research breakthrough that may one day quell the debate over stem cell therapies .
The process , which derives embryonic stem cells from chemically - synthesised proteins , may eventually eliminate the controversial step of destroying human embryos for stem cell therapies , scientists from Queensland University of Technology ( QUT ) say .
" The achievement overcomes one of the major obstacles to the approved use of stem cell therapies , " QUT Associate Professor David Leavesly said .
" Take care of your Mother " Can you hear that phrase , gentle men of the movements ?
Does it resound with a shiver in the soul , a reflexive shadow of childhood ?
Naturally .
For it was what we were taught by our primary nurturer .
Take care of Mother .
Provide and protect and never , ever be angry at your selflessly giving mother , or at the surrogates we date and mate and marry .
It 's a dynamic as old as time and as unavoidable as death .
Men carry the rage in many families and battle with their fathers , while peer out from hiding , cheering the vanquished .
We guard the walls , and slay each other .
We do our mother 's bidding .
We protect her from our rage .
We meet and beat drums and perpetuate patricide , slaying our fathers in words if not in deed , while mother hides and orchestrates the bloodshed .
Rare is the man who will stand and vent his justified anger at women ; rarer still is a man who will confront women with his righteous rage .
The few who do so around our sacred circles touch a raw nerve and release a basso - profundo growl that fades , forgotten and ignored , yet still resonates below the threshold of consciousness .
Those men create a nervousness and paranoia , then atavistic conditioning kicks in .
We ignore our mothers , turn to our fathers , and we scream our challenge to only one of our parents .
We have all been deeply wounded by women , as they have been deeply wounded by men .
I believe most men have an unformed , nebulous indictment to present : that they silently yearn to confront the women who have wounded them and scream , " J'Accuse " .
Yet they lack the courage of a Emile Zola , or his resolution to suffer the consequences of challenging hypocrisy and scapegoating .
For men know they shall be punished and ostracized , blamed and shamed ; they fear losing their mothers .
They fear being abandoned if they see women 's shadow and hold up a mirror .
Men fear losing our emotional umbilicals , and they do not know , deep in their hearts , that they can feed themselves .
Men suffer the slings and arrows of women 's rage in silence , and bare their breasts to the justified and the ludicrous .
If projection is an arrow , it sticks where it finds a soft spot , and the target carries the disowned parts for the archer ; the fletching of the bolt betrays the pattern of those who let fly their shadow .
Men have listened to women , absorbed their arrows .
It is time men insist that women return the favor .
It is time men shot their arrows back , along with a few carefully crafted shafts from their quivers .
Sam Keen wrote a paragraph that has haunted me , " Honor your anger , but before you express it , sort out the righteousness from the unrighteous .
Immediately after a storm , the water runs muddy ; rage is indiscriminate .
It takes time to discriminate , for the mud to settle .
But once the stream runs clear , express your outrage against any who have violated your being .
Give the person you intend to love the gift of discriminating anger . "
Men have no holding pond where the silt may settle , no safe backwater to allow toxic contaminants to separate and settle safely to the bottom before they give that gift .
The men's movements have created a place to cope with the wounds of fathers , yet has not yet developed the maturity or courage to build a pond where men can distill their rage against women .
It is as if , in the varied attempts to name and heal the wounds of our childhood , men have triaged a portion of their souls , condemning it to fester in silence .
We still speak in our councils as if we are bugged by the Great Feminist in the Sky , as if our women can hear our words , as if our mothers know each whisper before it is uttered ; we know we will be condemned .
I sense in many men the fear that their women can read their minds , and know that on the first Saturday morning of the month , we meet to plot the most grievous of crimes .
If the original motivation of beginning their healing journeys for many men was the salvation of a relationship - an ultimatum of change delivered by a woman - then it stands to reason that men still follow a hint of their directions , a faint tracing of a woman 's blueprints for our growth .
Except in very rare circumstances , that does not include examining women 's crimes against men , for no one relishes confronting their own shadow .
Men anguish about their relationships , yet never spelunk for ghosts in the darker caves of the soul , where our mothers lurk , where ex-lovers and wives and female friends hide their scheming .
It 's time men invited women into the circle for a few rounds , as we have figuratively stomped our fathers and mentors and friends , for in their own passive aggressive deniability , in their sly subtlety , in their new - found overt aggression , women have wounded us as grievously as we have wounded them .
Detailing the wounds will take far more space than I have here , and each man has his own map of scars : suffice to say that the wounds are real .
If there is ever to be a healing of the rift between men and women , men must treat women women as equals , and equals do not need to be protected .
Men must take the risks of punishment and ostracism to grow : in the process of separation from women who refuse to own their shadow , men develop the necessary emotional skills to gather their needs from themselves and other men , rather than single sourcing their needs .
I believe we must create a sacred space where men can explore their own exploitation by women , their own woundings inflicted by women , and the inevitable feelings of anger and rage .
Men cannot do this work with women , as by and large , they could not do this work with men .
While women have the support structure in place , and men are inundated by the flood of their anger in the media , in the workplace , and in our homes , men have no comparable sanctuary , no societal permission .
Men do not yet have a sacred mat where wrestling with this particular demon is encouraged and allowed : no ritual , no example , no framework .
I have this sneaking suspicion that we , as a society , will never heal the rift between men and women as long as society exempts women from accountability .
Each man has his own wounds for which women tend to evade responsibility .
I 've found that the men I meet in our gatherings tend to have done much of the hard work of holding themselves responsible for their crimes of the heart , yet I have seen no comparable trend in the women 's writings and gatherings .
If men are to avoid the tragic mistakes of the women 's movement , the polarizing , blaming affect of raw , undiluted , undiscriminating rage , men need to create their own place of purification before they hand that anger back where it belongs ; most women will not help us , and I fear that most will actively oppose that work .
For they fear men's anger , with good reason .
They fear men will beat them , and rape them , and dehumanize them .
They live in terror of male rage , a fear almost as deep as that of looking into their own dark side .
I know that fear , as I still live in terror of female rage .
Though my story is rather extreme , I am not alone or unique in my fear : wounds need not cut to the bone to inflict agony .
I knew my mother 's rage when she raped me , my grandmother 's rage when she molested me , and I predictably chose women who were infected with similar anger .
We acted that rage out , and I battered and was battered , abused and was abused in the endless dance of swords .
The only way I have learned to harness and release my rage was to speak my truth , to seek the source of my rage , and to express that anger directly to those who harmed me , rather than acting it out in the banal circle of re-enactment with designated surrogates .
The only true safety for women from my rage is my commitment to confront my own demons .
All the anger management classes and battering awareness programs in the world may change some behavior , but they will never get to the core problem : men are angry with and at women , and women caused a large portion the old fashioned way - they earned it .
You might be able to stop a boy from battering but you can't take the battering out of a boy by shaming him - he will continue to act out that anger in different ways .
The rage that women fear has its genesis not just in the conditioning of our society , or in the myth of testosterone poisoning , or from our father 's fists , but also in our mother 's arms : our current thinking treats only the symptoms , but not the disease .
For if our father 's were absent , who raised us ?
Who molded us ?
Who tailored us to their needs ?
Mothers .
Men are angry , and a large portion of that anger is righteous .
Men need a place to discharge that rage .
Stand back , gentlemen .
Your mother is , by the proclamations of her peers , a strong and capable human being ; let her defend herself .
Men need not protect her , her sisters , or her successors , from the consequences of their actions .
I believe the next evolutionary step in men's movements is to create a place where men can hone the gift of anger , to join later in loving combat .
Men 's anger is neither congenitally abusive or inherently unjustifiable : it is the inevitable product of their experience with women .
I fear men cannot find healing and reconciliation until they know their darkness , and can name their tormentors : first to their brothers , then to the face of their intimate enemies .
First to brothers , who can and will listen and hear .
First in sacred circles , and men's magazines and books .
Then to mothers and lovers and friends : clear and brilliant , the gift of our anger rather than the poison .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
There are more new cases of Americans infected with HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , than previously believed , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Saturday .
A woman uses the Oraquick rapid HIV testing device at a New York health clinic in 2006 .
About 56,000 people became infected with HIV in the past year , which translates to about 40 percent more cases than officials had estimated , said Dr. Kevin Fenton , director of the CDC's National Center for HIV / AIDS , Viral Hepatitis , STD and TB Prevention .
Previous CDC estimates suggested about 40,000 new people were infected each year .
But those estimates used " limited data and less precise methods , " said the center , which is now using technology capable of determining when someone was infected .
The new method can indicate whether someone has been infected with HIV during the previous five months , rather than relying on statistical models .
Diagnosis of HIV can occur years after infection , he said .
" The fact that 56,000 Americans each year are contracting HIV for the first time is a wake - up call for all of us in the U.S. , " Fenton said .

Are you living with HIV infection ?

" These numbers are a scathing indictment of how profoundly U.S. and CDC HIV prevention efforts have failed , " said Michael Weinstein , president of AIDS Healthcare Foundation , which calls itself " the nation 's largest provider of HIV / AIDS medical care . "
Weinstein called on the United States to appropriate $ 200 million for the testing of 10 million people over the next three years .
" Identifying all those who are infected and linking them to treatment is the only way to break the chain of new infections and begin to address the nation 's runaway epidemic , " he said .
In the United States , more than 1 million people are living with HIV , and about one - fourth of them are unaware they have the virus , the CDC said .
See a breakdown of HIV cases in the U.S. »
According to the report , 53 percent of new HIV infections occur in homosexual or bisexual men .
African - Americans account for 45 percent , or 25,000 new cases annually , meaning they are seven times more likely to contract HIV than whites .
In Washington , D.C. , 80 percent of people living with HIV are African - American , according to Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health .
Watch more on the new AIDS numbers »
On Tuesday , the California - based think tank Black AIDS Institute released a report that suggests that the AIDS epidemic among African - Americans in parts of the United States is as severe as it is in parts of Africa .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : HIV / AIDS
If African - Americans made up their own country , it would rank 16th globally in the number of people living with HIV , said Black AIDS Institute founder Phill Wilson .
The number of people newly infected has remained relatively stable since the late 1990s , and the more accurate estimate does not change that , the CDC said .
Wilson said the numbers were especially startling considering that the United States lacked the infrastructure to handle 40,000 new HIV cases each year .
Now , with the numbers as high as 56,000 a year , it 's even worse , he said .
" We do not have a national AIDS strategy , " said Wilson , suggesting that the new numbers should translate into a " national call to action . "
Fenton acknowledged more needs to be done , but said the CDC was bound to operate within " the president 's budget . "
Ideally , he said , a response to the epidemic would include more investment in prevention efforts .
The CDC will work with the Department of Health and Human Services , along with other public and private organizations , to " add to the federal pot , " he said .
" Every year , more than 15,000 people are dying from this disease , and AIDS is a major killer for some of our minority communities , " he said .
" The key thing we have to focus on now is what , how and when do we begin to enhance the prevention responses to end this epidemic . "
Fenton and Wilson said removing stigma and discrimination are necessary first steps .
People need to be educated about how they can prevent infection and , if they do get HIV , how they can get tested and treated as soon as possible .
Since the mid-1990s , antiretroviral therapies have turned HIV and AIDS into more of a chronic illness rather than a death sentence .
Until a vaccine is developed , getting infected people on antiretrovirals as early as possible would improve their long - term outcome .
The new data is scheduled for publication in the peer - reviewed Journal of the American Medical Association .
The report 's release is meant to coincide with the opening Sunday of the the biannual International AIDS Conference in Mexico City , Mexico .

ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - Leaders of Pakistan ’s coalition government on Tuesday set about seeking a replacement for President Pervez Musharraf and tackling pressing economic and security problems .
Musharraf , former army chief and key ally of the United States in its campaign against terrorism , resigned on Monday to avoid impeachment nearly nine years after taking power in a coup .
Speculation he would resign had mounted since the fractious coalition government , led by the party of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto , said this month it planned to impeach him on charges of violating the constitution .
Prolonged wrangling over Musharraf ’s position hurt financial markets in the nuclear - armed country of 165 million people , and raised concern in Washington and elsewhere that it was distracting from efforts to tackle militants , especially in areas bordering Afghanistan .
Musharraf ’s resignation lifted Pakistan shares on Monday to their biggest one - day rise in eight weeks , and helped the rupee recover slightly .
But analysts said the rebound was temporary .
“ It ’s a major victory for the new government but there is still a lot of uncertainty going forward , ” said Sayem Ali , an economist at Standard Chartered Bank .
Mushtaq Khan , a London - based analyst at Citi , said the government could now focus on the economy , taking concrete steps to restore investor confidence shattered by the political turmoil .
These include shrinking the trade deficit by banning imports of non-essential items such as luxury consumer goods , and cutting government spending by abolishing all fuel subsidies , Khan said .
QUESTIONS
Divisive questions still hang over Musharraf ’s fate .
There was no announcement on Monday on whether he would get immunity from prosecution and be allowed to live freely in Pakistan .
Coalition officials had said Musharraf sought immunity from prosecution , but he said in his resignation address to the nation he was asking for nothing .
“ I leave my future in the hands of the nation and people , ” he said .
One main coalition party , that of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif whom Musharraf ousted in 1999 , has insisted he face trial for treason .
Bhutto ’s party says parliament should decide .

With the coalition partners ’ preoccupation with Musharraf out of the way , the United States and other allies will be keen to see the government focus on security .
Hundreds of people have been killed in a wave of suicide attacks in Pakistan in recent months and the U.S. Pentagon said in June insurgent havens in Pakistan were the biggest threat to Afghan security .
President George W. Bush said he appreciated Musharraf ’s efforts to fight al Qaeda and other extremists , and was committed to a strong Pakistan that strengthened democracy and fought terrorism .

Old rival India reacted cautiously to Musharraf ’s resignation .
Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee told reporters : “ India will continue to have an amicable relation with Pakistan in the days to come ” .
Pakistan is committed to a peace process with India launched under Musharraf , but India fears a weak civilian government will not have his influence over the army and military spy agency , which India suspects has a hand in most attacks on its soil .
The chairman of the Senate , Mohammadmian Soomro , will be acting president until a new one is elected within 30 days , but it is not clear who that will be .
Traditionally , Pakistan ’s president has been a figurehead , although under Musharraf the office was much more powerful .

On Obama , Earmarks , Palin Less Than Honest Palin's RNC speech bent the truth on her record and on the opposition .
Sept. 4 , 2008  --
In a rousing speech at last night 's Republican National Convention , vice presidential hopeful Sarah Palin , the governor of Alaska , touted her record , attacked the opposition , and in some cases , bent the facts .
• PALIN : " [ Obama ] is a man who can give an entire speech about the wars America is fighting , and never use the word ' victory ' except when he 's talking about his own campaign . "
FACT : On July 15 , in a speech in Washington , D.C. , Obama twice used the word " victory " in reference to Iraq .
" In fact , " he said , " true success in Iraq -- victory in Iraq -- will not take place in a surrender ceremony where an enemy lays down their arms .
... I want Iraqis to take responsibility for their own future , and to reach the political accommodation necessary for long - term stability .
That 's victory .
That 's success .
That 's what 's best for Iraq , that 's what 's best for America , and that 's why I will end this war as president .
A week later in Berlin , Germany , on July 23 , Obama used the word " victory " three times to describe Allied successes during World War II .
And in a June speech about the prospect of universal health care , he said Sen. Hillary Clinton " will be central to that victory . "
• PALIN : " There is much to like and admire about our opponent .
But listening to him speak , it 's easy to forget that this is a man who has authored two memoirs but not a single major law or reform -- not even in the state senate . "
FACT : The meaning of " major " is open to debate , but Obama worked with Republicans , including Sen .
Richard Luger of Indiana , to pass legislation that would expand efforts to intercept illegal shipments of weapons of mass destruction and to destroy conventional weapons stockpiles .
While a state senator in Illinois , he sponsored two contentious bills , one that studied racial profiling by police and another that ordered interrogations in potential death penalty cases to be recorded .
• PALIN : " I fought to bring about the largest private - sector infrastructure project in North American history .
And when that deal was struck , we began a nearly $ 40 billion natural gas pipeline to help lead America to energy independence .
That pipeline , when the last section is laid and its valves are opened , will lead America one step farther away from dependence on dangerous foreign powers that do not have our interests at heart . "
FACT : That infrastructure project has not yet been approved by federal regulators .
The proposed pipeline would ship natural gas from the Alaska 's North Slope to homes and businesses across the United States .
In June , the Alaskan legislature , with Palin 's prodding , agreed to pay Canadian energy company TransCanada $ 500 million as an incentive to build the pipeline .
• PALIN : " And I have protected the taxpayers by vetoing wasteful spending : nearly half a billion dollars in vetoes .
I suspended the state fuel tax and championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress .
I told the Congress ' thanks , but no thanks , ' for that Bridge to Nowhere . "
FACT : While serving as mayor of Wasilla , Alaska , Palin hired Steven Silver , a former chief of staff for Sen .
Ted Stevens , to lobby Congress for earmarks .
Wasilla received around $ 27 million in federal money , about as much as Boise , Idaho .
Boise has a population of 200,000 people , compared with Wasilla 's 10,000 .
Earmarked funds went to sewage improvements and improving roads connecting the town to a local ski resort .
As for the Bridge to Nowhere , Palin initially supported using federal funds to build a $ 398 million bridge from Ketchikan to Gravina Island , which has 50 residents and a small airport .
It was not until the plan was ridiculed that she withdrew her support .
Critics contend she still supports using federal money to build a 3.4 mile Road to Nowhere on the island for $ 26 million -- from the funds for the bridge .
• PALIN : While I was at it , I got rid of a few things in the governor 's office that I did n't believe our citizens should have to pay for .
That luxury jet was over the top .
I put it on eBay .
I also drive myself to work .
FACT : Soon after entering office , Palin put the state - owned Westwind II jet that her predecessor Frank Murkowski purchased amid much criticism .
When the deal fell through with the sole eBay bidder , the plane was sold offline .
Alaskan businessman Larry Reynolds paid $ 2.1 million for the jet after learning about it from Republican John L. Harris , speaker of the Alaskan House of Representatives .
Palin , as she said , drives herself to work .
In July , her Chevy Suburban was rear - ended while driving from Wasilla to her office in downtown Anchorage .
The Associated Press contributed to this report .
To get in the debating mood , Republican John McCain will host a town - hall event and take a short nap .
His rival , Democrat Barack Obama , will work out or shoot hoops .
Sen .
Obama will spar for the debate with Greg Craig , a Washington lawyer and former official in the Clinton administration who is one of his few gray - haired advisers .
A McCain spokeswoman declined to discuss who will practice with Sen. McCain .

Clang - Features and Goals
This page describes the features and goals of Clang in more detail and gives a more broad explanation about what we mean .
These features are :
End -User Features :
Utility and Applications :
Internal Design and Implementation :
A major focus of our work on clang is to make it fast , light and scalable .
The library - based architecture of clang makes it straight - forward to time and profile the cost of each layer of the stack , and the driver has a number of options for performance analysis .
Many detailed benchmarks can be found online .
Compile time performance is important , but when using clang as an API , often memory use is even more so : the less memory the code takes the more code you can fit into memory at a time ( useful for whole program analysis tools , for example ) .
In addition to being efficient when pitted head - to - head against GCC in batch mode , clang is built with a library based architecture that makes it relatively easy to adapt it and build new tools with it .
This means that it is often possible to apply out - of - the - box thinking and novel techniques to improve compilation in various ways .
In addition to being fast and functional , we aim to make Clang extremely user friendly .
As far as a command - line compiler goes , this basically boils down to making the diagnostics ( error and warning messages ) generated by the compiler be as useful as possible .
There are several ways that we do this , but the most important are pinpointing exactly what is wrong in the program , highlighting related information so that it is easy to understand at a glance , and making the wording as clear as possible .
Here is one simple example that illustrates the quality of Clang diagnostic :
$ clang - fsyntax - only t.c t.c:7:39 : error : invalid operands to binary expression ( ' int ' and ' struct A ' ) return y + func(y ?
( ( SomeA.X + 40 ) + SomeA ) / 42 + SomeA.X : SomeA.X ) ; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~
Here you can see that you do n't even need to see the original source code to understand what is wrong based on the Clang error : Because Clang prints a caret , you know exactly which plus it is complaining about .
The range information highlights the left and right side of the plus which makes it immediately obvious what the compiler is talking about , which is very useful for cases involving precedence issues and many other situations .
Clang diagnostics are very polished and have many features .
For more information and examples , please see the Expressive Diagnostics page .
GCC is currently the defacto - standard open source compiler today , and it routinely compiles a huge volume of code .
GCC supports a huge number of extensions and features ( many of which are undocumented ) and a lot of code and header files depend on these features in order to build .
While it would be nice to be able to ignore these extensions and focus on implementing the language standards to the letter , pragmatics force us to support the GCC extensions that see the most use .
Many users just want their code to compile , they do n't care to argue about whether it is pedantically C99 or not .
As mentioned above , all extensions are explicitly recognized as such and marked with extension diagnostics , which can be mapped to warnings , errors , or just ignored .
A major design concept for clang is its use of a library - based architecture .
In this design , various parts of the front - end can be cleanly divided into separate libraries which can then be mixed up for different needs and uses .
In addition , the library - based approach encourages good interfaces and makes it easier for new developers to get involved ( because they only need to understand small pieces of the big picture ) .
" The world needs better compiler tools , tools which are built as libraries .
This design point allows reuse of the tools in new and novel ways .
However , building the tools as libraries is n't enough : they must have clean APIs , be as decoupled from each other as possible , and be easy to modify / extend .
This requires clean layering , decent design , and keeping the libraries independent of any specific client . "
Currently , clang is divided into the following libraries and tool :
libsupport - Basic support library , from LLVM .

libsystem - System abstraction library , from LLVM .

clang -

As an example of the power of this library based design ....
If you wanted to build a preprocessor , you would take the Basic and Lexer libraries .
If you want an indexer , you would take the previous two and add the Parser library and some actions for indexing .
If you want a refactoring , static analysis , or source - to - source compiler tool , you would then add the AST building and semantic analyzer libraries .
For more information about the low - level implementation details of the various clang libraries , please see the clang Internals Manual .
Clang is designed and built with many grand plans for how we can use it .
The driving force is the fact that we use C and C++ daily , and have to suffer due to a lack of good tools available for it .
We believe that the C and C++ tools ecosystem has been significantly limited by how difficult it is to parse and represent the source code for these languages , and we aim to rectify this problem in clang .
The problem with this goal is that different clients have very different requirements .
Consider code generation , for example : a simple front - end that parses for code generation must analyze the code for validity and emit code in some intermediate form to pass off to a optimizer or backend .
Because validity analysis and code generation can largely be done on the fly , there is not hard requirement that the front - end actually build up a full AST for all the expressions and statements in the code .
TCC and GCC are examples of compilers that either build no real AST ( in the former case ) or build a stripped down and simplified AST ( in the later case ) because they focus primarily on codegen .
On the opposite side of the spectrum , some clients ( like refactoring ) want highly detailed information about the original source code and want a complete AST to describe it with .
Refactoring wants to have information about macro expansions , the location of every paren expression '( ( ( x ) ) ) ' vs 'x ' , full position information , and much more .
Further , refactoring wants to look across the whole program to ensure that it is making transformations that are safe .
Making this efficient and getting this right requires a significant amount of engineering and algorithmic work that simply are unnecessary for a simple static compiler .
The beauty of the clang approach is that it does not restrict how you use it .
In particular , it is possible to use the clang preprocessor and parser to build an extremely quick and light - weight on - the - fly code generator ( similar to TCC ) that does not build an AST at all .
As an intermediate step , clang supports using the current AST generation and semantic analysis code and having a code generation client free the AST for each function after code generation .
Finally , clang provides support for building and retaining fully - fledged ASTs , and even supports writing them out to disk .
Designing the libraries with clean and simple APIs allows these high - level policy decisions to be determined in the client , instead of forcing " one true way " in the implementation of any of these libraries .
Getting this right is hard , and we do n't always get it right the first time , but we fix any problems when we realize we made a mistake .
Integration with IDEs
We believe that Integrated Development Environments ( IDE's ) are a great way to pull together various pieces of the development puzzle , and aim to make clang work well in such an environment .
The chief advantage of an IDE is that they typically have visibility across your entire project and are long - lived processes , whereas stand - alone compiler tools are typically invoked on each individual file in the project , and thus have limited scope .
There are many implications of this difference , but a significant one has to do with efficiency and caching : sharing an address space across different files in a project , means that you can use intelligent caching and other techniques to dramatically reduce analysis / compilation time .
A further difference between IDEs and batch compiler is that they often impose very different requirements on the front - end : they depend on high performance in order to provide a " snappy " experience , and thus really want techniques like " incremental compilation " , " fuzzy parsing " , etc .
Finally , IDEs often have very different requirements than code generation , often requiring information that a codegen - only frontend can throw away .
Clang is specifically designed and built to capture this information .
We actively intend for clang ( and LLVM as a whole ) to be used for commercial projects , not only as a stand - alone compiler but also as a library embedded inside a proprietary application .
We feel that the license encourages contributors to pick up the source and work with it , and believe that those individuals and organizations will contribute back their work if they do not want to have to maintain a fork forever ( which is time consuming and expensive when merges are involved ) .
Further , nobody makes money on compilers these days , but many people need them to get bigger goals accomplished : it makes sense for everyone to work together .
For more information about the LLVM / clang license , please see the LLVM License Description for more information .
Clang is designed and built by experienced compiler developers who are increasingly frustrated with the problems that existing open source compilers have .
Clang is carefully and thoughtfully designed and built to provide the foundation of a whole new generation of C/C++/ Objective C development tools , and we intend for it to be production quality .
Being a production quality compiler means many things : it means being high performance , being solid and ( relatively ) bug free , and it means eventually being used and depended on by a broad range of people .
While we are still in the early development stages , we strongly believe that this will become a reality .
Our goal is to make it possible for anyone with a basic understanding of compilers and working knowledge of the C/C++/ ObjC languages to understand and extend the clang source base .
A large part of this falls out of our decision to make the AST mirror the languages as closely as possible : you have your friendly if statement , for statement , parenthesis expression , structs , unions , etc , all represented in a simple and explicit way .
In addition to a simple design , we work to make the source base approachable by commenting it well , including citations of the language standards where appropriate , and designing the code for simplicity .
Beyond that , clang offers a set of AST dumpers , printers , and visualizers that make it easy to put code in and see how it is represented .
Clang is the " C Language Family Front - end " , which means we intend to support the most popular members of the C family .
We are convinced that the right parsing technology for this class of languages is a hand - built recursive - descent parser .
Because it is plain C++ code , recursive descent makes it very easy for new developers to understand the code , it easily supports ad - hoc rules and other strange hacks required by C/C++ , and makes it straight - forward to implement excellent diagnostics and error recovery .
We believe that implementing C/C++/ObjC in a single unified parser makes the end result easier to maintain and evolve than maintaining a separate C and C++ parser which must be bugfixed and maintained independently of each other .
When you start work on implementing a language , you find out that there is a huge gap between how the language works and how most people understand it to work .
This gap is the difference between a normal programmer and a ( scary ? super - natural ? ) " language lawyer " , who knows the ins and outs of the language and can grok standardese with ease .
In practice , being conformant with the languages means that we aim to support the full language , including the dark and dusty corners ( like trigraphs , preprocessor arcana , C99 VLAs , etc ) .
Where we support extensions above and beyond what the standard officially allows , we make an effort to explicitly call this out in the code and emit warnings about it ( which are disabled by default , but can optionally be mapped to either warnings or errors ) , allowing you to use clang in " strict " mode if you desire .
As much as the know - nothing media talked about divided Democrats , Obama felt no need to use his VP pick to rally the base and unite his party .
Biden was picked precisely because Obama felt he was the best pick for the ticket , not because he needed to mollify one group or another .
Now we see McCain 's pick of Quayle Palin , and it's clear that he was forced to kow - tow to the Huckabee / Dobson wing of the Republican Party .
We already know she is virulently anti-choice .
But did you know she is a creationist ?
The volatile issue of teaching creation science in public schools popped up in the Alaska governor 's race this week when Republican Sarah Palin said she thinks creationism should be taught alongside evolution in the state 's public classrooms .
Palin was answering a question from the moderator near the conclusion of Wednesday night 's televised debate on KAKM Channel 7 when she said , " Teach both .
You know , do n't be afraid of information .
Two years ago , Palin was part - time mayor of a village of 6,000 .
Today , she 's supposedly ready to step in to run this country in the eventuality that Sen.
McCentury can no longer perform those duties ?
Right .
This was a sop to the Right , which was unwilling to accept a pro-choice Republican on the ticket , and a pathetic and hilariously desperate effort to grab the 17 holdout PUMAs ( who are fake Democrats already willing to vote for McCain anyway ) .

When it 's time to clink glasses a couple of friends usually ask me , “ Whaddid the market do today ? ”
They know I keep track and can always pop back an answer — up a hundred , down three hundred , whatever .
They 're usually too polite to remind me that I usually have no clue , or a very small one , about what it means .
As an exercise in greed and fear , “ the market ” moves do little more than reflect those emotions , feelings as fickle as a romantic adolescent .
What to do about the current market disorder is a libertarian issue beyond the now - routine argument that we should let the banks fail because they certainly erred and probably sinned .
Libertarian thought is welded to a base of seeing things as they are .
The financial markets and the irrational government solutions of the moment are reeling from statist thought , which holds just the opposite .
The political and financial establishments have married the idea that prices of stocks and bonds — and most other things — ought to result from something other than an agreement between willing buyers and sellers .
Now , conventional wisdom holds there is an underlying rationality to the financial world and that the bright and hard - working investor or trader will prosper “ over time ” by identifying and acting on that reality .
That may be true if someone will create a useful definition of “ over time . ”
And if prosperity is redefined as wealth rather than numbers of dollars .
And if the police power of the state is not permitted to inject irrationality into private investing decisions .
If “ over time ” is taken to mean yesterday , the ultimate fear , panic , ruled the grimy corners of Wall Street , and the sky really is falling , all because a certain minute and polluted strain of libertarian sentiment invaded the alien environs of the United States House of Representatives .
Our leaders there paid lip service — so transient as to be nearly invisible — to one immutable law of economics which decrees that stupidity hurts because it is supposed to .
A libertarian glancing at a calendar and noting the proximity of Nov. 4 wo n't take comfort from that .
He will recognize that enough seat holders glimpsed their real fear , the threat of having to seek honest work when a new congress is sworn in January .
It was n't free - market clarity of thought that prompted the defeat .
It was political panic .
It occurred to enough of our 435 representatives that an “ aye ” vote would require them to explain to Joe and Sally Sixpack that while ( a ) the titans of finance deserve rescue by the taxpayers , ( b ) you , Joe and Sally , are on your own after losing your life savings in precisely parallel games at the nearest casino .
Or accepting a mortgage you could n't afford .
You say the Sixpack family did n't understand the game , so tough luck Joe ?
That 's a miserable answer because the Ivy League PhD and MBA masterminds of Fanny Mae , Freddie Mac , Lehman , AIG , and the others did n't understand their game , either .
Nor did the politicians who created the climate which culminated in today 's financial darkness .
If you need evidence that the bankers were shooting craps in the dark , just check almost anything written on the subject over the past six months .
By the trillions of dollars they bought and sold and borrowed against assets whose value was unknown and perhaps unknowable – CDOs , CMOs , credit default swaps , and other derivatives removed by light - years from assets they were supposed to represent .
The Vegas casino analogy to the trading patterns of our best and brightest is exact : you stay , hit , or double down at the black jack table without looking at your second card .
A rational mind has more trouble dealing with the fallen czars of high finance than it does with the poor fellow who tries to break the casino bank without knowing the odds or the real rules of the game .
After all , we do n't expect much sophistication from the average graduate of PS69 with a vocational certificate in welding from the local community college , but we have been conditioned to believe that advanced degrees from Harvard and Wharton represent actual knowledge and perhaps even a nodding acquaintence with ethics .
And against all experience we also expect our legislators to have sipped from the fountain of knowledge and to harbor instincts to honesty .

The rejection of the so - called bailout bill yesterday was a routine application of politics as usual .
The failed bill will be cosmetized and passed .
The representatives who voted against the original have the political cover they need .
It 's enough of a populist credential to work well enough until the election .
And in the 35 days remaining before the plebiscite , they can justify the lipsticked pig version we 'll see in any of several ways .
The most common one will be a soulful mien as they explain , “ The bill was going to pass anyway , and I believed I could better guard your interests continuing to be part of the bipartisan process .
Return me to congress and I 'll… ” .
He adds that the version he approved was a far better idea than the original .
And the voters will probably buy it for reasons that can be well understood through an AP report .
“ Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson emerged after the vote and warned of a credit crunch that would affect American businesses and said families would find it harder to get student loans and car loans , ” AP said .
Pardon me , but loans are supposed to be hard to get .
The lender is risking his resources and wants to know two things :
Is the purpose of the loan reasonabe for this guy ?
And what are the odds that he will repay as he promises ?
Secretary Paulson seems to suggest that is archaic nonsense .
Loans have become just another entitlement .
I submit that in the most prosperous years of my life and yours only a fool would have staked us to a vehicle representing a year 's income and a house representing five year 's earning .
But because Washington , acting primarily if not wholly thorugh the Federal Reserve Board , has made money dirt - cheap or free in order to create a popular feeling of prosperity , we have announced to our people that they have a right to borrow and borrow cheaply .
That is precisely what Paulson , Bernanke , and their predecessors did with the active encouragement of the political parasites .
Only Ron Paul and a few others wore themselves out spitting into the popular wind of SUVs for one and all , six - year - car loans and easy terms on that villa of threes — three stalls in the garage , three bathrooms , three years of interest - only .
The tiny Paul coalition opposed creating a climate forcing banks to lend to irresponsible borrowers .
They rebelled at the political crusade for universal home “ ownership . ”
They balked at a thousand schemes for the government buying of things government could n't afford .
They lost .
And here we are .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - California will sue the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for “ wantonly ” ignoring its duty to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from ships , aircraft , and construction and agricultural equipment , state Attorney General Jerry Brown said on Wednesday .

Brown said the lawsuit , to be announced at a news conference at the Port of Long Beach on Thursday and filed in Washington after a 180 - day waiting period mandated by the Clean Air Act , was meant to force the EPA into action .
The lawsuit follows two similar ones this year by California in conjunction with other states on car and truck emissions and ozone pollution .
“ Ships , aircraft and industrial equipment burn huge quantities of fossil fuel , causing greenhouse gas pollution , yet President ( George W. )
Bush stalls with one bureaucratic dodge after another , ” said Brown , a strong advocate for the environment since his two terms as a liberal California governor in the 1970s and 1980s .
“ Because Bush ’s Environmental Protection Agency continues to wantonly ignore its duty to regulate pollution , California is forced to seek judicial action , ” he said .
Brown said he was filing the lawsuit because he had petitioned the EPA three times to implement such regulations and was met only with a “ pathetically weak ” proposal that did not conclude greenhouse gases endangered public health .
An EPA spokesman disagreed , saying the agency had been “ fully responsive ” to California ’s petitions and said Brown would be better served lobbying the Democratic - led U.S. Congress to take action .
“ TYPICAL OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ”
“ ( The lawsuit ) is certainly typical of the attorney general of California , ” EPA spokesman Jonathan Shradar said .
“ If they do n’t like how we make a decision on something , they sue and hope the courts will mandate toward their position .
It works sometimes and sometimes it does n’t work , ” he said .
In April , California , with the support of Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , was one of 18 states to sue the EPA for failing to limit greenhouse gas emissions from new cars and trucks despite a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court a year earlier that the agency had the power to do so .
In May , California joined 12 other states in suing the EPA , claiming it violated the Clean Air Act by not toughening ozone pollution standards enough .
The EPA has also come under fire from Democrats in Congress .
Earlier this week , three Democratic senators , including California ’s Barbara Boxer , called for the resignation of EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson , saying he had sided with polluters instead of fighting global warming and other ecological problems .
Brown said California would likely be joined in the latest lawsuit against the EPA by Connecticut , Oregon , New York City , the California Air Resources Board , the South Coast Air Quality Management District and an a coalition of environmental groups .

Python 2.5 ( r25 : 51908 , Sep 19 2006 , 09 : 52 : 17 ) [ MSC v. 1310 32 bit ( Intel ) ] on win32
Type " help " , " copyright " , " credits " or " license " for more information . >>>
0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3 5.5511151231257827e-017
0.1 を 3 回足しても 0.3 にはなりません。少しだけずれちゃってます。
この例のばあい、誤差の原因は、「浮動小数点数」が2進数で表現されていることです。" 0.1 " は2進数で書くと無限小数なので、途中で打ち切って記憶されてしまい、正確な
" 0.1 " とは少しずれた値になってしまうのです。
それでは困る場合のために、多くのプログラミング言語には、10進数で実数を記憶する「BigDecimal」のようなライブラリが用意されています。またまた
Python のばあい ：
>>> Decimal ( " 0.1 " ) + Decimal ( " 0.1 " ) + Decimal ( " 0.1 " ) - Decimal ( " 0.3 " ) Decimal ( " 0.0 " )
ピッタリ " 0.0 " になりました ！
では 、Decimal のようなライブラリを使えば、実数計算の誤差は完全に消えてなくなるのでしょうか？ 答えは否 。
>>> Decimal ( 8 ) / Decimal( 7 ) * Decimal ( 7 ) Decimal ( " 8.000000000000000000000000001 " )
" 8/7 " は10進数では無限小数になってしまうので、Decimalでも途中で打ち切られてしまいます。その結果、7倍しても元の8には戻らず、やっぱり微妙にずれます。Pythonのデフォルトでは途中の打ち切りは28ケタですが、これを調整してどれだけ長めにとっても、
>>> getcontext ( ) .prec = 80 >>> Decimal ( 8 ) / Decimal( 7 ) * Decimal ( 7 ) Decimal ( " 7.999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 9999999997 " ) >>> getcontext ( ) .prec = 300 >>> Decimal ( 8 ) / Decimal( 7 ) * Decimal ( 7 ) Decimal ( " 8.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002 " )
ずれるものはずれます。「7進数で表現するライブラリを導入すれば・・・！！」と思わず考えてしまいますが、何進数で表現しようとも、有理数で近似している限りは、たとえば sqrt や sin のような無理数を返す計算を入れたとたんに、ちょっとずれてしまうことは避けられません。（巧く実装しない限り）計算を繰り返すたびにこの誤差は少しずつ積もっていきます。
Negative Appeal

The device can " see through " camouflage
The idea , put forward by the University of the West of England ( UWE ) , will now be developed into a prototype .
It detects and enhances indistinct or concealed objects by amplifying their 3D shape .
The equipment can also automatically compare and recognise threatening objects or people .
UWE 's team of machine vision experts , led by Dr Melvyn Smith , submitted the plans under the MoD 's Competition of Ideas scheme .
They will receive about £ 120,000 for one year 's work .
" The system , based on our expertise in photometric stereo techniques , reveals and enhances subtle shapes and surface details that may not be apparent or are deliberately concealed , " said Dr Smith .
" For example , it could ' see through ' camouflage or the pattern of a scarf used to cover the face , or enhance bulges in clothing caused by concealed weapons . "
The MoD received 467 entries for its competition of ideas , more than half of which came from universities and small or medium enterprises .
In all , these projects represent an investment of about £ 11 m into new ideas to enhance the UK 's defence technology strategy .

This is Part One of a series of articles on Java. next .
In Part One , I will explore the common ground shared by the Java . next languages .
I have chosen four languages which together represent " Java.next " : Clojure , Groovy , JRuby , and Scala .
At first glance , these languages are wildly different .
Clojure is a Lisp .
Groovy is the " almost Java " choice .
JRuby has the beauty of Ruby , and the mindshare of Rails .
Scala , unlike the others , brings the notion that we need more static typing .
As you might imagine , there is heated debate about which of these languages is best for some purpose , or best in general .
Lost in the debate is the fact that these languages share a ton of common ground .
They all evolved against a shared background , the Java language .
Their design decisions are all influenced by what has worked well in Java , and what has failed .
In this article I will demonstrate two important points about the common ground these languages share :
Over the last decade of coding in object - oriented , VM - based languages , we have learned a lot about writing expressive , maintainable applications .
Java.next incorporates this knowledge , enabling essence over ceremony .
The " essence vs. ceremony " design choices add up to a very different way of programming .
The mental shift from Java to Java . next is a bigger shift than the previous shift from C/ C++ to Java .
I have distilled the shared advantages of Java . next to eight points , which are explored in more detail below .
everything is an object
low - ceremony property definitions
expressive collections
functional programming
overriding operators
maintainable exception handling
adding methods to existing objects
roll - your - own constructs
Everything is an object
In Java , we live every day with the distinction between objects and primitives .
This causes three practical problems :
APIs must be duplicated : one method for objects , and another for primitives .
Or worse , septlicated .
One method for objects , and one each for different primitive types .
The default ( efficient , easy - to - use ) numeric types have range limitations .
Exceed them and your program breaks in mysterious ways .
You can not use intuitive math operators ( +,-,etc. ) with accurate numeric types .
In Java.next , everything is an object .
You can invoke methods on all types using the same syntax .
; clojure (. 1 floatValue ) 1.0 // groovy 1 . floatValue ( ) ===> 1.0 # ruby 1 . to_f => 1.0 // scala 1 . floatValue res1 : Float = 1.0
Low - ceremony property definitions
In Java , to create a property , you must define a field , a getter , a setter , and ( often ) a constructor , all with appropriate protection modifiers .
In Java.next , you can define all of these in a single step .
; clojure ( defstruct person : first - name : last - name ) // groovy class Person { def firstName def lastName } # ruby Person = Struct . new ( : first_name , : last_name ) // scala case class Person ( firstName : String , lastName : String ) {}
If you need to override ( or omit ) a getter , setter , or constructor for a class , you can also do that , without having to spell out all boilerplate versions of the other pieces .
And that 's not all .
All of these languages embrace TMTOWTDI ( There 's More Than One Way To Do It ) , so there are multiple variants on the approaches shown above .
Expressive collections
Java.next provides a convenient literal syntax for the most important collections : arrays and maps .
In addition , you can string together multiple operations by passing function arguments , without having to write explicit iterators or loops .
For example , to find the all the squares under 100 that are also odd :
; clojure ( filter ( fn [ x ] ( = 1 ( rem x 2 ) ) ) ( map ( fn [ x ] (* x x ) ) ( range 10 ) ) ) ( 1 9 25 49 81 ) // groovy ( 1 .. 10 ) . collect { it * it }. findAll { it % 2 == 1 } === > [ 1 , 9 , 25 , 49 , 81 ] # ruby ( 1 .. 10 ) . collect { | x | x * x }. select { | x | x % 2 == 1 } => [ 1 , 9 , 25 , 49 , 81 ] // scala ( 1 to 10 ) . map ( x => x * x ) . filter ( x => x % 2 == 1 ) res20 : Seq .
Projection [ Int ] = RangeMF ( 1 , 9 , 25 , 49 , 81 )
There are similar conveniences for name / value collections , a.k.a. hashes or dictionaries .
Functional programming
The convenient collections described above are a special case of a more general idea : functional programming .
Java.next supports functions as first class objects , allowing function arguments , functions that create new functions , and closures over the current scope .
As a simple example , consider creating an adder function that adds some value chosen at runtime :
; clojure ( defn adder [ x ] ( fn [ y ] (+ x y ) ) ) // groovy adder = { add -> { val -> val + add } } # ruby def adder ( add ) lambda { | x | x + add } end // scala def sum ( a : Int ) ( b : Int ) = a + b
Overriding operators
In Java , you cannot override operators .
Math looks like this , for types like BigDecimal :
// Java math balance .
add ( balance .
multiply ( interest ) ) ;
Java.next allows you to override operators .
This allows you to do create new types that feel like built - in types , e.g. you could write a ComplexNumber or RationalNumber that supports + , - , * , and /.
; Clojure (+ balance (* balance interest ) ) //
Groovy balance + ( balance * interest ) # JRuby balance + ( balance * interest ) // Scala ( See [ 1 ] ) balance + ( balance * interest )
Maintainable exception handling
Checked exceptions are a failed experiment .
Java code is bloated with checked exception handling code that tends to obscure intent without improving error handling .
Worse yet , checked exceptions are a maintenance headache at abstraction boundaries .
( New kinds of unrecoverable failures down the dependency chain should not necessitate recompilation ! )
Java.next does not require you to declare checked exceptions , or to explicitly deal with checked exceptions from other code .
It is a testimony to the power of Java ( the platform ) that other languages are free to ignore the ugliness of checked exceptions in Java ( the language ) .
Adding methods to existing types
In Java , you cannot add methods to existing types .
This leads to absurd object - mismodeling , as developers create utility classes that defy the point of OO :
// Java ( from the Jakarta Commons ) public class StringUtils { public static boolean isBlank ( String str ) { int strLen ; if ( str == null || ( strLen = str . length ( ) ) == 0 ) { return true ; } for ( int i = 0 ; i < strLen ; i ++) { if (( Character .
is
Whitespace ( str .
charAt ( i ) ) == false ) ) { return false ; } } }
In Java.next , you can add methods to existing types :
; Clojure ( defmulti blank ?
class ) ( defmethod blank ?
String [ s ] ( every ?
# { \ space } s ) ) ( defmethod blank ?
nil [ _ ] true ) // Groovy String .
metaClass .
is Blank = { length ( ) == 0 || every { Character .
is
Whitespace ( it .
charAt ( 0 ) ) } } # Ruby ( from Rails ) class String def blank ?
empty ?
|| strip .
empty ?
end end // Scala class CharWrapper ( ch : Char ) { def is Whitespace = Character .
is
Whitespace ( ch ) } implicit def charWrapper ( ch : Character ) = new CharWrapper ( ch ) class BlankWrapper ( s : String ) { def is Blank = s . is Empty || s . forall ( ch => ch .
is Whitespace ) } implicit def stringWrapper ( s : String ) = new BlankWrapper ( s )
Roll - your - own constructs
In Java , you have the language and the libraries .
The two are clearly distinct : you can write new libraries , but you cannot add language features .
In Java.next , the line between language and libraries is blurry .
You can create new constructs that work like core language features .
For example , Clojure provides an and function .
; clojure ( and 1 2 ) => 2
But maybe your problem domain is n't so binary .
You need a most function , that returns true if most of its arguments evaluate to true .
Clojure does n't have this , but you can write one :
; clojure ( most 1 2 ) => true ( most 1 2 nil ) => true ( most 1 nil nil ) => false
The point here is not " Does my language need a ' most ' conditional ? "
Probably not .
The point is that different domains have different needs .
In Java.next , the boundary between the language and the libraries is a minimized .
You can adapt the language to your domain , instead of the other way around .
As another example , consider Ruby 's attribute syntax :
# Ruby class Account attr_accessor : name dsl_attribute : type end
attr_accessor is built into the language .
dsl_attribute is a library method that I wrote , which allows you to omit the " = " when assigning values , e.g .
# normal attributes account .
name = " foo " # equals - free attributes account .
type checking
Conclusions
The Java. next languages share a ton of common ground .
Although I 've used small isolated examples for explanation , the real power comes from using these features together .
Combining all the Java. next features leads to an entirely different style of coding .
You do not have to code defensively , using a slew of factories , patterns , and dependency injection to keep your code testable and adaptable .
Instead , you can build a minimal solution and evolve it .
Instead of coding in your Java . next language , you can develop internal Domain - Specific Languages ( DSLs ) that better match your problem domain .
In my experience , this style of coding tends to reduce the size of a codebase by an order of magnitude , while improving readability .
Many people are looking for the " next big language . "
The next big language is already here , but it is n't a single language .
It is the collection of ideas above ( plus probably some I missed ) as manifested in Java. next .
Does the transition to Java . next deserve the name " big " ?
Absolutely .
In my experience , the move from Java to Java . next is every bit as big as the previous tectonic shifts in the industry , both in learning curve and in productivity advantages once you make the transition .
As an industry , we need to reset the bar to include Java. next .
Once we have , we can have a conversation about the differences in these languages .
I will take up the unique aspects of the Java . next languages in future installments of this series .
Notes
This article is taken from the first half of the JVM Language Shootout talk that I wrote for NFJS .
Check the schedule for a talk near you .
Suggestions for improving the code samples above are most welcome .
Thanks to Justin Gehtland , Jason Rudolph , Rob Sanheim , Glenn Vanderburg , and Greg Vaughn for reading an earlier draft of this article .
The BigDecimal example does not work as I would expect on the Scala build I have ( 2.7.1.final ) .
But the important point is that I could make it work by adding an implicit conversion .
I am not dependent on the language designers , I can improve the language myself .

A research team from the Center for Environmental Health Sciences ( CEHS ) at MIT has confirmed that when DNA repair mechanisms are compromised , chronic inflammation expedites intestine cancer in mice .
The results suggest that people with a decreased ability to repair DNA damage might be more susceptible to developing cancer associated with chronic inflammation , such as ulcerative colitis .
This discovery may lead to the development of treatments for the prevention of various types of cancer and will hopefully raise the awareness to the importance of early detection and treatment of inflammation .
Inflamation Pathway ( Credit : Array Biopharma )
Inflammation caused by infectious agents , such as Helicobacter pylori and Hepatitis C , is known to increase the risk of stomach and liver cancers , respectively .
It is well known that inflammation produces cytokines ( immune response chemicals that encourage cell proliferation and suppress cell death ) , which could lead to cancer if proper cell monitoring mechanisms are not activated .
In addition , another process that is evoked during inflammation has been suspected as a possible cancer inducer .
During the inflammatory response to infection , immune cells , such as macrophages and neutrophils , release reactive elements , such as oxygen and nitrogen , often damaging the DNA .
When DNA repair mechanisms function properly , the damage caused by inflammation is repaired before it can develop into cancer .
However , the MIT team showed that once the mechanisms are not intact , the damage to the DNA can develop into mutations , possibly leading to cancer .
The effectiveness of these processes varies between different people and there are many reasons for the deficiency of DNA repair mechanisms , including genetic mutations , aging , or a diet lacking in vitamins E , C , and folic acid .
These interpersonal differences can influence the susceptibility and the nature of different individuals ’ response to chronic inflammation .
In the study , a research team led by Lisiane Meira and Leona Samson tested two groups of mice : the first group was comprised of healthy mice and served as the control group , while the other group was comprised of mice with genetically impaired DNA repair mechanisms .
The researchers induced colon inflammation in the mice by treating them with a chemical compound that creates a condition similar to human colitis .
The results were not surprising , and showed that the mice with DNA repair deficiency were more susceptible to cancer .
Inflammation and Cancer
( Credit : National Institute
of General Medical Sciences )
The team then conducted a second study , in collaboration with another CEHS member , James Fox , Director of the Division of Comparative Medicine at MIT , and one of his students , Chung - Wei Lee .
This study was conducted in order to show that different types of infections could replicate the results of the first study .
The outcome was as expected – when infected with H. pylori , mice lacking the proper DNA repair mechanisms were more susceptible to pre-cancerous lesions in the stomach .
This study is related to another article by Fox , which showed that treating H. pylori infection at the early stages with antibiotics can prevent cancer development .
The new study suggests that if H. pylori inflammation goes untreated , patients with deficient DNA repair mechanisms would stand at a greater risk of developing cancer .
This discovery will hopefully alert doctors and patients to the dangers of many types of inflammation .
It is obvious that there is much to be gained from further research of the link between inflammation and cancer .
TFOT recently covered a research project in which a trail receptor , related to the link between inflammation and cancer , was discovered by scientists at the University of Pennsylvania .
Another recent breakthrough in cancer research was the creation of cancer - resistant mice by researchers from the University of Kentucky .
The original MIT press release can be found here .
Anyone who has worked in a large organization  or , for that matter , reads the comic strip “ Dilbert ”  is familiar with the “ org chart ” strategy .
To hide their lack of any actual ideas about what to do , managers sometimes make a big show of rearranging the boxes and lines that say who reports to whom .
You now understand the principle behind the Bush administration ’s new proposal for financial reform , which will be formally announced today : it ’s all about creating the appearance of responding to the current crisis , without actually doing anything substantive .
The financial events of the last seven months , and especially the past few weeks , have convinced all but a few diehards that the U.S. financial system needs major reform .
Otherwise , we ’ll lurch from crisis to crisis  and the crises will get bigger and bigger .
The rescue of Bear Stearns , in particular , was a paradigm - changing event .
Traditional , deposit - taking banks have been regulated since the 1930s , because the experience of the Great Depression showed how bank failures can threaten the whole economy .
Supposedly , however , “ non-depository ” institutions like Bear did n’t have to be regulated , because “ market discipline ” would ensure that they were run responsibly .
1966 : Star Trek makes its network television debut .
Given the cultural impact and enormous franchise spawned by the original Star Trek series , it 's hard to believe that the show lasted just three seasons – 80 episodes – and was canceled by NBC in 1969 because of low ratings .
But if network numbers - crunching and the short - sightedness of advertising sponsors doomed it , Star Trek 's long - term survival , evidenced by its ongoing syndication , not to mention the numerous TV spinoffs and feature - length films it inspired , is both a vindication of and a tribute to its creator and executive producer , Gene Roddenberry .
And Roddenberry was a guy badly in need of vindication .
His career began promisingly : Roddenberry wrote scripts for some popular 1950s TV shows like Naked City , Highway Patrol and Have Gun , Will Travel .
But the original Star Trek TV series , as well as the first feature - length film , Star Trek : The Motion Picture , were conspicuous successes in an otherwise unremarkable and often problematic association with Hollywood .
The commercial success of the first Star Trek movie would spawn other films and a new TV series , Star Trek : The Next Generation , although Roddenberry 's involvement with those projects was diminished .
But if his relationship with the industry had its rough patches , his reputation as a futurist and visionary – which begins and ends with Star Trek – is assured .
The original show 's most visionary aspects were social , not scientific , and that had everything to do with the times .
The country was in turmoil , embroiled in Vietnam and the growing civil rights movement .
Roddenberry said later that these events influenced many of the themes , as well as the multicultural makeup of the crew .
Roddenberry remained in demand on the lecture circuit to the end of his life , speaking not only at universities but at some other pretty significant places , too , including the Smithsonian Institution and NASA .
Star Trek 's impact on popular culture is matched by only a handful of other television shows , and surpassed by precious few .
The original cast members on the USS Enterprise 's 1966 flight deck became household names : Capt . James T. Kirk ( William Shatner ) , First Officer Mr. Spock ( Leonard Nimoy ) , Dr. Leonard " Bones " McCoy ( DeForest Kelley ) , Chief Engineer Montgomery " Scotty " Scott ( James Doohan ) , Communications Officer Nyota Uhura ( Nichelle Nichols ) and Helmsman Hikaru Sulu ( George Takei ) .
Navigator Pavel Chekov ( Walter Koenig ) , who joined the cast in the second season to give the Russians their due in space , was also a popular character .
Phrases like " Beam me up , Scotty " and " Live long and prosper " and " to boldly go … " entered the lexicon , and the show 's cult following , kept visibly alive by the numerous and rollicking Star Trek conventions , remains strong to this day .
An 11 - foot model of the starship Enterprise is on display at the Smithsonian .
On the tech front , the communicator used by Enterprise crew members is said to have been the inspiration for the flip - open cellphone .
The original pilot episode for the series , " The Cage , " was filmed in 1964 but not aired in its entirety until 1988 .
After the original pilot was rejected by NBC , " The Cage " was chopped up and heavily edited , and eventually shown under the title " The Menagerie " during Star Trek 's three - year run .
Nimoy's Mr. Spock was the only character from the pilot to later appear in the TV series , although he was most un - Spock like , showing a lot more emotion than your average Vulcan .
In the pilot , the Enterprise was commanded by Capt. Christopher Pike ( Jeffrey Hunter ) .
Because of all the spinoffs that resulted from it , Roddenberry 's Star Trek is often referred to as The Original Series .
For a lot of us who came of age watching Shatner chewing on all that alien scenery and nibbling on all those alien necks , it was The Only Series .

Pennsylvania ’s former deputy attorney general and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton supporter Philip J. Berg has filed a lawsuit in federal court in Pennsylvania accusing presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
Barack Obama of lying about his U.S. citizenship , which would make him ineligible to be president .
Mr. Berg is one of a faction of Clinton supporters who have n’t heeded the party ’s call for unity , filing the suit just days before the opening of the Democratic National Convention , which will nominate Mr. Obama as the party ’s presidential candidate .
The suit , filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia last week , also names the Democratic National Committee and the Federal Election Commission and says Mr. Obama´s mother went to Kenya late in her pregnancy and ended up giving birth there .
It also claims that later in life , Mr. Obama declared himself a citizen of Indonesia .
The Obama campaign has firmly said the Illinois Democrat is a natural - born citizen .
Last month , the campaign posted on Mr. Obama ’s Web site a copy of his “ certification of live birth . ”
It says he was born in Honolulu on Aug. 4 , 1961 , two years after Hawaii was named the 50th state .
Mr. Berg said he was contacted about filing the lawsuit by a member or associate of the group PUMA , which was formed to support Mrs. Clinton shortly after she withdrew from the race .
Its mission includes denouncing the Democratic Party and Mr. Obama ’s nomination .
“ I really do not believe he is a natural - born citizen , ” said Mr. Berg , adding that he is not connected with Mrs. Clinton or her campaign .
Just over one - quarter of Clinton supporters say they ’re now backing Mr. McCain , up from 16 percent in late June , according to a CNN poll conducted after Mr. Obama announced Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. , of Delaware , as his running mate .
Two - thirds of Clinton supporters are now backing Mr. Obama .
Mrs. Clinton , for her part , encouraged her supporters this week to back Mr. Obama .
“ Whether you voted for me , or voted for Barack , the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose .
We are on the same team , and none of us can sit on the sidelines , ” she said during her address to the convention Tuesday .
Mr. Berg , who says he donated about $ 200 to Mrs. Clinton ’s campaign , may represent the fringe of the pro-Hillary faction that has n’t warmed to Mr. Obama .
He has filed suits for clients against President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney , claiming they knew about the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks before they happened .
He also publicly asked Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas , Antonin Scalia and Sandra Day O’Connor to disbar themselves for their decision in the controversial 2001 case Bush v. Gore .
Mr. Berg has posted documents on his Web site , ObamaCrimes.com , he says back up his claims .
But he said he does n’t know where they originated .
Backers of the idea that Mr. Obama is n’t a natural - born citizen say Mr. Obama ’s certification of live birth does n’t quell the issue .
They say a certification can be obtained after birth .
But the Hawaii State Department of Health said Monday that there is no difference between a certificate and a certification of live birth in the eyes of the state .
For instance , either can be used to confirm U.S. citizenship to obtain a passport or state ID , said Alvin Onaka , a research and statistics officer at the Department of Health .
In Hawaii , only the person named on the certificate or his family can request the certificate of live birth .
Several fact - checking groups , such as FactCheck.org and PolitiFact.com have determined that the certification posted on Mr. Obama ’s Web site is authentic .
Mr. Obama ’s opponent , Sen. John McCain of Arizona , has faced questions about his qualification as a “ natural - born citizen ” as well .
Mr. McCain was born on a military installation in the Panama Canal Zone , where his father , a Navy officer , was stationed .
Theodore Olson , a former solicitor general who is advising the McCain campaign , said in February that he ’s confident Mr. McCain meets the constitutional requirement .
Legal scholars say there is no precedent on the subject because all previous presidents have been born within the 50 states or territories that became states .

A woman caused uproar in court when she pulled two fingers from her handbag claiming they had belonged to one of her six children .
Remi Fakorede , who was convicted of a £ 925,000 tax credit fraud , told London 's Snaresbrook Crown court they had fallen off following a curse .
She said the same voodoo curse had caused her to participate in the fraud .
The 46 - year - old from Hackney was convicted of fraud committed between 1 August 2002 and 26 June 2007 .
When the child 's fingers were produced , one juror burst into tears while the judge immediately adjourned the case for the rest of the day .
Reporting of the incident , which happened during the trial , was only lifted once the guilty verdict was returned .
Police were called to the court and took a statement from the Nigerian - born defendant .
Social Services and the Child Protection Agency were also contacted .
I have never experienced anything as horrific as this
Judge Jacqueline Beech
Although it is understood one of her children had lost part of her hand after suffering renal problems and developing gangrene , DNA test results are now awaited to determine who the body parts belonged to .
Fakorede was convicted of one count of fraud totalling £ 925,933 , while one of her daughters , 21 - year - old Denise Shofolawe - Coker , was found guilty of laundering £ 70,000 of the stolen money .
Remanding them in custody and adjourning the case until 8 September for pre-sentence reports , Judge Jacqueline Beech warned the pair they faced " inevitable " imprisonment for their " breathtaking " dishonesty .
Lifting the reporting ban on the earlier " fingers " incident , the judge said it must have been " unpleasant " for the jury , and added : " I have never experienced anything as horrific as this . "
The court heard Fakorede , who holds joint Nigerian and British citizenship , invented 20 aliases to make 39 false tax credit claims over a five - year period .
She was found out when she then tried to claim childcare as well .
Fakorede blamed the fraud on unknown " forces of darkness " , who she said had placed a " voodoo " curse on her family .
She then produced the fingers as evidence , saying the magic was so strong it caused one of her children to lose them .

F# is an awesome language .
I 'd choose to write F# code any day over any language if my work allows it .
The way you are able to concisely and cleanly write code with it is what brought me over .
Sure there is an initial overhead ( if you we are an OO programmer ) in learning all the functional constructs but in the end its all worth it .
Even though you might not be able to use it at work ( read : management only wants C# / VB.NET ) , the way you are writing OO code will definitely be improved .
I for example have come to appreciate Generics and delegates more because of F# .
Microsoft Research has done such a great job with it and I 'm quite sure they will continue to do so .
There is no question that " F# as a language " is great .
People do however have a gripe about " F# as a Microsoft product " .
It is not open source nor is it standard like C# .
There is a technology - lockin which I presume some fear will later on will translate into a vendor - lockin .
F# targets mainly the research and financial institutions .
I can not say much about financial companies but research instituions and technology companies are big Linux users .
There is very high likelihood that these people are also open - source advocates .
It will be in their best interest to ensure that the language works perfectly on both Windows and non-windows systems .
This is both a win for the users and for Microsoft .
It would also propel the language forward at a much quicker pace .
It might be too early to ask this given that the F# CTP was only recently released , but should Microsoft open source F# and get the community involved ?

The story : On October 15th 1997 , the Cassini - Huygens mission blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station to explore Saturn and its moons .
It continues to study the ringed gas giant today and its mission has been extended till 2010 .
Cassini is is powered by 32.8 kg ( 72 lbs ) of plutonium fuel .
A radioactive power source is the only option for missions travelling beyond the orbit of Mars as sunlight is too weak for solar panels to be effective .
However , NASA ( in association with secret organizations , such as the Illuminati or the Freemasons ) wants to use this plutonium for a “ higher purpose ” , dropping Cassini deep into Saturn at the end of its mission where atmospheric pressures will be so large that it will compress the probe , detonating like a nuclear bomb .
What ’s more , this will trigger a chain reaction , kick - starting nuclear fusion , turning Saturn into a fireball .
This is what has become known as The Lucifer Project .
This second sun will have dire consequences for us on Earth , killing millions from the huge influx of radiation by this newborn star .
Earth ’s loss becomes the Saturn moon Titan ’s gain , suddenly it is habitable and the organizations playing “ God ” can start a new civilization in the Saturn system .
What ’s more , exactly the same thing was attempted when the Galileo probe was dropped into Jupiter ’s atmosphere in 2003 …
The reality : Now that the Cassini mission has been extended by two years , we can expect this conspiracy theory to become more and more vocal in the coming months .
But like the Galileo / Jupiter / second sun theory , this one is just as inaccurate , once again using bad science to scare people ( much like Planet X then ) …
So what happened when Galileo dropped into Jupiter ?
Well … nothing really .
In 2003 , NASA took the prudent decision to terminate the hugely successful Galileo mission by using its last drops of propellent to push it at high speed into the gas giant .
By doing so , this ensured the probe would burn up during re-entry , dispersing and burning any contaminants ( such as terrestrial bacteria and the radioactive plutonium - 238 fuel on board ) .
The primary concern about letting Galileo sit in a graveyard orbit was that if mission control lost contact ( very likely as the radiation belts surrounding Jupiter were degrading the probe ’s ageing electronics ) , there may have been the possibility that Galileo would crash into one of the Jovian moons , contaminating them and killing any possible extra-terrestrial microbial life .
This was a serious concern , especially in the case of Europa which could be a prime location for life to thrive below its ice - encrusted surface .
Now this is where the intrigue begins .
Long before Galileo plummeted into Jupiter ’s atmosphere , conspiracy theorists cited that NASA wanted to create an explosion within the body of the gas giant , thus igniting a chain reaction , creating a second sun ( Jupiter is often called a ‘ failed star ’ , although it has always been way too small to support nuclear reactions in its core ) .
This was proven wrong on many counts , but there were three main reasons why this could not happen :
The design of the radioisotope thermoelectric generators ( RTGs ) supplying energy to the craft would n’t allow it .
The physics behind a nuclear explosion ( nuclear fission ) would n’t allow it .
The physics of how a star works ( nuclear fusion ) would n’t allow it .
Five years after the Galileo impact , Jupiter still looks to be in fine health ( and it certainly is n’t close to being a star ) .
Although history has already proven you can’t create a star from a gas giant using a space probe ( i.e. Jupiter + Probe ≠ Star ) , conspiracy theorists think that NASA ’s evil plan failed and there is some evidence that something did happen after Galileo got swallowed by Jupiter ( and that NASA is pinning their hopes on the Cassini / Saturn combo ) .
Cue the Big Black Spot
Backing up the conspiracy theorists ’ claims that there was an explosion inside the Jovian atmosphere after Galileo hit was the discovery of a dark blob near the equator of Jupiter a month after the event .
This was widely reported across the web , but only a couple of observations were made before it disappeared .
Some explanations pointed out that the blob could have been a short - lived dynamic atmospheric feature or it was a shadow from one of the Jovian moons .
After this initial excitement , nothing else surfaced about the phenomenon .
However , some were keen to point out that the dark patch on Jupiter ’s surface may have been a manifestation of a nuclear detonation from Galileo deep within the planet which , after a month , eventually floated to the surface .
Comparisons had even made with the 1994 features generated by the impact of the pieces of Comet Shoemaker - Levy 9 ( pictured above ) .
What ever the cause of this dark feature , it did n’t come from Galileo as a nuclear detonation simply was not possible .
What ’s more , a nuclear detonation from the Cassini mission when it enters Saturn ’s atmosphere in 2010 is also impossible , and here ’s why …
The Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators ( RTGs )
RTGs are a tried and tested technology in use since the 1960’s .
Various RTG designs have been used on a huge number of missions including Pioneer 10 , Pioneer 11 , Voyager 1 , Voyager 2 , Galileo , Ulysses , Cassini and , most recently , New Horizons .
RTGs are a very dependable source of power for space missions where solar panels have not been an option .
For Cassini , if solar panels were used , they would need to have a huge area to collect the meagre sunlight at 10 AU , thus impractical to launch and operate .
The three RTGs on board Cassini are fuelled by small pellets of plutonium - 238 ( 238 Pu ) encased separately in shock - proof containers known as general purpose heat source modules .
There are 18 modules in each RTG .
Through the use of thermocouples , the steady heat generated by the radioactive decay of the plutonium isotope is converted into electricity to supply Cassini .
It is worth noting at this point that 238 Pu is not weapon grade ( i.e. it is very difficult to generate nuclear fission , 239 Pu is more suited for this purpose ) .
There are also dozens of Radioisotope Heater Units ( RHUs ) on board Cassini that provide a steady heat to critical subsystems , which contain single pellets of Pu-238 .
Again , these units are separated and shielded , each weighing 40 grams .
For more details on this , check out the NASA Factsheet : Spacecraft Power for Cassini .
Shielding is critical for each plutonium pellet , primarily to prevent radioactive contamination during launch of space missions .
Should there be an incident during launch , space agencies such as NASA must assure the containment of the radioactive material .
Therefore all RTGs and RHUs are completely safe regardless of the stresses they are put under .
So , like Galileo , Cassini will hit Saturn ’s atmosphere at a high velocity ( Galileo hit the Jovian atmosphere at a speed of 50 km / s ) and disintegrate very quickly before burning to a cinder .
The point I want to highlight here is that Cassini will break apart like any fast - moving object during re-entry .
Still , conspiracy theorists are quick to point out that Cassini is carrying a huge amount of plutonium , totalling 32.8 kg ( even though it is not the weapon - grade 239Pu and all the bits of 238 Pu are tiny pellets , encased in damage - proof containers , being scattered through Saturn ’s atmosphere ) .
But ignoring all the logical arguments against , it will still generate a nuclear explosion , right ?
Alas , no .
So how does a nuclear bomb work anyway ?
For a general run-down of the basics behind a nuclear weapon , check out the very clear description at How Stuff Works : How Nuclear Bombs Work ( scroll down to “ Implosion - Triggered Fission Bomb , ” as this is what the conspiracy theorists believe Cassini will emulate ) .
So there ’s Cassini , plummeting through Saturn ’s atmosphere in two years time .
As it gets deeper , bits fall off and burnt by the friction caused by re-entry .
When I say fall off , I mean they are no longer attached .
For a nuclear detonation to occur we need a solid mass of weapon grade plutonium .
By solid mass , I mean we need a minimum amount of the stuff for nuclear fission to occur ( a.k.a. “ critical mass ” ) .
The critical mass of 238 Pu is approximately 10 kg ( US DoE publication ) , so Cassini has enough 238 Pu for three crude nuclear bombs ( ignoring the fact that it is very difficult to build a 238 Pu weapon in the first place ) .
But how could all those tiny pellets of 238 Pu be pulled together , in free - fall , casings removed , letting the pressure of Saturn ’s atmosphere force it all together tipping it toward critical mass ?
Is that really possible ?
No .
Even if by some chance all the 238 Pu in one RTG melded together , how would it detonate ?
For detonation of an implosion - triggered fission bomb to occur , sub-critical masses need to be forced together at the same instant .
The only way this is possible is to surround the sub-critical masses with high - explosives so a shock wave rapidly collapses the sub-critical masses together .
Only then may a chain reaction be sustained .
Unless NASA has been really sneaky and hidden some explosives inside their RTGs , detonation is not possible .
Using atmospheric pressure alone is not a viable explanation .
Now we can see that it is pretty much impossible for the plutonium on board Cassini to create a nuclear explosion .
But if there was a nuclear detonation , could a chain reaction occur ?
Could Saturn become a star ?

( Fortune Magazine ) --
Long before the small group of men gained control of a $ 1.3 trillion economy , they could be found gathered at a lakeshore deep in the forest , trying to relax amid the upheaval of the new Russia .
Lake Komsomolskoye , named after the youth wing of the Communist Party , lies about 60 miles north of St. Petersburg , just one of 700 lakes on the isthmus connecting Russia and Finland .
There the group , many of whom helped run Russia 's second - largest city , would retreat for weekends among the tall , lakeside cedars in a private compound of dachas , or country houses .
Vladimir Putin , then head of external relations for the St. Petersburg mayor , was a member of the group .
So was Vladimir Yakunin , who had revived a bank started by the Communist Party , and Igor Sechin , then Putin 's chief of staff .
The group called itself ozero , meaning " the lake , " and one of its frequent guests was a bright young lawyer named Dmitry Medvedev who worked in the St. Petersburg government .
One prime topic of their lakeside conversation back then : how much they disliked the unfolding chaos of Boris Yeltsin 's Russia .
More than 15 years later , many of these same men ( and some of their closest friends ) now run the country .
Since Putin became President in 2000 , thanks to President Yeltsin 's unexpected resignation , other members of the lake group have risen to the highest levels in Russian business and politics .
Sechin , 47 , now chairs Rosneft , the state - owned oil company ; Yakunin , 60 , heads Russian Railways .
And Medvedev , 42 , was chairman of Gazprom , Russia 's largest company , until succeeding Putin as Russian President in March .
While Putin , 55 , stepped into the No. 2 role of Prime Minister , no one doubts that he has extended his regime .
Although Russia 's military incursion into its former republic of Georgia was the most dramatic expression of Russia 's new nationalism , a similar campaign has been gaining momentum in the realm of business .
Putin and his pals have moved swiftly to reassert the government 's control over key sectors of the Russian economy , pushing aside - and sometimes punishing - outside investors and many of the so - called oligarchs , the flashy entrepreneurs who grew fabulously wealthy when Yeltsin liberalized the Russian economy .
In all , the state has taken back an estimated $ 100 billion in assets held by private hands in the 1990s , according to analysts .
For Putin & Co. , business is the new frontier .
" These days , " says Boris Nemtsov , leader of the largest opposition party in Russia and a former deputy prime minister under Yeltsin , " these guys are all about money as much as anything else . "
The nationalistic zeal of these executives and leaders may be explained by something else the lake group members share :
Almost to a man , they served in the Soviet - era KGB , which comprised both the foreign intelligence service ( of which Putin is an alumnus ) and also the dreaded internal security apparatus , which had intimidated and terrorized several generations of Soviet citizens .
While Putin proudly acknowledges his time in the KGB , others do not , yet their r�sum�s are filled with postings that former KGB officials cite as common covers for the intelligence agency .
Rosneft 's Sechin , for example , worked as a translator in Angola and Mozambique in the early 1980s .
Yakunin spent six years as a diplomat at the Soviet mission to the United Nations .
Medvedev is a notable exception , having no apparent KGB background .
Among the top Russian bureaucrats and business leaders , more than one - quarter have their roots in the so - called power ministries of the government , of which the old KGB is first among equals , according to Olga Kryshtanovskaya , a sociologist who tracks Russian elites .
These men are known collectively as the siloviki , from a Russian word for " force . "
" You could say they control the crown jewels of the Russian economy , " says journalist Yevgenia Albats , who has written a book on the KGB ( the security service that succeeded has the acronym FSB ) .
For the vast majority of Russians , the pedigree of the men now running Russia Inc. is not something they dwell on .
Medvedev , Putin 's handpicked successor , enjoys immense popularity among citizens , and most foreign CEOs support him too .
These days , for Russians and foreigners alike , the bottom line trumps all - and Russia under Putin and his successor has been pumping profits .
" There 's no question , economically speaking , the last eight years - the Putin era - have been very successful compared to the previous eight , " says Roland Nash , head of research at Renaissance Capital .
Economic growth since 2001 has averaged 7 % a year .
The Russian stock market has added no less than $ 1 trillion in wealth , fueled by a surge of foreign investment getting in on Russia 's boom .
Yet for all the talk of prosperity and stability under Putin & Co. , foreign companies operating in today 's Russia - especially those in Russia 's valuable energy and natural - gas sectors - have suddenly started getting nervous .
Stories of Russian power plays have grown too numerous to dismiss : of business leaders thrown in jail on bogus charges , assets taken by dubious lawsuits , partnerships with Russian companies suddenly turning into struggles over control .
Aggravated by the invasion of Georgia , those concerns have sent the Russian stock market plunging more than 30 % since May .
Unless Russia can moderate its growing reputation as a strong - armed economic regime , its appeal as an emerging market may be coming to a close .
Says Renaissance 's Nash : " There 's no question the outside investment community is watching this now very , very closely . "
Lately the PR has been disastrous .
Consider the case of BP ( BP ) , which thought its partnership with a group of Russian billionaires , TNK - BP , was a textbook joint venture .
Instead , the British oil company finds itself under attack : Its Russia - based employees have been hit with dubious charges of industrial espionage , the CFO of the venture recently stepped down , and the CEO has publicly complained of " sustained harassment of the company and myself " by Russian authorities .
Industry analysts believe they 've seen this scenario before - last year Royal Dutch Shell ( RDS - B ) was forced to cede control over its Sakhalin oilfield to Russian companies ( see " Shell Shakedown " ) - and predict BP will eventually pull out in frustration , followed by a state - controlled energy giant taking over the business .
The BP case raises vexing questions for an economy now bathing in the luxury of $ 115 - per - barrel oil .
Bill Browder , who had been one of Russia 's biggest foreign portfolio managers until his visa suddenly was revoked without explanation in 2005 , wonders whether the current crop of CEOs and government leaders have " any serious commitment to property rights . "
The fact that so many people sitting atop corporate Russia were schooled not at Harvard or Stanford but at a notorious espionage and security agency does not reassure Browder , whose Hermitage Capital Management has been raided repeatedly by Russian authorities in the past year for a variety of alleged improprieties ( none of which have been proven ) .
" This happens every day , all day long , " Browder told Fortune .
" If you own a piece of property [ that the government wants ] , you can be the target of this type of raid . "
Foreigners are n't the only targets of the government 's escalating land grab .
An early warning came with the 2003 prosecution of billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky , CEO of Russia 's oil company Yukos , who is now serving an eight - year prison term in Siberia on a questionable tax - evasion and fraud conviction - an effort led by Igor Sechin , who was then Putin 's deputy chief of staff .
Sechin , who declined to be interviewed , then folded Yukos into state - owned Rosneft and a year later became chairman of the state - owned oil company ( all the while maintaining his position as Putin 's right - hand man ) .
The addition of Yukos helped transform Rosneft from a lackluster state business to a strong performer , with $ 36.2 billion in revenues last year .
Khodorkovsky now awaits another trial on fresh charges of embezzlement and money - laundering .
" As soon as one sentence is over , they 'll add another , " he told the Times of London in May , alleging that Sechin plundered his company " out of greed . "
A Russian government spokesman says Khodorkovsky was lawfully convicted .
In late July , Putin again removed the velvet glove and cocked his fist at an oligarch who had displeased him - in the process spooking investors in a major Russian company listed on the New York Stock Exchange .
Putin overtly threatened Igor Zyuzin , the CEO of Mechel ( MTL ) , a mining and metals giant , accusing him of price fixing in order to evade corporate taxes .
When the billionaire Zyuzin failed to show up at a meeting with Russian authorities , saying he was ill , Putin told a group of steel executives in Nizhny Novgorod : " Illness is illness , but I think he should get well as soon as possible .
Otherwise , we will have to send him a doctor and clean up all the problems . "
Investors in Mechel 's stock were the ones who were sick after that remark , given the implications .
Mechel plunged 30 % in a single day of trading in New York .
Putin declined to be interviewed for this story .
Just six weeks after reluctantly surrendering to Barack Obama in the brutal 2008 Democratic primary race , Sen . Hillary Clinton has begun raising money for what she says is her 2012 New York Senate reelection campaign .
Clinton still faces about $ 20 million in debts from her unsuccessful presidential effort this year .
As part of a so - called " unity drive , " Obama has appealed to his supporters in recent weeks to give to Clinton to cover the costs that she incurred while raking him over the coals in a bare - knuckled bid to return to the White House .
Some Obama backers have balked .
Clinton has also asked her donors to contribute to the massive general election fundraising effort of Obama , who changed his mind and has rejected federal funding .
Some Clinton backers have balked .
Now , the New York Observer is reporting early this morning that the former first lady has sent out a special message to supporters who donated up to $ 2,300 to her anticipated 2008 general election campaign .
Since there wo n't be one , she must return that money to the donors by Aug. 28 , unless she gets their permission not to .
Her new appeal includes a photocopy of a handwritten note from Clinton that says : " Dear friend , your commitment has meant so much to me over the course of my presidential campaign .
You were there for me when I needed you the most and I 'll never forget it .
I hope you 'll help me continue to fight for the issues and causes we believe in by filling out the enclosed form in support of Friends of Hillary . "
The form , once signed , allows Clinton staff to transfer the money from the 2008 general election fund into the 2012 senate reelection treasury , where it can earn four years ' of interest .
The report comes from Jason Horowitz of the Observer 's Politiker blog .
If successful , this early fundraising , while unusual , can have the effect of scaring off any serious Republican challengers in New York .
And help keep Clinton supporters in her camp and full of hope after the close call this primary season .
And , if memory serves , when Clinton had about $ 10 million left over from her successful 2006 Senate reelection campaign , she shifted those funds as starter cash over to her nascent presidential effort last year .
Hmmm .
Not that any ambitious politician would think this far ahead .
But if Obama was to , say , lose a close election in November to Clinton 's close friend , John McCain , the new president would be 72 on Inauguration Day next Jan. 20 .
That would make him really pretty old for anything other than maybe perhaps one term , which would leave things wide open in 2012 for , say , a former Arkansas first lady who happens to be only 60 right now .
And might have an ample senate campaign fund suitable for transferring into a presidential fund .
But that 's absolutely ridiculous to think about now .
As is , of course , having three major Democratic fundraising campaigns underway at the same time .

Investigation : Flamboyant City tycoon Jon Moynihan who runs PA Consulting , who are the subject of an investigation because of the lost prisoner secrets
The missing computer memory stick containing personal data on every prisoner in England and Wales may have been accidentally thrown into a waste bin .
Senior Whitehall officials admitted last night that the two - inch long flash drive is unlikely ever to be found .
They fear that the stick , containing the names and addresses of all 84,000 convicts in English and Welsh jails , was removed with the rubbish from the London offices of PA Consulting .
The Mail on Sunday has established that the data was lost by a middle - ranking woman consultant at the firm ’s Victoria offices who had attended regular meetings at the Home Office with senior Government officials over the past month .
The woman has been suspended while the Home Office , Scotland Yard and her bosses hunt for the stick , which was downloaded from an encrypted Home Office file .
Last night Home Secretary Jacqui Smith was under increasing pressure to personally explain why the public was not told about the fiasco until Thursday – four days after the data was reported lost .
Ms Smith yesterday remained at her constituency home at Redditch , Worcestershire , leaving it to junior Minister Tony McNulty to try to explain why the blunder had occurred despite Government promises of a crackdown after a string of similar data losses .
Shadow Home Office Minister David Ruffley said : ‘ Ms Smith does n’t understand that the buck stops with her as Home Secretary .
Wealth : The Chelsea townhouse that John Moynihan lives in with his wife Patricia which cost them £ 8 million in 2000
It simply is n’t good enough to send her junior Ministers out to face the music . ’
Asked why the Home Office had not sacked PA Consulting , Mr McNulty said even though there had been a ‘ clear security breach ’ , an investigation launched into the loss had to be allowed to ‘ take its course ’ .
PA Consulting is at the heart of the Government ’s controversial £ 20 billion ID - card project and has been paid £ 240 million for its work in Whitehall over the past four years .
The £ 500,000 contract for tracking prisoner details , during which the data was lost , has been suspended by the Home Office , which is allowing no more data exchanges with the firm until an investigation into the lost memory stick is complete .
PA Consulting has earned £ 100 million in the past three years from the Home Office ID card scheme , £ 33 million working on new biometric visas for the Foreign Office and at least £ 31 million from the Department for Work and Pension .
It has also received £ 20 million from the Department for Communities and Local Government , £ 16 million from the Environment Department , £ 17 million from the Ministry of Defence , £ 9 million from the Education Department and £ 3.5 million from the Cabinet Office .
Two years ago , PA Consulting donated £ 11,750 to the Labour Party .
It is run by flamboyant City tycoon Jon Moynihan , 60 , who lives with his hat designer wife Patricia Underwood in a Chelsea townhouse that was bought for £ 8 million in 2000 and is now reputedly one of the most expensive properties in London .
They also have a home in New York .
PA Consulting first told the Home Office it had lost the data on Monday afternoon .
But a senior Home Office source claimed there was a suspicion that the company had been made aware of the loss the previous week .
When told of the loss , one Home Office official said : ‘ You ’ve done what ? ’ amid scenes described by a source as ‘ chaotic ’ .
The Home Office told the firm to ‘ turn its building upside down ’ and find the data stick .
By Wednesday , PA Consulting , under pressure from the Home Office , was forced to call in Scotland Yard ’s Specialist and Economic Crime Command to investigate .
After meetings with company officials , the officers decided it was unlikely a crime had been committed or that the data had been deliberately removed from the building and they decided it did not warrant launching a formal investigation .
Late the same day , a Home Office whistleblower told the Tory Party about the blunder .
Recent Government data losses include 658 laptops stolen from the Ministry of Defence in the past four years , a personal computer containing sensitive documents relating to defence and extremism stolen from Local Government Secretary Hazel Blears ’ constituency office and two discs containing 25 million child benefit records belonging to HM Revenue & Customs going missing .
Last night , the Tories demanded that the Government create a new criminal offence of ‘ knowingly or recklessly causing the loss of data ’ .
Shadow Justice Secretary Nick Herbert said : ‘ Every time the Government have lost data , Ministers have promised a crackdown – but nothing has happened . ’
While touring , the former vice president stipulated that every television in his hotel suite be preset to the Fox News Channel .
Unless , of course , “ Gossip Girl ” happened to be on .
NeverBlock is a library that , using Ruby 1.9 fibers , allows to write non-blocking code .
The first database to profit from NeverBlock was Postgres ( read the InfoQ article about Fibers and NeverBlock ) .
And now , just a few days later , NeverBlock added support for MySQL as well , using the new MySQLPlus driver .
MySQLPlus builds on top of the original Ruby MySQL driver but adds asynchronous query processing support and threaded access support .
There 's also another project aiming to bring asynchronous operations to Ruby 's MySQL connection called Asymy .
InfoQ talked to Roger Pack who worked on MySQLPlus ; we were particularly interested in the differences between MySQLPlus and Asymy , and why they created a new adapter .
First some history : the former state of the art was the C MySQL lib , which blocked for any queries .
Both try to overcome that .
MySQLPlus is basically a fork of the standard MySQL Ruby C lib which adds some multi- thread friendly aspects , specifically the ability to not block on IO until a query returns .
Asymy is a pure Ruby asynchronous MySQL adapter .
It 's written in Ruby , so parses things much more slowly ( about 10 x slower ) , and is also fairly new so still has a few bugs lurking .
I 'd say a difference between them is that Asymy is " only " for Event driven while MySQLPlus works with threads and event driven .
Its event driven aspect is a little limited since you can't actually detect when to wait on IO while a query is being read in , so it 's not perfect yet , but it 's a step in the right direction .
In reality what occurred is that we started with Asymy , then Muhammed [ Ali , one of the persons behind NeverBlock ] found out that the standard C MySql libs , with slight modification , yield themselves almost equally as well to multi- threading , so we switched to those .
The MySQLPlus library is a small change to Tomita Masahiro 's library .
So I guess there is some duplication between them , it 's mostly a question of C versus Ruby , and we did n't write the C , so no duplication there .
So NeverBlock now works with MySQLPlus , will it also work with plain Event Machine ?
NeverBlock is basically the combination of Fibers , EventMachine and Postgres or MySQLPlus drivers .
So the answer is yes , if you apply some small patches to it , so if you enjoy the EventMachine style of staged programming it would work with 1.8.x even .
Note that MySQLPlus already works as a thread friendlier drop in replacement for the 1.8.x MySQL drivers .
It also happens to work with NeverBlock and 1.9 , which is its original goal .
What are the future plans for the project ?
Do you have any intentions to adapt other databases too ?
Muhammed mentioned the potential .
I do n't have any since I think we 've covered the bases pretty well .
Future plans are to work to get rails 2.2 working with NeverBlock and MySQLPlus , hopefully with good performance results .
MySQLPlus is also used in a completely asynchronous Event Machine MySQL client developed by Aman Gupta , one of the co-authors of MySQLPlus .
Of course , Postgres and MySQL are n't the only databases used with Ruby , so we talked to KUBO Takehiro , an author of ruby - oci8 , the interface to Oracle databases .
We asked him about his opinion of NeverBlock and if it would be easy to integrate it with ruby - oci8 :
In my opinion it is n't easy .
Neverblock - pg uses PGconn #send_query to issue a query then suspends the fiber until the query is finished .
But ruby - oci8 's non blocking mode is different .
When a query is executed , ruby - oci8 in a non blocking mode waits the result but does n't block other threads .
There is no place outside ruby - oci8 to add code to suspend the fiber .
But I have no intention of modifying ruby - oci8 to adapt NeverBlock .
That 's because users can use non-blocking operations transparently without using NeverBlock fiber pool .
In addition I 'm not sure whether NeverBlock is must for non blocking operations .
If ruby - pg wraps blocking operations by rb_thread_blocking_region ( ) ( new in ruby 1.9 ) , it does n't block other threads ( see The Futures of Ruby Threading ) .
In spite of what I mentioned above , I appreciate its effort for adding connection pooling feature to activerecord adapters .
It is exactly what I want .
We also asked Jamis Buckis , who is responsible for the sqlite3 - ruby adapter , if it would make sense to implement an asynchronous interface to SQLite :
Honestly , not really .
SQLite is an embedded database , not a client / server model like MySQL or PostgreSQL .
In order to support async queries to SQLite , you 'd first need to convert it into a server , so that it runs in a separate process from your application , and by the time you 've done that ... there really is no more reason to be using sqlite .
Really , I strongly discourage people from using SQLite in a production web environment .
It is fantastic for testing and development , and works great for embedded apps , but in a web environment it just does n't work nearly as well as the client / server models .
What do you think ?
Is non-blocking database access necessary for better performance ?
You have all the high scores on the Rock Band leader boards , and you have spent hours with your friends creating the best possible avatars .
Your logo , your characters , and your vision of your band 's image are perfect , but now what ?
With Rock Band 2 , you 'll be able to log into the official site , pull up images of your band , and then order posters , T - shirts , and other merchandise with your logo or images of your band .
The Harmonix booth had examples of the interface : you can pose your characters , add filters and special effects , and then create custom posters and T - shirts .
If that is n't enough , you 'll also be able to order action figures of your custom characters showing off all your hard work .
Basically , you can create and market your own virtual band .
It 's an interesting idea , and the shirts and posters that Harmonix showed us looked great , but are people really ready to wear the logo of a band they created while playing musical instruments ?
That 's an open question , but I 'm looking forward to seeing what my own avatar looks like with my custom guitar and tattoos .

BBC News , Madhya Pradesh
About 60 % children in Madhya Pradesh state are malnourished
Lying on a bed is a tiny malnourished child .
Her limbs wasted , her stomach bloated , her hair thinning and falling out .
Her name is Roshni .
She stares , wide - eyed , blankly at the ceiling .
Roshni is six months old .
She should weigh 4.5 kg .
But when she is placed on a set of scales they settle at just 2.9kg .
Roshni is suffering from severe acute malnutrition , defined by the World Health Organisation as weighing less than 60 % of the ideal median weight for her height .
There are 40 beds in this centre .
On every one is a similar child .
All are acutely malnourished .
Wailing , painful , plaintive cries fill the air .
This is the Nutrition Rehabilitation Centre in the town of Shivpuri .
You might think we are somewhere in Africa .
But this is the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh - modern India , a land of booming growth .
" The situation in our village is very bad , " says Roshni 's mother , Kapuri .
" Sometimes we get work , sometimes we do n't .
Together with our children we are dying from hunger .
What can we poor people do ?
Nothing . "
Typical symptoms
The lunchtime meal of boiled eggs , milk and porridge is handed out .
Another mother is cradling her daughter , trying to feed her .
The girl 's name is Kajal .
She is two - and - a - half years old and so weak she can hardly eat .
Her mother tries to spoon some milk into her mouth .
It dribbles down her chin .
Kajal barely even opens her eyes .
Kajal 's skin is pale .
Her breath comes sharp , shallow and fast .
She too is suffering from severe acute malnutrition .
Her weight is 6.7 kg .
Children wait for a meal outside an Anganwadi centre in Chitori Khurda
The nutrition centre here was set up by the United Nations Children 's Fund ( Unicef ) .
Doctor Vandana Agarwal , Unicef 's nutrition specialist for Madhya Pradesh state , points to Kajal 's swollen little feet .
" There is oedema on both the feet , scaly skin on her legs , even her respiration rate is high , " Dr Agarwal says .
" The child is in a lethargic condition , her hair is thin , sparse , lustreless , easily - pluckable .
These are the typical symptoms of protein energy malnutrition . "
India has some of the highest rates of child malnutrition and mortality in under-fives in the world and Madhya Pradesh state has the highest levels in India .
There are around 10 million children in the state .
A decade ago 55 % were malnourished .
Two years ago the government 's own National Family Health Survey put the figure for Madhya Pradesh at around 60 % .
So why is it going up ?
Compounded " It 's basically inadequate access to food , poor feeding practices , poor childcare practices , " says Dr Agarwal .
In Madhya Pradesh the situation is compounded by two significant factors .
For four years in a row the rains have failed , so food crops have failed too .
And now global food prices have risen , stretching many families beyond breaking point .
" In the past year food prices have increased significantly , but people 's incomes have n't improved , " says Dr Agarwal .
" Like wheat , earlier they used to buy it at eight rupees a kilogram , now it 's 12 rupees . "
India has some of the highest rates of child malnutrition in the world " Because of the increase in food prices a mother cannot buy an adequate quantity of milk , fruits and vegetables .
So their staple diet has become wheat chapattis , " she explains .
" A child cannot survive on wheat chapattis alone .
About 80 % of mothers and children are anaemic because they can't get good quality food . "
To see why things are so bad , we headed out into the villages around Shivpuri .
The drought zone stretches across this part of central India .
The land is parched and barren .
The air hot and heavy .
The village of Chitori Khurda is a ramshackle collection of 80 stone and mud huts on a rocky plain .
The villagers here come from the bottom rung of India 's social scale .
Among the lowest of the low in India 's caste system are the Scheduled Tribes , just above them come the Other Backward Castes .
Together they make up 95 % of the population of Chitori Khurda .
Worst hit Even here , in this desolate spot , caste matters consign the lowest to the harshest existence .
Chitori Khurda village has no water supply .
There are four wells in the fields around , but all belong to higher caste owners who often refuse to let the villagers use them .
So these are the people worst hit by rising food prices .
They have little land of their own .
What they do have is the least fertile , sometimes far away .
Without water they cannot irrigate , so they cannot feed themselves .
And out here there is not much in the way of work either .
Doctors say inadequate access to food is one of the causes of malnutrition
The men of Chitori Khurda get odd jobs labouring for higher castes or just play cards all day .
The women sit outside their houses sorting green leaves they have gathered into small bundles .
The leaves are sold to make local cigarettes .
But it does not earn much .
So in almost every home people are going hungry .
Unicef says 79 % of the children in this village are malnourished .
Siya showed me her house , crouching to get in through the low door , we entered a stifling - hot , single room where the family of six live .
Siya picked up the can where she keeps her flour .
It should hold enough for a week 's supply .
There were just a few cupfuls left .
Her two youngest children , seven - month - old Anjali and two - year - old Aseel , are both severely acutely malnourished .
The family can afford to eat only twice a day .
The children chewed slowly on a few chapattis flavoured with a tiny bit of onion and ground chillies .
It is all they have to eat .
Getting worse Siya 's husband works as a bonded labourer .
He is still trying to pay off a loan he took out 15 years ago .
In theory the government provides 30kg of subsidised flour a month to every poor family .
But corruption and inefficiency mean the system often does not work .
Even with the full allocation a family like Siya 's would have to buy an additional 90kg of flour a month at a cost of more than 1,000 rupees .
Kajal had to be taken to hospital for emergency blood transfusion Siya says several days a month the family has to go to bed hungry .
" The children cry and create a commotion , " she tells me .
" I go door - to - door until somebody gives me a little . "
Every lunchtime the children of Chitori Khurda gather at the Anganwadi centre in the village .
It is where nutrition and health services are provided at village level .
On the day we visited , each child was given two puris ( small bread puffs fried in oil ) along with some sweet porridge .
The allocation is 80g of food a day per child .
The children ate it , then sat hoping for more , but there was none .
Madhya Pradesh is trying hard to tackle the problem of malnutrition , but it is getting worse , not better .
Corruption and inefficiency hamper the system .
Some Anganwadi workers skim off food to sell .
Others refuse to give food to lower - caste children .
Many simply do not turn up as they are not paid much for the job .
Add to that high food prices and the poorest are sliding into hunger .
Back in Shivpuri , two - and - a - half - year - old Kajal had to be transferred to hospital .
Her condition was so serious , she was so anaemic and her haemoglobin levels so low that she had to have an emergency blood transfusion .
Lying in her hospital bed Kajal was reviving , slowly .
Her mother , anxious , looked on , a pressing question weighing on her mind .
Kajal should survive , but how will she feed her child ?

After word broke that Ensemble Studios was rumored to be close after the completion of Halo Wars , the real - time strategy game for the Xbox 360 , we received word from sources close to the studio that the information was mostly correct .
According to those sources , there were no lay - offs at Ensemble today , but we did receive internal confirmation that the Dallas based developer is to be shuttered sometime next year .
Those sources , who wish to remain anonymous , told us that Corporate VP Shane Kim visited the studio today to deliver the bad news .
The former vice president of Microsoft Game Studios informed the rank and file that , come Halo Wars ship date , the 13 - year old dev studio would be closed .
Why would Microsoft ax one of its more successful developers , one with 20 million units sold over the past decade in the home stretch of development on Halo Wars ?
It 's an odd move , but not unprecedented for the Redmond giant .
It shuttered FASA Studios , developer of Shadowrun , just four months after that developer delivered its Xbox 360 and PC shooter .
Rumors of its closure came far in advance of official word .
Letting go of Ensemble may signal a serious change in direction for Microsoft as a games publisher , opting to distance itself further from the PC gaming space amid increasing piracy concerns and a stronger focus on Xbox development .
With " no plans " for a Gears of War 2 PC release and the dissolution of Halo 2 PC developer Hired Gun , Ensemble may have looked , to bean counters , like expensive overhead in a dwindling market , one with little console experience .
Microsoft Game Studios still has a handful of developers under its umbrella , including Lionhead Studios , Turn 10 Studios and Rare , all of whom are hard at work on Xbox 360 - only titles .
Internally developed studios , like Wingnut Interactive and Xbox Live Productions , may now be more of Microsoft 's style , as opposed to the buy and burn acquisition methods it has used to build up the MGS label .
With studios like BioWare , Bungie and Bizarre being snapped up , it does n't leave the company with much of a " second - party " presence .
We 've yet to receive comment from Microsoft on the situation at Ensemble Studios , but we 'll update when we do .

Secrets for a bride and groom looking at wedding photographers and wedding venues .
Many brides and grooms do not know where they want to hold their wedding at first , and come to a planner undecided .
I often get asked the question by these young couples looking to get married , whether or not the wedding venue makes a difference to the wedding photographs .
There is no simple answer to this question – it is actually yes and no .
My job as a Johannesburg wedding photographer has given me the chance to see many breathtakingly beautiful wedding venues in Johannesburg and area .
It is for that reason that I say ‘ yes ’ to the above question , because obviously a beautiful wedding venue such as the many wedding venues in Muldersdrift such as Oakfield Farm , Glenburn Lodge , Avianto , Moon and Sixpence and Gardenworld ?
offer beautiful landscapes , gardens , and other settings for unique and treasured wedding photos .
My wedding venue was at a place called Glencove ( a part of Glenburn Lodge ) , and it was absolutely lovely .
( and , even after all this time , I still do – as always , I ’m such a sentimental old fool … ) simply because everything – the gardens , the chapel , & the entire setting – is incredibly intimate & romantic . . ..
I really truly like it !!
My husband and I posing on a bridge crossing a river is one of my favorite wedding photographs and has incredible lighting .
It is the perfect setting for the perfect wedding photograph and it completely captured the moment .
Having said that , I think any photo where my husband & I are looking into each other ’s eyes would be special to me , regardless of the background or the lighting or the setting .
Regarding the question “ do wedding venues make a difference to the photographs ? ” , I say “ they do n’t . ”
Well yes , but also because a qualified photographer is usually able to use the setting to your advantage and take lovely , unique photographs .
The setting of the wedding should not determine the quality of the photos taken by a professional wedding photographer .
You can capture beautiful photographic images even at the simplest of locations .
Likewise for a super - contemporary and seemingly ‘ unromantic ’ venue …
Obviously , depending on your photographer and which style of pictures you favor , a lot of photographs can be very ordinary so make sure to select your wedding photographer and the wedding venue carefully .
I always recommend that you choose a venue based on how it feels to you .
Choose one that resonates with you , one that you feel comfortable in .
Choose a place that you really love , no logical reason necessary .
Choose your venue because it appeals to and feels right for you .
When you feel good , you look good – and your photographs will show it .
You ’ll be able to shine in your own unique way and look beautiful as a a married couple .
The most happiest time ever of being a woman is her wedding day , and photos are one of the best things to cherish forever .!

WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The pro-gun majority in the House moved Wednesday to compel the nation 's capital to broaden the rights of its residents to buy and own firearms , including semiautomatic weapons .
Critics , led by the District of Columbia 's sole delegate to Congress , decried the action .
They said the vote tramples on the district 's right to govern itself and could endanger both residents and political dignitaries who often travel across the city .
But the National Rifle Association - backed bill passed easily , 266- 152 , with supporters saying they were determined to give D.C. residents the same Second Amendment right of self - defense that has been available to other Americans .
Many of those speaking for the bill in debate that extended well into the night Tuesday were conservative Democrats from rural districts who strongly support gun rights .
Eighty - five Democrats voted for the bill .
" Number one , I 'm a pro-gun Democrat , " said Rep. Mike Ross , D - Ark .
" Number 2 , if the government of the District of Columbia can take your guns away from you in our nation 's capital , Prescott , Arkansas , and many other small towns across the country could be next . "
The legislation is unlikely to be taken up in the Senate in the few remaining weeks of this session , but it served both to give lawmakers a pro-gun vote shortly before the election and to demonstrate the NRA 's continuing political clout .
The bill , sponsored by Mississippi freshman Democrat Travis Childers , would echo action taken Tuesday by the D.C. Council by repealing the district 's semiautomatic handgun ban and overturning a D.C. law requiring that firearms kept in the home be locked up and inoperable .
It would allow D.C. residents to purchase guns from federally licensed dealers in Maryland and Virginia and repeal what critics claimed were burdensome registration requirements .
D.C. Mayor Adrian
Fenty said in a statement that he finds it " unacceptable that this bill makes the district the only jurisdiction in the country exempt from a federal law banning residents from buying guns in other states . "
The Supreme Court , in a 5 - 4 vote last June , ruled that the 32 - year - old district ban on handgun possession violated Second Amendment rights to bear arms .
The D.C. Council responded the next month with a temporary measure allowing possession of unloaded weapons in homes but keeping the ban on semiautomatics .
On Tuesday the council went further , voting to let residents own most semiautomatic pistols and removing the requirement that weapons be stored unloaded and disassembled or secured with trigger locks .
That was n't enough for the NRA and its congressional allies , which accused the council of trying to defy the Supreme Court ruling .
" This Congress has lost faith in the willingness of the District of Columbia to defend the Second Amendment , " said Rep. Mark Souder , R - Ind .
But nonvoting Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton said Congress was violating the district 's home rule rights by imposing federal dictates , something it would do to no other American city .
" The House has the gall to ask for a vote to nullify the gun laws in my district , depriving my district of the right to protect itself and visitors like yourselves while denying me a vote on this floor on passage .
Have you no shame ? " she declared .
Norton unsuccessfully tried to move a bill that would have merely given the district 180 days to come up with new regulations complying with the Supreme Court ruling .
The White House opposed that approach and supported the Childers measure , saying it would " immediately advance Second Amendment principles . "
" The president wants to sign the bill this year and urges the Senate to take action on the House - passed bill as quickly as possible to ensure that the residents of the district are able to exercise their Second Amendment rights in a robust and meaningful way , " White House press secretary Dana Perino said .
District of Columbia Council Chairman Vincent Gray said the House was rushing " to trample on the rights of D.C. taxpayers ... even as the district government has acted swiftly and responsibly to enact an emergency bill " to address the Supreme Court 's ruling .

Riddle of the skull :
What was a white woman doing in New Zealand 100 years before Europeans settled there ?
Mystery :
The skull is said to be of a white woman
The discovery of a yellowing , cracked skull on a riverbank in New Zealand ’s North Island had baffled scientists .
Their research has shown the skull belonged to a European woman who lived about 270 years ago – a century before the first known arrival of white settlers in the country .
Even an inquest into the woman ’s death has failed to solve the mystery .
Coroner John Kershaw , sitting in the town of Masterton , 50 miles from Wellington , decided after hearing expert opinions at the inquest that the skull belonged to a European woman aged between 40 and 45 .
‘ This suggests that the deceased was alive somewhere in the South Wairarapa region ( north - east of Wellington ) in or about 1740 , ’ said Mr Kershaw .
Mr Kershaw said despite radiocarbon dating of the skull , historians had reported that the region was not settled by Europeans until after the New Zealand Company sent settlers to Wellington in 1840 .
Captain Cook visited New Zealand in 1770 - but that was 30 years after the woman was supposedly there
The skull was discovered in October 2004 by a local resident as he walked by the Ruamahunga River , south - east of the small town of Featherston .
Two Auckland forensic pathologists , Dr Rex Ferris and Dr Tim Koelmeyer , told the inquest that the skull was not Maori – the Polynesian people who were the first known inhabitants of New Zealand – and was almost certainly a European woman .
They said that conclusion could be drawn because of the study of the size of the skull , and comparison of specific parts of the skull , such as the cheekbones and jaw , with skulls of other races .
The woman ’s identity and cause of death could not be ascertained , and a verdict that ‘ death has occurred ’ was recorded .
Captain Cook traded with the Maoris , the natives of New Zealand
New Zealand was discovered by Dutch navigator Abel Tasman in December 1642 , but he only journeyed along the west coast of the country and did not land anywhere in the North Island .
And the first two European women known to arrive in the country were Kathleen Hagerty and Charlotte Edgar , British convicts who escaped from New South Wales and arrived in New Zealand in 1806 .
English explorer Captain James
Cook visited the area in 1770 - but that was nearly 30 years after the mystery woman was alive in the area .
Engraving made during the voyage of explorer Abel Tasman to New Zealand in 1642 .
In the background two Maori watch the ships approach .
Local archivest Gareth Winter told the coroner : ' There were no European inhabitants in the area 300 years ago .
' There are no records of a ship missing in New Zealand waters during this period , which might have resulted in somebody being stranded there . '
In the meantime the skull will be kept in the Wairarapa Museum of Art and History until further research can come up with some possible answers .
Wow .
Just wow .
Hillary Clinton must have known she was on the teevee , right ?
“ Rich people , god bless us .
We deserve all the opportunities to make sure our country and our blessings continue to the next generation . ”
Do n’t get me started on the word “ deserve . ”

$ 1 Quadrillion of Unregulated Debt At Core of Coming Derivatives Crisis By John Tiffany Despite all the blather and swearing - on - the - Bible pronunciamentos from establishment “ pundits , ” our house - of - cards financial system is not fundamentally sound .
Expect such indices as the Dow to tumble even much lower when the Pandora ’s box of derivatives is fully opened .
Believe it or not , the Dow is still not far from its all - time peaks , with a lot further to fall .
The depression is still in its early stages .
We are looking at $ 1 quadrillion of unregulated debt , with much of it at risk .
( And we used to think $ 1 trillion was a lot . )
These are literally inconceivable sums .
Counting one dollar per second , it would take 32 million years to count to one quadrillion .
The stock market in this era of the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank is a giant craps shoot .
Much of it is quite unregulated , especially the invisible market of derivatives .
The sub - prime mortgage market collapsed , which is now being followed by a giant credit crisis .
Now we are looking at the possible collapse of the derivative market .
President Bush failed at every business he has been associated with .
He has always had his dad to bail him out to avoid bankruptcy .
But this time his dad and even Henry Paulson can’t keep Bush from facing the failure of his economic policies at the helm of the U.S. economy .
America ’s oversized debt pyramid has just begun to wind down .
The Federal Reserve has announced that it is giving an $ 85 billion loan to American International Group ( AIG ) , the world ’s largest financial conglomerate , in exchange for a nearly 80 percent stake in the firm .
The Associated Press calls it a “ government takeover , ” but as Ellen Brown , J.D. , author of The Web of Debt , says , this is not a real nationalization like the purchase of Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac stock by the U.S. Treasury .
“ The Federal Reserve , ” she points out , “ has the power to print the national money supply , but it is not actually
It is a private banking corporation , owned by a consortium of private banks .
The private banking industry just bought the world ’s largest insurance company . ”
But they used taxpayer money to do it .
Proposals for reforming the banking system are not even on the radar screen of establishment politics , but the current system is collapsing at train - wreck speed .
Says Brown : “ We need to stop funding the culprits who brought us this debacle at our expense .
We need a public banking system that makes a cost - effective credit mechanism available for homeowners , manufacturing , renewable energy , and infrastructure ; and the first step to making it cost effective is to strip out the swarms of gamblers , fraudsters and profiteers now gaming the system . ”

Just What Are Derivatives ?
Derivatives are financial instruments whose value changes in response to the changes in underlying variables .
The main types of derivatives are futures , forwards , options and swaps .
The main use of derivatives is to reduce risk for one party .
The diverse range of potential underlying assets and pay - off alternatives leads to a wide range of derivatives contracts available to be traded in the market .
Derivatives can be based on different types of assets such as commodities , equities ( stocks ) , bonds , interest rates , exchange rates or indexes ( such as a stock market index , consumer price index ( CPI ) — inflation derivatives — or even an index of weather conditions , or other derivatives ) .
Their performance can determine both the amount and the timing of the pay - offs .
Stock index futures and options are known as derivative products because they derive their existence from actual market indices , but have no intrinsic characteristics of their own .
In addition to that , one of the reasons some believe they lead to greater market volatility is that huge amounts of securities can be controlled by relatively small amounts of margin or option premiums .
One reason derivatives are popular is because they can be transacted off balance sheets .

Sometimes animal lovers are in the mood to see kittens — lots and lots of kittens .
Still photos of kittens may offer only partial satisfaction for your desire for cuteness .
Fortunately , there ’s plenty of video footage available , showing all the wobbling , bouncing , chasing , batting , squealing , head - tilting , cat - napping silliness you can stand .
For your viewing pleasure , I compiled this kittens YouTube playlist :
The videos play in this general order :
newborn kittens
wobbly , vulnerable first steps and mewing of early kittenhood
kittens playing with toys , boxes , a roll of toilet paper , and each other
white kittens ( I ’m partial to white cats , especially fluffy ones )
drinking milk , mostly from bottles — but , in one video , from a dog !
nodding off and falling asleep
If you find a kitten video that you think belongs in this YouTube playlist , please let me know .
You can also find myriad kitten videos and slideshows on Kyte TV , and chat ( text , audio , or video ) live about them .
With visual access to so many kittens , is it possible to rank them in order of cuteness ?
kittenwar seeks to do just that , by encouraging users to click the cuter baby feline subject of two photos .
One selection leads to another , and another , and another , and pretty soon you ’ve found a new way to procrastinate with this addictive activity .
After selecting the cuter of two kittens , kittenwar informs you of the percentage of how many users agreed with your assessment of the previous pair .
kittenwar compiles the stats of photos that garnered the most clicks ( or " Winningest " kittens ) and the least clicks ( " Losingest " kittens ) .
The collection of Winningest photos showcases those kittens — ( often seen looking directly at the camera with wide - eyed expressions of innocence , sleeping in a pile of siblings and playmates , or curled up in a household object ) — that have been statistically deemed cutest by kittenwar users .
By contrast , the Losingest kittens tend to possess features that most people judge as unattractive in felines : hairlessness , bulging eyes , long snouts , long ears .
Many of them are at least part Siamese , and some almost look like Chihuahua dogs .
Complicating matters is the battle of photo quality perception .
Many of the Winningest kitten photos are of a high enough quality to be made into posters ( the kind found in offices and dorm rooms with cliched captions like " Hang in there " or " Easy does it " ) ; whereas the quality of the Losingest kitten photos are often low ( over - or underexposed , " red eye " reflections , unappealing backgrounds , poor composition ) .
So I wonder if , given a choice between two equally cute ( or non-cute ) kittens , Kittenwar users subconsciously choose the one in the higher quality photo ?
In any case , proud kitten guardians may want to upload images with only the best photographic quality .
kittenwar ’s popularity has expanded into the book kittenwar : May the Cutest Kitten Win ! , as well as the card game kittenwar , the Card Game : May the Cutest Kitten Win !.
More cuteness is available at Cute Overload , which has specific sections for kittens and other cuddly , furry creatures .
If you ’re in the mood for a laugh , check out Bonsai Kitten ( it ’s a joke , really ! ) and LOLcats ( " I Can Has Cheezburger ? " ) .
Two of my favorite LOLcats are literary homages to Edgar Allen Poe and William Shakespeare .
If the sad truth about why there are so many kittens has inspired you to consider adopting a pet , you may find a loving addition to your family through any of these resources :

Why I Am No Longer Supporting IE6
In the recent
As I mentioned above , I 'm not talking about leaving the site inaccessible or unusable for IE6 users .
I completely understand that there are many corporate machines that are held back by IT restrictions & policies where IE6 is the only choice .
I 'm not talking about making my sites inaccessible to these users , or even those who just do n't upgrade due to their own ignorance .
However , I 'm just going to choose to no longer dumb - down my sites to support them .
They 'll be able to access my sites .
They just wo n't have as good of an experience .
I know that this sort of decision cannot be made about all sites .
It 's a smart idea for major public sites to be able to fall back to IE6 support if needed .
Most of my sites are focused on the developer , either in the form of a blog or a community site .
Knowing that this is my audience I feel completely justified in not supporting IE6 and focusing only on more current browsers .
When redesigning my new site , I intentionally used PNG images with transparencies among other things that I knew would n't look cool for IE6 users .
I 'm OK with that .
I do n't think that is me being " elitist " or anything , again the audience for this site is developers - although there is still a disturbing percentage of the traffic that is using IE6 .
Letting IE6 Users Know What They Are Missing
OK .
As I mentioned , IE6 users can still read everything on this site .
Things are way too spaced apart and many dividers are not where they are supposed to be , but things are still quite readable .
I do n't want these users thinking that this is how my site is supposed to look .
Come on , that would be embarrassing .
Instead of fixing it however , I 've decided to add a little item to the header area of the page to let them know that " I know the site looks like crap , it 's because of your browser " .
Users who come to this site using IE6 will see the above and can come read more on this post .
I 'm completely on - board with Mad Kristensen 's post
What 's Wrong With IE6 ?
This is a development blog , so I should n't have to explain this to anyone here , but off top of my head ( this is a small part of a very large list ) :
Lack of support for current standards for HTML markup , CSS , etc Support for non-standard features not compatible with other browsers
No PNG transparency support Released in 2001 , we 've completely moved beyond everything about IE6 .
This is a browser that PC World rated one of the worst tech products of all time .
How Long Will Developers Have to Continue Supporting IE6 ?
At some point , we 'll all have to be OK with putting and end to adding support for IE6 in our sites .
37 Signals
If you 'd like to end supporting IE6 in your sites as well , all you have to do is focus on developing for newer browsers .
Let the site suck for IE6 users IMO .
To let them know that " you know it sucks and they should upgrade " ,
Say No To IE 6 !
Our current campaign focuses on assisting users in upgrading their Internet Explorer 6 web browser .
This campaign will result in former IE 6 users having a more enjoyable experience on the web while ( hopefully ) creating a less stressful and complicated environment for web developers by hastening the retirement of an outdated browser .
OK .
Enough for me .
I 'm sold .
No more support for IE6 from me .
IE6 users , sorry .
You can still use my sites , they just wo n't look as nice .
As a consolation prize , you will at least get to see my cool " Eek IE6 ! " message .
In the recent relaunch of this site , I created a new custom skin for Subtext .
Since this is just a personal site , I threw things together fairly quickly , testing along the way with Firefox3 and IE7 .
Once I was getting closer to complete , I took a look at my new site in all the usual browsers , including IE6 .
Ugh , it looked terrible .
I gave it some thought and made some decisions about supporting IE6 .
I 'm not going to support it .
Not on this site and not on others that I have a say in .
I 'm not talking about leaving my site unusable for IE6 users - they just wo n't get as good of an experience .
I 'm not alone with this decision .
Read on to see why I am no longer supporting IE6 .

37 Signals dropped support for IE6 in their products last Friday , Aug 15th .
I 've decided that for my sites , the time is now as well .

Let the site suck for IE6 users IMO .
To let them know that " you know it sucks and they should upgrade " , SaveTheDevelopers.org has a nice little Javascript you can add to your site to drop down a little message on the top of your pages that encourages the user to upgrade their browser to IE7 or install Firefox , Opera , Safari , etc.OK .

Pig Gate a .k.a. the attempt to gin up a gender controversy by the McCain campaign has lead to the Obama camp to put out a statement calling the McCain campaign cynical and increasingly dishonorable .
This whole thing started yesterday when at a Virginia campaign rally Obama said , “ You can put lipstick on a pig .
It ’s still a pig .
You can wrap up an old fish in a piece of paper and call it change .
It ’s still going to stink after eight years .
We ’ve had enough . ”
The McCain camp called Obama ’s remarks disgusting and demanded an apology for the Democrat calling Sarah Palin a pig .
Of course , Obama never called Palin a pig , but I guess when one is trying to strike while the fire is hot , they should n’t let a little thing like the facts stand in the way .

The Obama campaign put out a statement last night calling this a pathetic attempt to play the gender card .
“ Enough is enough .
The Mc Cain campaign ’s attack tonight is a pathetic attempt to play the gender card about the use of a common analogy – the same analogy that Senator McCain himself used about Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s health care plan just last year .
This phony lecture on gender sensitivity is the height of cynicism and lays bare the increasingly dishonorable campaign John McCain has chosen to run , ” said senior advisor Anita Dunn .
John McCain is the last politician in the world that should be talking about gender issues .
He opposes equal pay for women .
He favors legislation that would make it more difficult for women to bring sex discrimination lawsuits against employers .
( These are the types of lawsuits that he considers frivolous ) .
Plus , his anti-abortion position makes it clear that John McCain is not a supporter on some important issues to many women .
John McCain is listening to Karl Rove and his crowd .
He is doing whatever he has to do to win an election .
McCain was an American hero , but now he shamelessly exploits his biography , and has flushed his previous policy positions down the toilet .
McCain is running a dishonorable campaign , but the bigger question is , what ’s the Obama campaign going to do about it ?
What if you could have a type of monitoring that would store a value of your choosing , and a status of your choosing , based on a script on your servers ?
A kind of “ universal ” check type that you can customize as you wish on your end .
Well , now you can .
We have added a new , customizable check type to the Pingdom uptime monitoring service , called simply “ HTTP custom ” .
It expects a formatted XML response with a status ( OK / not OK ) and a value ( a number ) .
This value replaces the “ response time ” value in the Pingdom graphs , and the status ( OK or not ) replaces the UP or DOWN status .
Since you are returning a value and a status every time your XML page is accessed ( for example once a minute ) , you will be able to see this data in the graphs in the Pingdom control panel , and of course be sent alerts just as with any other Pingdom check .
This may all sound a bit abstract , so let ’s look at some examples of how this new check type can be used .
Monitor the amount of free RAM or HD space on your server .
Monitor the CPU load on your server .
Monitor the number of active connections to your web server .
And any other monitoring type you can imagine …
All you need is a script that performs some form of task on your end and sends back the status and value of the operation in the specified XML format .
Your script decides what is considered UP ( i.e. OK ) , so you have full control over thresholds and what is tested on your end .
Of course , nothing stops you from performing more advanced tasks than the ones we mentioned above .
The imagination is the limit here .
What we do on our end is simple , we just get this XML file from you .
How you generate it is completely up to you .
We hope you will find good use for this new functionality .
As always , we welcome any feedback you may have !
Note :
This check will time out if it cannot read the XML file within 30 seconds , which counts as a “ down ” on Pingdom ’s end .
So if you decide to create a really elaborate , time - consuming script on your end , you may be best off letting it run separately and just have it continuously update a status page ( the XML file ) that is accessed by Pingdom .
Also , if the server your script runs on ( or rather the XML file ) is unreachable for some reason , this will also count as a “ down ” on Pingdom ’s end , so make sure your script runs on a reliable server with a good Internet connection .
Poor Maureen
Dowd does n't know how to make fun of Barack Obama .
It 's actually pretty easy !
Everyone misses Bill Clinton because he enjoyed extramarital sex with interns and oddly unattractive women , he had a southern accent , and he was kind of chubby .
Everyone will miss George W. Bush because he 's stupid .
Those traits are so , so easy to mock !
But the problem is jokes about those traits were and are and always have been terrible .
Have another Big Mac , Bubba !
Then put a cigar in someone 's vagina !
Hey George Bush you look like a chimp !
And , like a chimp , your grasp of complex concepts like grammar is often lacking !
Jesus .
Stop already .
Obama 's a godsend , because he lacks those easy buttons .
So everyone has to be more creative with their humor .
Allow us to help you !
The Big Fuss
The secret - the the thing that has so many literal - minded idiots terrified at things like that New Yorker cover - is simple : you do n't need to mock the man , you can mock the aura surrounding him .
Barack 's messianic tendencies have been greatly exaggerated but there 's no topping that Rolling Stone cover with the halo .
So when The Onion put Obama on the cover of Tiger Beat , it was funny because it was an absurd exaggeration of the truth ( see how that works ? ) .
Filth & Fury Plus Obama 's strongest supporters are showing themselves to be severely humorless , and that 's funny !
The gradual shift from constant outrage over matters that probably justify outrage - the mood of the Bush years - to this new era of outrage - for - the - sake of outrage is a scary omen for the future of liberalism in this country and also a great punchline .
Dos and Don'ts
Do n't :
Try to cleverly call him effete .
Looking at you , Maureen !
The guy dresses nice , sometimes , but he does n't actually have those effeminate signifiers that everyone seems to think other male Democratic politicians possess .
So stop fucking calling him " Butterfly " because that makes no sense .
Do : Call him " elite ! "
It 's funny because he represents an aspirational black middle class and so we have to put him and his wife back in their place !
Haha no , seriously , it 's funny because making fun of Harvard is funny .
Do n't make latte jokes though , it 's not 1997 .
Do n't : Make fun of his funny name .
It 's painful when Slate does it , yes , but even the reliable Daily Show writers fall into the trap .
" Baracknophobia " is not the level of punmanship we 've come to expect from you guys .
It is funny to call him " Barry , " though .
Do :
Make fun of how people are terrified of his funny name and his foreign background .
When faced with polls that suggest Americans do truly believe that Barack Obama was raised by The Iron Sheikh and spent his school years snorting the remains of 9/11 victims , all you can do is laugh and contemplate a life a sea .
Special Cases : Black comedians .
Can they make fun of Barack Obama ?
Sure !
But other black people will get even angrier about it , depending on the material and the audience .
Of course , you knew that already .
Note to Cartoonists : Yes , his ears stick out .
Good work catching that one .
In Short : Yes , so far , there is nothing " buffoonish " about Barack Obama .
And that is a good thing , for people who enjoy laughing at things that are actually funny !
But please , please , please , white people - do n't whine about not being allowed to make fun of him because everyone will get mad at you .
Just think about it for a minute !
If your joke is funny , make it !
If it is not funny , make one ( 1 ) different joke .
[ Note : We forgot the credit the illustrator !
Lukas Ketner drew this for Willamette Week . ]
Each campaign sat in a conference room ( or presumably something similar ) some three or four weeks ago and mapped out their future campaign .
Each advisor had " VP " circled somewhere on their memo pad ; and each nominee had a VP in mind .
But suppose for a second each candidate had a different perspective ; could a different decision have entirely effected their nominee 's standing in the last four weeks .
What are their possible pasts ?
Everybody is quick to point out that " if Obama had selected Hillary Clinton as his Vice President , the race would already be over ; " I simply do not believe this .
In fact I think entirely the opposite is true .
Knowing what we know now , Hillary would have doomed the Democratic Party , and I mean that in the nicest way possible .
McCain would have been forced to react , and would not have chosen Sarah Palin ; I say this with 100 % certainty .
If you 're running against the historic ticket you pick the slick white guy and hope to gain racist and sexist votes ; that 's the sad reality and I do n't think the Republicans would have hesitated .
Instead Obama 's selection of Biden did no harm , the cardinal rule of VP selection .
Ultimately I think Biden will do the most good , but that 's not the point of this article .
John McCain likely chooses Mitt Romney ( although , Pawlenty , Ridge or Liebermann would still have been options ) to counteract the gravitas of the Obama - Clinton ticket ; it 's hard to predict , after all McCain did eventually chose Sarah Palin .
I think Hillary Clinton is the only person for whom McCain does n't choose Sarah Palin , with the possible exception of Kathleen Sebelius ; but I do n't think she was ever legitimately considered .
Mitt Romney 's strength is the economy and it just so happens that the economy is flying into a sharpened fan right now .
McCain 's possible past is much brighter with a Romney selection ( and likely his future ) , especially after his disastrous week .
McCain likely would not have gotten such a large bounce in the polls had he chosen somebody other than Palin , but it clearly does n't matter what the polls said at the beginning of September on November 5th .
As of right now the only thing Palin has concretely provided McCain was a nice five percent boost in his polling numbers for what amounts to a week ; the recent CBS poll shows McCain 's support among women plummeting by 21 % .
Romney may or may not have provided a similar polling spike , but at least he would be useful with regards to the now diseased economy , after all that was Romney 's main selling point .
If you take a look into the past and alter the VP permutations the scenario that actually happened appears to the best imaginable outcome for Obama and the worst possible for McCain .
The McCain campaign fell into the trap of trying to pick what the central issue of the election would be ; they guessed energy and fell flat on their face .
Nobody cares how much gas costs because they have no money to buy anything .
Most people have lost 10 % of their portfolio in the past two days and the GOP ticket is offering no solutions to fix the already ailed economy .
The Obama campaign instead focused on the actual role of a Vice President and selected somebody who actually ran for the position twice .
Joe Biden is n't an expert on the economy or energy by any stretch , but his central claim to knowledge is not the fact that he can see Russia , but rather his 35 years as a Senator .
The Obama campaign took an entirely different approach to the selection that maximized their chances on any issue ; they played the statistics .
That I cannot say about the McCain campaign .
I cannot conclude within any reasonable bounds of logic why Sarah Palin was selected .
There are simply too many other , better possible pasts for John McCain .
The possible future will be theirs to command .
Whenever , to coin a phrase , a war breaks out in a faraway country of which we know little , I am reminded of a news editor I once worked for .
He would go to a wall map showing the location of the paper 's correspondents , produce a ruler , and measure the distance of each from the area in question .
Regardless of travel links or national boundaries , he decreed that the nearest should go .
It was a bit like that , I imagine , in many media offices when the conflict between Georgia and Russia broke out .
Not only was it August , when many reporters are on holiday , it was also the Olympics , and the few still on duty were mostly in Beijing .
The Financial Times headline , " Georgia says Russia at war " , may have seemed strange , but it summed up the state of Fleet Street 's verifiable knowledge as the armies moved into action .
In the age of 24 - hour news , however , the press cannot hang about waiting for reporters to arrive .
Readers want bombs , tanks and death tolls .
They need to be told who are the goodies and baddies .
News , remember , is part of the entertainment industry .
Into the vacuum stepped the Georgian government .
Its president , Mikheil Saakashvili , speaks English , wants to join Nato , sent troops to Iraq , got himself educated at Harvard , cultivates a media - friendly style , and sends Georgian university exam papers to be marked in Britain , though whether he expects to get them back is another matter .
He took power in the Rose revolution of 2003 - 04 and professes to be a democrat .
He 's clearly an all - round good egg .
And he has a PR firm , Aspect Consulting , based in Brussels , London and Paris , which also acts for Exxon Mobil , Kellogg 's and Procter and Gamble .
Almost hourly over the five - day war , press releases landed on foreign news desks .
" Russia continues to attack civilian population . "
The capital Tblisi was " intensively " bombed .
A downed Russian plane turned out to be " nuclear " .
European " energy supplies " were threatened as Russia dropped bombs near oil pipelines .
A " humanitarian wheat shipment " was blocked .
Later , " invading Russian forces " began " the occupation of Georgia " .
Saakashvili's government filed allegations of ethnic cleansing to The Hague .
Note the use of terms that trigger western media interest : civilian victims , nuclear , humanitarian , occupation , ethnic cleansing .
It would be unfair to accuse the British press of accepting the Georgian PR uncritically .
Most papers dutifully reported that a Georgian attack in the breakaway province of South Ossetia , where most people want to join Russia , started the conflict .
But casual readers might have struggled to understand that .
The Mail 's headline announced : " ' 1,500 die ' as the Russian tanks roll in " .
Only in the last paragraph of the story did it become clear that the Georgians , not the Russians , were alleged to have killed 1,500 .
Russia 's behaviour , newspapers implied , was in a quite different category from Georgia's .
In the Sunday Times , Russian tanks went " rampaging " in South Ossetia , while Georgian tanks merely " moved " .
If Georgian forces had bombarded civilians , it was " reprehensible " , the Telegraph allowed .
Russia , however , was " offending every canon of international behaviour " .
An analysis in the same paper avoided any mention of how Georgia provoked the crisis .
Saakashvili was " paying the price " for his pro-western foreign policy .
A " resurgent Russia " was " itching to flex its muscles and burning with post - imperial hubris " .
Such comments are illuminated by substituting Britain or America for Russia , and Iraq for Georgia .
Try " resurgent Britain ... itching to flex its muscles " , etc .
As the conflict went on , press coverage became more balanced , with several commentators noting , to quote the Independent 's Mary Dejevsky , that " it is quite hard to argue that there is one law for assisting Albanians in Kosovo and quite another for Russians and Ossetians in Georgia " .
Increasingly , the press portrayed Saakashvili as a self - regarding fool who blundered into a war he was bound to lose .
But Georgia 's actions in South Ossetia went largely unexamined , and it was hard to find , from press accounts , what refugees from the province were fleeing from .
Again , the Georgians played the PR game more skilfully .
Western correspondents were welcomed into Gori and shown areas apparently bombed by the Russians .
Saakashvili held international media phone conferences , got himself on TV news channels and even found time , within hours of war breaking out , to write for the Wall Street Journal .
Russia , by contrast , allowed little access to South Ossetia .
Its government attempted no comparable media offensive .
Though it also has a PR agency , GPlus Europe in Brussels ( and Ketchum in Washington ) , it was not asked to issue press releases .
As a source wryly put it , " the press release is not a common tool of the Russian government " .
The brief war in the Caucasus was a classic example of the situation outlined in Nick Davies 's book Flat Earth News .
Most newspapers had n't a clue what was going on and lacked sufficient resources to find out .
So skilfully presented PR was at a premium .
Most journalists treated it with at least some scepticism , but it inevitably had an effect .
If there was a military war , there was also an information one , and Georgia got the better of it .
The researchers suggest they may be able to develop treatments for children Scientists have revealed the earliest developmental changes that lead to Down 's syndrome .
The team from Barts and the Royal London say the changes to embryonic stem cells are caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 .
The study , in the American Journal of Human Genetics , says the extra chromosome sets off a chain of genetic changes in the developing embryo .
The Down 's Syndrome Association welcomed the " excellent " research .
Down syndrome belongs to a group of conditions called " aneuploidies " , which are defined by an abnormal loss or gain of genetic material , such as fragments of chromosomes or whole chromosomes .
Aneuploidies cause congenital anomalies that are a prime cause of infant death in Europe and the US , and are currently on the increase with advancing maternal age in European countries .
Around one in every 1,000 babies born in the UK will have Down 's syndrome .
There are 60,000 people in the UK with the condition .
Therapeutic potential
The international team of researchers , which also included scientists from the US , Australia , Spain and Switzerland , looked at embryonic stem cells from mice which had been genetically engineered to carry a copy of human chromosome 21 .
" It 's not just important for the development of brain cells but for their maintenance throughout life
Professor Dean Nizetic
They discovered that the presence of the extra chromosome 21 , known as trisomy 21 , disturbs a key regulating gene called REST , which then disturbs the cascade of other genes that control normal development at the embryonic stem cell stage .
The scientists also found that one gene ( DYRK1A ) which is present on chromosome 21 , acts as the trigger for this disturbance .
Dean Nizetic , professor of cellular and molecular biology at Barts and the London , said the work could one day lead to molecule - based therapies which could alleviate the effects of Down 's syndrome .
" We hope that further research might lead to clues for the design of new therapeutic approaches tackling developmental delay , mental retardation , ageing and regeneration of brain cells , and Alzheimer 's disease .
He said he believed the genetic effects continue throughout life .
" I suspect that it 's not just important for the development of brain cells but for their maintenance throughout life ; how cells age and how they can cope with stress .
" That 's an area that could be approached with regard to therapies . "
' Extremely positive ' Professor Nizetic suggested future research should be directed into basic molecular mechanisms that could one day develop into treatments to children with Down 's syndrome in the first few years of life when the brains are " plastic " and rapidly developing .
And he said that the same areas of the human genome have been thought to play a part in Alzheimer 's disease - so research could also lead to treatments for that condition .
Carol Boys , chief executive for the Down 's Syndrome Association said : " Any research that helps us to understand more about some of the complex medical conditions that are commonly associated with Down 's syndrome can only be a positive step forward .
" The development of therapeutic treatments for these sometimes complicated health problems that can be associated with the condition will hopefully lead to an improvement in the overall health of people of with Down 's syndrome . "
She added : " We understand that research is slow , but the initial results look extremely positive and we look forward to the continuation of the excellent work of this dedicated research team with interest . "

I picked up the recent Uncanny X - Men # 500 .
I used to be a major X - junkie .
We ’re talking MAJOR junkie .
I ’d read every single Uncanny X - Men story from Giant - Sized X - Men # 1 ( 1975 ) through Uncanny X - Men # 320 ( January 1995 ) .
While I only started reading the series in 1983 , I ’d gone back and read all the earlier stories .
This includes most of the spin - off series as well ; New Mutants , X - Men Classic , X - Factor , X - Men ( adjective - less ) , Excalibur , X - Force , Generation X , tons of mini-series , etc .
So shortly after the Phalanx Covenant I ’d just had enough and walked away from 20 years of continuity and over 400 comics .
Every so often I ’ll pick up an issue of X - Men just to see what is going on .
I picked up a handful in the 350s , 360s , 370s , and a couple others here and there .
Issue # 500 seemed like a good one to pick - up .
It was billed as a “ jumping on point ” and I ’m always a sucker for an anniversary issue .
To start with , it had an awesome Alex Ross cover celebrating several eras of the book .
Well , at least the version I got was an Alex Ross .
The inside notes at least four different variant covers .
Another example of why I walked away previously .
The story was by Ed Brubaker & Matt Fraction .
I hear these guys on the Word Balloon podcast frequently , so I was hopeful this would be good .
The art was by Greg Land and Terry Dodson ; both well known for their gorgeous ladies .
So far , so good .
Warning .. SPOILERS ahead …
As expected the art is great and the ladies are hot .
By the third page , we get to see a Sentinel , so that ’s cool .
The early part of the story provides the reader with a tour of the new X - Men headquarters in San Francisco , along with an explanation of the X - Men ’s new found popularity with the masses .
Then the story moves to a swank San Francisco art opening featuring three decommissioned Mark One Sentinels .
Suddenly Magneto attacks and reactivates the Sentinels .
Our heroes are there to protect their new hometown .
Lots of action in downtown San Francisco , ultimately leading to Magneto ’s defeat .
It ’s discovered that Magneto ( who lost his powers a while back ) was simulating his powers with an exo-suit designed by the High Evolutionary .
In fact , Magneto ’s attack was merely a distraction , and he ’s in cahoots with the High Evolutionary in a mysterious plot surrounding a stationary Celestial that ’s chilling in San Francisco .
The next day , Cyclops sends out a psychic broadcast ( sent via Emma Frost ) to all mutants on Earth inviting them to their new headquarters in San Francisco .
The X - Men have turned their headquarters into a mutant sanctuary .
And finally in an epilogue we see some anti-mutant hate crimes begin to appear in San Francisco .
Overall , I guess I pretty much enjoyed the issue .
Nothing like a decisive opinion , eh ?
It was definitely a great “ jumping on point ” and the art was phenomenal .
However , I had some concerns with the issue .
First off , Magneto ’s attack really seemed ridiculous .
Even in hindsight with his attack simply being a distraction , it seemed forced .
I had a hard time believing this was really the brilliant strategist he had been portrayed as in the past .
I honestly expected him to be revealed as an impostor .
I was shocked when it turned out to really be Magneto .
I think my biggest issue with the story was the lack of change within the team .
I stated that I gave up reading the series on a regular basis back in 1995 .
Well … not much has really changed since .
In fact , it seems not much has really changed since the mid-80s either .
I can quickly run down the changes to the X - Men that appeared in this book since the “ classic ” days :
Emma Frost is a good guy and dating Cyclops
Beast looks more like a blue lion nowadays
Cannonball has graduated to the X - Men
Storm is the Queen of Wakanda
The X - Men are popular and trendy
The majority of mutants have become de-powered thanks to the Scarlet Witch .
There are only approximately 200 mutants left on Earth .
However , I gotta say I do n’t think there were all that many in the “ classic ” days anyway .
So maybe this is simply another reset to the “ classic ” era .
20 years later and those seem to be the only changes to the series based upon this issue .
Now I know there have been TONS of other changes , but they apparently either did n’t stick or were n’t worth mentioning in this issue .
Even things that were changed previously have reverted back to their “ classic ” state ; for example Colossus is alive again , Angel has his feathered wings back , Jean Grey is dead again , and Professor X is absent again ( he was always going away for long periods of time in the old days ) .
By way of example , here is the X - Men roster for this issue :
Cyclops
Storm
Colossus
Wolverine
Nightcrawler
Angel
Beast
Cannonball
Emma Frost
With the exception of Emma Frost and Cannonball , this is pretty much the classic team .
Since those classic days , they ’ve introduced tons of new characters .
Were those characters not popular ?
Were they that forgettable ?
Who knows , maybe they ’ve been de-powered , are on other teams nowadays , or have become villains .
Here are a handful of X - Men from more recent years that I guess did n’t make the cut :
Jubilee
Gambit
Bishop
Revanche
Cecilia Reyes
Marrow
Maggott
Sage
Chamber
Stacy X
With all that said , I realize that resetting a comic back to its “ classic ” era is commonplace .
Just look at what DC has been doing for quite some time .
I guess I was just disappointed to find the X - Men were n’t that different than I remember .
Most of the time that would probably be a comfort .
But in a team that is known for lots of change and dynamic storytelling , it just seemed somewhat sad that they were taking the “ safe ” approach by making it too approachable for folks like me .
Part of the fun with the X - Men growing up was being thrown into the deep end with all these characters I did n’t know and discovering for myself who they were and what they were about .
After issue # 500 , I already know all the characters and there really is n’t much mystery to bring me back .
Microsoft was quick to respond to Congress after the House rejected the government ’s $ 700 billion bank bailout plan , issuing a brief statement asking them to rethink their position .
" Microsoft strongly urges members of the U.S. House of Representatives to reconsider and to support legislation that will re-instill confidence and stability in the financial markets , " said General Counsel Brad Smith .
" This legislation is vitally important to the health and preservation of jobs in all sectors of the economy of Washington State and the nation , and we urge Congress to act swiftly . "
The Dow ’s 778 - point drop is the worst single - day point loss ever .
Microsoft was down more than 8 percent , closing at $ 25.01 .
Smith also acknowledged that it is n’t everyday that the company speaks out on these matters .
" In the over 35 - year history of Microsoft , we ’ve never taken a position on a piece of banking legislation , but unusual times call for unusual steps , " he told the Seattle Post - Intelligencer .

According to a new national poll commissioned by Lifetime Networks , Barack Obama leads John McCain 49 % - 38 % with women voters .
Not surprisingly , Obama ’s strength is with minority women .
Eight nine percent of African American women , and 62 % of Hispanic women said that they are supporting Obama .
Interestingly , those surveyed said the gender of each candidate ’s choice of running mate does not matter .
Fifty five percent of Obama supporters said selecting a woman as his running mate does not matter , and 62 % of McCain supporters said that it did not matter .
However , Obama would benefit by selecting a woman running mate , while McCain could actually be hurt by it .
Twenty nine percent of women said that they would be more likely to support Obama if he had a female running mate , while 15 % said that they would be more inclined to support McCain , but 20 % said that they would be less likely to support the Republican if he added a woman to the ticket .
Obama has a higher positive rating than McCain 53 % - 37 % .
Overall voters are split on McCain 37 % view him favorably , and 31 % unfavorably .
Obama leads McCain with Independent women 42%-30 % with 20 % still undecided .

Most of the Hillary Clinton supporters have moved to Obama ( 76 % ) , but 18 % answered that they will vote for John McCain .
Most women blame bad campaign strategy as the reason why Hillary Clinton lost ( 34 % ) .
Thirty one percent blamed her loss on who she was and what she stood for , and 21 % said that she lost because she is a woman .
The top four issues listed by the women surveyed in this poll were the economy ( 41 % ) , the war in Iraq ( 24 % ) , healthcare ( 23 % ) and education ( 17 % ) .
At best Obama is splitting the male vote with John McCain , so women are a critical group that he must win in November .
Judging from this poll , it would appear that the bad feelings of the Democratic primary campaign have passed for most Clinton supporters .
I think much of the credit for this goes to Hillary Clinton herself .
She has led her supporters by example and thrown herself into the Obama campaign .
I still believe that the coalition that will power Obama to victory will be made up of younger voters , minorities , and women .
The full poll results can be read here .
Here 's the McCain camp's on record take , in a statement from Douglas Holtz - Eakin , his top economic adviser :
From the minute John McCain suspended his campaign and arrived in Washington to address this crisis , he was attacked by the Democratic leadership : Senators Obama and Reid , Speaker Pelosi and others .
Their partisan attacks were an effort to gain political advantage during a national economic crisis .
By doing so , they put at risk the homes , livelihoods and savings of millions of American families .
Barack Obama failed to lead , phoned it in , attacked John McCain , and refused to even say if he supported the final bill .
Just before the vote , when the outcome was still in doubt , Speaker Pelosi gave a strongly worded partisan speech and poisoned the outcome .
This bill failed because Barack Obama and the Democrats put politics ahead of country .

You could , if you wanted , keep track of all your favorite net - based video shows in a feed reader or just wait to hear about them a week after they 're released .
Or you could use the free , cross- platform Miro player to turn your computer into a TiVo for net video .
As Gina detailed in her look at Miro , the software keeps track of what you 've watched , auto - recycles stuff you probably wo n't get to , and otherwise does a smart job of handling video streams .
And if you want to hook Miro up to your real TV , it 's got the chops to go full - screen with any format .
3. Turn YouTube searches into vidcast feeds .

YouTube offers up a few RSS feeds of videos — " Recently Featured , " " Top Favorites Today , " and the like — but not for individual searches , the kind you 'd make if you were keeping up with The Guild or keeping on top of the latest Xbox 360 hacks .
YouTube Podcaster , a free service from vixy .
net ( who also provide a nifty converter you 'll see below ) , makes YouTube videos as easy to grab and watch as podcasts .
Enter in your search URL , copy the iTunes link , and you 'll get an on - demand feed of videos that meet your criteria .
You 'll want to be specific , but skipping the comments and stream loading time are your rewards .
2. Watch YouTube on TV .

Are the brakes on your Django app ?
When building an application using an application framework like Django ... the priority is often to get the application working first and optimize it later .
The trade off is between getting it done and getting it done for 1 million users .
Here 's a check list of things you can do to make sure your application can be optimized quickly when you put on your optimization hat .
Note , most applications do n't need all of this since most applications do not get anywhere near enough traffic to justify even bothering .
But if you 're lucky enough to need to optimize your Django app , I hope this post can help you .
Note , my background is in building very large high traffic sites for companies such as Fanball.com , AOL Fantasy Sports , eBay.ca , PGATour and NASCAR .
All of those sites were built using ColdFusion / Microsoft SQLServer or MySQL or Oracle and I only recently jumped into Django .
If you 're familiar with fantasy sports , you know that you usually rush to a site to set your line up just before a sporting event starts and then you check your score when an event is live .
This traffic is extremely high during those peak times , so much so that Fanball.com used to be a top 1000 site according to Alexa during football season .
Being new to Django I wished I could have found a post like this when trying to launch a high traffic site .
Caching and Managers
You probably built your app using managers right ?
Even if you 're not building the application for a large number of users , you should be using managers anyway to help reuse code .
If you are using managers , going back to retrofix your code to use memcache or some other type of caching is straight forward .
Be sure to use cMemcache in your production environment .
And be sure NOT to mix cMemcache and the regular memcache python library .
The keys they generate are not 100 % compatible .
You 'll be able to read keys from either , but cMemcache wo n't write keys that regular memcache can always read .
I 'm not sure why that 's true , but you 've been warned .
Dog Piling and Caching
This is a big deal .
No matter how good you 're caching objects , you need to make sure only ONE process is refreshing the cache .
There are several ways to handle this .
Mint Cache is a good solution .
Another solution is to use managers that ONLY read the cached objects , and have a separate process refresh the cache .
You can use signals to flag that an object needs to be refreshed .
Or you could refresh it on a timed interval .
Health Check for Load Balancers
You have two options to survive a server going down .
One is to have a hot spare waiting to be put online .
In this scenario the load balancer should do this automatically .
Another , is to have that hot swappable server already online and make sure that your load can always be handled with at least 1 server down .
I prefer the later solution as this guarantees that the " idle " server is actually functional under load .
Opinions vary .
Avoid auto shutting down a server from a load balancer .
You could cause a death spiral very easily this way .
Access Servers Directly
It 's important to be able to access the servers directly , even if you are behind a load balancer .
This will often be the only way to reliably test unusual problem that might be happening in production .
To do this , make sure the servers are configured to answer at a special URL directly .
For example web1.mysite.com .
You should have web1.mysite.com in your HOSTS or in your local DNS server .
If you can't get to the server directly because of a firewall , try using a free VPN like Hamachi to get through .
Connection Caching
Be sure to have some sort of connection pooling or connection caching .
I was able to get SQLAlchemy installed within 30 minutes .
It 's easy to setup .
Make sure that the database timeout value ( base.py ) in the SQLAlchemy matches the timeout value for the connection at the database .
Avoid Thread Thrashing
Keep those threads alive !
Check your Apache settings and make sure that you do n't have thread thrashing .
You do n't want Apache killing and starting threads on you .
Every time you do that , Django needs to initialize ... an expensive process .
Any objects you might have built in memory need to be rebuilt .
The database connection needs to be established again .
These are all things you only want to do once .
Would you boot up your machine every single time you want to send an email ?
You probably leave it on during working hours .
Same thing applies here .
Leave those threads on .
Here 's an example of settings I 've used with Apache on a 4 CPU server .
StartServers 20
ServerLimit 20
MinSpareServers 20
MaxClients 20
MaxRequestsPerChild 100000
Note that MaxRequestsPerChild COULD be set to 0 and have the thread never reset , but just in case there 's a memory leak somewhere ( I have yet to see one ) I have it reset every 100 k requests .
Do n't just set the ServerLimit and MaxClients connections to some crazy high number .
Remember , there 's only so much memory on the server to go around .
If you start to swap memory , your server is dead .
Additionally , if your server is already CPU bound ( 85 % CPU utilization ) , setting these numbers higher is not going to help .
You 'll just increase the overhead of switching between all the processes .
Cache Templates
In a production environment , you should cache templates .
Here 's a great snippet to do that .
Note About Load Testing
There are two ways to test how your application is going to perform under load .
The more expensive , more time consuming and least accurate number can be had with load testing software .
You can start to unit test certain parts with software as simple as ab which comes with Apache .
You can start to spend some real money on expensive load testing suites with nice reports and that allowing load testing from multiple clients so that you can effectively test against a load balanced farm .
Load testing is a completely different test , but just remember that load testing is in fact the least accurate and the most expensive way to load test an application .
You can spend lots of time and money building script that try to get close to a real world scenario but will never actually be real .
The advantage is that you will get back some useful data and you can do this before a single user hits a web page .
A better approach , if it 's possible , is to gradually roll - out the application .
Gradually increase both the number of users and the number of expensive features .
This is not always possible , but usually .. it is .
Reverse DNS and Mutexes
This might sound obvious , but be sure your DBA has checked this one .
MySQL likes to do reverse DNS lookups on the IP when it receives a connection .
Either start MySQL with -- skip - name - resolve or be sure that reverse DNS is configured properly .
Also , if you 're going to have a large number of connections ( probably one per apache thread + a few extra ) be sure the mutex count in the OS is set high enough .
We 've had to raise it to 1000 on a very large installation .
Miscellaneous
Here 's a few things covered in other posts , but that I feel I need to include in here because .. well .
it 's very low hanging fruit .
Remember to reduce the number of queries .
If you 're doing something like this in a template team .
player .name and you 're not using select_related ( ) or not creating your own object , that means that django will automatically query the data for you .
This is a huge problem if it 's in a loop .
Additionally , try to combine ORM calls if it makes sense .
Try to go to the database as little as possible .
It 's often easy to browse through the queries on a page and see where often used lookups can be cached or different ORM calls can be combined .
Be sure to monitor your disk space .
You probably want to turn of most logging on Apache .
Also , please do n't serve your images and static content through Python .
It 's like using your flat bed to transport a letter .
Conclusion
You 've already chosen Django and Python so you know you have room to improve performance .
Plan ahead .
You do n't have to slow down development to optimize the application for those mythical million users , but use managers whenever possible .
Keep an eye on that query count at the bottom of the page .
If all else fails and you 're under the gun , ask .
The IRC channel can really help when things are happening right now .

It seems it is finally open season on John McCain in the Mainstream Media for his poor judgement in his irresponsible decision to chose Sarah Palin as a running mate .
On TV
CNN
Scarborough ( H/T wordie ) :
And on the News sites in America :
The New York Times here and this is David Brooks speaking :
He really needs someone to impose a policy structure on his moral intuitions .
He needs a very senior person who can organize a vast administration and insist that he tame his lone - pilot tendencies and work through the established corridors — the National Security Council , the Domestic Policy Council .
He needs a near - equal who can turn his instincts , which are great , into a doctrine that everybody else can predict and understand .
Rob Portman or Bob Gates would n’t have been politically exciting , but they are capable of performing those tasks .
Palin , for all her gifts , is not .
She underlines McCain ’s strength without compensating for his weaknesses .
The real second fiddle job is still unfilled .
and here :
Aides to Mr. McCain said they had a team on the ground in Alaska now to look more thoroughly into Ms. Palin ’s background .
A Republican with ties to the campaign said the team assigned to vet Ms. Palin in Alaska had not arrived there until Thursday , a day before Mr. McCain stunned the political world with his vice - presidential choice .
The campaign was still calling Republican operatives as late as Sunday night asking them to go to Alaska to deal with the unexpected candidacy of Ms. Palin . [ … ]
“ They did n’t seriously consider her until four or five days from the time she was picked , before she was asked , maybe the Thursday or Friday before , ” said a Republican close to the campaign .
“ This was really kind of rushed at the end , because John did n’t get what he wanted .
He wanted to do Joe or Ridge . ”
The Washington Post ’s Richard Cohen says :
One of the great sights of American political life — a YouTube moment if ever there was one — was to see the doughboy face of Newt Gingrich as he extolled the virtues of Sarah Palin , a sitcom of a vice presidential choice and a disaster movie if she moves up to the presidency : “ She ’s the first journalist ever to be nominated , I think , for the president or vice president , and she was a sportscaster on local television , ” Gingrich said on the “ Today ” show .
“ So she has a lot of interesting background .
And she has a lot of experience .
Remember that , when people worry about how inexperienced she is , for two years she ’s been in charge of the Alaska National Guard . ”
and adds , rather pointedly :
It ’s a pity Gingrich was not around when the Roman Emperor Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus , better known by his nickname Caligula , reputedly named Incitatus as a consul and a priest .
Incitatus was his horse .
It does n’t stop here , there ’s the European media , too :
The Times calls her half baked Alaskan and concludes :
Mrs Palin ’s selection has made for great political theatre .
It is also profoundly irresponsible .
This was Mr McCain ’s first Cabinet - level appointment , and it reflects as vividly as any of his battles over campaign finance reform the maverick tendencies that continue to define him .
Such tendencies are of huge value on the American football field , in certain corporate settings and , indeed , in the US Senate .
Whether they belong in the Oval Office at a time of grave and unfamiliar challenges to Western civilisation is far less clear .
The Telegraph likens the frantic post factum vetting to a political hit squad :
Senior allies of the Republican presidential nominee insisted that the team of press officers will handle the worldwide media frenzy surrounding the selection of only the second woman ever on a presidential ticket .
But they also admitted that they have operatives on the ground in Alaska to probe more deeply into her background .
Democrats detected a whiff of panic in the McCain camp , amid growing claims that Mrs Palin ’s personal history was not properly vetted before Mr McCain announced his pick on Friday .
I think it is more than a whiff of panic .
I bet , they did n’t even google her name before the announcement .
They could n’t have , because if they had they would have come up with what we have have come up with :
About the Independence Party of Alaska
About the Issues
About the Real Sarah Palin
About Who Is Sarah Palin
About Governor Palin and Creationism
and this , this and much more
I ’d say we vetted Governor Palin here and as far as I am concerned , this appointment is an insult to every American voter .
UPDATE : More international media comments in Open Season II
I do n’t claim to understand everything in this article - Chris is our financial guru – but it strikes me as a damn good explanation of what happened this week , and where things are heading .
From the Washington Post :
What we are witnessing may be the greatest destruction of financial wealth that the world has ever seen — paper losses measured in the trillions of dollars .
Corporate wealth .
Oil wealth .
Real estate wealth .
Bank wealth .
Private - equity wealth .
Hedge fund wealth .
Pension wealth .
It ’s a painful reminder that , when you strip away all the complexity and trappings from the magnificent new global infrastructure , finance is still a confidence game — and once the confidence goes , there ’s no telling when the selling will stop .

Twenty - five years ago this week , I became a United States citizen .
I will always remember Sept. 16 , 1983 , as one of the greatest days of my life .
Like other newcomers to this country , I came here for my shot at the American Dream .
Growing up in a small village in Austria , where if I worked hard I might be fortunate enough to follow in my father 's footsteps and become a policeman , I knew America was the Promised Land .
It was the place to go if you wanted your dreams to come true .
With hard work and determination , and because the American people were so generous and welcoming , I have succeeded beyond my wildest imagination .
I understand the immigrant yearning for freedom and opportunity .
But I also believe immigrants have a responsibility to America as well .
It is not enough to come here and take the best this nation has to offer without giving something back .
To truly succeed as an American citizen , you have to do more .
First , learn the English language and blend into the American culture , even as you honor and remain proud of your own heritage .
I do n't say learn the language out of any sense of etiquette or duty .
Do it so you can participate fully in the life of the nation and make the most of living in this country .
I came here in 1968 speaking only a little English .
To make it in business and Hollywood , I knew I had to take English lessons , speech lessons , accent - removal lessons — anything to improve my chances of success .
And I happily did it all .
Second , participate in the political process .
In Austria , I was surrounded by countries like Hungary , Czechoslovakia , and Yugoslavia where citizens did not have the right to vote .
So I have always been keenly aware that this right should not be taken for granted .
But too many Americans do .
Democracy is not a spectator sport .
To keep it strong and to effect real change , you have to be involved .
Learn about some of the sacrifices Americans have made over the years to build and preserve the greatest democracy in history .
Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died defending freedom .
If you visit just one Civil War battlefield or learn about World War II , it 's hard to take for granted the right to vote .
Finally , give something back .
Many immigrants come from cultures where service is not stressed .
I was no different .
In fact , it was not until I met my wife , Maria , and her parents , Sargent and Eunice Kennedy Shriver , that I discovered the true value of service .
They started so many programs that helped millions of people , from Special Olympics to the Peace Corps , Job Corps , and Head Start .
Before I knew it , I was spending time with kids from the Special Olympics .
That made me feel so good , I was soon working in after - school programs to give kids safe choices when the bell rang at the end of the day .
I became chairman of the President 's Council on Fitness and Sports and traveled around the nation talking to students about staying healthy by exercising and eating right .
I had the ultimate opportunity to give something back to California when I was elected governor in 2003 .
To promote service around our state and nation , I created the first cabinet - level position for service and volunteering , calling on the next president and other governors to do the same .
There are so many great immigrants who have performed outstanding public service for this nation that I could fill this entire column with a list of their names .
Madeleine Albright and Henry Kissinger became great secretaries of state .
Andrew Grove built Intel into a high - tech powerhouse .
Max Frankel moved to America from Germany and went on to run the New York Times .
Albert Einstein also came here from Germany .
The list goes on and on .
These were immigrants who came here for the American Dream , but they were not looking for handouts .
They did not ask only what they could get from their new country .
They also asked what they could give to it .
Not everyone can become Albert Einstein , but as Martin Luther King Jr. said , " Anybody can be great , because anybody can serve . "
Pitch in a few hours every week at a soup kitchen , clean up a local park or riverbed , mentor a child , or coach a youth sports team .
Give something back , and not only will you lift up others , but you will lift yourself up , too .
When you do these things , you will learn what I learned when I became a citizen :
Once you 're in , other than being able to run for president , you have all the same rights as descendants of those who came here on the Mayflower .
There is no second - tier citizenship .
You are an American , period .
With hard work , learning English , and getting involved , there is no limit on what you can achieve .
Bush says understands frustration with financial meltdown Agence France - Presse
Published : Saturday September 27 , 2008
Print This Email This President George W. Bush said Saturday he understood Americans may not want to foot the bill for a proposed massive rescue for the shellshocked US financial system but argued it was necessary to save the country 's economy .
" Many Americans are anxious about their finances and their future , " Bush said in his weekly radio address .
" I know many of you listening this morning are frustrated with the situation .
" You make sacrifices every day to meet your mortgage payments and keep up with your bills .
When the government asks you to pay for mistakes on Wall Street , it does not seem fair .
And I understand that .
" And if it were possible to let every irresponsible firm on Wall Street fail without affecting you and your family , I would do it .
But that is not possible , " Bush said , warning : " The failure of the financial system would mean financial hardship for many of you . "
As lawmakers in Congress negotiated details of a final rescue plan amid turmoil on global markets , Bush argued that a collapsed financial sector would mean less credit , fewer new businesses and fewer jobs .
" And that would put our economy on the path toward a deep and painful recession , " he argued .
" The rescue effort we 're negotiating is not aimed at Wall Street -- it is aimed at your street . "
He said there was " now widespread agreement on the major principles " of a bailout package .
The plan was designed to " free up the flow of credit to consumers and businesses by reducing the risk posed by troubled assets " and would " ensure that taxpayers are protected , that failed executives do not receive a windfall from your tax dollars , and that there is a bipartisan board to oversee these efforts . "
The US president also said a 700 - billion - dollar pricetag estimate for the bailout was on the high side .
" The final cost of this plan will be far less than 700 billion dollars , " he said .
" Here 's why : as fear and uncertainty have gripped the market for mortgage - related assets , their price has dropped sharply .
Yet many of these assets still have significant underlying value , because the vast majority of people will eventually pay off their mortgages .
" In other words , many of the assets the government would buy are likely to go up in price over time .
This means that the government will be able to recoup much , if not all , of the original expenditure , " he said .
Following the food chain back to Iraq
The secret of great wealth with no obvious source is some forgotten crime , forgotten because it was done neatly .
- Balzac
The journalist 's rule says : follow the money .
This rule , however , is not really axiomatic but derivative , in that money , as even our vice president will tell you , is really a way of tracking energy .
We 'll follow the energy .
We learn as children that there is no free lunch , that you do n't get something from nothing , that what goes up must come down , and so on .
The scientific version of these verities is only slightly more complex .
As James Prescott Joule discovered in the nineteenth century , there is only so much energy .
You can change it from motion to heat , from heat to light , but there will never be more of it and there will never be less of it .
The conservation of energy is not an option , it is a fact .
This is the first law of thermodynamics .
Special as we humans are , we get no exemptions from the rules .
All animals eat plants or eat animals that eat plants .
This is the food chain , and pulling it is the unique ability of plants to turn sunlight into stored energy in the form of carbohydrates , the basic fuel of all animals .
Solar - powered photosynthesis is the only way to make this fuel .
There is no alternative to plant energy , just as there is no alternative to oxygen .
The results of taking away our plant energy may not be as sudden as cutting off oxygen , but they are as sure .
Scientists have a name for the total amount of plant mass created by Earth in a given year , the total budget for life .
They call it the planet 's " primary productivity . "
There have been two efforts to figure out how that productivity is spent , one by a group at Stanford University , the other an independent accounting by the biologist Stuart Pimm .
Both conclude that we humans , a single species among millions , consume about 40 percent of Earth 's primary productivity , 40 percent of all there is .
This simple number may explain why the current extinction rate is 1,000 times that which existed before human domination of the planet .
We 6 billion have simply stolen the food , the rich among us a lot more than others .
Energy cannot be created or canceled , but it can be concentrated .
This is the larger and profoundly explanatory context of a national - security memo George Kennan wrote in 1948 as the head of a State Department planning committee , ostensibly about Asian policy but really about how the United States was to deal with its newfound role as the dominant force on Earth .
" We have about 50 percent of the world 's wealth but only 6.3 percent of its population , " Kennan wrote .
" In this situation , we can not fail to be the object of envy and resentment .
Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity without positive detriment to our national security .
To do so , we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and day - dreaming ; and our attention will have to be concentrated everywhere on our immediate national objectives .
We need not deceive ourselves that we an afford today the luxury of altruism and world - benefaction . "
" The day is not to far off , " Kennan concluded , " when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts . "
If you follow the energy , eventually you will end up in a field somewhere .
Humans engage in a dizzying array of artifice and industry .
Nonetheless , more than two thirds of humanity 's cut of primary productivity results from agriculture , two thirds of which in turn consists of three plants : rice , wheat , and corn .
In the 10,000 years since humans domesticated these grains , their status has remained undiminished , most likely because they are able to store solar energy in uniquely dense , transportable bundles of carbohydrates .
They are to the plant world what a barrel of refined oil is to the hydrocarbon world .
Indeed , aside from hydrocarbons they are the most concentrated form of true wealth - sun energy - to be found on the planet .
As Kennan recognized , however , the maintenance of such a concentration of wealth often requires violent action .
Agriculture is a recent human experiment .
For most of human history , we lived by gathering or killing a broad variety of nature 's offerings .
Why humans might have traded this approach for the complexities of agriculture is an interesting and long - debated question , especially because the skeletal evidence clearly indicates that early farmers were more poorly nourished , more disease - ridden and deformed , than their hunter - gatherer contemporaries .
Farming did not improve most lives .
The evidence that best points to the answer , I think , lies in the difference between early agricultural villages and their pre-agricultural counterparts - the presence not just of grain but of granaries and , more tellingly , of just a few houses significantly larger and more ornate than all the others attached to those granaries .
Agriculture was not so much about food as it was about the accumulation of wealth .
It benefited some humans , and those people have been in charge ever since .
Domestication was also a radical change in the distribution of wealth within the plant world .
Plants can spend their solar income in several ways .
The dominant and prudent strategy is to allocate most of it to building roots , stem , bark - a conservative portfolio of investments that allows the plant to better gather energy and survive the downturn years .
Further , by living in diverse stands ( a given chunk of native prairie contains maybe 200 species of plants ) , these perennials provide services for one another , such as retaining water , protecting one another from wind , and fixing free nitrogen from the air to use as fertilizer .
Diversity allows a system to " sponsor its own fertility , " to use visionary agronomist Wes Jackson 's phrase .
This is the plant world 's norm .
There is a very narrow group of annuals , however , that grow in patches of a single species and store almost all of their income as seed , a tight bundle of carbohydrates easily exploited by seed eaters such as ourselves .
Under normal circumstances , this eggs - in - one - basket strategy is a dumb idea for a plant .
But not during catastrophes such as floods , fires , and volcanic eruptions .
Such catastrophes strip established plant communities and create opportunities for wind - scattered entrepreneurial seed bearers .
It is no accident that no matter where agriculture sprouted on the globe , it always happened near rivers .
You might assume , as many have , that this is because the plants needed the water or nutrients .
Mostly this is not true .
They needed the power of flooding , which scoured landscapes and stripped out competitors .
Nor is it an accident , I think , that agriculture arose independently and simultaneously around the globe just as the last ice age ended , a time of enormous upheaval when glacial melt let loose sea-size lakes to create tidal waves of erosion .
It was a time of catastrophe .
Corn , rice , and wheat are especially adapted to catastrophe .
It is their niche .
In the natural scheme of things , a catastrophe would create a blank slate , bare soil , that was good for them .
Then , under normal circumstances , succession would quickly close that niche .
The annuals would colonize .
Their roots would stabilize the soil , accumulate organic matter , provide cover .
Eventually the catastrophic niche would close .
Farming is the process of ripping that niche open again and again .
It is an annual artificial catastrophe , and it requires the equivalent of three or four tons of TNT per acre for a modem American farm .
Iowa 's fields require the energy of 4,000 Nagasaki bombs every year .
Iowa is almost all fields now .
Little prairie remains , and if you can find what Iowans call a " postage stamp " remnant of some , it most likely will abut a cornfield .
This allows an observation .
Walk from the prairie to the field , and you probably will step down about six feet , as if the land had been stolen from beneath you .
Settlers ' accounts of the prairie conquest mention a sound , a series of pops , like pistol shots , the sound of stout grass roots breaking before a moldboard plow .
A robbery was in progress .
When we say the soil is rich , it is not a metaphor .
It is as rich in energy as an oil well .
A prairie converts that energy to flowers and roots and stems , which in turn pass back into the ground as dead organic matter .
The layers of topsoil build up into a rich repository of energy , a bank .
A farm field appropriates that energy , puts it into seeds we can eat .
Much of the energy moves from the earth to the rings of fat around our necks and waists .
And much of the energy is simply wasted , a trail of dollars billowing from the burglar 's satchel .
I 've already mentioned that we humans take 40 percent of the globe 's primary productivity every year .
You might have assumed we and our livestock eat our way through that volume , but this is not the case .
Part of that total - almost a third of it - is the potential plant mass lost when forests are cleared for farming or when tropical rain forests are cut for grazing or when plows destroy the deep mat of prairie roots that held the whole business together , triggering erosion .
The Dust Bowl was no accident of nature .
A functioning grassland prairie produces more biomass each year than does even the most technologically advanced wheat field .
The problem is , it 's mostly a form of grass and grass roots that humans can't eat .
So we replace the prairie with our own preferred grass , wheat .
Never mind that we feed most of our grain to livestock , and that livestock is perfectly content to eat native grass .
And never mind that there likely were more bison produced naturally on the Great Plains before farming than all of beef farming raises in the same area today .
Our ancestors found it preferable to pluck the energy from the ground and when it ran out move on .
Today we do the same , only now when the vault is empty we fill it again with new energy in the form of oil - rich fertilizers .
Oil is annual primary productivity stored as hydrocarbons , a trust fund of sorts , built up over many thousands of years .
On average , it takes 5.5 gallons of fossil energy to restore a year 's worth of lost fertility to an acre of eroded land - in 1997 we burned through more than 400 years ' worth of ancient fossilized productivity , most of it from someplace else .
Even as the earth beneath Iowa shrinks , it is being globalized .
Six thousand years before sodbusters broke up Iowa , their Caucasian blood ancestors broke up the Hungarian plain , an area just northwest of the Caucasus Mountains .
Archaeologists call this tribe the LBK , short for linearbandkeramik , the German word that describes the distinctive pottery remnants that mark their occupation of Europe .
Anthropologists call them the wheat - beef people , a name that better connects those ancients along the Danube to my fellow Montanans on the Upper Missouri River .
These proto-Europeans had a full set of domesticated plants and animals , but wheat and beef dominated .
All the domesticates came from an area along what is now the Iraq - Syria - Turkey border at the edges of the Zagros Mountains .
This is the center of domestication for the Western world 's main crops and livestock , ground zero of catastrophic agriculture .
Two other types of catastrophic agriculture evolved at roughly the same time , one centered on rice in what is now China and India and one centered on corn and potatoes in Central and South America .
Rice , though , is tropical and its expansion depends on water , so it developed only in floodplains , estuaries , and swamps .
Corn agriculture was every bit as voracious as wheat ; the Aztecs could be as brutal and imperialistic as Romans or Brits , but the corn cultures collapsed with the onslaught of Spanish conquest .
Corn itself simply joined the wheat - beef people 's coalition .
Wheat was the empire builder ; its bare botanical facts dictated the motion and violence that we know as imperialism .
The wheat - beef people swept across the western European plains in less than 300 years , a conquest some archaeologists refer to as a " blitzkrieg . "
A different race of humans , the Cro-Magnons - hunter - gatherers , not farmers - lived on those plains at the time .
Their cave art at places such as Lascaux testifies to their sophistication and profound connection to wildlife .
They probably did most of their hunting and gathering in uplands and river bottoms , places the wheat farmers did n't need , suggesting the possibility of coexistence .
That 's not what happened , however .
Both genetic and linguistic evidence say that the farmers killed the hunters .
The Basque people are probably the lone remnant descendants of Cro-Magnons , the only trace .
Hunter - gatherer archaeological sites of the period contain spear points that originally belonged to the farmers , and we can guess they were n't trade goods .
One group of anthropologists concludes , " The evidence from the western extension of the LBK leaves little room for any other conclusion but that LBK - Mesolithic interactions were at best chilly and at worst hostile . "
The world 's surviving Blackfeet , Assiniboine Sioux , Inca , and Maori probably have the best idea of the nature of these interactions .
Wheat is temperate and prefers plowed - up grasslands .
The globe has a limited stock of temperate grasslands , just as it has a limited stock of all other biomes .
On average , about 10 percent of all other biomes remain in something like their native state today .
Only 1 percent of temperate grasslands remains undestroyed .
Wheat takes what it needs .
The supply of temperate grasslands lies in what are today the United States , Canada , the South American pampas , New Zealand , Australia , South Africa , Europe , and the Asiatic extension of the European plain into the sub-Siberian steppes .
This area largely describes the First World , the developed world .
Temperate grasslands make up not only the habitat of wheat and beef but also the globe 's islands of Caucasians , of European surnames and languages .
In 2000 the countries of the temperate grasslands , the neo-Europes , accounted for about 80 percent of all wheat exports in the world , and about 86 percent of all corn .
That is to say , the neo-Europes drive the world 's agriculture .
The dominance does not stop with grain .
These countries , plus the mothership - Europe - accounted for three fourths of all agricultural exports of all crops in the world in 1999 .
Plato wrote of his country 's farmlands :
What now remains of the formerly rich land is like the skeleton of a sick man .
Formerly , many of the mountains were arable .
The plains that were full of rich soil are now marshes .
Hills that were once covered with forests and produced abundant pasture now produce only food for bees .
Once the land was enriched by yearly rains , which were not lost , as they are now , by flowing from the bare land into the sea .
The soil was deep , it absorbed and kept the water in loamy soil , and the water that soaked into the hills fed springs and running streams everywhere .
Now the abandoned shrines at spots where formerly there were springs attest that our description of the land is true .
Plato 's lament is rooted in wheat agriculture , which depleted his country 's soil and subsequently caused the series of declines that pushed centers of civilization to Rome , Turkey , and western Europe .
By the fifth century , though , wheat 's strategy of depleting and moving on ran up against the Atlantic Ocean .
Fenced - in wheat agriculture is like rice agriculture .
It balances its equations with famine .
In the millennium between 500 and 1500 , Britain suffered a major " corrective " famine about every ten years ; there were seventy - five in France during the same period .
The incidence , however , dropped sharply when colonization brought an influx of new food to Europe .
The new lands had an even greater effect on the colonists themselves .
Thomas Jefferson , after enduring a lecture on the rustic nature by his hosts at a dinner party in Paris , pointed out that all of the Americans present were a good head taller than all of the French .
Indeed , colonists in all of the neo-Europes enjoyed greater stature and longevity , as well as a lower infant - mortality rate - all indicators of the better nutrition afforded by the onetime spend down of the accumulated capital of virgin soil .
The precolonial famines of Europe raised the question :
What would happen when the planet 's supply of arable land ran out ?
We have a clear answer .
In about 1960 expansion hit , its limits and the supply of unfarmed , arable lands came to an end .
There was nothing left to plow .
What happened was grain yields tripled .
The accepted term for this strange turn of events is the green revolution , though it would be more properly labeled the amber revolution , because it applied exclusively to grain - wheat , rice , and corn .
Plant breeders tinkered with the architecture of these three grains so that they could be hypercharged with irrigation water and chemical fertilizers , especially nitrogen .
This innovation meshed nicely with the increased " efficiency " of the industrialized factory - farm system .
With the possible exception of the domestication of wheat , the green revolution is the worst thing that has ever happened to the planet .
For openers , it disrupted long - standing patterns of rural life worldwide , moving a lot of no -longer - needed people off the land and into the world 's most severe poverty .
The experience in population control in the developing world is by now clear :
It is not that people make more people so much as it is that they make more poor people .
In the forty - year period beginning about 1960 , the world 's population doubled , adding virtually the entire increase of 3 billion to the world 's poorest classes , the most fecund classes .
The way in which the green revolution raised that grain contributed hugely to the population boom , and it is the weight of the population that leaves humanity in its present untenable position .
Discussion of these , the most poor , however , is largely irrelevant to the American situation .
We say we have poor people here , but almost no one in this country lives on less than one dollar a day , the global benchmark for poverty .
It marks off a class of about 1.3 billion people , the hard core of the larger group of 2 billion chronically malnourished people - that is , one third of humanity .
We may forget about them , as most Americans do .
More relevant here are the methods of the green revolution , which added orders of magnitude to the devastation .
By mining the iron for tractors , drilling the new oil to fuel them and to make nitrogen fertilizers , and by taking the water that rain and rivers had meant for other lands , farming had extended its boundaries , its dominion , to lands that were not farmable .
At the same time , it extended its boundaries across time , tapping fossil energy , stripping past assets .
The common assumption these days is that we muster our weapons to secure oil , not food .
There 's a little joke in this .
Ever since we ran out of arable land , food is oil .
Every single calorie we eat is backed by at least a calorie of oil , more like ten .
In 1940 the average farm in the United States produced 2.3 calories of food energy for every calorie of fossil energy it used .
By 1974 ( the last year in which anyone looked closely at this issue ) , that ratio was 1:1 .
And this understates the problem , because at the same time that there is more oil in our food there is less oil in our oil .
A couple of generations ago we spent a lot less energy drilling , pumping , and distributing than we do now .
In the 1940s we got about 100 barrels of oil back for every barrel of oil we spent getting it .
Today each barrel invested in the process returns only ten , a calculation that no doubt fails to include the fuel burned by the Hummers and Blackhawks we use to maintain access to the oil in Iraq .
David Pimentel , an expert on food and energy at Cornell University , has estimated that if all of the world ate the way the United States eats , humanity would exhaust all known global fossil - fuel reserves in just over seven years .
Pimentel has his detractors .
Some have accused him of being off on other calculations by as much as 30 percent .
Fine .
Make it ten years .
Fertilizer makes a pretty fine bomb right off the shelf , a chemistry lesson Timothy McVeigh taught at Oklahoma City 's Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in 1995 - not a small matter , in that the green revolution has made nitrogen fertilizers ubiquitous in some of the more violent and desperate corners of the world .
Still , there is more to contemplate in nitrogen 's less sensational chemistry .
The chemophobia of modern times excludes fear of the simple elements of chemistry 's periodic table .
We circulate petitions , hold hearings , launch websites , and buy and sell legislators in regard to polysyllabic organic compounds - polychlorinated biphenyls , polyvinyls , DDT , 2 - 4d , that sort of thing - not simple carbon or nitrogen .
Not that agriculture 's use of the more ornate chemistry is benign - an infant born in a rural , wheat - producing county in the United States has about twice the chance of suffering birth defects as one born in a rural place that does n't produce wheat , an effect researchers blame on chlorophenoxy herbicides .
Focusing on pesticide pollution , though , misses , the worst of the pollutants .
Forget the polysyllabic organics .
It is nitrogen - the wellspring of fertility relied upon by every Eden - obsessed backyard gardener and suburban groundskeeper - that we should fear most .
Those who model our planet as an organism do so on the basis that the earth appears to breathe - it thrives by converting a short list of basic elements from one compound into the next , just as our own bodies cycle oxygen into carbon dioxide and plants cycle carbon dioxide into oxygen .
In fact , two of the planet 's most fundamental humors are oxygen and carbon dioxide .
Another is nitrogen .
Nitrogen can be released from its " fixed " state as a solid in the soil by natural processes that allow it to circulate freely in the atmosphere .
This also can be done artificially .
Indeed .
humans now contribute more nitrogen to the nitrogen cycle than the planet itself does .
That is , humans have doubled the amount of nitrogen in play .
This has led to an imbalance .
It is easier to create nitrogen fertilizer than it is to apply it evenly to fields .
When farmers dump nitrogen on a crop , much is wasted .
It runs into the water and soil , where it either reacts chemically with its surroundings to form new compounds or flows off to fertilize something else , somewhere else .
That chemical reaction , called acidification , is noxious and contributes significantly to acid rain .
One of the compounds produced by acidification is nitrous oxide , which aggravates the greenhouse effect .
Green growing things normally offset global warming by sucking up carbon dioxide , but nitrogen on farm fields plus methane from decomposing vegetation make every farmed acre , like every acre of Los Angeles freeway , a net contributor to global warming .
Fertilization is equally worrisome .
Rainfall and irrigation water inevitably washes the nitrogen from fields to creeks and streams , which flows into rivers , which floods into the ocean .
This explains why the Mississippi river , which drains the nation 's Corn Belt , is an environmental catastrophe .
The nitrogen fertilizes artificially large blooms of algae that in growing suck all the oxygen from the water , a condition biologists call anoxia , which means " oxygen - depleted . "
Here there 's no need to calculate long - term effects , because life in such places has no long term : everything dies immediately .
The Mississippi River 's heavily fertilized effluvia has created a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico the size of New Jersey .
America 's biggest crop , grain corn , is completely unpalatable .
It is raw material for an industry that manufactures food substitutes .
Likewise , you can't eat unprocessed wheat .
You certainly can't eat hay .
You can eat unprocessed soybeans , but mostly we do n't .
These four crops cover 82 percent of American cropland .
Agriculture in this country is not about food ; it 's about commodities that require the outlay of still more energy to become food .
About two thirds of U.S. grain corn is labeled " processed , " meaning it is milled and otherwise refined for food or industrial uses .
More than 45 percent of that becomes sugar , especially high - fructose corn sweeteners , the key stone ingredient in three quarters of all processed foods , especially soft drinks , the food of America 's poor and working classes .
It is not a coincidence that the American pandemic of obesity tracks rather nicely with the fivefold increase in corn-syrup production since Archer Daniels Midland developed a high - fructose version of the stuff in the early seventies .
Nor is it a coincidence that the plague selects the poor , who eat the most processed food .
It began with the industrialization of Victorian England .
The empire was then flush with sugar from plantations in the colonies .
Meantime the cities were flush with factory workers .
There was no good way to feed them .
And thus was born the afternoon tea break , the tea consisting primarily of warm water and sugar .
If the workers were well off , they could also afford bread with heavily sugared jam - sugar - powered industrialization .
There was a 500 percent increase in per capita sugar consumption in Britain between 1860 and 1890 , around the time when the life expectancy of a male factory worker was seventeen years .
By the end of the century the average Brit was getting about one sixth of his total nutrition from sugar , exactly the same percentage Americans get today - double what nutritionists recommend .
There is another energy matter to consider here , though .
The grinding , milling , wetting , drying , and baking of a breakfast cereal requires about four calories of energy for every calorie of food energy it produces .
A two - pound bag of breakfast cereal burns the energy of a half - gallon of gasoline in its making .
All together the food - processing industry in the United States uses about ten calories of fossil - fuel energy for every calorie of food energy it produces .
That number does not include the fuel used in transporting the food from the factory to a store near you , or the fuel used by millions of people driving to thousands of super discount stores on the edge of town , where the land is cheap .
It appears , however , that the corn cycle is about to come full circle .
If a bipartisan coalition of farm - state lawmakers has their way - and it appears they will - we will soon buy gasoline containing twice as much fuel alcohol as it does now .
Fuel alcohol already ranks second as a use for processed corn in the United States , just behind corn sweeteners .
According to one set of calculations , we spend more calories of fossil - fuel energy making ethanol than we gain from it .
The Department of Agriculture says the ratio is closer to a gallon and a quart of ethanol for every gallon of fossil fuel we invest .
The USDA calls this a bargain , because gasohol is a " clean fuel . "
This claim to cleanness is in dispute at the tailpipe level , and it certainly ignores the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico , pesticide pollution , and the haze of global gases gathering over every farm field .
Nor does this claim cover clean conscience ; some still might be unsettled knowing that our SUVs ' demands for fuel compete with the poor 's demand for grain .
Green eaters , especially vegetarians , advocate eating low on the food chain , a simple matter of energy flow .
Eating a carrot gives the diner all that carrot 's energy , but feeding carrots to a chicken , then eating the chicken , reduces the energy by a factor of ten .
The chicken wastes some energy , stores some as feathers , bones , and other inedibles , and uses most of it just to live long enough to be eaten .
As a rough rule of thumb , that factor of ten applies to each level up the food chain , which is why some fish , such as tuna , can be a horror in all of this .
Tuna is a secondary predator , meaning it not only does n't eat plants but eats other fish that themselves eat other fish , adding a zero to the multiplier each notch up , easily a hundred times , more like a thousand times less efficient than eating a plant .
This is fine as far as it goes , but the vegetarian 's case can break down on some details .
On the moral issues , vegetarians claim their habits are kinder to animals , though it is difficult to see how wiping out 99 percent of wildlife 's habitat , as farming has done in Iowa , is a kindness .
In rural Michigan , for example , the potato farmers have a peculiar tactic for dealing with the predations of whitetail deer .
They gut - shoot them with small - bore rifles , in hopes the deer will limp off to the woods and die where they wo n't stink up the potato fields .
Animal rights aside , vegetarians can lose the edge in the energy argument by eating processed food , with its ten calories of fossil energy for every calorie of food energy produced .
The question , then , is : Does eating processed food such as soy burger or soy milk cancel the energy benefits of vegetarianism , which is to say , can I eat my lamb chops in peace ?
Maybe .
If I 've done my due diligence , I will have found out that the particular lamb I am eating was both local and grass - fed , two factors that of course greatly reduce the embedded energy in a meal .
I know of ranches here in Montana , for instance , where sheep eat native grass under closely controlled circumstances - no farming , no plows , no corn , no nitrogen .
Assets have not been stripped .
I can't eat the grass directly .
This can go on .
There are little niches like this in the system .
Each person 's individual charge is to find such niches .
Chances are , though , any meat eater will come out on the short end of this argument , especially in the United States .
Take the case of beef .
Cattle are grazers , so in theory could live like the grass - fed lamb .
Some cattle cultures - those of South America and Mexico , for example - have perfected wonderful cuisines based on grass - fed beef .
This is not our habit in the United States , and it is simply a matter of habit .
Eighty percent of the grain the United States produces goes to livestock .
Seventy - eight percent of all of our beef comes from feed lots , where the cattle eat grain , mostly corn and wheat .
So do most of our hogs and chickens .
The cattle spend their adult lives packed shoulder to shoulder in a space not much bigger than their bodies , up to their knees in shit , being stuffed with grain and a constant stream of antibiotics to prevent the disease this sort of confinement invariably engenders .
The manure is rich in nitrogen and once provided a farm 's fertilizer .
The feed - lots , however , are now far removed from farm fields , so it is simply not " efficient " to haul it to cornfields .
It is waste .
It exhales methane , a global - warming gas .
It pollutes streams .
It takes thirty - five calories of fossil fuel to make a calorie of beef this way ; sixty - eight to make one calorie of pork .
Still , these livestock do something we can't .
They convert grain 's carbohydrates to high - quality protein .
All well and good , except that per capita protein production in the United States is about double what an average adult needs per day .
Excess cannot be stored as protein in the human body but is simply converted to fat .
This is the end result of a factory - farm system that appears as a living , continental - scale monument to Rube Goldberg , a black - mass remake of the loaves - and - fishes miracle .
Prairie 's productivity is lost for grain , grain 's productivity is lost in livestock , livestock 's protein is lost to human fat - all federally subsidized for about $ 15 billion a year , two thirds of which goes directly to only two crops , corn and wheat .
This explains why the energy expert David Pimentel is so worried that the rest of the world will adopt America 's methods .
He should be , because the rest of the world is .
Mexico now feeds 45 percent of its grain to livestock , up from 5 percent in 1960 .
Egypt went from 3 percent to 31 percent in the same period , and China , with a sixth of the world 's population , has gone from 8 percent to 26 percent .
All of these places have poor people who could use the grain , but they can't afford it .
I live among elk and have learned to respect them .
One moonlit night during the dead of last winter , I looked out my bedroom window to see about twenty of them grazing a plot of grass the size of a living room .
Just that small patch among acres of other species of native prairie grass .
Why that species and only that species of grass that night in the worst of winter when the threat to their survival was the greatest ?
What magic nutrient did this species alone contain ?
What does a wild animal know that we do n't ?
I think we need this knowledge .
Food is politics .
That being the case , I voted twice in 2002 .
The day after Election Day , in a truly dismal mood , I climbed the mountain behind my house and found a small herd of elk grazing native grasses in the morning sunlight .
My respect for these creatures over the years has become great enough that on that morning I did not hesitate but went straight to my job , which was to rack a shell and drop one cow elk , my household 's annual protein supply .
I voted with my weapon of choice - an act not all that uncommon in this world , largely , I think , as a result of the way we grow food .
I can see why it is catching on .
Such a vote has a certain satisfying heft and finality about it .
My particular bit of violence , though , is more satisfying , I think , than the rest of the globe 's ordinary political mayhem .
I used a rifle to opt out of an insane system .
I killed , but then so did you when you bought that package of burger , even when you bought that package of tofu burger .
I killed , then the rest of those elk went on , as did the grasses , the birds , the trees , the coyotes , mountain lions , and bugs , the fundamental productivity of an intact natural system , all of it went on .
