Mr Krstic criticised software vendors ' efforts to secure their products at the opening session of the annual AusCERT computer security conference on the Gold Coast yesterday , where he was keynote speaker .
The 21 - year - old has taken leave from his undergraduate studies at Harvard to head security for One Laptop Per Child , a program founded by Nicholas Negroponte of the renowned Media Lab at MIT in Boston .
Mr Krstic says the computing industry relies on utterly obsolete concepts and assumptions that first surfaced in the early 1970s .
" The way modern desktop security works is by relying on the user to make informed and sensible choices on things they do n't understand , " Mr Krstic told conference delegates .
He said the idea that software executed by a computer user should operate with the same level of privilege that the user has - an approach that has been ingrained in operating system architecture since 1971 - was proof the approach is deeply flawed .
" There 's a bunch of programs that ship with the default install of all major operating systems , including Linux and Mac OS and Windows , that can do things like format your hard drive , erase all your documents , corrupt them randomly , send them to Russia ( or ) pretend to be you , " he said .
" The program is Minesweeper .
There is absolutely nothing in place that would make it so that Minesweeper cannot do any of ( those ) things . . .
That tells me that something is pretty badly broken . "
Operating system interfaces were also a problem , Mr Krstic said .
Computer users were constantly bombarded with complicated dialogue and decision boxes they had no hope of understanding .
" Why do we have these idiotic dialogues that are n't protecting anyone ? " he said .
Mr Krstic cited early consumer experiences with personal firewall products as an example of the problems created when users have the power to change things they do n't understand .
" A dialogue would pop up and say ' Hi , we 've intercepted this packet with this TCP sequence number and these flags set , and SYN and FIN are both on , and here are the destination ports and the source ports and here is a hex dump of the packet .
Allow or deny ?
What do you think ? '.
Who is that protecting ?
It 's protecting me , but I do n't need that kind of protection in the first place . "
During an interview after his keynote speech , Mr Krstic said that security was a high priority .
It would be " absolutely tragic if the project failed because all the machines locked up or stopped working because the security was compromised .
That 's probably the No. 1 nightmare scenario that I can come up with , " he said .
Mr Krstic will use several approaches to secure the OLPC laptop , but says his approach will not be revolutionary , merely a mix of proven ideas .
" We 're trying to take a bunch of technologies that we 've known about . . . and combine them in a meaningful way to provide a lot of the security guarantees that we 're after , " he said .
" It has n't been about trying to invent brand - new things , nearly as much as it's been trying to look at the past and pick out some of the good solutions that have been out there but not used and put them together in the right way . "
The project will begin distributing the laptops , which currently cost $ US175 ( $ A213 ) to produce , in September .
The project anticipates 2 to 5 million children will be using the laptops by the end of the year .

INTRODUCTION
Security is both a feeling and a reality .
And they ’re not the same .
The reality of security is mathematical , based on the probability of different risks and the effectiveness of different countermeasures .
We can calculate how secure your home is from burglary , based on such factors as the crime rate in the neighborhood you live in and your door - locking habits .
We can calculate how likely it is for you to be murdered , either on the streets by a stranger or in your home by a family member .
Or how likely you are to be the victim of identity theft .
Given a large enough set of statistics on criminal acts , it ’s not even hard ; insurance companies do it all the time .
We can also calculate how much more secure a burglar alarm will make your home , or how well a credit freeze will protect you from identity theft .
Again , given enough data , it ’s easy .
But security is also a feeling , based not on probabilities and mathematical calculations , but on your psychological reactions to both risks and countermeasures .
You might feel terribly afraid of terrorism , or you might feel like it ’s not something worth worrying about .
You might feel safer when you see people taking their shoes off at airport metal detectors , or you might not .
You might feel that you ’re at high risk of burglary , medium risk of murder , and low risk of identity theft .
And your neighbor , in the exact same situation , might feel that he’s at high risk of identity theft , medium risk of burglary , and low risk of murder .
Or , more generally , you can be secure even though you do n’t feel secure .
And you can feel secure even though you ’re not .
The feeling and reality of security are certainly related to each other , but they ’re just as certainly not the same as each other .
We ’d probably be better off if we had two different words for them .
This essay is my initial attempt to explore the feeling of security : where it comes from , how it works , and why it diverges from the reality of security .
Four fields of research — two very closely related — can help illuminate this issue .
The first is behavioral economics , sometimes called behavioral finance .
Behavioral economics looks at human biases — emotional , social , and cognitive — and how they affect economic decisions .
The second is the psychology of decision - making , and more specifically bounded rationality , which examines how we make decisions .
Neither is directly related to security , but both look at the concept of risk : behavioral economics more in relation to economic risk , and the psychology of decision - making more generally in terms of security risks .
But both fields go a long way to explain the divergence between the feeling and the reality of security and , more importantly , where that divergence comes from .
There is also direct research into the psychology of risk .
Psychologists have studied risk perception , trying to figure out when we exaggerate risks and when we downplay them .
A fourth relevant field of research is neuroscience .
The psychology of security is intimately tied to how we think : both intellectually and emotionally .
Over the millennia , our brains have developed complex mechanisms to deal with threats .
Understanding how our brains work , and how they fail , is critical to understanding the feeling of security .
These fields have a lot to teach practitioners of security , whether they ’re designers of computer security products or implementers of national security policy .
And if this paper seems haphazard , it ’s because I am just starting to scratch the surface of the enormous body of research that ’s out there .
In some ways I feel like a magpie , and that much of this essay is me saying : “ Look at this !
Is n’t it fascinating ?
Now look at this other thing !
Is n’t that amazing , too ? ”
Somewhere amidst all of this , there are threads that tie it together , lessons we can learn ( other than “ people are weird ” ) , and ways we can design security systems that take the feeling of security into account rather than ignoring it .
THE TRADE - OFF OF SECURITY
Security is a trade - off .
This is something I have written about extensively , and is a notion critical to understanding the psychology of security .
There ’s no such thing as absolute security , and any gain in security always involves some sort of trade - off .
Security costs money , but it also costs in time , convenience , capabilities , liberties , and so on .
Whether it ’s trading some additional home security against the inconvenience of having to carry a key around in your pocket and stick it into a door every time you want to get into your house , or trading additional security from a particular kind of airplane terrorism against the time and expense of searching every passenger , all security is a trade - off .
I remember in the weeks after 9/11 , a reporter asked me : “ How can we prevent this from ever happening again ? ” “ That ’s easy , ” I said , “ simply ground all the aircraft . ”
It ’s such a far - fetched trade - off that we as a society will never make it .
But in the hours after those terrorist attacks , it ’s exactly what we did .
When we did n’t know the magnitude of the attacks or the extent of the plot , grounding every airplane was a perfectly reasonable trade - off to make .
And even now , years later , I do n’t hear anyone second - guessing that decision .
It makes no sense to just look at security in terms of effectiveness .
“ Is this effective against the threat ? ” is the wrong question to ask .
You need to ask : “ Is it a good trade - off ? ” Bulletproof vests work well , and are very effective at stopping bullets .
But for most of us , living in lawful and relatively safe industrialized countries , wearing one is not a good trade - off .
The additional security is n’t worth it : is n’t worth the cost , discomfort , or unfashionableness .
Move to another part of the world , and you might make a different trade - off .
We make security trade - offs , large and small , every day .
We make them when we decide to lock our doors in the morning , when we choose our driving route , and when we decide whether we ’re going to pay for something via check , credit card , or cash .
They ’re often not the only factor in a decision , but they ’re a contributing factor .
And most of the time , we do n’t even realize it .
We make security trade - offs intuitively .
These intuitive choices are central to life on this planet .
Every living thing makes security trade - offs , mostly as a species — evolving this way instead of that way — but also as individuals .
Imagine a rabbit sitting in a field , eating clover .
Suddenly , he spies a fox .
He ’s going to make a security trade - off : should I stay or should I flee ?
The rabbits that are good at making these trade - offs are going to live to reproduce , while the rabbits that are bad at it are either going to get eaten or starve .
This means that , as a successful species on the planet , humans should be really good at making security trade - offs .
And yet , at the same time we seem hopelessly bad at it .
We get it wrong all the time .
We exaggerate some risks while minimizing others .
We exaggerate some costs while minimizing others .
Even simple trade - offs we get wrong , wrong , wrong — again and again .
A Vulcan studying human security behavior would call us completely illogical .
The truth is that we ’re not hopelessly bad at making security trade - offs .
We are very well adapted to dealing with the security environment endemic to hominids living in small family groups on the highland plains of East Africa .
It ’s just that the environment of New York in 2007 is different from Kenya circa 100,000 BC .
And so our feeling of security diverges from the reality of security , and we get things wrong .
There are several specific aspects of the security trade - off that can go wrong .
For example :
1 . The severity of the risk .
2 . The probability of the risk .
3 . The magnitude of the costs .
4 . How effective the countermeasure is at mitigating the risk .
5 . How well disparate risks and costs can be compared .
The more your perception diverges from reality in any of these five aspects , the more your perceived trade - off wo n’t match the actual trade - off .
If you think that the risk is greater than it really is , you ’re going to overspend on mitigating that risk .
If you think the risk is real but only affects other people — for whatever reason — you ’re going to underspend .
If you overestimate the costs of a countermeasure , you ’re less likely to apply it when you should , and if you overestimate how effective a countermeasure is , you ’re more likely to apply it when you should n’t .
If you incorrectly evaluate the trade - off , you wo n’t accurately balance the costs and benefits .
A lot of this can be chalked up to simple ignorance .
If you think the murder rate in your town is one - tenth of what it really is , for example , then you ’re going to make bad security trade - offs .
But I ’m more interested in divergences between perception and reality that _can ’t_ be explained that easily .
Why is it that , even if someone knows that automobiles kill 40,000 people each year in the U.S. alone , and airplanes kill only hundreds worldwide , he is more afraid of airplanes than automobiles ?
Why is it that , when food poisoning kills 5,000 people every year and 9/11 terrorists killed 2,973 people in one non-repeated incident , we are spending tens of billions of dollars per year ( not even counting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ) on terrorism defense while the entire budget for the Food and Drug Administration in 2007 is only $ 1.9 billion ?
It ’s my contention that these irrational trade - offs can be explained by psychology .
That something inherent in how our brains work makes us more likely to be afraid of flying than of driving , and more likely to want to spend money , time , and other resources mitigating the risks of terrorism than those of food poisoning .
And moreover , that these seeming irrationalities have a good evolutionary reason for existing : they ’ve served our species well in the past .
Understanding what they are , why they exist , and why they ’re failing us now is critical to understanding how we make security decisions .
It ’s critical to understanding why , as a successful species on the planet , we make so many bad security trade - offs .
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM ABOUT RISK
Most of the time , when the perception of security does n’t match the reality of security , it ’s because the perception of the risk does n’t match the reality of the risk .
We worry about the wrong things : paying too much attention to minor risks and not enough attention to major ones .
We do n’t correctly assess the magnitude of different risks .
A lot of this can be chalked up to bad information or bad mathematics , but there are some general pathologies that come up over and over again .
In _Beyond Fear , _I listed five :
* People exaggerate spectacular but rare risks and downplay common risks .
* People have trouble estimating risks for anything not exactly like their normal situation .
* Personified risks are perceived to be greater than anonymous risks .
* People underestimate risks they willingly take and overestimate risks in situations they can’t control .
* Last , people overestimate risks that are being talked about and remain an object of public scrutiny . [ 1 ]
David Ropeik and George Gray have a longer list in their book _ Risk : A Practical Guide for Deciding What ’s Really Safe and What ’s Really Dangerous in the World Around You_ :
* Most people are more afraid of risks that are new than those they ’ve lived with for a while .
In the summer of 1999 , New Yorkers were extremely afraid of West Nile virus , a mosquito - borne infection that had never been seen in the United States .
By the summer of 2001 , though the virus continued to show up and make a few people sick , the fear had abated .
The risk was still there , but New Yorkers had lived with it for a while .
Their familiarity with it helped them see it differently .
* Most people are less afraid of risks that are natural than those that are human - made .
Many people are more afraid of radiation from nuclear waste , or cell phones , than they are of radiation from the sun , a far greater risk .
* Most people are less afraid of a risk they choose to take than of a risk imposed on them .
Smokers are less afraid of smoking than they are of asbestos and other indoor air pollution in their workplace , which is something over which they have little choice .
* Most people are less afraid of risks if the risk also confers some benefits they want .
People risk injury or death in an earthquake by living in San Francisco or Los Angeles because they like those areas , or they can find work there .
* Most people are more afraid of risks that can kill them in particularly awful ways , like being eaten by a shark , than they are of the risk of dying in less awful ways , like heart disease — the leading killer in America .
* Most people are less afraid of a risk they feel they have some control over , like driving , and more afraid of a risk they do n’t control , like flying , or sitting in the passenger seat while somebody else drives .
* Most people are less afraid of risks that come from places , people , corporations , or governments they trust , and more afraid if the risk comes from a source they do n’t trust .
Imagine being offered two glasses of clear liquid .
You have to drink one .
One comes from Oprah Winfrey .
The other comes from a chemical company .
Most people would choose Oprah ’s , even though they have no facts at all about what ’s in either glass .
* We are more afraid of risks that we are more aware of and less afraid of risks that we are less aware of .
In the fall of 2001 , awareness of terrorism was so high that fear was rampant , while fear of street crime and global climate change and other risks was low , not because those risks were gone , but because awareness was down .
* We are much more afraid of risks when uncertainty is high , and less afraid when we know more , which explains why we meet many new technologies with high initial concern .
* Adults are much more afraid of risks to their children than risks to themselves .
Most people are more afraid of asbestos in their kids ’ school than asbestos in their own workplace .
* You will generally be more afraid of a risk that could directly affect you than a risk that threatens others .
U.S. citizens were less afraid of terrorism before September 11 , 2001 , because up till then the Americans who had been the targets of terrorist attacks were almost always overseas .
But suddenly on September 11 , the risk became personal .
When that happens , fear goes up , even though the statistical reality of the risk may still be very low . [ 2 ]
Others make these and similar points , which are summarized in Table 1 . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
When you look over the list in Table 1 , the most remarkable thing is how reasonable so many of them seem .
This makes sense for two reasons .
One , our perceptions of risk are deeply ingrained in our brains , the result of millions of years of evolution .
And two , our perceptions of risk are generally pretty good , and are what have kept us alive and reproducing during those millions of years of evolution .
People exaggerate risks that are : People downplay risks that are :

Table 1 : Conventional Wisdom About People and Risk Perception
When our risk perceptions fail today , it ’s because of new situations that have occurred at a faster rate than evolution : situations that exist in the world of 2007 , but did n’t in the world of 100,000 BC .
Like a squirrel whose predator - evasion techniques fail when confronted with a car , or a passenger pigeon who finds that evolution prepared him to survive the hawk but not the shotgun , our innate capabilities to deal with risk can fail when confronted with such things as modern human society , technology , and the media .
And , even worse , they can be made to fail by others — politicians , marketers , and so on — who exploit our natural failures for their gain .
To understand all of this , we first need to understand the brain .
RISK AND THE BRAIN
The human brain is a fascinating organ , but an absolute mess .
Because it has evolved over millions of years , there are all sorts of processes jumbled together rather than logically organized .
Some of the processes are optimized for only certain kinds of situations , while others do n’t work as well as they could .
And there ’s some duplication of effort , and even some conflicting brain processes .
Assessing and reacting to risk is one of the most important things a living creature has to deal with , and there ’s a very primitive part of the brain that has that job .
It ’s the amygdala , and it sits right above the brainstem , in what ’s called the medial temporal lobe .
The amygdala is responsible for processing base emotions that come from sensory inputs , like anger , avoidance , defensiveness , and fear .
It ’s an old part of the brain , and seems to have originated in early fishes .
When an animal — lizard , bird , mammal , even you — sees , hears , or feels something that ’s a potential danger , the amygdala is what reacts immediately .
It ’s what causes adrenaline and other hormones to be pumped into your bloodstream , triggering the fight - or - flight response , causing increased heart rate and beat force , increased muscle tension , and sweaty palms .
This kind of thing works great if you ’re a lizard or a lion .
Fast reaction is what you ’re looking for ; the faster you can notice threats and either run away from them or fight back , the more likely you are to live to reproduce .
But the world is actually more complicated than that .
Some scary things are not really as risky as they seem , and others are better handled by staying in the scary situation to set up a more advantageous future response .
This means that there ’s an evolutionary advantage to being able to hold off the reflexive fight - or - flight response while you work out a more sophisticated analysis of the situation and your options for dealing with it .
We humans have a completely different pathway to deal with _analyzing_ risk .
It ’s the neocortex , a more advanced part of the brain that developed very recently , evolutionarily speaking , and only appears in mammals .
It ’s intelligent and analytic .
It can reason .
It can make more nuanced trade - offs .
It ’s also much slower .
So here ’s the first fundamental problem : we have two systems for reacting to risk — a primitive intuitive system and a more advanced analytic system — and they ’re operating in parallel .
And it ’s hard for the neocortex to contradict the amygdala .
In his book _Mind Wide Open , _ Steven Johnson relates an incident when he and his wife lived in an apartment and a large window blew in during a storm .
He was standing right beside it at the time and heard the whistling of the wind just before the window blew .
He was lucky — a foot to the side and he would have been dead — but the sound has never left him :
But ever since that June storm , a new fear has entered the
mix for me : the sound of wind whistling through a window .
I
know now that our window blew in because it had been
installed improperly ….
I am entirely convinced that the
window we have now is installed correctly , and I trust our
superintendent when he says that it is designed to withstand
hurricane - force winds .
In the five years since that June , we
have weathered dozens of storms that produced gusts
comparable to the one that blew it in , and the window has
performed flawlessly .
I know all these facts — and yet when the wind kicks up , and
I hear that whistling sound , I can feel my adrenaline levels
rise ….
Part of my brain — the part that feels most _me_ -
like , the part that has opinions about the world and decides
how to act on those opinions in a rational way — knows that
the windows are safe … .
But another part of my brain wants
to barricade myself in the bathroom all over again . [ 7 ]
There ’s a good reason evolution has wired our brains this way .
If you ’re a higher - order primate living in the jungle and you ’re attacked by a lion , it makes sense that you develop a lifelong fear of lions , or at least fear lions more than another animal you have n’t personally been attacked by .
From a risk / reward perspective , it ’s a good trade - off for the brain to make , and — if you think about it — it ’s really no different than your body developing antibodies against , say , chicken pox based on a single exposure .
In both cases , your body is saying : “ This happened once , and therefore it ’s likely to happen again .
And when it does , I ’ll be ready . ”
In a world where the threats are limited — where there are only a few diseases and predators that happen to affect the small patch of earth occupied by your particular tribe — it works .
Unfortunately , the brain ’s fear system does n’t scale the same way the body ’s immune system does .
While the body can develop antibodies for hundreds of diseases , and those antibodies can float around in the bloodstream waiting for a second attack by the same disease , it ’s harder for the brain to deal with a multitude of lifelong fears .
All this is about the amygdala .
The second fundamental problem is that because the analytic system in the neocortex is so new , it still has a lot of rough edges evolutionarily speaking .
Psychologist Daniel Gilbert has a great quotation that explains this :
The brain is a beautifully engineered get - out - of - the - way
machine that constantly scans the environment for things out
of whose way it should right now get .
That ’s what brains did
for several hundred million years — and then , just a few
million years ago , the mammalian brain learned a new trick : to
predict the timing and location of dangers before they
actually happened .
Our ability to duck that which is not yet coming is one of the
brain ’s most stunning innovations , and we would n’t have dental
floss or 401 ( k ) plans without it .
But this innovation is in
the early stages of development .
The application that allows
us to respond to visible baseballs is ancient and reliable ,
but the add - on utility that allows us to respond to threats
that loom in an unseen future is still in beta testing . [ 8 ]
A lot of what I write in the following sections are examples of these newer parts of the brain getting things wrong .
And it ’s not just risks .
People are not computers .
We do n’t evaluate security trade - offs mathematically , by examining the relative probabilities of different events .
Instead , we have shortcuts , rules of thumb , stereotypes , and biases — generally known as “ heuristics . ”
These heuristics affect how we think about risks , how we evaluate the probability of future events , how we consider costs , and how we make trade - offs .
We have ways of generating close - to - optimal answers quickly with limited cognitive capabilities .
Don Norman ’s wonderful essay , “ Being Analog , ” provides a great background for all this .
[ 9 ]
Daniel Kahneman , who won a Nobel Prize in Economics for some of this work , talks about humans having two separate cognitive systems : one that intuits and one that reasons :
The operations of System 1 are typically fast , automatic ,
effortless , associative , implicit ( not available to
introspection ) , and often emotionally charged ; they are also
governed by habit and therefore difficult to control or modify .
The operations of System 2 are slower , serial , effortful , more
likely to be consciously monitored and deliberately
controlled ; they are also relatively flexible and potentially
rule governed . [ 10 ]
When you read about the heuristics I describe below , you can find evolutionary reasons for why they exist .
And most of them are still very useful . [ 11 ]
The problem is that they can fail us , especially in the context of a modern society .
Our social and technological evolution has vastly outpaced our evolution as a species , and our brains are stuck with heuristics that are better suited to living in primitive and small family groups .
And when those heuristics fail , our feeling of security diverges from the reality of security .
RISK HEURISTICS
The first , and most common , area that can cause the feeling of security to diverge from the reality of security is the perception of risk .
Security is a trade - off , and if we get the severity of the risk wrong , we ’re going to get the trade - off wrong .
We can do this both ways , of course .
We can underestimate some risks , like the risk of automobile accidents .
Or we can overestimate some risks , like the risk of a stranger sneaking into our home at night and kidnapping our child .
How we get the risk wrong — when we overestimate and when we underestimate — is governed by a few specific brain heuristics .
Prospect Theory
Here ’s an experiment that illustrates a particular pair of heuristics . [ 12 ]
Subjects were divided into two groups .
One group was given the choice of these two alternatives :
* Alternative A : A sure gain of $ 500 .
* Alternative B : A 50 % chance of gaining $ 1,000 .
The other group was given the choice of :
* Alternative C : A sure loss of $ 500 .
* Alternative D : A 50 % chance of losing $ 1,000 .
These two trade - offs are n’t the same , but they ’re very similar .
And traditional economics predicts that the difference does n’t make a difference .
Traditional economics is based on something called “ utility theory , ” which predicts that people make trade - offs based on a straightforward calculation of relative gains and losses .
Alternatives A and B have the same expected utility : +$500 .
And alternatives C and D have the same expected utility : - $ 500 .
Utility theory predicts that people choose alternatives A and C with the same probability and alternatives B and D with the same probability .
Basically , some people prefer sure things and others prefer to take chances .
The fact that one is gains and the other is losses does n’t affect the mathematics , and therefore should n’t affect the results .
But experimental results contradict this .
When faced with a gain , most people ( 84 % ) chose Alternative A ( the sure gain ) of $ 500 over Alternative B ( the risky gain ) .
But when faced with a loss , most people ( 70 % ) chose Alternative D ( the risky loss ) over Alternative C ( the sure loss ) .
The authors of this study explained this difference by developing something called “ prospect theory . ”
Unlike utility theory , prospect theory recognizes that people have subjective values for gains and losses .
In fact , humans have evolved a pair of heuristics that they apply in these sorts of trade - offs .
The first is that a sure gain is better than a chance at a greater gain .
( “ A bird in the hand is better than two in the bush . ” )
And the second is that a sure loss is worse than a chance at a greater loss .
Of course , these are not rigid rules — given a choice between a sure $ 100 and a 50 % chance at $ 1,000,000 , only a fool would take the $ 100 — but all things being equal , they do affect how we make trade - offs .
Evolutionarily , presumably it is a better survival strategy to — all other things being equal , of course — accept small gains rather than risking them for larger ones , and risk larger losses rather than accepting smaller losses .
Lions chase young or wounded wildebeest because the investment needed to kill them is lower .
Mature and healthy prey would probably be more nutritious , but there ’s a risk of missing lunch entirely if it gets away .
And a small meal will tide the lion over until another day .
Getting through today is more important than the possibility of having food tomorrow .
Similarly , it is evolutionarily better to risk a larger loss than to accept a smaller loss .
Because animals tend to live on the razor ’s edge between starvation and reproduction , any loss of food — whether small or large — can be equally bad .
That is , both can result in death .
If that ’s true , the best option is to risk everything for the chance at no loss at all .
These two heuristics are so powerful that they can lead to logically inconsistent results .
Another experiment , the Asian disease problem , illustrates that . [ 13 ]
In this experiment , subjects were asked to imagine a disease outbreak that is expected to kill 600 people , and then to choose between two alternative treatment programs .
Then , the subjects were divided into two groups .
One group was asked to choose between these two programs for the 600 people :
* Program A : “ 200 people will be saved . ”
* Program B : “ There is a one - third probability that 600 people will be saved , and a two - thirds probability that no people will be saved . ”
The second group of subjects were asked to choose between these two programs :
* Program C : “ 400 people will die . ”
* Program D : “ There is a one - third probability that nobody will die , and a two - thirds probability that 600 people will die . ”
Like the previous experiment , programs A and B have the same expected utility : 200 people saved and 400 dead , A being a sure thing and B being a risk .
Same with Programs C and D .
But if you read the two pairs of choices carefully , you ’ll notice that — unlike the previous experiment — they are exactly the same .
A equals C , and B equals D. All that ’s different is that in the first pair they ’re presented in terms of a gain ( lives saved ) , while in the second pair they ’re presented in terms of a loss ( people dying ) .
Yet most people ( 72 % ) choose A over B , and most people ( 78 % ) choose D over C. People make very different trade - offs if something is presented as a gain than if something is presented as a loss .
Behavioral economists and psychologists call this a “ framing effect ” : peoples ’ choices are affected by how a trade - off is framed .
Frame the choice as a gain , and people will tend to be risk averse .
But frame the choice as a loss , and people will tend to be risk seeking .
We ’ll see other framing effects later on .
Another way of explaining these results is that people tend to attach a greater value to changes closer to their current state than they do to changes further away from their current state .
Go back to the first pair of trade - offs I discussed .
In the first one , a gain from $ 0 to $ 500 is worth more than a gain from $ 500 to $ 1,000 , so it does n’t make sense to risk the first $ 500 for an even chance at a second $ 500 .
Similarly , in the second trade - off , more value is lost from $ 0 to - $ 500 than from - $ 500 to - $ 1,000 , so it makes sense for someone to accept an even chance at losing $ 1,000 in an attempt to avoid losing $ 500 .
Because gains and losses closer to one ’s current state are worth more than gains and losses further away , people tend to be risk averse when it comes to gains , but risk seeking when it comes to losses .
Of course , our brains do n’t do the math .
Instead , we simply use the mental shortcut .
There are other effects of these heuristics as well .
People are not only risk averse when it comes to gains and risk seeking when it comes to losses ; people also value something more when it is considered as something that can be lost , as opposed to when it is considered as a potential gain .
Generally , the difference is a factor of 2 to 2.5 . [ 14 ]
This is called the “ endowment effect , ” and has been directly demonstrated in many experiments .
In one , [ 15 ] half of a group of subjects were given a mug .
Then , those who got a mug were asked the price at which they were willing to sell it , and those who did n’t get a mug were asked what price they were willing to offer for one .
Utility theory predicts that both prices will be about the same , but in fact , the median selling price was over twice the median offer .
In another experiment , [ 16 ] subjects were given either a pen or a mug with a college logo , both of roughly equal value .
( If you read enough of these studies , you ’ll quickly notice two things .
One , college students are the most common test subject .
And two , any necessary props are most commonly purchased from a college bookstore . )
Then the subjects were offered the opportunity to exchange the item they received for the other .
If the subjects ’ preferences had nothing to do with the item they received , the fraction of subjects keeping a mug should equal the fraction of subjects exchanging a pen for a mug , and the fraction of subjects keeping a pen should equal the fraction of subjects exchanging a mug for a pen .
In fact , most people kept the item they received ; only 22 % of subjects traded .
And , in general , most people will reject an even - chance gamble ( 50 % of winning , and 50 % of losing ) unless the possible win is at least twice the size of the possible loss . [ 17 ]
What does prospect theory mean for security trade - offs ?
While I have n’t found any research that explicitly examines if people make security trade - offs in the same way they make economic trade - offs , it seems reasonable to me that they do at least in part .
Given that , prospect theory implies two things .
First , it means that people are going to trade off more for security that lets them keep something they ’ve become accustomed to — a lifestyle , a level of security , some functionality in a product or service — than they were willing to risk to get it in the first place .
Second , when considering security gains , people are more likely to accept an incremental gain than a chance at a larger gain ; but when considering security losses , they ’re more likely to risk a larger loss than accept a larger gain .
Other Biases that Affect Risk
We have other heuristics and biases about risks .
One common one is called “ optimism bias ” : we tend to believe that we ’ll do better than most others engaged in the same activity .
This bias is why we think car accidents happen only to other people , and why we can at the same time engage in risky behavior while driving and yet complain about others doing the same thing .
It ’s why we can ignore network security risks while at the same time reading about other companies that have been breached .
It ’s why we think we can get by where others failed .
Basically , animals have evolved to underestimate loss .
Because those who experience the loss tend not to survive , those of us remaining have an evolved experience that losses _don ’t_ happen and that it ’s okay to take risks .
In fact , some have theorized that people have a “ risk thermostat , ” and seek an optimal level of risk regardless of outside circumstances . [ 18 ]
By that analysis , if something comes along to reduce risk — seat belt laws , for example — people will compensate by driving more recklessly .
And it ’s not just that we do n’t think bad things can happen to us , we — all things being equal — believe that good outcomes are more probable than bad outcomes .
This bias has been repeatedly illustrated in all sorts of experiments , but I think this one is particularly simple and elegant . [ 19 ]
Subjects were shown cards , one after another , with either a cartoon happy face or a cartoon frowning face .
The cards were random , and the subjects simply had to guess which face was on the next card before it was turned over .
For half the subjects , the deck consisted of 70 % happy faces and 30 % frowning faces .
Subjects faced with this deck were very accurate in guessing the face type ; they were correct 68 % of the time .
The other half was tested with a deck consisting of 30 % happy faces and 70 % frowning faces .
These subjects were much less accurate with their guesses , only predicting the face type 58 % of the time .
Subjects ’ preference for happy faces reduced their accuracy .
In a more realistic experiment , [ 20 ] students at Cook College were asked “ Compared to other Cook students — the same sex as you — what do you think are the chances that the following events will happen to you ? ”
They were given a list of 18 positive and 24 negative events , like getting a good job after graduation , developing a drinking problem , and so on .
Overall , they considered themselves 15 % more likely than others to experience positive events , and 20 % less likely than others to experience negative events .
The literature also discusses a “ control bias , ” where people are more likely to accept risks if they feel they have some control over them .
To me , this is simply a manifestation of the optimism bias , and not a separate bias .
Another bias is the “ affect heuristic , ” which basically says that an automatic affective valuation —
I ’ve seen it called “ the emotional core of an attitude ” — is the basis for many judgments and behaviors about it .
For example , a study of people ’s reactions to 37 different public causes showed a very strong correlation between 1 ) the importance of the issues , 2 ) support for political solutions , 3 ) the size of the donation that subjects were willing to make , and 4 ) the moral satisfaction associated with those donations .
[ 21 ]
The emotional reaction was a good indicator of all of these different decisions .
With regard to security , the affect heuristic says that an overall good feeling toward a situation leads to a lower risk perception , and an overall bad feeling leads to a higher risk perception .
This seems to explain why people tend to underestimate risks for actions that also have some ancillary benefit — smoking , skydiving , and such — but also has some weirder effects .
In one experiment , [ 22 ] subjects were shown either a happy face , a frowning face , or a neutral face , and then a random Chinese ideograph .
Subjects tended to prefer ideographs they saw after the happy face , even though the face was flashed for only ten milliseconds and they had no conscious memory of seeing it .
That ’s the affect heuristic in action .
Another bias is that we are especially tuned to risks involving people .
Daniel Gilbert again : [ 23 ]
We are social mammals whose brains are highly specialized for
thinking about others .
Understanding what others are up to —
what they know and want , what they are doing and planning —
has been so crucial to the survival of our species that our
brains have developed an obsession with all things human .
We
think about people and their intentions ; talk about them ; look
for and remember them .
In one experiment , [ 24 ] subjects were presented data about different risks occurring in state parks : risks from people , like purse snatching and vandalism , and natural - world risks , like cars hitting deer on the roads .
Then , the subjects were asked which risk warranted more attention from state park officials .
Rationally , the risk that causes the most harm warrants the most attention , but people uniformly rated risks from other people as more serious than risks from deer .
Even if the data indicated that the risks from deer were greater than the risks from other people , the people - based risks were judged to be more serious .
It was n’t until the researchers presented the damage from deer as enormously higher than the risks from other people that subjects decided it deserved more attention .
People are also especially attuned to risks involving their children .
This also makes evolutionary sense .
There are basically two security strategies life forms have for propagating their genes .
The first , and simplest , is to produce a lot of offspring and hope that some of them survive .
Lobsters , for example , can lay 10,000 to 20,000 eggs at a time .
Only ten to twenty of the hatchlings live to be four weeks old , but that ’s enough .
The other strategy is to produce only a few offspring , and lavish attention on them .
That ’s what humans do , and it ’s what allows our species to take such a long time to reach maturity .
( Lobsters , on the other hand , grow up quickly . )
But it also means that we are particularly attuned to threats to our children , children in general , and even other small and cute creatures . [ 25 ]
There is a lot of research on people and their risk biases .
Psychologist Paul Slovic seems to have made a career studying them . [ 26 ]
But most of the research is anecdotal , and sometimes the results seem to contradict each other .
I would be interested in seeing not only studies about particular heuristics and when they come into play , but how people deal with instances of contradictory heuristics .
Also , I would be very interested in research into how these heuristics affect behavior in the context of a strong fear reaction : basically , when these heuristics can override the amygdala and when they can’t .
PROBABILITY HEURISTICS
The second area that can contribute to bad security trade - offs is probability .
If we get the probability wrong , we get the trade - off wrong .
Generally , we as a species are not very good at dealing with large numbers .
An enormous amount has been written about this , by John Paulos [ 27 ] and others .
The saying goes “ 1 , 2 , 3 , many , ” but evolutionarily it makes some amount of sense .
Small numbers matter much more than large numbers .
Whether there ’s one mango or ten mangos is an important distinction , but whether there are 1,000 or 5,000 matters less — it ’s a lot of mangos , either way .
The same sort of thing happens with probabilities as well .
We ’re good at 1 in 2 vs. 1 in 4 vs. 1 in 8 , but we ’re much less good at 1 in 10,000 vs. 1 in 100,000 .
It ’s the same joke : “ half the time , one quarter of the time , one eighth of the time , almost never . ”
And whether whatever you ’re measuring occurs one time out of ten thousand or one time out of ten million , it ’s really just the same : almost never .
Additionally , there are heuristics associated with probabilities .
These are n’t specific to risk , but contribute to bad evaluations of risk .
And it turns out that our brains ’ ability to quickly assess probability runs into all sorts of problems .
The Availability Heuristic
The “ availability heuristic ” is very broad , and goes a long way toward explaining how people deal with risk and trade - offs .
Basically , the availability heuristic means that people “ assess the frequency of a class or the probability of an event by the ease with which instances or occurrences can be brought to mind . ” [ 28 ]
In other words , in any decision - making process , easily remembered ( available ) data are given greater weight than hard - to - remember data .
In general , the availability heuristic is a good mental shortcut .
All things being equal , common events are easier to remember than uncommon ones .
So it makes sense to use availability to estimate frequency and probability .
But like all heuristics , there are areas where the heuristic breaks down and leads to biases .
There are reasons other than occurrence that make some things more available .
Events that have taken place recently are more available than others .
Events that are more emotional are more available than others .
Events that are more vivid are more available than others .
And so on .
There ’s nothing new about the availability heuristic and its effects on security .
I wrote about it in _ Beyond Fear , _[ 29 ] although not by that name .
Sociology professor Barry Glassner devoted most of a book to explaining how it affects our risk perception . [ 30 ]
Every book on the psychology of decision making discusses it .
In one simple experiment , [ 31 ] subjects were asked this question :
In a typical sample of text in the English language , is it
more likely that a word starts with the letter K or that K is
its third letter ( not counting words with less than three
letters ) ?
Nearly 70 % of people said that there were more words that started with K , even though there are nearly twice as many words with K in the third position as there are words that start with K .
But since words that start with K are easier to generate in one ’s mind , people overestimate their relative frequency .
In another , more real - world , experiment , [ 32 ] subjects were divided into two groups .
One group was asked to spend a period of time imagining its college football team doing well during the upcoming season , and the other group was asked to imagine its college football team doing poorly .
Then , both groups were asked questions about the team ’s actual prospects .
Of the subjects who had imagined the team doing well , 63 % predicted an excellent season .
Of the subjects who had imagined the team doing poorly , only 40 % did so .
The same researcher performed another experiment before the 1976 presidential election .
Subjects asked to imagine Carter winning were more likely to predict that he would win , and subjects asked to imagine Ford winning were more likely to believe he would win .
This kind of experiment has also been replicated several times , and uniformly demonstrates that considering a particular outcome in one ’s imagination makes it appear more likely later .
The vividness of memories is another aspect of the availability heuristic that has been studied .
People ’s decisions are more affected by vivid information than by pallid , abstract , or statistical information .
Here ’s just one of many experiments that demonstrates this . [ 33 ]
In the first part of the experiment , subjects read about a court case involving drunk driving .
The defendant had run a stop sign while driving home from a party and collided with a garbage truck .
No blood alcohol test had been done , and there was only circumstantial evidence to go on .
The defendant was arguing that he was not drunk .
After reading a description of the case and the defendant , subjects were divided into two groups and given eighteen individual pieces of evidence to read : nine written by the prosecution about why the defendant was guilty , and nine written by the defense about why the defendant was innocent .
Subjects in the first group were given prosecution evidence written in a pallid style and defense evidence written in a vivid style , while subjects in the second group were given the reverse .
For example , here is a pallid and vivid version of the same piece of prosecution evidence :
* On his way out the door , Sanders [ the defendant ] staggers against a serving table , knocking a bowl to the floor .
* On his way out the door , Sanders staggered against a serving table , knocking a bowl of guacamole dip to the floor and splattering guacamole on the white shag carpet .
And here ’s a pallid and vivid pair for the defense :
* The owner of the garbage truck admitted under cross-examination that his garbage truck is difficult to see at night because it is grey in color .
* The owner of the garbage truck admitted under cross-examination that his garbage truck is difficult to see at night because it is grey in color .
The owner said his trucks are grey “ because it hides the dirt , ” and he said , “ What do you want , I should paint them pink ? ”
After all of this , the subjects were asked about the defendant ’s drunkenness level , his guilt , and what verdict the jury should reach .
The results were interesting .
The vivid vs. pallid arguments had no significant effect on the subject ’s judgment immediately after reading them , but when they were asked again about the case 48 hours later — they were asked to make their judgments as though they “ were deciding the case now for the first time ” — they were more swayed by the vivid arguments .
Subjects who read vivid defense arguments and pallid prosecution arguments were much more likely to judge the defendant innocent , and subjects who read the vivid prosecution arguments and pallid defense arguments were much more likely to judge him guilty .
The moral here is that people will be persuaded more by a vivid , personal story than they will by bland statistics and facts , possibly solely due to the fact that they remember vivid arguments better .
Another experiment [ 34 ] divided subjects into two groups , who then read about a fictional disease called “ Hyposcenia - B . ” Subjects in the first group read about a disease with concrete and easy - to - imagine symptoms : muscle aches , low energy level , and frequent headaches .
Subjects in the second group read about a disease with abstract and difficult - to - imagine symptoms : a vague sense of disorientation , a malfunctioning nervous system , and an inflamed liver .
Then each group was divided in half again .
Half of each half was the control group : they simply read one of the two descriptions and were asked how likely they were to contract the disease in the future .
The other half of each half was the experimental group : they read one of the two descriptions “ with an eye toward imagining a three - week period during which they contracted and experienced the symptoms of the disease , ” and then wrote a detailed description of how they thought they would feel during those three weeks .
And then they were asked whether they thought they would contract the disease .
The idea here was to test whether the ease or difficulty of imagining something affected the availability heuristic .
The results showed that those in the control group — who read either the easy - to - imagine or difficult - to - imagine symptoms , showed no difference .
But those who were asked to imagine the easy - to - imagine symptoms thought they were more likely to contract the disease than the control group , and those who were asked to imagine the difficult - to - imagine symptoms thought they were less likely to contract the disease than the control group .
The researchers concluded that imagining an outcome alone is not enough to make it appear more likely ; it has to be something easy to imagine .
And , in fact , an outcome that is difficult to imagine may actually appear to be less likely .
Additionally , a memory might be particularly vivid precisely because it ’s extreme , and therefore unlikely to occur .
In one experiment , [ 35 ] researchers asked some commuters on a train platform to remember and describe “ the worst time you missed your train ” and other commuters to remember and describe “ any time you missed your train . ”
The incidents described by both groups were equally awful , demonstrating that the most extreme example of a class of things tends to come to mind when thinking about the class .
More generally , this kind of thing is related to something called “ probability neglect ” : the tendency of people to ignore probabilities in instances where there is a high emotional content . [ 36 ]
Security risks certainly fall into this category , and our current obsession with terrorism risks at the expense of more common risks is an example .
The availability heuristic also explains hindsight bias .
Events that have actually occurred are , almost by definition , easier to imagine than events that have not , so people retroactively overestimate the probability of those events .
Think of “ Monday morning quarterbacking , ” exemplified both in sports and in national policy .
“ He should have seen that coming ” becomes easy for someone to believe .
The best way I ’ve seen this all described is by Scott Plous :
In very general terms : ( 1 ) the more _available_ an event is ,
the more frequent or probable it will seem ; ( 2 ) the more
_vivid_ a piece of information is , the more easily recalled
and convincing it will be ; and ( 3 ) the more _salient_
something is , the more likely it will be to appear causal . [ 37 ]
Here ’s one experiment that demonstrates this bias with respect to salience . [ 38 ]
Groups of six observers watched a two - man conversation from different vantage points : either seated behind one of the men talking or sitting on the sidelines between the two men talking .
Subjects facing one or the other conversants tended to rate that person as more influential in the conversation : setting the tone , determining what kind of information was exchanged , and causing the other person to respond as he did .
Subjects on the sidelines tended to rate both conversants as equally influential .
As I said at the beginning of this section , most of the time the availability heuristic is a good mental shortcut .
But in modern society , we get a lot of sensory input from the media .
That screws up availability , vividness , and salience , and means that heuristics that are based on our senses start to fail .
When people were living in primitive tribes , if the idea of getting eaten by a saber - toothed tiger was more available than the idea of getting trampled by a mammoth , it was reasonable to believe that — for the people in the particular place they happened to be living — it was more likely they ’d get eaten by a saber - toothed tiger than get trampled by a mammoth .
But now that we get our information from television , newspapers , and the Internet , that ’s not necessarily the case .
What we read about , what becomes vivid to us , might be something rare and spectacular .
It might be something fictional : a movie or a television show .
It might be a marketing message , either commercial or political .
And remember , visual media are more vivid than print media .
The availability heuristic is less reliable , because the vivid memories we ’re drawing upon are n’t relevant to our real situation .
And even worse , people tend not to remember _where_ they heard something — they just remember the content .
So even if , at the time they ’re exposed to a message they do n’t find the source credible , eventually their memory of the source of the information degrades and they ’re just left with the message itself .
We in the security industry are used to the effects of the availability heuristic .
It contributes to the “ risk du jour ” mentality we so often see in people .
It explains why people tend to overestimate rare risks and underestimate common ones . [ 39 ]
It explains why we spend so much effort defending against what the bad guys did last time , and ignore what new things they could do next time .
It explains why we ’re worried about risks that are in the news at the expense of risks that are not , or rare risks that come with personal and emotional stories at the expense of risks that are so common they are only presented in the form of statistics .
It explains most of the entries in Table 1 .
Representativeness
“ Representativeness ” is a heuristic by which we assume the probability that an example belongs to a particular class is based on how well that example represents the class .
On the face of it , this seems like a reasonable heuristic .
But it can lead to erroneous results if you ’re not careful .
The concept is a bit tricky , but here ’s an experiment makes this bias crystal clear . [ 40 ]
Subjects were given the following description of a woman named Linda :
Linda is 31 years old , single , outspoken , and very bright .
She majored in philosophy .
As a student , she was deeply
concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice ,
and also participated in antinuclear demonstrations .
Then the subjects were given a list of eight statements describing her present employment and activities .
Most were decoys ( “ Linda is an elementary school teacher , ” “ Linda is a psychiatric social worker , ” and so on ) , but two were critical : number 6 ( “ Linda is a bank teller , ” and number 8 ( “ Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement ” ) .
Half of the subjects were asked to rank the eight outcomes by the similarity of Linda to the typical person described by the statement , while others were asked to rank the eight outcomes by probability .
Of the first group of subjects , 85 % responded that Linda more resembled a stereotypical feminist bank teller more than a bank teller .
This makes sense .
But of the second group of subjects , 89 % of thought Linda was more likely to be a feminist bank teller than a bank teller .
Mathematically , of course , this is ridiculous .
It is impossible for the second alternative to be more likely than the first ; the second is a subset of the first .
As the researchers explain : “ As the amount of detail in a scenario increases , its probability can only decrease steadily , but its representativeness and hence its apparent likelihood may increase .
The reliance on representativeness , we believe , is a primary reason for the unwarranted appeal of detailed scenarios and the illusory sense of insight that such constructions often provide . ” [ 41 ]
Does n’t this sound like how so many people resonate with movie - plot threats — overly specific threat scenarios — at the expense of broader risks ?
In another experiment , [ 42 ] two groups of subjects were shown short personality descriptions of several people , all of which were sampled from a population of 100 engineers or lawyers .
Here ’s a sample description :
Tom W. is of high intelligence , although lacking in true creativity .
He has a need for order and clarity , and for neat and tidy systems in which every detail finds its appropriate place .
His writing is rather dull and mechanical , occasionally enlivened by somewhat corny puns and flashes of imagination of the sci - fi type .
He has a strong drive for competence .
He seems to have little feel and little sympathy for other people and does not enjoy interacting with others .
Self - centered , he nonetheless has a deep moral sense .
Then , the subjects were asked to give a probability that each description belonged to an engineer rather than a lawyer .
One group of subjects was told this about the population :
* Condition A : The population consisted of 70 engineers and 30 lawyers .
The second group of subjects was told this about the population :
* Condition B : The population consisted of 30 engineers and 70 lawyers .
Statistically , the probability that a particular description belongs to an engineer rather than a lawyer should be much higher under Condition A than Condition B . However , subjects judged the assignments to be the same in either case .
They were basing their judgments solely on the stereotypical personality characteristics of engineers and lawyers , and ignoring the relative probabilities of the two categories .
Interestingly , when subjects were not given any personality description at all and simply asked for the probability that a random individual was an engineer , they answered correctly : 70 % under Condition A and 30 % under Condition B .
But when they were given a neutral personality description , one that did n’t trigger either stereotype , they assigned the description to an engineer 50 % of the time under both Conditions A and B .
And here ’s a third experiment .
Subjects ( college students ) were given a survey which included these two questions : “ How happy are you with your life in general ? ” and “ How many dates did you have last month ? ”
When asked in this order , there was no correlation between the answers .
But when asked in the reverse order — when the survey reminded the subjects of how good ( or bad ) their love life was before asking them about their life in general — there was a 66 % correlation . [ 43 ]
Representativeness also explains the base rate fallacy , where people forget that if a particular characteristic is extremely rare , even an accurate test for that characteristic will show false alarms far more often than it will correctly identify the characteristic .
Security people run into this heuristic whenever someone tries to sell such things as face scanning , profiling , or data mining as effective ways to find terrorists .
And lastly , representativeness explains the “ law of small numbers , ” where people assume that long - term probabilities also hold in the short run .
This is , of course , not true : if the results of three successive coin flips are tails , the odds of heads on the fourth flip are not more than 50 % .
The coin is not “ due ” to flip heads .
Yet experiments have demonstrated this fallacy in sports betting again and again . [ 44 ]
COST HEURISTICS
Humans have all sorts of pathologies involving costs , and this is n’t the place to discuss them all .
But there are a few specific heuristics I want to summarize , because if we ca n’t evaluate costs right — either monetary costs or more abstract costs — we ’re not going to make good security trade - offs .
Mental Accounting
Mental accounting is the process by which people categorize different costs . [ 45 ]
People do n’t simply think of costs as costs ; it ’s much more complicated than that .
Here are the illogical results of two experiments . [ 46 ]
In the first , subjects were asked to answer one of these two questions :
* Trade - off 1 : Imagine that you have decided to see a play where the admission is $ 10 per ticket .
As you enter the theater you discover that you have lost a $ 10 bill .
Would you still pay $ 10 for a ticket to the play ?
* Trade - off 2 : Imagine that you have decided to see a play where the admission is $ 10 per ticket .
As you enter the theater you discover that you have lost the ticket .
The seat is not marked and the ticket cannot be recovered .
Would you pay $ 10 for another ticket ?
The results of the trade - off are exactly the same .
In either case , you can either see the play and have $ 20 less in your pocket , or not see the play and have $ 10 less in your pocket .
But people do n’t see these trade - offs as the same .
Faced with Trade - off 1 , 88 % of subjects said they would buy the ticket anyway .
But faced with Trade - off 2 , only 46 % said they would buy a second ticket .
The researchers concluded that there is some sort of mental accounting going on , and the two different $ 10 expenses are coming out of different mental accounts .
The second experiment was similar .
Subjects were asked :
* Imagine that you are about to purchase a jacket for $ 125 , and a calculator for $ 15 .
The calculator salesman informs you that the calculator you wish to buy is on sale for $ 10 at the other branch of the store , located 20 minutes ’ drive away .
Would you make the trip to the other store ?
* Imagine that you are about to purchase a jacket for $ 15 , and a calculator for $ 125 .
The calculator salesman informs you that the calculator you wish to buy is on sale for $ 120 at the other branch of the store , located 20 minutes drive away .
Would you make the trip to the other store ?
Ignore your amazement at the idea of spending $ 125 on a calculator ; it ’s an old experiment .
These two questions are basically the same : would you drive 20 minutes to save $ 5 ?
But while 68 % of subjects would make the drive to save $ 5 off the $ 15 calculator , only 29 % would make the drive to save $ 5 off the $ 125 calculator .
There ’s a lot more to mental accounting . [ 47 ]
In one experiment , [ 48 ] subjects were asked to imagine themselves lying on the beach on a hot day and how good a cold bottle of their favorite beer would feel .
They were to imagine that a friend with them was going up to make a phone call — this was in 1985 , before cell phones — and offered to buy them that favorite brand of beer if they gave the friend the money .
What was the most the subject was willing to pay for the beer ?
Subjects were divided into two groups .
In the first group , the friend offered to buy the beer from a fancy resort hotel .
In the second group , the friend offered to buy the beer from a run-down grocery store .
From a purely economic viewpoint , that should make no difference .
The value of one ’s favorite brand of beer on a hot summer ’s day has nothing to do with where it was purchased from .
( In economic terms , the consumption experience is the same . )
But people were willing to pay $ 2.65 on average for the beer from a fancy resort , but only $ 1.50 on average from the run-down grocery store .
The experimenters concluded that people have reference prices in their heads , and that these prices depend on circumstance .
And because the reference price was different in the different scenarios , people were willing to pay different amounts .
This leads to sub-optimal results .
As Thayer writes , “ The thirsty beer - drinker who would pay $ 4 for a beer from a resort but only $ 2 from a grocery store will miss out on some pleasant drinking when faced with a grocery store charging $ 2.50 . ”
Researchers have documented all sorts of mental accounting heuristics .
Small costs are often not “ booked , ” so people more easily spend money on things like a morning coffee .
This is why advertisers often describe large annual costs as “ only a few dollars a day . ”
People segregate frivolous money from serious money , so it ’s easier for them to spend the $ 100 they won in a football pool than a $ 100 tax refund .
And people have different mental budgets .
In one experiment that illustrates this , [ 49 ] two groups of subjects were asked if they were willing to buy tickets to a play .
The first group was told to imagine that they had spent $ 50 earlier in the week on tickets to a basketball game , while the second group was told to imagine that they had received a $ 50 parking ticket earlier in the week .
Those who had spent $ 50 on the basketball game ( out of the same mental budget ) were significantly less likely to buy the play tickets than those who spent $ 50 paying a parking ticket (
out o
f a different mental budget ) .
One interesting mental accounting effect can be seen at race tracks . [ 50 ]
Bettors tend to shift their bets away from favorites and towards long shots at the end of the day .
This has been explained by the fact that the average bettor is behind by the end of the day — pari-mutuel betting means that the average bet is a loss — and a long shot can put a bettor ahead for the day .
There ’s a “ day ’s bets ” mental account , and bettors do n’t want to close it in the red .
The effect of mental accounting on security trade - offs is n’t clear , but I ’m certain we have a mental account for “ safety ” or “ security , ” and that money spent from that account feels different than money spent from another account .
I ’ll even wager we have a similar mental accounting model for non-fungible costs such as risk : risks from one account do n’t compare easily with risks from another .
That is , we are willing to accept considerable risks in our leisure account — skydiving , knife juggling , whatever — when we would n’t even consider them if they were charged against a different account .
Time Discounting
“ Time discounting ” is the term used to describe the human tendency to discount future costs and benefits .
It makes economic sense ; a cost paid in a year is not the same as a cost paid today , because that money could be invested and earn interest during the year .
Similarly , a benefit accrued in a year is worth less than a benefit accrued today .
Way back in 1937 , economist Paul Samuelson proposed a discounted - utility model to explain this all .
Basically , something is worth more today than it is in the future .
It ’s worth more to you to have a house today than it is to get it in ten years , because you ’ll have ten more years ’ enjoyment of the house .
Money is worth more today than it is years from now ; that ’s why a bank is willing to pay you to store it with them .
The discounted utility model assumes that things are discounted according to some rate .
There ’s a mathematical formula for calculating which is worth more — $ 100 today or $ 120 in twelve months — based on interest rates .
Today , for example , the discount rate is 6.25 % , meaning that $ 100 today is worth the same as $ 106.25 in twelve months .
But of course , people are much more complicated than that .
There is , for example , a magnitude effect : smaller amounts are discounted more than larger ones .
In one experiment , [ 51 ] subjects were asked to choose between an amount of money today or a greater amount in a year .
The results would make any banker shake his head in wonder .
People did n’t care whether they received $ 15 today or $ 60 in twelve months .
At the same time , they were indifferent to receiving $ 250 today or $ 350 in twelve months , and $ 3,000 today or $ 4,000 in twelve months .
If you do the math , that implies a discount rate of 139 % , 34 % , and 29 % — all held simultaneously by subjects , depending on the initial dollar amount .
This holds true for losses as well , [ 52 ] although gains are discounted more than losses .
In other words , someone might be indifferent to $ 250 today or $ 350 in twelve months , but would much prefer a $ 250 penalty today to a $ 350 penalty in twelve months .
Notice how time discounting interacts with prospect theory here .
Also , preferences between different delayed rewards can flip , depending on the time between the decision and the two rewards .
Someone might prefer $ 100 today to $ 110 tomorrow , but also prefer $ 110 in 31 days to $ 100 in thirty days .
Framing effects show up in time discounting , too .
You can frame something either as an acceleration or a delay from a base reference point , and that makes a big difference .
In one experiment , [ 53 ] subjects who expected to receive a VCR in twelve months would pay an average of $ 54 to receive it immediately , but subjects who expected to receive the VCR immediately demanded an average $ 126 discount to delay receipt for a year .
This holds true for losses as well : people demand more to expedite payments than they would pay to delay them . [ 54 ]
Reading through the literature , it sometimes seems that discounted utility theory is full of nuances , complications , and contradictions .
But clearly there is some mental discounting going on ; it ’s just not anywhere near linear , and not easily formularized .
HEURISTICS THAT AFFECT DECISIONS
And finally , there are biases and heuristics that affect trade - offs .
Like many other heuristics we ’ve discussed , they ’re general , and not specific to security .
But they ’re still important .
First , some more framing effects .
Most of us have anecdotes about what psychologists call the “ context effect ” : preferences among a set of options depend on what other options are in the set .
This has been confirmed in all sorts of experiments — remember the experiment about what people were willing to pay for a cold beer on a hot beach — and most of us have anecdotal confirmation of this heuristic .
For example , people have a tendency to choose options that dominate other options , or compromise options that lie between other options .
If you want your boss to approve your $ 1 M security budget , you ’ll have a much better chance of getting that approval if you give him a choice among three security plans — with budgets of $ 500 K , $ 1 M , and $ 2 M , respectively — than you will if you give him a choice among three plans with budgets of $ 250 K , $ 500 K , and $ 1 M .
The rule of thumb makes sense : avoid extremes .
It fails , however , when there ’s an intelligence on the other end , manipulating the set of choices so that a particular one does n’t seem extreme .
“ Choice bracketing ” is another common heuristic .
In other words : choose a variety .
Basically , people tend to choose a more diverse set of goods when the decision is bracketed more broadly than they do when it is bracketed more narrowly .
For example , [ 55 ] in one experiment students were asked to choose among one of six different snacks that they would receive at the beginning of the next three weekly classes .
One group had to choose the three weekly snacks in advance , while the other group chose at the beginning of each class session .
Of the group that chose in advance , 64 % chose a different snack each week , but only 9 % of the group that chose each week did the same .
The narrow interpretation of this experiment is that we overestimate the value of variety .
Looking ahead three weeks , a variety of snacks seems like a good idea , but when we get to the actual time to enjoy those snacks , we choose the snack we like .
But there ’s a broader interpretation as well , one borne out by similar experiments and directly applicable to risk taking : when faced with repeated risk decisions , evaluating them as a group makes them feel less risky than evaluating them one at a time .
Back to finance , someone who rejects a particular gamble as being too risky might accept multiple identical gambles .
Again , the results of a trade - off depend on the context of the trade - off .
It gets even weirder .
Psychologists have identified an “ anchoring effect , ” whereby decisions are affected by random information cognitively nearby .
In one experiment [ 56 ] , subjects were shown the spin of a wheel whose numbers ranged from 0 and 100 , and asked to guess whether the number of African nations in the UN was greater or less than that randomly generated number .
Then , they were asked to guess the exact number of African nations in the UN .
Even though the spin of the wheel was random , and the subjects knew it , their final guess was strongly influenced by it .
That is , subjects who happened to spin a higher random number guessed higher than subjects with a lower random number .
Psychologists have theorized that the subjects anchored on the number in front of them , mentally adjusting it for what they thought was true .
Of course , because this was just a guess , many people did n’t adjust sufficiently .
As strange as it might seem , other experiments have confirmed this effect .
And if you ’re not completely despairing yet , here ’s another experiment that will push you over the edge . [ 57 ]
In it , subjects were asked one of these two questions :
* Question 1 : Should divorce in this country be easier to obtain , more difficult to obtain , or stay as it is now ?
* Question 2 : Should divorce in this country be easier to obtain , stay as it is now , or be more difficult to obtain ?
In response to the first question , 23 % of the subjects chose easier divorce laws , 36 % chose more difficult divorce laws , and 41 % said that the status quo was fine .
In response to the second question , 26 % chose easier divorce laws , 46 % chose more difficult divorce laws , and 29 % chose the status quo .
Yes , the order in which the alternatives are listed affects the results .
There are lots of results along these lines , including the order of candidates on a ballot .
Another heuristic that affects security trade - offs is the “ confirmation bias . ”
People are more likely to notice evidence that supports a previously held position than evidence that discredits it .
Even worse , people who support position A sometimes mistakenly believe that anti-A evidence actually supports that position .
There are a lot of experiments that confirm this basic bias and explore its complexities .
If there ’s one moral here , it ’s that individual preferences are not based on predefined models that can be cleanly represented in the sort of indifference curves you read about in microeconomics textbooks ; but instead , are poorly defined , highly malleable , and strongly dependent on the context in which they are elicited .
Heuristics and biases matter .
A lot .
This all relates to security because it demonstrates that we are not adept at making rational security trade - offs , especially in the context of a lot of ancillary information designed to persuade us one way or another .
MAKING SENSE OF THE PERCEPTION OF SECURITY
We started out by teasing apart the security trade - off , and listing five areas where perception can diverge from reality :
1 . The severity of the risk .
2 . The probability of the risk .
3 . The magnitude of the costs .
4 . How effective the countermeasure is at mitigating the risk .
5 . The trade - off itself .
Sometimes in all the areas , and all the time in area 4 , we can explain this divergence as a consequence of not having enough information .
But sometimes we have all the information and _still_ make bad security trade - offs .
My aim was to give you a glimpse of the complicated brain systems that make these trade - offs , and how they can go wrong .
Of course , we can make bad trade - offs in anything : predicting what snack we ’d prefer next week or not being willing to pay enough for a beer on a hot day .
But security trade - offs are particularly vulnerable to these biases because they are so critical to our survival .
Long before our evolutionary ancestors had the brain capacity to consider future snack preferences or a fair price for a cold beer , they were dodging predators and forging social ties with others of their species .
Our brain heuristics for dealing with security are old and well - worn , and our amygdalas are even older .
What ’s new from an evolutionary perspective is large - scale human society , and the new security trade - offs that come with it .
In the past I have singled out technology and the media as two aspects of modern society that make it particularly difficult to make good security trade - offs — technology by hiding detailed complexity so that we do n’t have the right information about risks , and the media by producing such available , vivid , and salient sensory input — but the issue is really broader than that .
The neocortex , the part of our brain that has to make security trade - offs , is , in the words of Daniel Gilbert , “ still in beta testing . ”
I have just started exploring the relevant literature in behavioral economics , the psychology of decision making , the psychology of risk , and neuroscience .
Undoubtedly there is a lot of research out there for me still to discover , and more fascinatingly counterintuitive experiments that illuminate our brain heuristics and biases .
But already I understand much more clearly why we get security trade - offs so wrong so often .
When I started reading about the psychology of security , I quickly realized that this research can be used both for good and for evil .
The good way to use this research is to figure out how humans ’ feelings of security can better match the reality of security .
In other words , how do we get people to recognize that they need to question their default behavior ?
Giving them more information seems not to be the answer ; we ’re already drowning in information , and these heuristics are not based on a lack of information .
Perhaps by understanding how our brains processes risk , and the heuristics and biases we use to think about security , we can learn how to override our natural tendencies and make better security trade - offs .
Perhaps we can learn how not to be taken in by security theater , and how to convince others not to be taken in by the same .
The evil way is to focus on the feeling of security at the expense of the reality .
In his book _Influence , _[ 58 ]
Robert Cialdini makes the point that people can’t analyze every decision fully ; it ’s just not possible : people need heuristics to get through life .
Cialdini discusses how to take advantage of that ; an unscrupulous person , corporation , or government can similarly take advantage of the heuristics and biases we have about risk and security .
Concepts of prospect theory , framing , availability , representativeness , affect , and others are key issues in marketing and politics .
They ’re applied generally , but in today ’s world they ’re more and more applied to security .
Someone could use this research to simply make people _feel_ more secure , rather than to actually make them more secure .
After all my reading and writing , I believe my good way of using the research is unrealistic , and the evil way is unacceptable .
But I also see a third way : integrating the feeling and reality of security .
The feeling and reality of security are different , but they ’re closely related .
We make the best security trade - offs — and by that I mean trade - offs that give us genuine security for a reasonable cost — when our feeling of security matches the reality of security .
It ’s when the two are out of alignment that we get security wrong .
In the past , I ’ve criticized palliative security measures that only make people _feel_ more secure as “ security theater . ”
But used correctly , they can be a way of raising our feeling of security to more closely match the reality of security .
One example is the tamper - proof packaging that started to appear on over - the - counter drugs in the 1980s , after a few highly publicized random poisonings .
As a countermeasure , it did n’t make much sense .
It ’s easy to poison many foods and over - the - counter medicines right through the seal — with a syringe , for example — or to open and reseal the package well enough that an unwary consumer wo n’t detect it .
But the tamper - resistant packaging brought people ’s perceptions of the risk more in line with the actual risk : minimal .
And for that reason the change was worth it .
Of course , security theater has a cost , just like real security .
It can cost money , time , capabilities , freedoms , and so on , and most of the time the costs far outweigh the benefits .
And security theater is no substitute for real security .
Furthermore , too much security theater will raise people ’s feeling of security to a level greater than the reality , which is also bad .
But used in conjunction with real security , a bit of well - placed security theater might be exactly what we need to both be and feel more secure .

I was taken aback but not outraged .
I ’d certainly been called worse and indeed jumped at the chance to use the old insult to explain to my NBC bosses why I did not want to appear on the Imus show .
I have n’t talked about this much .
I ’m a big girl .
I have a platform .
I have a voice .
I ’ve been working in journalism long enough that there is little danger that a radio D.J. ’s juvenile slap will define or scar me .
Yesterday , he began telling people he never actually called me a cleaning lady .
Whatever .
This is not about me .
It is about the Rutgers Scarlet Knights .
That game had to be the biggest moment of their lives , and the outcome the biggest disappointment .
They are not old enough , or established enough , to have built up the sort of carapace many women I know — black women in particular — develop to guard themselves against casual insult .
Why do my journalistic colleagues appear on Mr. Imus ’s program ?
That ’s for them to defend , and others to argue about .
I certainly do n’t know any black journalists who will .
To his credit , Mr. Imus told the Rev. Al Sharpton yesterday he realizes that , this time , he went way too far .
Yes , he did .
Every time a young black girl shyly approaches me for an autograph or writes or calls or stops me on the street to ask how she can become a journalist , I feel an enormous responsibility .
It ’s more than simply being a role model .
I know I have to be a voice for them as well .
So here ’s what this voice has to say for people who cannot grasp the notion of picking on people their own size :
This country will only flourish once we consistently learn to applaud and encourage the young people who have to work harder just to achieve balance on the unequal playing field .
Let ’s see if we can manage to build them up and reward them , rather than opting for the cheapest , easiest , most despicable shots .
Documents show US had propaganda campaign plan two months before invasion Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday May 9 , 2007 Print This Email This Months before the US invaded Iraq , Pentagon planners were developing an elaborate propaganda campaign to ensure US government - " approved " information was broadcast to the Iraqi public , according to a previously classified White Paper released Tuesday by the independent National Security Archives .
The White Paper , prepared in January 2003 , lays out plans to install American - friendly media with an Iraqi face and to silence local anti-US news outlets , referred to in the paper as " hate media . "
Also released by the National Security Archives were a Power Point presentation outlining the goals of the media plan and other briefing materials .
Transformation of Iraqs media would be accomplished by a Rapid Reaction Media Team , which planners envisioned as a bridge between the state - controlled outlets of Saddam Husseins regime and a long - term  Iraqi Free Media  network , which would broadcast America - friendly programming .
" This team will deploy from Washington immediately upon cessation of hostilities and begin broadcasting and printing approved USG information to the Iraqi public , " the paper says .
The paper was prepared by two Defense Department offices , Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict , which is in charge of psychological warfare , and Near East and South Asian Affairs ( Special Plans ) , which was established to plan the Iraq war in secret .
A Pentagon spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday .
" Having professional US - trained Iraqi media teams immediately in - place to portray a new Iraq ( by Iraqis for Iraqis ) with hopes for a prosperous , democratic future , will have a profound psychological and political impact on the Iraqi people , " reads the White Paper .
To deal with native voices unfriendly to US interests in the war , the paper calls for installation of a temporary Media Commissioner to regulate against hate media that might destabilize Iraq .
The commissioner would work with military commanders to identify the media infrastructure we need left in tact and find alternative ways of disabling key sites .
The National Security Archives ' Joyce Battle mused ,  Evidently the Baghdad headquarters of Arab satellite network al - Jazeera was not part of " the media infrastructure that we need left intact . "
The project was estimated to cost about $ 2 million , and be completed within 12 months from the end of the invasion , according to briefing materials prepared along with the White Paper .
The Pentagons media strategy enriched several defense contractors including the Rendon Group , Scientific Applications International Corporation and the Lincoln Group , reports Battle .
According to press reports that emerged in late 2005 , the Lincoln Group was paid $ 100 million by the Pentagon to act as a go - between to allow the US military to covertly place articles written by military information officers into Iraqi newspapers as if Iraqi correspondents had written them .
Despite the Pentagons stated goals of a free  Iraqi media , Battle reports , the International Press Institute ranks Iraq as the most dangerous country in the world for journalists and says Iraqs media is closer to what would be found in an autocratic regime rather than an emerging democracy .
READ THE FULL WHITE PAPER HERE .
I ’ve written about the U.S. national ID card — REAL ID — extensively ( most recently here ) .
The Department of Homeland Security has published draft rules regarding REAL ID , and are requesting comments .
Comments are due today , by 5:00 PM Eastern Time .
Please , please , please , go to this Privacy Coalition site and submit your comments .
The DHS has been making a big deal about the fact that so few people are commenting , and we need to prove them wrong .
This morning the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on REAL ID ( info — and eventually a video — here ) ; I was one of the witnesses who testified .
And lastly , Richard Forno and I wrote this essay for News.com :
In March , the Department of Homeland Security released its long - awaited guidance document regarding national implementation of the Real ID program , as part of its post - 9/11 national security initiatives .
It is perhaps quite telling that despite bipartisan opposition , Real ID was buried in a 2005 “ must - pass ” military spending bill and enacted into law without public debate or congressional hearings .
DHS has maintained that the Real ID concept is not a national identification database .
While it ’s true that the system is not a single database per se , this is a semantic dodge ; according to the DHS document , Real ID will be a collaborative data - interchange environment built from a series of interlinking systems operated and administered by the states .
In other words , to the Department of Homeland Security , it ’s not a single database because it ’s not a single system .
But the functionality of a single database remains intact under the guise of a federated data - interchange environment .
The DHS document notes the “ primary benefit of Real ID is to improve the security and lessen the vulnerability of federal buildings , nuclear facilities , and aircraft to terrorist attack . ”
We know now that vulnerable cockpit doors were the primary security weakness contributing to 9/11 , and reinforcing them was a long - overdue protective measure to prevent hijackings .
But this still raises an interesting question :
Are there really so many members of the American public just “ dropping by ” to visit a nuclear facility that it ’s become a primary reason for creating a national identification system ?
Are such visitors actually admitted ?
DHS proposes guidelines for proving one ’s identity and residence when applying for a Real ID card .
Yet while the department concedes it ’s a monumental task to prove one ’s domicile or residence , it leaves it up to the states to determine what documents would be adequate proof of residence–and even suggests that a utility bill or bank statement might be appropriate documentation .
If so , a person could easily generate multiple proof - of - residence documents .
Basing Real ID on such easy - to - forge documents obviates a large portion of what Real ID is supposed to accomplish .
Finally , and perhaps most importantly for Americans , the very last paragraph of the 160 - page Real ID document deserves special attention .
In a nod to states ’ rights advocates , DHS declares that states are free not to participate in the Real ID system if they choose–but any identification card issued by a state that does not meet Real ID criteria is to be clearly labeled as such , to include “ bold lettering ” or a “ unique design ” similar to how many states design driver ’s licenses for those under 21 years of age .
In its own guidance document , the department has proposed branding citizens not possessing a Real ID card in a manner that lets all who see their official state - issued identification know that they ’re “ different , ” and perhaps potentially dangerous , according to standards established by the federal government .
They would become stigmatized , branded , marked , ostracized , segregated .
All in the name of protecting the homeland ; no wonder this provision appears at the very end of the document .
One likely outcome of this DHS - proposed social segregation is that people presenting non-Real ID identification automatically will be presumed suspicious and perhaps subject to additional screening or surveillance to confirm their innocence at a bar , office building , airport or routine traffic stop .
Such a situation would establish a new form of social segregation–an attempt to separate “ us ” from “ them ” in the age of counterterrorism and the new normal , where one is presumed suspicious until proven more suspicious .
Two other big - picture concerns about Real ID come to mind : Looking at the overall concept of a national identification database , and given existing data security controls in large distributed systems , one wonders how vulnerable this system - of - systems will be to data loss or identity theft resulting from unscrupulous employees , flawed technologies , external compromises or human error–even under the best of security conditions .
And second , there is no clear guidance on the limits of how the Real ID database would be used .
Other homeland security initiatives , such as the Patriot Act , have been used and applied –some say abused –for purposes far removed from anything related to homeland security .
How can we ensure the same will not happen with Real ID ?
As currently proposed , Real ID will fail for several reasons .
From a technical and implementation perspective , there are serious questions about its operational abilities both to protect citizen information and resist attempts at circumvention by adversaries .
Financially , the initial unfunded $ 11 billion cost , forced onto the states by the federal government , is excessive .
And from a sociological perspective , Real ID will increase the potential for expanded personal surveillance and lay the foundation for a new form of class segregation in the name of protecting the homeland .
It ’s time to rethink some of the security decisions made during the emotional aftermath of 9/11 and determine whether they ’re still a good idea for homeland security and America .
After all , if Real ID was such a well - conceived plan , Maine and 22 other states would n’t be challenging it in their legislatures or rejecting the Real ID concept for any number of reasons .
But they are .
And we as citizens should , too .
Let the debate begin .

In a free , democratic society , political affiliation is an informed , continually evaluated decision ; not a bond of blind loyalty , like that of dog to man .
I hereby take leave of the Republican Party , for the time being anyway , at least as an active participant .
Hopefully , the GOP will soon again merit the support of Americans who believe in individual freedom , personal responsibility and limited government .
I will continue to work for those values and for candidates who support them , irrespective of party affiliation .
Why ?
The Senate just passed the detainee bill .
It is even worse than the bill President Bush proposed .
Among many noxious provisions , it allows American authorities to lock people up indefinitely , without independent judicial review .
That clearly violates the U.S. Constitution and , therefore , the Geneva Convention for foreign detainees .
It also breaks a nearly thousand - year English - American tradition of habeas corpus .
Habeas corpus is the foundation upon which every aspect of a fair trial rests , indeed the foundation of every civil right .
What right or freedom can be safe if government officials can throw someone in jail without independent review ?
Literally throw away the key .
The McCarthy era and Japanese internment were recent memories when I grew up during the Eisenhower Administration .
I learned about them through study of history and came to know victims of both personally .
When the internment bill becomes law , President Bush and Republican Members of Congress will have done something equally shameful , as well as dangerous to our democracy .
We can only hope the Supreme Court rises to its duty and strikes down their mischief , as it did Bush ’s unilaterally declared Special Tribunals .
Comments of Congressional Republican leaders leave no doubt a major reason for passing this bill was to benefit Republican candidates in the upcoming Congressional elections .
Fellow Republicans :
You owe yourselves and America at least this .
Study the detainee bill .
Read commentary from both sides .
Read foreign as well as American sources .
Thanks to Google and the internet that is much easier than in the past .
Do not glibly say ( in ignorance or after consulting only right wing sources )
“ My Party ’s leader ( President Bush ) has acted , it is my duty to trust his judgment . ”
That is not discharging the duty of a responsible conservative and citizen of a free society .
That is being an idiot , or a fascist .
If , after devoting substantial effort to informing yourself from diverse sources , you can still support the Republican Party and its candidates this fall , do so with my blessing .
I cannot .
I tried , but there is a limit .
President Bush made a personal visit to Congress to fight an amendment by Republican Senator Arlon Spector .
That amendment would have restored habeas corpus .
After the President ’s visit , the Senate defeated Spector ’s habeas amendment on a party line vote : 48 YEA ( 4 Republicans , 43 Democrats , 1 Independent  Jeffords ) , 51 NAY ( 50 Republicans , 1 Democrat ) .
In the final vote , sending the bill to the President , Spector rejoined fellow Republicans , and some Democrats .
He expressed hope the Supreme Court would strike down the habeas denial provision .
I think Spector is right , at least I hope so .
Whatever happens upon judicial review , President Bush and Congressional Republicans did what they did .
That action must be punished , and in a tangible way , not just with talk .
In democratic politics that means withdrawal of political support , contributing , hopefully , to electoral defeat .
Otherwise , politicians of either party will succumb to future temptations to indulge momentary public passion at the expense of principles essential to freedom .
Some readers may protest that the detainee bill only applies to aliens in U.S. custody , i.e. , “ them , ” not to citizens , i.e. , “ us . ”
My limited research suggests citizens are not entirely safe from the bill ’s provisions .
I do n’t care and neither should you .
Our concern should be with what U.S. officials do in our names , not who they do it to .
Only by uniting “ their ” freedom with “ our ” freedom ( whoever “ they ” and “ we ” are at the moment ) can anyone ’s freedom be safe .
Others will ask  likely in anger , “ Do you accept responsibility for the possibility that your concerns about individual rights and freedom may lead to Islamic terrorists killing innocent Americans ? ”
One answer involves numbers .
With the highly unlikely exception of their employing nuclear weapons , terrorists do not pose an unusually great threat to Americans ( in America ) .
Averaged over reasonable time periods , the nearly 3000 , 9/11 deaths amount to a few hundred per year .
Averaged over comparable periods , more Americans die from just about every domestic - origin form of mortality on record .
As a global society unfolds around us , we , formerly isolated , Americans have some emotional adapting to do .
We will be exposed to different risks , but not substantially greater total risk .
Americans who once died of home - grown diseases ( smallpox and whooping cough in the past , cancer and heart disease today ) will someday die of foreign origin diseases , like AIDS and Asian bird flu .
Similarly , our murderers may come , not from the house down the street , or from across the bedroom , but from villages on the far side of the world .
One American child dies in the privacy of his or her home , grieved only by family and friends .
Another dies screaming to the world through TV cameras , victim of some yet to be conceived form of foreign terrorism .
One equals one .
Death is death .
It is the responsibility of Americans to emotionally adapt to new realities , not the responsibility of the world to indefinitely cope with our present inability to do so .
Coping with death is not easy , whether the cause be old or new , domestic or foreign , public or private .
It is when we depend on the strong and wise among us , family , friends , sometimes government officials .
Reflect on whether you genuinely believe President Bush and other Republican leaders properly discharged their responsibility to lead us ( calmly and rationally ) through the valley of death created by 9/11 .
The other answer involves politics .
I quote Benjamin Franklin “ Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety . ”
We Republicans must give first loyalty to the vision of America we share with Franklin , that of a nation that is better than momentary fear and anger .
Try though I have , I can no longer believe our current Republican President and Congressional leaders uphold that vision .

The Best of Robert Stokes
People still waiting for those wall - sized flat screen TVs that were promised in sci- fi books will be able to take a step closer to their dream with the announcement of Matsushita ’s thumping great 103 - inch panel TV .
Korean electronics company Matsushita , which owns the Panasonic brand , plans to unleash the plasma whopper by the end of the year , and says that it has already taken orders from the US .
First demo’d at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January this year , the 2.3 x 1.3 m behemoth weighs in at a wall - straining 215 kg – making it bigger than a double - sized mattress and almost as heavy as an upright piano .
The specifications look sumptuous though , with the 103 - inch panel offering a full 1080i HD resolution ( 1,920 by 1,080 pixels ) and an “ aaaieee – my eyes ! ” brightness rating of 3000:1 .
Panasonic have n’t announced how much the plasma monster is going to cost , but there ’s no doubt it wo n’t be for the likes of us mere mortals ( as a rough guide , Matsushita ’s current 65 - inch screen costs a leg - crossing $ 7,500 in Japan . )
Panasonic reckon that they ’ll be able to shift around 5,000 of these enormo - displays in the first year , although they added that probably only 20 % of takers will be TV viewers , with the majority buying the display for use as electronic billboards , or displays in studios and corporate lobbies .

The Art of War
Otto Dix ’s Der Krieg [ War ] cycle 1924
Introduction | Selected works | Slideshow | Checklist | Education ( pdf )

Otto Dix was born in 1891 in Untermhaus , Thuringia , the son of an ironworker .
He initially trained in Gera and at the Dresden School of Arts and Crafts as a painter of wall decorations and later taught himself how to paint on canvas .
He volunteered as a machine - gunner during World War I and in the autumn of 1915 he was sent to the Western Front .
He was at the Somme during the major allied offensive of 1916 .
After the war he studied at the academies of Dresden and Dusseldorf .
Together with George Grosz , he was one of the leading exponents of the artistic movement Die Neue Sachlichkeit [ New Objectivity ] , a form of social realist art which unsentimentally examined the decadence and underlying social inequality of post - war German society .
With the rise of the National Socialists in 1933 , Dix was dismissed from his teaching post at the Dresden Academy .
He moved south to Lake Constance and was only allowed to continue practising as an artist after he agreed to relinquish overtly political subject matter in favour of landscape painting .
Dix was conscripted into the army during World War II and in 1945 was captured and put into a prisoner of war camp .
He returned to Dresden after the war where his paintings became more religiously reflective of his war - time experiences .
He died in 1969 . [1 ]
Der Krieg [ War ] 1924 arose out of Dix ’s own experiences of the horrors of war .
As outlined above , he had volunteered for service in the army and fought as a machine - gunner on the Western Front .
He was wounded a number of times , once almost fatally .
War profoundly affected him as an individual and as an artist , and he took every opportunity , both during his active service and afterwards , to document his experiences .
These experiences would become the subject matter of many of his later paintings and are central to the Der Krieg cycle .
Der Krieg itself , as a cycle of prints ( 51 in total ) , is consciously modelled on Goya ’s [ 1746 –1828 ] equally famous and equally devastating Los Desastres de la Guerra [ The disasters of war ] .
Los Desastres detailed Goya ’s own account of the horrors of the Napoleonic invasion and the Spanish War of Independence from 1808 to 1814 .
Goya ’s cycle of 82 etchings , which he worked on for a decade after the Spanish War of Independence were not , however , published until 1863 , long after his death .
Like Los Desastres , Der Krieg uses a variety of etching techniques and does so with an equally astonishing facility .
Similarly , it exploits the cumulative possibilities of a long sequence of images and mirrors Goya ’s unflinching , stark realism in terms of its fundamental presentation .
GH Hamilton describes
Dix ’s cycle as ‘ perhaps the most powerful as well as the most unpleasant anti-war statements in modern art …
It was truly this quality of unmitigated truth , truth to the most commonplace and vulgar experiences , as well as the ugly realities of psychological experience , that gave his work a strength and consistency attained by no other contemporary artist , not even by [ George ] Grosz … ’ [ 2 ]
It has become a commonplace to see this cycle as an admonition against the barbarity of war .
And there is no doubt that as a human document it is a powerful cautionary work .
At a psychological level , however , its truth goes deeper than this .
Dix was both horrified and fascinated by the experience of war .
Otto Dix ' Verwundeter ( Herbst 1916 , Bapaume ) [ Wounded soldier – Autumn 1916 , Bapaume ] ' 1924 etching , aquatint , drypoint Collection of the National Gallery of Australia , The Poynton Bequest 2003 © Otto Dix , Licensed by VISCOPY , Australia ' Verwundeter ( Herbst 1916 , Bapaume ) [ Wounded soldier – Autumn 1916 , Bapaume ] ' 1924 etching , aquatint , drypoint Collection of the National Gallery of Australia , The Poynton Bequest 2003 © Otto Dix , Licensed by VISCOPY , Australia click to enlarge
In 1963 , explaining why he volunteered for the army in the First World War he had this to say :
I had to experience how someone beside me suddenly falls over and is dead and the bullet has hit him squarely .
I had to experience that quite directly .
I wanted it .
I ’m therefore not a pacifist at all – or am I ?
Perhaps I was an inquisitive person .
I had to see all that myself .
I ’m such a realist , you know , that I have to see everything with my own eyes in order to confirm that it ’s like that .
I have to experience all the ghastly , bottomless depths of life for myself … [ 3 ]
In the same interview , he also had this to say :
As a young man you do n’t notice at all that you were , after all , badly affected .
For years afterwards , at least ten years , I kept getting these dreams , in which I had to crawl through ruined houses , along passages I could hardly get through … [
4 ]
This nightmarish , hallucinatory quality pervades all of the Der Krieg images .
Paradoxically , there is also a quality of sensuousness , an almost perverse delight in the rendering of horrific detail , which indicates that there was perhaps , in Dix ’s case , an almost addictive quality to the hyper - sensory input of war .
In terms of the general corpus of Dix ’s work , Der Krieg occupies a central place amongst the large number of paintings and works - on - paper devoted to the theme of war .
The work is astonishingly powerful and , as stated above , it remains one of the most powerful indictments of war ever conceived .
It is universally regarded as one of the great masterpieces of twentieth century .
Dix ’s oeuvre as a whole , and Der Krieg in particular , was hugely influential on a number of other twentieth century artist such as Ben Shahn , Pablo Picasso and Robert Motherwell .

The etchings were printed by Kupferdruckerei O. Felsing in Charlottenburg on BSB Maschinen Butten and Kupferdruck paper under Dix ’s supervision .
The portfolio was published by Karl Nierendorf , Berlin , as five separate folios each of 10 prints in an edition of 70 in 1924 .
The edition the National Gallery of Australia has acquired is numbered 58/70 .
The portfolio also includes the impression of Soldat und Nonne [ Soldier and nun ] , depicting the rape of a nun by a soldier , which was suppressed in the published version of the suite .
Otto Dix is one of the greatest artists of the first half of the 20th century and his visual legacy , including his Der Krieg cycle , with its still relevant contemporary echoes , is one of the most powerful documents of man ’s inhumanity to man that we have available to us today .
Its acquisition represents a major coup for the Gallery having been on the Department of International Prints desiderata list for years .

( This post has been podcasted please look at the bottom of article to download . )
Before his untimely death in a plane crash , Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said , “ I 'm not Hillary 's mother - f****** tour guide ! ”
That was n't a nice thing for a member of the President 's cabinet to say about the First Lady , now my Senator , Hillary Clinton .
And it 's probably not polite for me to bring it up now .
But if I do n't , surely the Karl Rovarians will – if Senator Mrs. Clinton nails the Presidential nomination .
Bill Clinton used to say that , once he became president , he finally earned more money than his wife .
That was a carefully crafted bit of modesty to show Bill as an aw - shucks regular guy versus Richie Rich - kid George Bush .
But Bill 's cute remark raised a question in my mind : How did Hillary get that big ol ' salary ?
And another question arises : how has she stayed out of prison ?
The story 's a little complicated , involving a New Orleans power company , Indonesian billionaires , a New York nuclear plant and plain old influence peddling .
But if we follow the money , we 'll get the picture .
And it ai n't pretty .
But first , let 's stop at Wal - Mart .
Read an official biography of the Senator and you 'll find her six - month stint on a child - protection task force .
Yet you wo n't find her SIX YEARS on the board of directors of Wal - Mart Corporation .
She may have earned a Grammy for “ It Takes a Village to Raise a Child . ”
But it takes a Governor 's wife to provide cover for Wal - Mart 's profiteering off systematic wage - enslavement of children in its factories in South America .
Sam Walton called Hillary , “ My little lady . ”
Sam paid her an eyebrow raising sum for a director – equal to 60 % of her entire not - insubstantial salary as a lawyer .
By contrast , Wendy Diaz ( her real name ) , a 13 - year - old in Honduras , was paid 25 cents an hour to make shirts for the “ little lady 's ” label .
Hillary 's rake - in was made possible by Wal - Mart 's 100 % union - free operation and out - sourcing of 100 % of its manufacturing , some to prison factories in China .
Now , you could say that Hillary could n't hear the screams of the kiddies in Kamp Wal - Mart in Honduras .
After all , she relied on the intelligence provided her by the President ( of Wal - Mart ) .
Fast forward to 1994 and the Brown ‘ mother - f'ing tour guide ' business .
According to Nolanda Hill , the Commerce Secretary 's long - time business partner and love interest , Brown , who died in 1996 , endorsed a Hillary cash - for - access scheme ( $ 10,000 for coffee with the President , $ 100,000 for a night in the Lincoln bedroom ) .
However , Brown resented the discount rate the First Lady put on US executives joining Brown 's lucrative trade missions .
‘ I 'm worth more than $ 50,000 a pop ! ' he said .
One company more than happy to pony up for a cash joy - ride with Brown was Entergy International .
This electric company , based in Little Rock , became one of the world 's biggest power system operators on the planet under the Clinton regime .
Interestingly , Bill Clinton began his political climb by running for Arkansas Attorney General campaigning on a pledge to fight Entergy 's electric price hikes .
His pro-consumer plan was defeated in court by Entergy 's law firm – which included one Hillary Rodham .
There were more favors for Entergy .
In 1998 , I discovered , while working under cover for the Guardian and Observer , that Tony Blair was personally fixing the system to let Entergy to violate British policy on coal plants .
Why ?
I picked up in my secret recordings of Blair 's cronies that calls to take care of Entergy , rules be damned , had come in from the office of ‘ the Flotus ' – the First Lady of the United States .
It gets creepier .
In June of 1994 , Entergy 's partner in Asia , the Riady family of Indonesia paid recently - resigned Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell a $ 100,000 consulting fee .
Odd that : Hubbell was on his way to prison for the felony crime of inflating his legal bills .
Why would Asians pay a lawyer for advice on Asia who was on his way to the pokey ?
Maybe it had to do with his partner in crime .
I 've conducted investigations of lawyer over - billing .
It is nearly impossible for a senior lawyer to pad billing records unless the junior partner also fraudulently monkeys with time logs to make sure the records do n't give away the game .
Who was Hubbell 's “ little lady ” junior partner ?
Today we call her Madame Senator .
Hillary 's logs were worth close inspection by authorities , no ?
But the funny thing about Hillary 's billing records : when requested for disclosure in another suit , they disappeared .
First , her law firm 's computers went ka-blooey .
Then the paper printouts vanished , but not before , during the 1992 Presidential campaign , they were secretly combed over , line by line , by Web Hubbell .
Hubbell knew his own logs were phonied , and he understood the consequences of exposure .
Ultimately , bloated hours on those records caused him to lose his law license , his Associate Attorney General post and his freedom .
He got 21 months in the slammer .
What did Hubbell see and know about Hillary 's logs ?
Hubbell wo n't say , except for a cryptic remark , after seeing her bills , that ‘ every lawyer ' fabricates records .
Hubbell pleaded guilty , but refused to answer investigators ' questions , a requirement in any plea bargain – so the judge had to sentence him to prison .
Why would Hubbell choose to do time on the chain gang over testifying about the First Lady ?
His prosecutors did not know at the time of the $ 100,000 Riady payment , the first of over half a million dollars Hubbell would receive from Clinton friends in the weeks up to his entering jail .
And those Hillary billing records ?
Hubbell lost them – how convenient .
Then they reappeared two years later , just outside Hillary 's office , right after Hubbell announced he would refuse to testify against her .
Maybe the Clintons knew nothing about the big money flowing to prison - bound Hubbell .
Knowledge of the payments would suggest they were buying Hubbell 's silence .
In 1996 , when the LA Times uncovered the payments , Mrs. Clinton 's First Man Bill stone - cold denied he knew anything about it .
Then , in 2000 , in a deposition by the Justice Department , the President changed his tune .
Investigators confronted the President with this : on June 20 , 1994 , Hubbell met with Hillary .
Two days later , James Riady , the Asian billionaire Entergy partner , met with Hubbell for breakfast .
Just a few hours later , Riady returned to the White House , then met again with Hubbell , then made two more treks to the White House .
Two days later , a videotape shows the beginning of another meeting in the Oval Office between Clinton and Riady — but oddly , before they talk , the tape goes blank .
Two days after that , Hubbell gets his $ 100,000 through a Riady bank .
Lying to journalists is a venal sin , but lying to the Feds is perjury .
In his deposition , the President 's denial transformed into amnesia .
He could n't remember if Riady mentioned the payment .
Then , the President slyly opened the door to the truth .
“ I would n't be surprised if James told me , ” Clinton said .
Neither would I .
What did Riady get ?
The Flotus herself , says Nolanda Hill , forced Brown to accept the appointment of Riady 's bag man , John Huang , as a Commerce Department deputy .
According to records of calls the Guardian obtained via the Freedom of Information Act , Huang 's first order of business was to wheedle his way into confidential CIA briefings on Indonesia and China , then call Riady and his Entergy partners .
The same day Riady met the President , documents show he called on a Clinton crony at the top of the department 's Export - Import Bank .
“ We just came over from the Oval Office , ” is a nice way to provide assurance of the ‘ political connection ' required for help .
These and other Riady team meetings at Commerce are marked ‘ social ' .
Yet , shortly thereafter , the department agreed to promote and fund the Riady - Entergy China venture .
Influence is not a victimless crime .
Riady and his minions ' visits to the White House ( 94 times ! ) included successful requests for the President to meet Indonesian dictator Suharto and to kill negative reports on East Timor and working conditions in Indonesia .
Timorese and Indonesians paid for these policy flips with blood .
Has Entergy 's investment in Hillary 's jail - bird partner continued to pay dividends ?
Code Pink and New York environmentalists have been pulling out their hair over Senator Clinton 's backing of the operation of the creaky old Indian Point nuclear plant just above – and within irradiating distance of – New York City .
The owner of the Indian Point nuke ?
Hillary 's old buck buddies , Entergy .
Am I saying Hillary would arrange for a payoff to keep witnesses silent , to poison US foreign policy for the profit of corporate cronies , to vote in Washington loaded down with conflicts of interest ?
I would never say so .
Even if the evidence will .

Pro-gun group : Gonzales should resign Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday May 2 , 2007 Print This Email This
The head of an organization that strongly opposes gun control measures called on Tuesday for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign .
" He took an oath to uphold the Constitution , not trample it .
Perhaps it is time for him to go , " said Alan Gottlieb , founder of the Second Amendment Foundation .
Gottlieb 's organization is critical of Gonzales for backing legislation that would give the Attorney General the discretionary power to deny the purchase of a firearm or the issuance of a firearm license or permit to Americans suspected of having links to terrorism .
" This bill raises serious concerns about how someone becomes a ' suspected terrorist . '
Nobody has explained how one gets their name on such a list , and worse , nobody knows how to get one 's name off such a list , " Gottlieb argued in the group 's press release .
The Second Amendment Foundation was particularly exercised over Gonzales ' cooperation with a Senate Democrat in advancing the measure .
" We 're not surprised that General Gonzales has found an agreeable sponsor in Frank Lautenberg .
The senator from New Jersey has never seen a restrictive gun control scheme he did not immediately embrace , and S. 1237 is loaded with red flags , " the group said .
" Attorney General Gonzales has no business asking for that kind of power over any tenet in the Bill of Rights . "

As I walked through the school it was clear that it was just like any other school in the area , the walls covered with student paintings illustrating one theme or another .
There were absolutely no in your face religious themes , just mentions of things like Muslim politeness or Muslim behavior on posters with the list of the same sort of rules you see in any other school .
First impressions were that it was exactly the sort of school where any kid could get a great education , and the facilities were generally superior to those in the elementary schools where I teach .
I must say , however , that I have never seen a school cafeteria quite like the one at Granada .
The food was fresh cooked , healthy , and had plenty of stuff that kids like , including pizza and a wide assortment of ice cream .
Beverages included the usual assortment plus a wide range of coffees and energy drinks .
The kids and their parents both seemed happy , though some of the prices reminded me more of a mall than a village school .
Perhaps the most striking sight was the huge contingent of Granada kids wearing their green chess team shirts .
On the front , the team named Granada Guardians was prominent .
On the back , there were four sponsors , including Dr Pepper , which gave a very American touch to the uniform .
I have never seen a scholastic chess team with so much corporate sponsorship .
Most of the kids from the school were wearing those shirts , and I did n't see a single burkha on a competitor .
A few of the girls wore head scarves , but not many .
All of the kids got along well and played together , as one might expect .
The Granada team made it clear they were out to win every individual and team trophy possible , and collected over a dozen trophies .
These kids take their chess seriously and went all out to win every competition .
Their goal was clearly to dominate the California chess scene .
This is exactly the sort of healthy competition we need for our kids , where race , creed , orientation , and politics plays no part .
With all the American paranoia about the madrassas out there creating a bunch of future terrorists , people should all visit the Granada Muslim school to see some of the reality at least here in America .
The kids at the school are being taught to become fine citizens with good educations and solid academic skills .
It is at exactly what a school all to be .
Though I am no fan of organized religion , to put it mildly , I was very comfortable at this religious school and got no sense at all that these kids were somehow being brainwashed with values are foreign to my American ideals .
And seeing all these kids of various religions and ethnicities enjoying a day of playing chess together makes me wish there were more schools like this .
And yes , all of my participating students won trophies , even the blind kindergarten girl who has won trophies in her last four competitions , the only ones she has ever played .
One of the nicest things about the chess community is that everyone can play regardless of race , creed , orientation , gender , disability , or economic class .
Finally , I should mention that whoever runs the school is clearly not a fan of that foolish old man Al - Sistani , who has informed his Iraqi Shiite followers that chess is an abomination and against the Muslim faith .
The kids are taught that chess has been a part of Muslim culture for over 1500 years , and are not informed that the famous Iraqi cleric is simply flat - out wrong on the issue .
So , I 'm happy to see these kids trying to dominate the chess world .
And I look forward to the school establishing itself as the main base for Scholastic chess in the Bay Area .
' CRAZY IDEAS ' ' CRAZY IDEAS '
From laser weapons to test - tube babies , science - fiction writers have imagined hundreds of futuristic technologies that were or are being developed and used by the government or produced for the public .
Among them : From author Robert Heinlein : cellphones , remote - controlled robot arms , microwave ovens , water beds .
From author H.G. Wells : atomic bombs , airplanes , television , joystick controls .
From author Arlan Andrews : tourist spaceships , downloadable pocket - sized books .

Facebook Looking to prevent the next terrorist attack , the Homeland Security Department is tapping into the wild imaginations of a group of self - described " deviant " thinkers : science - fiction writers .
" We spend our entire careers living in the future , " says author Arlan Andrews , one of a handful of writers the government brought to Washington this month to attend a Homeland Security conference on science and technology .
Those responsible for keeping the nation safe from devastating attacks realize that in addition to border agents , police and airport screeners , they " need people to think of crazy ideas , " Andrews says .
The writers make up a group called Sigma , which Andrews put together 15 years ago to advise government officials .
The last time the group gathered was in the late 1990s , when members met with government scientists to discuss what a post - nuclear age might look like , says group member Greg Bear .
He has written 30 sci-fi books , including the best seller Darwin 's Radio .
Now , the Homeland Security Department is calling on the group to help with the government 's latest top mission of combating terrorism .
Although some sci - fi writers ' futuristic ideas might sound crazy now , scientists know that they often have what seems to be an uncanny ability to see into the future .
" Fifty years ago , science - fiction writers told us about flying cars and a wireless handheld communicator , " says Christopher Kelly , spokesman for Homeland Security 's Science and Technology division .
" Although flying cars have n't evolved , cellphones today are a way of life .
We need to look everywhere for ideas , and science - fiction writers clearly inform the debate . "
Bear says the writers offer powerful imaginations that can conjure up not only possible methods of attack , but also ideas about how governments and individuals will respond and what kinds of high - tech tools could prevent attacks .
The group 's motto is " Science Fiction in the National Interest . "
To join the group , Andrews says , you have to have at least one technical doctorate degree .
" We 're well - qualified nuts , " says Jerry Pournelle , co-author of the best sellers Footfall and Lucifer 's Hammer and dozens of other books .
Pournelle and others say that science - fiction writers have spent their lives studying the kinds of technologies and scenarios Homeland Security officials have been tackling since the department began operating in 2003 .
" We talk to a lot of strange people and read a lot of weird things , " Bear says .
At the Washington conference , Bear offered to put biometrics researchers in touch with movie special - effects experts .
The experts might be able to help the government determine how to match the face of someone walking through an airport to a grainy photo of a known terrorist .
Bear 's latest book , Quantico , is a sci- fi thriller that has FBI agents and a bioterrorism expert racing to hunt down a homegrown terrorist .
" We 'll play ' What if ? ' with anything , " says Sage Walker , an emergency medicine physician turned sci- fi writer and the only woman in the group .
She says the discussions with government officials " tend to be very intense and far - ranging . "
So are discussions between the writers .
During a coffee break at the conference , Walker , Bear and Andrews started talking about the government 's bomb - sniffing dogs .
Within minutes , they had conjured up a doggie brain - scanning skullcap that could tell agents what kind of explosive material a dog had picked up .
The 9/11 Commission called the 2001 terrorist attacks a result of the government 's " failure of imagination . "
For this group , Walker says , there 's no such thing as an " unthinkable scenario . "
Why offer their ideas to the government instead of private companies that pay big bucks ?
" To save civilization , " Ringworld author Larry Niven says .
" We do it in fiction .
Why would n't we want to do it in fact ? "

Ruby 1.9
Ruby VM
kernel threads
As you know , YARV support native thread .
It means that you can run each Ruby thread on each native thread concurrently .
It does n't mean that every Ruby thread runs in parallel .
YARV has global VM lock ( global interpreter lock ) which only one running Ruby thread has .
This decision maybe makes us happy because we can run most of the extensions written in C without any modifications .
are
Global Interpreter Lock
GIL
You must release Giant VM Lock before doing blocking task .
If you need do this in extension libraries , use rb_thread_blocking_region ( )
API .
rb_thread_blocking_region (
blocking_func , /* function that that will block */
data , /* this will be passed above function */
unblock_func /* if another thread cause exception with Thread#raise ,
this function is called to unblock or NULL
)
Continuations
Seaside
Guido van Rossum
Nevertheless , you 're right the GIL is not as bad as you would initially think : you just have to undo the brainwashing you got from Windows and Java proponents who seem to consider threads as the only way to approach concurrent activities .
Just because Java was once aimed at a set - top box OS that did n't support multiple address spaces , and just because process creation in Windows used to be slow as a dog , does n't mean that multiple processes ( with judicious use of IPC ) are n't a much better approach to writing apps for multi-CPU boxes than threads .
Just Say
No to the combined evils of locking , deadlocks , lock granularity , livelocks , nondeterminism and race conditions .
InterProcess Communication
IPC
fork
Erlang
share ­nothing
lightweight processes
m :n approach
[...] if we have multiple VM instance on a process , these VMs can be run in parallel .
I 'll work on that theme in the near future ( as my research topic ) .
[...] if there are many many problems on native threads , I 'll implement green thread .
As you know , it 's has some benefit against native thread ( lightweight thread creation , etc ) .
It will be lovely hack ( FYI .
my graduation thesis is to implement userlevel thread library on our specific SMT CPU ) .
Programming on native thread has own difficulty .
For example , on MacOSX , exec ( ) does n't work ( cause exception ) if other threads are running ( one of portability problem ) .
If we find critical problems on native thread , I will make green thread version on trunk ( YARV ) .
Multiple VM
MVM
The Ruby process needs to exec a new Ruby interpreter , which means it needs to know how it was launched ( which Ruby executable to use ) .
This quickly becomes difficult to do in a portable way .
For instance : if JRuby is used , the executable needs to be " jruby " .
Worse : the JVM or application server running it might not allow running outside programs .
The new Ruby interpreter needs to be set up with the correct ENV variables , LOADPATHs , Include Paths , and the main .rb file to execute
Communication can happen via DRb , but this needs to go via the network which is the only portable means of IPC .
Network communication means negotiating ports ( which port should the " server " part of the two programs listen to ) .
Network communication also means potential problems with firewalls that complain about programs opening connections or opening ports .
x = Thread.new {
p " hello "
}
pid_x = spawn ( Node , Mod , Func , Args )

A recent interview with ) , creator of Ruby , and , creator of YARV , tackles the topic of Ruby 's handling of threads .
Current stable releases of Ruby use user space threads ( also called " green threads " ) , which means that the Ruby interpreter takes care of everything to do with threads .
This is in contrast to kernel threads , where the creation , scheduling and synchronization is done with OS syscalls , which makes these operations costly , at least compared to their equivalents in user space threads .
User space threads , on the other hand , can not make use of multiple cores or multiple CPUs ( because the OS does n't know about them and thus can't schedule them on these cores / CPUs ) .has recently integrated YARV as the new , which , among other changes , has broughtto Ruby .
The introduction of kernel threads ( or " native threads " ) was widely greeted , particularly from developers coming from Java or .NET where kernel threads are the norm .
However , there 's a snag .
Sasada Koichi explains
This means : no matter how many cores or CPUs are available , only one Ruby thread will be able to run at any given time .
Thereworkarounds and native extensions can handle the ) in more flexible ways , for instance , release it before starting a long running operation .
Sasada Koichi explains the API available for releasing the GIL
The problem : this effectively removes the biggest argument for kernel threads , the use of multiple cores or CPUs , while retaining their problems .
Kernel threads are also the reason whymight be removed in future Ruby versions .
Continuations are a way for cooperative scheduling , which means that one thread of execution explicitly hands off control to another one .
The feature is also known under the name " Coroutine " , and has been around for a long time .
Recently , it move into the public eye because of the Smalltalk based web framework , which uses Continuations to significantly simplify web apps .
The approach using Kernel threads with a GIL is comparable to Python 's thread system , which also uses a GIL , and has done so for a long time .
Python 's GIL has caused countless debates about how to remove it , but it has stuck around for all this time .
However , a look at , Python 's creator , thoughts about threads , gives a view of an alternative future for Ruby threading .
In a recent post about the GIL , Guido van Rossum explained
The benefits of preemptively scheduled threads that share an address space has long been debated .
Unix was , for the longest time , single threaded or user space threaded .
Parallelism was implemented with multiple processes which communicated via different means of ) , such as Pipes , FIFOs , or explicitely shared memory regions .
This was supported by thesyscall , which allowed to cheaply duplicate a running process .
Recently , languages such ashave gained a lot of interest by also using aapproach ( called " lightweight processes ) + easy IPC method .
The " " are not OS processes , but actually live inside the same address space .
They are called " processes " , because they can not look into each others memory areas .
The " lightweight " comes from the fact that they are handled by a userspace scheduler .
For a long time , this meant that Erlang had the same problems as other userspace threaded systems : no support for multicores or multiple CPUs and blocking syscalls would block all threads .
Recently , though , this was solved by adopting an : the Erlang runtime now uses multiple kernel threads , and each one runs a user space scheduler .
This means that Erlang now gets to take advantage of multicores and multiple CPUs , without changing its execution model .
Luckily for the Ruby space , the Ruby team is aware of this and is considering this future for Ruby
This indicates that userspace ( green ) threads version of Ruby is not off the table , particularly in light of implementation problems of threading systems on different OSes , such as this one Why is there a need for Sasada Koichi's ) solution ?
Running multiple Ruby interpreters and having them communicate via IPC methods ( e.g. sockets ) is possible today as well .
However , it comes with a host of problems :
Of course , these issues make this much more complicated than the Thread equivalent of firing of a new thread of execution :
Or this Erlang sample : This Erlang code spawns a new lightweight process , and indeed : this is all the code that 's needed .
All the set up code is taken care of , none of the problems explained above .
The pid is a handle to the new process , and allows , for instance , for simple communication :
This sends a simple message to the process with the pid store in pid_x .
The message can consist of various types , for instance Atoms , Erlang 's version of Ruby 's symbols .
IPC as simple as this is certainly possible in Ruby too .
Erlectricity , is a new library that permits communication between Erlang and Ruby , but it could just as well be used to work between Ruby VMs .
Erlang IPC is particularly interesting , as it uses a pattern matching approach that facilitates message passing and makes it very concise .
The Ruby MVM is certainly the most promising idea for the future of Ruby threading .
It avoids the problems of the GIL and of manually wrangling Ruby processes and uses the share nothing ideas that make Erlang and other systems appealing for concurrency .
is the only Ruby version that uses kernel threads , mostly because it 's running on the JVM which supports them .
The cost of creating kernel threads is somewhat offset by the use of ( threads are created and kept around until they are needed ) .
Details of IronRuby 's threading support are n't known yet , but since the CLR and JVM are quite similar , it 's likely that kernel threads will be used too .
One possibility to prototype and experiment with the idea of a Ruby MVM would be to launch multiple instances of JRuby in the same JVM process and have them communicate .
This would effectively have the same cheap IPC ( data can be passed simply by passing a pointer , as long as the data is read only ) .
Ola Bini recently wrote about his new jrubysrv idea , which allows to run multiple JRuby instances in one JVM to save memory .
As it seems , the details of future thread support in Ruby are still undecided and might be quite different in the alternative implementations .
The forest contained trees , mosses , shrubs and ferns

The exquisitely preserved remains were unearthed in a US coalmine in Illinois , and date back to 300 million years ago .
Writing in the journal Geology , a UK - US team said a diverse array of now extinct fossilised flora could be seen .
Covering a 1,000 - hectare ( 10 sq km ) site , it represents the largest fossil rainforest yet discovered .
" This is a significant find , " said Professor Andrew Scott , a palaeobotanist from Royal Holloway University , London .
" These peat - forming systems are actually quite diverse and dynamic .
" What they are showing is that this ecological diversity is also seen spatially . "
Ancient insights
The Pennsylvanian Epoch , which dates to 299-318 million years ago , is considered the " zenith of peat formation " .
Geologists are keen to understand more about the period to gain insights into the formation of coal .
We were able to make a map of the forest by the light of our miner 's lamps
Howard Flacon- Lang
The deposit in Illinois is thought to have been created when a major earthquake shook the forest , causing a vast swathe to drop below sea level and become preserved as peat and then coal .
Dr Howard Falcon - Lang , an earth scientist from the University of Bristol , was one of the scientists to discover the site .
He said : " It was an amazing experience .
" We drove down the mine in an armoured vehicle , until we were a hundred metres below the surface .
" The fossil forest was rooted on top of the coal seam , so where the coal had been mined away the fossilized forest was visible in the ceiling of the mine .
" We walked for miles and miles along pitch - black passages with the fossil forest just above our heads .
We were able to make a map of the forest by the light of our miners ' lamps . "
Species diversity
The scientists found a rich mixture of ecology .
An abundance of 4 m - high ( 12ft ) tree ferns formed a sub-canopy over the forest , but they were dwarfed by club mosses , some more than 40 m tall .
Dr Falcon - Lang said the discovery allowed researchers to understand how the make - up of the forest changed across the ancient landscape .
" As there is nothing like it around today , before our work we knew very little about the ecological preferences and community structure of these ancient plants , " he said .
Other work is also starting to shed light on these systems .
A team from the Czech Republic recently discovered and mapped an ancient forest , from the same time period , buried under volcanic ash .
" Taken together , these two pieces of work are illuminating our understanding of how these vegetation systems work , " said Professor Scott .

MENLO PARK -- Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist David Halberstam was killed today doing what he had done for more than four decades : chasing down a great story .
Halberstam , 73 , died in a car wreck just a few miles away from a long - sought interview for a book he was planning about a legendary 1958 football game .
Driving the Pulitzer Prize - winning author was a UC Berkeley journalism graduate student drawn by the chance to spend time alone with a living legend .
Menlo Park police are still probing the cause of the fiery three - car accident .
Halberstam , of New York , was in the passenger seat of a car that was broadsided as it was making a left turn off the westbound Bayfront Expressway , which connects to the Dumbarton Bridge , onto Willow Road about 10:35 a.m. , authorities said .
The car in which Halberstam was riding , a Toyota Camry , was hit by a late model Infiniti .
When paramedics and fire crews arrived , they found Halberstam unresponsive and trapped in the front passenger seat , said Harold Schapelhouman , chief of the Menlo Park Fire District .
The engine compartment was on fire and the passenger side of the car had been crushed , Schapelhouman said .
One rescue crew was able to pull Halberstam from the car while another doused the flames , the chief said .
The author had no pulse and was not breathing when he was freed , and efforts to revive him were unsuccessful , Schapelhouman said .
Halberstam was pronounced dead at the scene .
The author appears to have died of massive blunt force trauma , but an autopsy scheduled for Tuesday should confirm the cause of death , said Kristine Gamble , senior deputy coroner for San Mateo County .
Police declined to say who may have been at fault in the crash .
Cars turning left at the intersection onto Willow Road may proceed only when they have a green arrow .
The Infiniti driver suffered minor injuries , and the driver of a Nissan coupe that apparently was hit by one of the other cars was unhurt , authorities said .
The Berkeley graduate student driving the Camry , Kevin Jones , suffered a punctured lung and was taken to Stanford Hospital .
" It 's just a really hard time for him .
He 's feeling really sad and freaked out , " his wife , Lily Jones , said by telephone from the hospital 's emergency room .
" It 's just a very traumatizing thing to have gone through . "
She said she had not discussed the accident with him in detail .
Halberstam had been in the Bay Area to deliver a speech at UC Berkeley about what it means to turn reporting into a work of history , said Orville Schell , the dean at Berkeley 's graduate school of journalism .
Halberstam won the Pulitzer Prize in 1964 at age 30 for his reporting from Vietnam .
He later turned to long - form writing and wrote 21 books , including " The Best and the Brightest , " about how the United States became involved in Vietnam .
His other works covered a wide range of subjects , including civil rights , sports and the auto industry .
But Halberstam's own journalistic career was anything but history , said John Eckhouse , a member of the journalism school 's alumni board , which arranged the event this past Saturday .
" He had just finished the galleys on Thursday for his latest book on the Korean war , " Eckhouse said .
" He spent Saturday in his room at the faculty club .
He said if he could come over to our ( afternoon ) event he would , but he had some editing to do , some writing to do . "
Halberstam 's Saturday evening speech was a rousing success , Schell said , with a packed house of journalists and members of the public .
" He was speaking about the need for passion to be a journalist , and the importance of it to the whole healthy functioning of the American political experiment , " Schell said .
" I think those two things were what made him something of an evangelist to the role of the journalist in our society . "
Afterward , Schell said , he and Halberstam dined at Berkeley 's Chez Panisse , talking late into the night about the parallels between the wars in Vietnam and Iraq .
Over the years , Halberstam had developed a habit of alternating weighty historical books with sports books , and he planned to follow up his Korean War book with a work about the 1958 NFL championship game between the New York Giants and the Baltimore Colts , often called football 's greatest game .
The game , won by the Colts in overtime , is widely regarded as having contributed to pro football 's modern popularity .
In his typically careful preparation , Eckhouse said , Halberstam had tracked down former 49ers quarterback Y.A. Tittle , who did not play in the championship but who had played the Colts two weeks before .
Halberstam hoped to gain insights into the play of Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas .
To get to the interview , Schell said , Halberstam approached the journalism school 's students , seeking a driver and offering unique compensation , as described in an e-mail from the school to the students : " He said he 'll give you a private seminar on the way back .
Details are vague , but this could be a really cool opportunity . "
Kevin Jones , a student whose resume already included awards from stints as a freelancer and at several small publications , had seized on that chance to have some face time with a journalistic icon , his wife said .
" He just wanted to get a chance to talk to somebody that he thought was interesting , " Lily Jones said .
" He does n't have class on Mondays and he thought this would be great opportunity . "
Tittle said he was in his Mountain View insurance office waiting at 11 a.m. , when he expected Halberstam would arrive .
At 12:30 , he said , his secretary came in and said he might as well go to lunch .
" I thought maybe something had come up with his family , " a shocked Tittle said this evening .
" He was only 2 miles away , 3 miles away . "

Sorry , there 's none here either
LAST year , as the southern hemisphere 's winter stretched Argentina 's vulnerable energy infrastructure to near breaking - point , Guillermo Moreno , the internal commerce minister , sought to assure the public that the fuel shortages would be only temporary .
“ It will rain diesel , ” he vowed .
Now , as the country faces its worst energy shortage in nearly 20 years , even a sprinkle of diesel would be a relief .
The end of May brought an unseasonably early cold snap , leading homes to turn up their heaters .
This , coupled with the failure of a power plant , caused the collapse of both the power grid and the fuel supply system .
In Buenos Aires , two of the wealthiest districts were plunged into darkness .
Across Argentina , electricity supplies to industrial users were severely curtailed , causing temporary workers to be laid off .
Service stations ran out of the compressed natural gas that powers many Argentine cars , including 90 % of the capital 's taxis .
At least this meant fewer jams , the official news agency noted brightly .
Analysts have long predicted that the consequences of the government 's populist energy policies would begin to be felt this winter .
During Argentina 's 2001 - 02 economic crisis , the government forcibly converted all energy tariffs from dollars to pesos , representing a cut of nearly two - thirds in their real value .
Since then , only a handful of modest increases have been permitted , resulting in energy prices that are some 40 % lower than those in neighbouring countries .
This has caused private - sector energy investment to grind to a virtual halt , while the economy has grown by nearly 9 % a year .
As a result , Argentina 's proven gas reserves have fallen from more than 20 years ' worth of production in the mid-1990s to less than ten years ' worth today , and it can no longer produce enough electricity to cover exceptional demand .
In spite of this , the country has managed to avoid big fuel disruptions over the past few years , thanks to a series of warm winters and ample rains that have boosted its hydroelectric output .
To cope with demand peaks , the government has also deployed an arsenal of short - term fixes — but at high cost .
Suspending gas exports to Chile has strained trans - Andean relations ; importing inefficient liquid fuels from Venezuela and electricity from Uruguay and Brazil is hugely expensive ; and forced rationing has hurt industrial production and the overall investment climate .
No significant increase in capacity is expected before the end of winter 2008 .
The energy chaos could hardly have come at a worse time for the president , Néstor Kirchner , who is up for re-election this October ( though his wife , a senator , is expected to run in his stead ) .
He had already lost credibility with voters by authorising a controversial change in the government 's method of measuring consumer prices , resulting in an official inflation rate well below private estimates of up to 15 % .
Now his government 's insistence that its energy policies are working seems equally laughable .
Moreover , the gas shortages have refocused public attention on a political bribery scandal involving the expansion of a gas pipeline in 2005 , which has already led to the departure of three senior government officials .
Energy executives , consultants and economists broadly agree on the path Argentina needs to take .
The price controls , which not only discourage investment but also push up demand , need to be replaced by a transparent system of controlled tariffs for low - income households and market prices for everyone else .
The government also needs to convince investors that their rights and contracts will be respected before they plonk down the billions of dollars necessary to bring the country 's energy system up to snuff .
But this would mean an end to the cheap gas and electricity that Argentina 's middle class has come to consider an inalienable right — and in an election year , no less .
As temperatures returned to their mild late - autumn norms this week , the government was able to breathe a sigh of relief .
But the respite may be short - lived .
Winter in the southern hemisphere officially begins on June 21st .
SAN FRANCISCO , June 17  Ian Clarke was a 23 - year - old computer scientist living in Scotland in 2000 when he started a global controversy by deploying an online system called Freenet .
The system was intended to make it possible to share information anonymously , and to make it virtually impossible to remove from the Internet once it was placed there .
Since then he has moved to the United States , gone back to Europe and returned to the United States , in the process starting three venture capital - backed companies .
But he has not given up on his original goal : to engender democracy by making it simple to share accurate information .
Mr. Clarke ’s latest project , a Web site called Thoof , is an attempt to improve on sites like Digg and Reddit , where communities of users filter and rank links to news articles and blog entries .
Thoof began operating on Friday in invitation - only mode and is set to open to the public next week .
Mr. Clarke is obsessed with the fact that even when accurate information exists on the Internet , it often does not have the political impact that it should .
Zoila Meyer did not realise she could deported for voting
Zoila Meyer , 40 , was investigated by immigration officials acting on a tip - off after she won election to the city council of Adelanto in 2004 .
Ms Meyer , originally from Cuba , quit after 10 weeks in office and applied to become a naturalized citizen .
But this month , she was arrested after investigators turned up at her home .
The mother - of - four had pleaded guilty in April last year to illegally voting in the election three years ago as a non-US citizen .
If they can do this to me , they can do it to anybody
Zoila Meyer
She was placed on probation and fined after admitting a misdemeanour charge of fraudulent voting .
But on 18 June , immigration officials showed up at her home and told her to go to their San Bernardino office , where she was handcuffed and arrested .
" I 'm scared , " she told the Associated Press .
" How can they just pluck me out of my family , my kids ?
" If they can do this to me , they can do it to anybody . "
Meyer was bailed and is due to appear on 18 July before an immigration judge , who will decide whether she should be deported to Canada , the last point of entry into the US on her record .
Ms Meyer currently lives in the San Bernardino County desert town of Apple Valley , where she has been studying for degrees to work in the justice system as a forensic nurse .
Lori Haley , a spokeswoman for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement , said : " People are arrested on immigration charges from all walks of life .
" She can plead her case before an immigration judge , if she feels that she has reason to seek release for removal . "
It was a sight to see : hundreds of alternative - newspaper people standing and cheering Bill Clinton as he walked onstage , hanging on his every word through a nearly hour - long talk and 45 minutes of questions , and then rushing to the stage to shake his hand , get his autograph , and take his picture .
When Clinton was president , alt - weeklies published plenty of attacks on him .
And a good many of us are way farther to the left than he is .
But when Clinton addressed the annual convention of the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies earlier this month in Little Rock , you 'd have thought he was talking to a room full of supporters at the height of an election campaign .
The AAN response , I think , reflects the deep anguish many of us feel about the Bush administration and the state of the nation .
Despite the tragedy in Iraq , the attacks on civil liberties , and the president 's low approval ratings , the Republican leadership in Washington is solidly behind George Bush , and the Democrats remain weak .
An intelligent , eloquent , focused Bill Clinton was a relief , and then some .
Speaking almost completely without notes , he flailed away at lobbyists , Karl Rove , Ralph Nader , the secrecy and lack of accountability of the Bush administration , the polarization in Washington , and the Republican Party 's vilifying of Max Cleland .
( The formerGeorgia senator lost both legs and an arm in the Vietnam War , Clinton noted : " How much more can you give to the country and still be able to function ? " )
He attacked Bush administration policies that , he said , have harmed not only our own security but that of people in other parts of the world .
He talked about the complex nature of the nation 's problems , the threat of global warming , our over - reliance on oil .
He bemoaned the high cost of health care , the rise in corporate leaders ' salaries and the flat wages of the average American , the enormous gap between the world 's rich and its poor , and the desperate plight of millions .
He criticized House Republicans ' approach to immigration .
" Our long porous borders have on balance been a great blessing to us , " he said .
And while the nation must be secure , he said , total security is impossible .
We'd be better off developing policies that win the friendship of other nations and people --- that build partnerships : helping address the health problems of other parts of the world , for example .
" These things are cheaper than war , " he said .
" And they work . "
Residents of Indonesia and Pakistan like Americans because we helped them following the tsunami and the earthquake , he said : " Thirty percent of our households gave " to tsunami-relief efforts .
" The opinion of America in Indonesia went up , and the opinion of Bin Laden went down . "
He urged " home - improvement " measures in the US : increased wages , affordable health care , more investment in education , a rational energy policy .
He pled for a " unifying politics . "
It 's not that politicians should n't have their differences , he said , but " we should n't be so mad that we can't hear one another talk . "
And , said Clinton , " we 've got to find ways to get back to evidence - based politics . "
( " Hillary was accused of being too wonkish " on global warming , he said , " which tickled me , because what we need are wonks . " )
Clinton is proud of his own record --- and he is proud of his wife 's record , during his administration and in the Senate .
And despite ground rules his handlers had set before his talk , he took questions about Hillary .
On her plans to run for president :
She has n't made a decision .
On her chances of being elected president if she 's nominated :
She 'll have a high negative rating by election day , but " it 's naive to think that anybody we nominate wo n't have a high negative by election day . "
Republicans will demonize the Democratic candidate , no matter who it is .
On his role if Hillary is elected president : " I 'll do whatever she asks me to do .
And I wo n't do anything she asks me not to do . "
Asked his opinion about Robert Kennedy Jr.'s recent article in Rolling Stone , charging that John Kerry , not George Bush , won the majority of votes in Ohio and thus won the 2004 presidential election , Clinton said Kennedy made " a compelling case . "
And , he said , " I think there 's no question that Al Gore would have won Florida " if all the votes had been counted accurately and all the people who wanted to vote had been able to .
He suggested issues that AAN journalists should raise during their fall Congressional election coverage .
Among them : " Do you believe in unilateral preemptive military action ?
And what should we do in Iraq now ? "
Asked for his insight into George Bush , who occasionally consults him , Clinton was cautious , insisting it would be " a violation of confidence " to comment much .
But , he said , " I think he believes most of what he says . "
Bush is more temperate on the issue of immigration than many Republicans in Congress , for example , " because he 's from Texas , " said Clinton .
And : " I think the reason he has given more money for AIDS is because he believes it is the right thing to do .
He is very strong and determined in what he thinks is right . "
Clearly , Clinton opposes many of the Bush administration 's policies .
But he kept returning to major themes of his talk : the need for a " unifying politics , " and the need for the media and the public to avoid simplistic , " cartoon " views of Bush : to " oppose what he is doing rather than ridicule him . "
( " I loved it when the Right Wing ridiculed me , " he said .
" When you ridicule someone , you underestimate them . " )
What alt journalists got in their nearly three hours with Clinton was dramatically different from what had been planned .
Reporting to her Denver readers last week , Westword editor Patty Calhoun --- who had moderated the question - and - answer period following Clinton 's speech --- disclosed the ground rules ( Clinton's ?
His aides ' ?) laid out prior to the event .
He would speak for 30 minutes and then take only two , pre-screened questions , which Calhoun would ask .
When a Clinton aide signaled by tapping his chest , Calhoun was to wrap things up .
But two questions in , Clinton was just getting warmed up , and more than half an hour later , ignoring his aide , he was still taking questions .
When Calhoun told him that the aide was about to lose it , Clinton retorted : " He 'll get over it . "
It was , of course , pure Bill Clinton : charming , captivating , and completely in control .
A masterful public speaker .
A masterful politician .
And stunningly intelligent .
For anybody worried to the breaking point about the Bush administration , it was impossible not to feel a profound sense of loss as Clinton discussed the country 's needs , Darfur , global warming , and the ideals of politics .
And it was impossible not to look ahead and wonder who among the Democrats ( and among the Republicans , if moderates could take back control of their party ) could be his equal .
Bill Clinton 's record is by no means perfect .
This newspaper objected to plenty of his policies .
And his astonishing sexual misconduct not only humiliated his family but severely damaged his party , making it easy for politicians with their own character flaws to masquerade as protectors of American values .
Clinton is right , of course , to chastise the media for " cartooning " politicians , and to remind us of the complex nature of national and international challenges .
But during that sordid Clinton - Lewinsky period , much of the American public seemed to react more intelligently and rationally than many politicians and much of the media .
Back then , the public seemed to have no trouble sorting things out , recognizing Clinton 's behavior as a dreadful but private matter , not worth the national attention it got , and far less significant than the challenges the country faced .
The posturing and sound bites of Clinton 's critics did n't seem to sway most Americans .
In the years since , though , the public seems to have become less discriminating , less willing to look beyond simplistic rhetoric , more accepting of fear - mongering .
Maybe September 11 changed things .
Certainly the attack on Pearl Harbor inspired actions by the Rooseveltadministration that horrify us now .
But surely , as we approach the fifth anniversary of that terrible , bright day in New York , we can begin to put our fear in perspective .
We are still two years away from the next presidential election , but within the year , the people who want to succeed George Bush will begin their campaigns in earnest .
And it will be time for the public to start assessing what those candidates say .
Surely we can act more intelligently than in November 2004 .
Maybe Bill Clinton needs to drop in on a lot of conventions , and a lot of cities .
Without notifying the public , federal agents for the past four years have assigned millions of international travelers , including Americans , computer - generated scores rating the risk they pose of being terrorists or criminals .
The travelers are not allowed to see or directly challenge these risk assessments , which the government intends to keep on file for 40 years .
The scores are assigned to people entering and leaving the United States after computers assess their travel records , including where they are from , how they paid for tickets , their motor vehicle records , past one - way travel , seating preference and what kind of meal they ordered .
In the Federal Register , the Homeland Security Department exempted ATS from many provisions of the Privacy Act designed to protect people from secret , possibly inaccurate government dossiers .
As a result , it said travelers cannot learn whether the system has assessed them .
Nor can they see the records to contest the content .
“ It ’s the largest database ever assembled in the world , ” the paper quoted one source as saying .
The agency ’s goal is “ to create a database of every call ever made ” within U.S. borders , it said the source added .
. . .
Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , told Fox News Channel : “ The idea of collecting millions or thousands of phone numbers — how does that fit into following the enemy ? ”
i.e .
Originally created to spy on foreign adversaries , the N.S.A. was never supposed to be turned inward .
Thirty years ago , Senator Frank Church , the Idaho Democrat who was then chairman of the select committee on intelligence , investigated the agency and came away stunned .
" That capability at any time could be turned around on the American people , " he said in 1975 , " and no American would have any privacy left , such is the capability to monitor everything : telephone conversations , telegrams , it does n't matter .
There would be no place to hide . "

UPDATE
UPDATE II
The Associated Press reported Friday that the Department of Homeland Security , over the last several years , has been secretly compiling detailed records of the travel activities of American citizens and assigning " risk assessment " ratings based on a whole slew of related information it collects and stores -- assessments which citizens have no right to review and which will be maintained by the U.S. Government for the next 40 years , ( via the excellent Wired blog 27B Stroke 6 ) : Federal law provides that citizens have the right to access records being maintained about them and to contest their accuracy , but Homeland Security has the power to exempt certain programs from that right of access , and -- needless to say -- it provided itself such an exemption here :
Privacy advocates were previously able to force DHS to shut down a similar program which also collected data concerning purely domestic travel pending enhanced privacy protections , but the just - revealed DHS program has been proceeding for years without the public 's knowledge .
It is also worth remembering -- because it seems to have disappeared almost completely from our public memory -- that USA Today revealed earlier this year that the NSA continues to compile comprehensive records of every telephone number which every person inside the U.S. calls , every telephone number from which they receive calls , and the duration of the calls .
We hear about these things , express a day or so of outrage , and then proceed with docility to accept it :
And all of that , of course , is to say nothing of the NSA 's ability not just to document , but also to listen in on -- in secret and with no oversight -- any and all international calls which Americans make or receive .
Combined , all of this ( , the surveillance activities that we happen to know about ) amounts to a vast amount of data that the Federal Government is now compiling and maintaining about the activities -- including the domestic activities -- of its citizens .
The Department of Homeland Security has rapidly become a multi-tentacled agency of domestic intelligence , and the NSA -- which , for the first several decades of its existence , had as its first mandate that it would never be turned against Americans inside the U.S. -- is being used exactly for that purpose , in ways that we know about and in ways that we almost certainly do not know about .
Worse still -- far worse -- the Government has developed these capabilities and instituted them almost entirely in secret , with no oversight of any kind .
And as this week 's revelation of this years - long travel data surveillance program makes clear ( as did the revelations of the NSA programs before that ) , there are almost undoubtedly entire spying and other data - collection programs of which we are still completely unaware -- " we " meaning not only American citizens , but also virtually none ( if not none ) of our representatives in Congress , or , for that matter , anyone else outside of the Bush administration .
If a Government is permitted to collect and maintain vast dossiers on its citizens , that information is going to be abused .
Period .
As James Bamford wrote last year in The New York Times : I had an ultimately inconsequential but nonetheless quite illustrative personal experience with this several months ago .
Back in July , when right - wing blogs were obsessed with investigating my personal life , including where I spend my time , this comment was left at Wizbang , in response to a July 21 post by Wizbang 's Kevin Aylward :
The information provided there by " Baggi " was accurate .
I left the U.S. on exactly June 22 , and as of July 21 , had not re-entered the country .
Knowing the date I exited the U.S. would not necessarily require access to a DHS data base .
It would be possible , for instance , for someone to have known that I left the country on that date by having access to the records of the specific airline I used to travel .
But to know -- as this commenter did -- that , as of the date of the comment , I had not re-entered the U.S. ( even for a day , or a few hours ) , would absolutely require access to non-public DHS customs and immigration data bases compiling data regarding international travel .
There is simply no other way to have known that ( let alone the " and more " to which the commenter obliquely referred ) .
We 're not supposed to have a Government which keeps track of what we do , absent some reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing .
Even with the most well - intentioned administration , it is self - evidently dangerous to allow the Government to maintain vast dossiers on tens or hundreds of millions of citizens .
Those dangers are exacerbated -- severely -- when , as has been the case to an unconscionable degree , the Government is permitted to do all of this almost entirely in the dark , with no meaningful checks or oversight of any kind .
And again , those conclusions are compelled by what we already know about all of this .
The universe of what we do n't know is assuredly vast .
Personally , I am going to have very little patience , understanding and tolerance for those who argue -- and there will be plenty of them , found everywhere -- that Democrats should use their new Congressional powers to investigate this administration only tepidly , delicately , and in the most limited and focus - group - tested ways .
There is absolutely a need to ensure that investigations proceed in an orderly way and that they not be driven by vindictiveness .
That 's all well and true .
But along with the rule of law , the idea that we are supposed to have a transparent and open government -- one which operates in secret only in rare and extraordinary circumstances , , when it truly needs to , not as a matter of course -- has been so discredited and forgotten that we almost reflexively accept , in a disturbingly sheep - like way , that we need not and should not know what the Government is doing because that is what is best for us ( just like we reflexively accept that they can violate the laws we enact because that , too , is best for us ) .
Surveillance technology is only becoming more potent , as is -- in some circles -- the mentality that the Government 's claimed need to " protect us " means that its power to monitor what we do ought to be unlimited .
Those two trends -- increasingly potent surveillance abilities combined with an increasingly submissive and authoritarian - minded public -- have the potential , actually the likelihood , to create all sorts of undesirable outcomes , to put it quite mildly .
The last thing that ought to happen is that these matters get decided without public awareness , let alone debate .
If our Government thinks it has good reason to start monitoring our actions and collecting and storing detailed data about how we live our lives -- including the millions of citizens suspected of no crimes -- then it ought to say what it wants to do and we can then debate if it ought to have that power .
Why is that proposition controversial ?
( Apparently , like the prior disclosures about domestic spying , there was no national security reason to conceal this program , since it was the Government itself which , after several years of collecting this information , just disclosed the travel data program in the Federal Register ) .
Aggressively investigating what the administration has been doing over the last five years , behind the impenetrable wall of secrecy it erected , is not an option , and it is n't something to do for drama , political gain , or emotional retribution .
It is vital because our democracy can only function if citizens know what its Government is doing .
There is more than ample ground for believing that this administration has engaged in all sorts of wrongdoing and lawbreaking .
Even if that were not the case , there are all sorts of questions that ought to be publicly debated , not decided by Dick Cheney in the dark .
There is no good or even decent argument -- none -- for believing that those matters ought to be simply left unexplored and undisturbed by Congressional Democrats due to some unseemly eagerness to show how " moderate " they are in order to maximize their prospects in the 2008 elections . :
I have a post at C&L regarding the warrior GOP Congressman from Indiana , Mike Pence . :
Via some creative Google and Technorati searches and the like , Todd Larason and Mona in comments have rather conclusively established that the " Baggi " referenced above is ( or at least repeatedly claims on right - wing blogs to be ) an employee of the Department of Homeland Security .
As I said in comments , I 'm not trying to suggest that this incident is the result of some exotic data - collection program , but am only using it to illustrate not just the potential -- but the inevitability -- of abuse when the Government collects and maintains information about the activities of its citizens .
The software will be tested in job centres later this year
So - called " voice - risk analysis software " will be used by council staff to help identify suspect claims .
It can detect minute changes in a caller 's voice which give clues as to when they may be lying .
The technology is already used by the insurance industry to combat fraud and will be trialled by Harrow Council , in north London , from May .
It will be tested on housing and council tax benefit claims first , before being rolled out to job centres later in the year .
Announcing the pilot , Mr Hutton said : " This technology aims to tackle fraudsters while speeding up claims and improving customer service for the honest majority . "
Further evidence
The BBC 's business reporter John Moylan explained that the system first analyses the characteristics of a caller 's " normal " voice to establish a benchmark .
This ensures it takes any natural variation , for example due to nerves or shyness , into account .
The software then looks for changes in voice tone and frequency and performs thousands of mathematical calculations to identify signs that someone could be lying .
Benefits staff can then ask for further evidence to support any suspicious claims .
Callers will hear a standard message before they speak alerting them that the technology is being used .
According to government figures , benefit fraud cost the UK economy about £ 0.7bn in 2005 / 06 .
For the Conservatives , shadow work and pensions secretary Philip Hammond said Gordon Brown 's obsession with a complex welfare regime was the real reason why so much was lost to fraudsters and cheats .
He said : " This government 's reaction to every problem is yet more Big Brother technology .
Given that £ 2.6 bn worth of benefits were overpaid last year alone , it 's disappointing that this re-heated lie detector initiative is the best it can come up with . "

• Press Release BudgetGovernmentUS
The benefits of a public service are not measured by revenues
Washington DC — Recent changes to the United States Postal Service ( USPS ) imposed by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy prompted reports of potential sabotage , lawsuits , and emergency Congressional hearings .
A new report , released today by the Center for Economic and Policy Research ( CEPR ) challenges long - standing misconceptions about and unrealistic expectations for the postal service ’s fundamental function as a public service .
This report proposes a clear alternative to calls for privatization or running the postal service “ as a business . ”
The US Postal Service Is a National Asset : Do n’t Trash It , by CEPR Senior Research Fellow Max B. Sawicky outlines the economic principles that illustrate how notions of privatization and self - financing of the USPS are bad for the economy and undermine the federally mandated universal service obligation .
“ It is common to declare the post office obsolete based on the decline in first - class mail , ” says Sawicky .
“ Rather than ruminate on ways to carve up the service until revenues cover costs , consider its unique assets and ask what more could the USPS do in the national interest . ”
Sawicky frames the public postal services ’ unique assets in a series of economic principles .
The last mile of postal routes — from main roads to individual delivery points , especially in low - density , rural areas — is not efficiently served by more than one mail delivery service , making the postal service a natural monopoly .
This means there is no efficiency to be gained from multiple last mile delivery services .
The concept of economies of scale , where increased output reduces the cost per unit of output , is seen in the postal service ’s tradition of low prices for every class of mail , regardless of the required trip from source to delivery point .
The postage for a first - class letter from Baltimore to Philadelphia is the same as one from Miami to Anchorage .
Reducing prices and expanding service would be a move in the direction of greater economic efficiency .
Cheap delivery of letters or packages to any US location is worth something to all , regardless of whether they use it .
The benefits of mail delivery extend beyond the direct users of the mail , making it an explicit public good , or what economists call an external benefit .
Historically , postal service expansion played a major role in the nation ’s economic growth since its inception during colonial times .
Economies of scope refer to the production of two related goods or services that result in combined cost savings .
The possibilities inherent in this economic concept could mean a robust future for the USPS .
But the execution of the concept , especially in the postal service ’s case , is fraught with neglect and abandonment .
For example , Sawicky recounts the abandonment of postal banking , which was successfully operated from 1911 to 1966 .
“ A strong public sector and postal service are essential under the current threats of a pandemic and an economic recession , ” says Sawicky .
“ As a public service , the United States Postal Service has provided a significant boost to the nation ’s prosperity and well - being .
Privatization for the sake of self - financing is a move in the wrong direction .
The service should be returned to a department of the federal government proper , expansion opportunities explored , and regular budget appropriations should cover any shortfalls in operating costs or promised benefits to postal workers . ”

Sometimes I get dangerous thoughts in my head , like “ I wonder what it would look like to see every ad in Times Square all on one page . ”
So when I knew I ’d be passing through Times Square this weekend , I made sure I had my camera .
For the purposes of this nearly purposeless project , I considered storefront signs the same as ads if they were flashy and glitzy like Times Square ads tend to be .
I ’m sure I missed a few , and there may be some I got more than once .
I do know that some appear to be duplicates , but are actually similar billboards in different spots .
Also , if an ad took up more than one billboard , I usually shot each billboard separately , unless it was a wraparound billboard on a corner , in which case I tried to get it in one shot .
So without further ado , here is every ad in Times Square .
More or less .
Drive across the empty reaches of the Great Plains , from the lost promise of Valentine , Neb. , to the shadowless side roads into Sunray , Tex. , and what you see is a land that has lost its purpose .
Many of the towns set in this infinity of flat have a listless look , with shuttered main streets and schools given over to the grave .
With upwards of $ 20 billion a year in federal payments going to a select few in farm country , you would think that these troubled counties would have a more vigorous pulse .
After all , corn and wheat prices are at record highs , and big manses here and there , with Hummers in limestone driveways , indicate that somebody is doing well .
It would be one thing if the despair and disparity in farm country were the sole products of history , if time had simply passed it all by .
But it comes as a jolt to realize that government policy is much to blame .
The Red State welfare program , also known as the farm subsidy system , showers most of its tax dollars on the richest farmers , often people with no dirt under their fingernails , at the expense of everybody else trying to work the land .
Like urban welfare before reform , agriculture subsidies reward those who can work the system — farming the government , as they call it around the diner .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A Pakistani student at a New York City high school was charged with a hate crime on Friday , accused of cutting the waist - length hair of a 15 - year - old Sikh .
The Sikh religion was founded more than 500 years ago in the northern Indian region of Punjab .
Adherents do not cut their hair or beards and wear turbans .
Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said Umair Ahmed , 17 , was charged with unlawful imprisonment as a hate crime , menacing as a hate crime , aggravated harassment , harassment and criminal possession of a weapon .
He faces up to seven years in prison if convicted .
“ The defendant is not accused of some schoolhouse prank but an attack on the fundamental beliefs of his victim ’s religion and his freedom to worship freely , ” Brown said in a statement .
“ Crimes of hate can never be tolerated here . ”
Prosecutors said Ahmed approached Vacher Harpal in a school hallway on Thursday armed with a pair of scissors and told him , “ I have to cut your hair . ”
When Harpal asked why and told him it was against his religion , Ahmed allegedly displayed a ring with Arabic inscriptions and stated , “ This ring is Allah .
If you do n’t let me cut your hair , I will punch you with this ring , ” according to prosecutors .
Once inside the bathroom , officials said , Harpal removed his turban while crying and begged Ahmed not to cut his hair , which had never been cut .
“ The defendant is then alleged to have used the scissors to cut the ( the boy ’s ) hair to the neckline and thrown the hair into the toilet and onto the floor , ” Brown said .
Late last year , six teenagers in northern India reportedly cut a Sikh boy ’s hair .
The incident sparked street protests and caused lawmakers to disrupt the Indian parliament .
Sikhs constitute nearly 2 percent of India ’s 1.1 billion population .
To the young programmers of the World !
The cry of the rebellion we launch here , in which we firmly implant our ideals alongside those of the Futurist painters , does not come from a little aesthetic minded clique but , on the contrary , expresses the violent desire that seethes in the veins of every creative programmer today .
We want to fight to the bitter end against the fanatical , thoughtless , and purely snobbish religious faith in the past , stoked by the nefarious existence of the academic journals .
We are rebelling against the sluggishly supine admiration for old operating systems , old languages , archaic standards , and against the enthusiasm for everything bug - ridden , rotting with code bloat , and eaten away by obsolescence .
And we judge unjust - criminal in fact - the habitual disdain for programs whose construction is different and original , new , throbbing with life .
Comrades !
We declare to you that triumphant progress in the other sciences has brought about , in humanity as a whole , changes so profound as to dredge out an abyss between the past and us free creatures who are securely confident in the radiant magnificence of the future .
We are nauseated by the despicable sloth that , ever since the 1970's , has let our programmers survive only through an incessant reprogramming of the glories of the past .
For the professionals of other disciplines , programming is still a land of the dead , an immense Pompeii still whitening with sepulchers .
But programming is being reborn , and in the wake of its political resurgence an intellectual resurgence is taking place .
In the expressways of our teeming cities , the pistons of our automobiles are fired by the spark of microprocessors .
In the land of the couch potatoes , computers control the appliances of our daily existence .
In the fields of traditional technology one is struck today by a new elan , by lightning - bright inspirations of something utterly new .
Only that programming is vital which finds its own elements in the people who use it .
Our forbearers drew material for their programming from the religious atmosphere weighing heavily on their programs .
We must now draw out inspiration from the tangible miracles of contemporary life , from the portable CD players that bring digital music to the masses , from the supersonic airplanes which achieve speed of flight through lightness of weight , the portable television sets which are available throughout the world and boot in less time than any computer system , from the convulsive struggle for the conquest of the unknown .
Then too , how can we remain indifferent to the frenetic activity of the great cities , to the utterly new psychology of programming that takes wing only after dark , to the febrile figures of the viveur , the cocotte , the hacker , the addicts to coffee ?
Because we propose to play our part in the badly needed renewal of all expressions of programming , we resolutely declare war against all those programmers and against all those institutions that , however they may camouflage themselves in raiment of pseudo - modernity , remain mired in tradition , in academicism , in a repugnant mental laziness .
We call on all young programmers to unleash their scorn on the whole lot of brainless canaille who in Computer Science applaud a sick - making reflorescence of spineless classicism ; who in MIT praise to the skies the neurotic cultists of network - transparent window systems - a hermaphroditic archaism ; who in computer companies heap financial rewards on a pedestrian and blind manual skill a la 1974 ; who in Berkeley adulate programming typical of pensioned - off government functionaries ; and in IBM glorify a farraginous rubbish heap turned out by fossilized alchemists !
In short , we rise up against the superficiality , banality , and slovenly , corner - workshop facility that makes most of the widely respected computer programmers in every region of Silicon Valley worthy , instead , of the deepest contempt .
Out with you , then , bought - and - sold rewriters of hack programs !
Out with you , archeologists infected with chronic necrophilia !
Out , atavistic executives , you complaisant panderers !
Out , gouty academics , besotted and ignorant professors !
Out !
Go ask the high priests of the True Cult , those guardians of Structured Programming Rules where the works of Henry Massalin are to be seen today ; ask them why the official operating systems do not even recognize the existence of self modifying code ; ask them where the art of User Interface is appreciated at its true worth ! . . .
And who takes the trouble to think about the programmers who do n't have twenty years of struggles and sufferings behind them but nonetheless are preparing works destined to bring honor to the homeland ?
Oh no , those critics ever ready to sell themselves have very different interests to defend !
The eXhibitions , the standards cartels , and the superficial and never - disinterested purchasing departments are what condemn the programming art to what is , plainly speaking prostitution !
And what should we say about the " Experts " ?
Come , come !
Let 's make an end once and for all to the layerists , the extensabilitists , the toolkit mongers , the librarians -
We have put up with them quite enough , with all those impotent programmers of useless software !
Let us make an end also to the wasters of disk space who clutter up our machines and profane our lightning - fast memories !
An end to the quick - money architecture of the jobbers of the prefabricated !
An End to the common run of program decorators , the fakers of technology , the masters of software cosmetology who sell themselves , and the slovenly and thick headed " managers " !
And here are our CONCLUSIONS resolute and in a nutshell .
With our enthusiastic adherence to Futurism we aim : 1 . To destroy the cult of the past , the obsession with all things old , academic pedantry , and formalism 2 .
To cast our scorn profoundly on every last form of imitation 3 .
To exalt every form of originality , even if foolhardy , even if extremely violent 4 .
To bear bravely and proudly the smear of " madness " with which they try to gag all innovators 5 .
To look on the lot of computer " scientists " as at one and the same time useless and dangerous 6 .
To rebel against the tyranny of the words " extensible " and " reusable " expressions so elastic that they can just as easily be used to demolish the art of Atkinson , Baumgart and Deutsch as well 7 .
To sweep out of the mental field of programming all themes and subjects already exploited 8 .
To render and magnify the life of today , incessantly and tumultuously transformed by science triumphant
Let the dead be buried in the deepest bowels of the earth !
Let the future 's threshold be swept clean of mummies !
Make way for the young , the violent , the headstrong !

If you have n't visited Ben Fry 's website before , I envy the experience you 're about to have .
( Be sure to visit his old MIT site , too . )
Ben Fry is Edward Tufte armed with a compiler .
Ben produces incredible dynamic visualizations with his custom Java - based , open - source processing language .
It even comes with its own custom IDE :
We think most " integrated development environments " ( Microsoft Visual Studio , Codewarrior , Eclipse , etc. ) tend to be overkill for the type of audience we 're targeting with Processing .
For this reason , we 've introduced the ' sketchbook ' which is a more lightweight way to organize projects .
As trained designers , we 'd like the process of coding to be a lot more like sketching .
The sketchbook setup , and the idea of just sitting down and writing code ( without having to write two pages to set up a graphics context , thread , etc ) is a small step towards that goal .
The idea of just writing a short piece of code that runs very easily ( via a little run button ) is a direct descendant of John Maeda 's work in Design By Numbers , and our experiences maintaining it .
( Yes , other languages and environments have done this first , but in our case , the concept is drawn from DBN ) .
It 's amazing stuff , more akin to sketching than coding .
Browse through the examples gallery to get a sense of what 's possible .
Ben 's latest Processing visualizations , baseball salary vs. performance , and isometric blocks , are like pages from an Edward Tufte book come to life .
And who can forget his classic zipdecode ?
If you 've gone this far with Java - based visualization , you might as well continue on to IBM's Many Eyes site .
You can't write your own visualization code here ; you 're stuck with the predefined visualizations they provide .
You can , however , upload and share the data sets you 're using to visualize from .
But you might wonder , what 's with all the Java ?
Could n't we do this dynamic visualization stuff with something more lightweight , something more appropriate for a web page ?
JavaScript is a possibility .
After all , we had Wolfenstein 5 k , a JavaScript clone of Wolfenstein 3D written in only 5 kilobytes of JavaScript , way back in 2002 .
Sadly , it does n't work in any modern browser , or even in any Microsoft OS newer than Windows XP Service Pack 2 .
But it 's an impressive piece of work nonetheless .
It foreshadowed just how reliant the web would become on JavaScript .
One such JavaScript visualization , Kyle Scholz 's music recommendation connected graph , is ponderously slow .
It leaves me wondering if JavaScript is really up to the task of visualization , even with the HTML Canvas element .

What about Flash ?
Surely visualization is a better use for Flash than the legions of advertisements ( and , now , video advertisements ) I 'm subjected to every day .
Although I can find some isolated visualizations in Flash , I 'm not seeing a vibrant visualization community there .

Surely visualization is a better use for Flash than the legions of advertisements ( and , now , video advertisements ) I 'm subjected to every day .
Although I can find some isolated visualizations in Flash , I 'm not seeing a vibrant visualization community there .
On the Windows side , there 's some hope for Windows Presentation Foundation , which ships in every Vista box .
WPF , and its lightweight cousin WPF/E , could enable lightweight , hardware accelerated visualization – something that 's sorely lacking from all the other options .
To see what I mean , try this WPF 3D sample , which runs entirely in the browser .
But the technology is far too new to have any kind of community .
If I wanted to see static illustrations , I 'd read a book .
But dynamic visualizations are n't quite there yet for web pages .
Right now , you have to pick your technology poison .
They all have their downsides .
Still , it 's something worth striving for .
I yearn for the day when web pages are regularly illustrated with the kind of beautiful , dynamic visualizations that Ben Fry creates .
Schumer :
It 's ' highly unlikely ' Alberto Gonzales stays attorney general Josh Catone
Published : Sunday March 18 , 2007 Print This Email This On NBC's Meet the Press this morning , Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) discussed the US attorney firing scandal with host Tim Russert .
" I think it 's highly unlikely [ Alberto Gonzales ] survives .
I would n't be surprised if , a week from now , he is no longer attorney general , " said Schumer .
Gonzales " miscast his role " as attorney general , said Schumer .
Rather than be the " the chief law enforcement officer of the land , " Schumer said that Gonzales has instead acted as " the president 's lawyer who rubber stamps everything the White House wants . "
Schumer said that the investigation by the Senate Judiciary Committee is " moving along . "
" The Justice Department has actually agreed to be cooperative , and this week the staff will take depositions of five Justice Department officials .
Next week we will have them come to hearings .
They 've also given us all the documents , " he said .
Kyle Sampson , the recently resigned former chief - of - staff to Alberto Gonzales , will " very likely " voluntarily testify under oath , according to Schumer .
When asked if privileges given to White House advisers would stop the committee from forcing Rove to testify , Schumer responded by saying , " Well , we can subpoena them .
...
They could claim privilege .
But the claim of privilege is considerably weakened because the Justice Department documents already mention Karl Rove , they mention Harriet Miers ... "
" The bottom line for us is they'd have to come under oath and tell us the truth .
For instance , Karl Rove said that he -- Tony Snow , rather , the president 's spokesperson , said that Karl Rove has said that he was against the firing of the U.S. attorneys , the 93 U.S. attorneys .
If Karl Rove says that under oath directly to us , that 's a lot of different than Tony Snow saying it .
The White House spokesperson had said , for instance , that Karl Rove was not at all involved in the Scooter Libby incident , and he was , " Schumer continued .
Russert then asked Schumer about Karl Rove 's assertion that the scandal is politically motivated .
" Well , I think Karl Rove does n't get it .
Here is the problem :
Of course , every president has the right to hire and fire U.S. attorneys at will , " replied Schumer .
" What 's different here is not simply that the president wanting this choice not that choice , but in these instances , the evidence is becoming more and more overwhelming that certain U.S. attorneys , and only certain ones , not all of them , but certain U.S. attorneys were fired because either they would n't prosecute a case that was politically advantageous to the White House , or they were prosecuting a case that was disadvantageous to the White House .
Every legal commentator , left , right , center , says you can't do that . "
Four of the fired US attorneys , said Schumer , believe that their removal had to do with involvement in ongoing investigations .
" But , Tim , we do n't have proof yet , conclusive , beyond - a- reasonable - doubt proof , " that the attorneys were fired for political reasons , Schumer conceded , " That 's why we have to go forward with the investigation . "
A full transcript of Meet the Press follows : # MR .
RUSSERT : Our issues this Sunday -- the attorney general of the United States under fire .
Why were eight U.S. attorneys removed ?
Did the Bush administration mislead Congress ?
With us , from the Senate Judiciary Committee , Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York .
And today marks the beginning of the fifth year of the war in Iraq .
Is it worth the cost in life and treasure ?
Should the U.S. send more troops or bring them home ?
With us , former congressman Tom Andrews , director of the Win Without War coalition ; former House majority leader , Tom DeLay , author of " No Retreat , No Surrender " ; Richard Perle , former chairman of the Pentagon 's Defense Policy Board ; and Congressman Joe Sestak , retired vice admiral of the U.S. Navy .
But , first , the attorney general will be going back to Capitol Hill to explain his role in the firing of eight U.S. attorneys .
With us , a man who will be a central part of those hearings , the senior senator from the state of New York , Democrat Chuck Schumer -- welcome .
SEN .
SCHUMER : Good morning .
MR .
RUSSERT : Will Alberto Gonzales survive as attorney general ?
SEN .
SCHUMER : I think it 's highly unlikely he survives .
I would n't be surprised if , a week from now , he is no longer attorney general .
He has just miscast his role , misperceived his role .
Instead of just being the president 's lawyer who rubber stamps everything the White House wants , he has a role , as attorney general , as the chief law enforcement officer of the land without fear or favor .
And on issue after issue , the U.S. attorney is obviously the most prominent and most egregious .
He 's bungled it .
And , Tim , if Attorney General Gonzales steps down , the White House has a real chance to clear the air , to restore faith that the rule of law will come first and politics second in the Justice Department not the other way around .
If they nominate somebody who , by their reputation and career shows that they put rule of law first , a person like a Michael Lucchese ( sp ) , a person like a Larry Thompson , a person like a Jim Comey .
These are conservative Republicans , but they put the rule of law first , and I hope that 's what the White House will do .
MR .
RUSSERT : What is the state of the investigation ?
When will the hearings begin and who will be part of those hearings ?
SEN .
SCHUMER : Well , the investigation is moving along ever since it started when we were first told -- when we asked just the question -- why were these seven U.S. attorneys fired ?
And they said , " Well , they all had bad records , " and then we got hold of their evaluations , and they were all excellent .
And then we found misstatement after misstatement .
What 's happened , thus far , is this :
The Justice Department has actually agreed to be cooperative , and this week the staff will take depositions of five Justice Department officials .
Next week we will have them come to hearings .
They 've also given us all the documents .
Secondly , we have to get the same information from the White House .
We 've met with Fred Fielding .
He is the counsel to the president .
He said he wants to be as forthcoming as the Justice Department has been in terms of documents and witnesses .
We 've asked for Karl Rove , Harriet Miers , some of their assistants , and Tuesday will be D - Day , because that 's the day he is going to tell us whether he does this or not .
I would give a -- I would offer a fervent plea to the White House to give us this information .
It 's going to come out , anyway .
There are too many people in the Justice Department who want the information to come out because they were so upset .
Just last night we heard from his attorney , that Kyle Sampson , Mr. Gonzales ' chief - of - staff , is really -- wants to come forward , it 's a real possibility that he will voluntarily testify , and he's at the center of this .
So that would really -- MR .
RUSSERT : So Kyle Sampson , the chief - of - staff of the attorney general has resigned ; is willing to come before your committee and testify under oath ?
SEN .
SCHUMER : He has said that he wants to do that , and I think that 's a very likely possibility .
MR .
RUSSERT : You cannot force White House aide , Karl Rove , or former White House Harriet Miers to come before your committee , can you ?
SEN .
SCHUMER : Well , we can subpoena them .
Senator Leahy has said he would .
He 's the chair of the judiciary committee .
They could claim privilege .
But the claim of privilege is considerably weakened because the Justice Department documents already mention Karl Rove , they mention Harriet Miers , so the way the law works , you can't claim privilege on some occasions but not on others .
MR .
RUSSERT : Would you be willing to testify -- have them give a deposition rather than come formally before your committee ?
SEN .
SCHUMER : Well , I think all that would have to be negotiated .
The bottom line for us is they'd have to come under oath and tell us the truth .
For instance , Karl Rove said that he -- Tony Snow , rather , the president 's spokesperson , said that Karl Rove has said that he was against the firing of the U.S. attorneys , the 93 U.S. attorneys .
If Karl Rove says that under oath directly to us , that 's a lot of different than Tony Snow saying it .
The White House spokesperson had said , for instance , that Karl Rove was not at all involved in the Scooter Libby incident , and he was .
MR .
RUSSERT : Let me turn to Mr. Rove .
He was at -- a week ago talked about this very issue .
Let 's listen to the president 's political adviser , Karl Rove .
MR .
KARL ROVE , PRESIDENTIAL POLITICAL ADVISER : ( From videotape . )
Look , by law and by Constitution , these attorneys serve at the pleasure of the president .
They traditionally are given a four - year term , and Clinton , when he came in , replaced all 93 U.S. attorneys .
But this is the right of any president , to appoint people to these offices .
They serve at the pleasure of the president , and my view is that this is , and unfortunately , a very big attempt by some in the Congress to make a political stink about it .
MR .
RUSSERT : Mr. Rove 's point is that President Clinton dismissed all 93 U.S. attorneys .
President Bush can fire any U.S. attorney he wants , and you 're simply making a political stink about it .
SEN .
SCHUMER : Well , I think Karl Rove does n't get it .
Here is the problem :
Of course , every president has the right to hire and fire U.S. attorneys at will .
Every president , when they come in , in a new term , like President Clinton did , basically cleans house and puts in new U.S. attorneys .
Ronald Reagan did within his first year , George Bush the First did within his first year , and this president , Karl Rove 's employer , George Bush , our present president , George Bush , did it .
All the U.S. attorneys were replaced .
What 's different here is not simply that the president wanting this choice not that choice , but in these instances , the evidence is becoming more and more overwhelming that certain U.S. attorneys , and only certain ones , not all of them , but certain U.S. attorneys were fired because either they would n't prosecute a case that was politically advantageous to the White House , or they were prosecuting a case that was disadvantageous to the White House .
Every legal commentator , left , right , center , says you can't do that .
That 's the one thing you can't do .
MR .
RUSSERT : Well , let 's be specific about this , because I want to show you what the attorney general said in January testifying before your committee .
Let 's watch Alberto Gonzales : MR . ALBERTO GONZALES , ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES : ( From videotape . )
I would never , ever make a change in the United States Attorney position for political reasons or if it would , in any way , jeopardize an ongoing serious investigation .
I just would not do it .
MR .
RUSSERT : Do you have any evidence that a U.S. attorney was removed , and that removal jeopardized an ongoing investigation ?
SEN .
SCHUMER : We do have evidence .
In fact , four of the U.S. attorneys who were fired believe that played a role in their removal .
Remember , these folks were called up , all of a sudden , on December 7th .
They thought they were doing a good job .
They said , " You 're not doing , you 're fired . "
" Why ? " " We ca n't tell you . "
Then they say -- there 's a little pressure -- they say they were n't doing their job right .
We get hold of the evaluations done by their peers , the judges , everyone in their district , they all get outstanding ratings , and then it comes out that in four of these instances they were asked to pursue cases -- individual cases , not a general policy -- they were asked to pursue individual cases that they thought they should n't , or they were perhaps pressured to stop .
So , yes , there is evidence there in the U.S. attorney 's mind .
But , Tim , we do n't have proof yet , conclusive , beyond - a- reasonable - doubt proof .
That 's why we have to go forward with the investigation .
MR .
RUSSERT : But this is a very serious charge .
Let me show you a map of the United States and where these U.S. attorneys come from -- there you 'll see , up in Michigan , and then we have them in New Mexico , Nevada , Arizona , Arkansas , Washington state , and two in California .
Where , specifically , did a U.S. attorney stop investigating or was a criminal justice case interrupted because of one of their removals ?
SEN .
SCHUMER : The most notorious is the Southern District of California , San Diego .
Ms. Lam , the U.S. attorney , had already brought about the conviction of Duke Cunningham .
It came out in the newspapers that she was continuing to pursue that investigation , and it might lead to others -- legislative and others -- and in the middle of this investigation , she was fired .
So I asked the deputy attorney general why was she fired ?
He said , " Well , she was n't doing enough immigration reentry cases . "
I said , " Really ? "
He said , " Did you tell " -- I asked him , " Did you tell her ? "
She said yes .
I said , " Well , did she improve ? "
This was back in the summer -- " Did she improve ? "
He said , " I have no idea . "
Well , gee whiz , if you 're firing someone in the middle of the most heated political investigation in America , do n't you think you ought to have a reason and know the reason ?
MR .
RUSSERT : We go back to , again , Bill Clinton , back in 1993 , when he fired all the U.S. attorneys , The New York Times wrote an editorial saying that the president had tainted the political process and the judicial process , and there was concern that , in fact , a U.S. attorney who was investigating Ways and Means chairman , Dan Rostenkowski , a Democrat , was removed a few weeks before he was going to make a major decision regarding the investigation .
SEN .
SCHUMER : But with Bill Clinton it was all of the U.S. attorneys at the beginning of his term , which every president has done .
The New York Times may think that U.S. attorneys should stay in regardless of the president .
There 's a good argument for that , but that 's apples and oranges , that is not picking out individual U.S. attorneys who were involved in very hot political cases and getting rid of them because things were getting too hot .
It 's a world of difference .
MR .
RUSSERT : But if you cannot prove that , in fact , a criminal investigation was interfered with , then this is all just political complaint , and nothing happens .
SEN .
SCHUMER : Oh , no .
Tim , this is very serious stuff .
Now , whether it reaches the level of criminality is one thing , but the U.S. attorneys are the chief law enforcement officer for federal law in each of their districts .
At the head of the Justice Building , on top of each Justice Building , when you walk in , is that eagle with the arrows clutched in her claws , and that symbolizes law without fear or favor .
And if U.S. attorneys , when they 're doing hot political cases , we 've had a tradition , we 've had a tradition for decades , that they have some independence while , once they 're appointed , and once they 're in office with an existing president , and if U.S. attorneys are to fear that if they pursue these cases against politicians that they will be fired , they wo n't do it .
And let me make one other point -- let us say a month from now some U.S. attorney somewhere in the U.S. indicts a politician , and that politician 's lawyer gets up and says what lawyers often say in these situations -- " It 's politics . "
Now more people are going to believe that .
So the rule of law , without fear or favor , is so important to this country , when you fire U.S. attorneys for political reasons , it 's serious .
And , look , this is not just Chuck Schumer for the Democrats .
They say it 's political -- ask John Sununu , ask Gordon Smith , ask the large number of Republican office holders who have said this is very wrong as well .
This is far deeper than politics .
MR .
RUSSERT : Paul McNulty , the deputy attorney general , came before the Judiciary Committee in February , was asked about this , and this was his response : MR .
PAUL MCNULTY , DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL : ( From videotape . )
All of the changes that we made were performance - related .
MR .
RUSSERT : Is that accurate ?
SEN .
SCHUMER : That 's totally inaccurate .
Paul McNulty , himself , I know him , he called me on the phone and said , " I am sorry that I did n't tell you the truth .
I was not told that these things were happening by the people who were supposed to brief me .
And now one of those people is Kyle Sampson , Kyle Sampson , the chief - of - staff to the attorney general .
And Kyle Sampson says everyone knew what was going on here .
We have to get to the bottom of this .
MR .
RUSSERT : Well , in fact , Kyle Sampson 's attorney , Brad Berenson , wrote this last night -- the fact that the White House and Justice Department had been discussing the subject since the election was well known to a number of other senior officials at the department including others who were involved in preparing the department 's testimony to Congress .
So the people who prepared Paul McNulty knew about this ?
SEN .
SCHUMER : Well , that 's what Kyle Sampson says , and we have a conflict in testimony .
We have -- the stories keep changing from so many people .
You know , a good lawyer will tell you , when the witnesses keep changing their stories , they are usually not telling the truth , and they have something to hide .
Our investigation has to get to the bottom of just that .
MR .
RUSSERT : There was an e-mail on Friday that was released from two members of the White House counsel staff regarding Karl Rove , and it said this : " Karl Rove stopped by to ask you , roughly quoting , how we planned to proceed regarding U.S. attorneys ; whether we were going to allow all the stay requests , resignations from all and accept only some of them or selectively replace them .
Now , Mr. Rove can easily say he was simply asking the question --
What was the White House counsel 's office doing or recommending ?
SEN .
SCHUMER : That is exactly true , and we do n't know yet Karl Rove 's exact position and actions .
That 's why we want to talk to him , under oath , directly .
But I will tell you this -- just a few days before , the White House said that the only person who was involved in this decision in the White House was Harriet Miers .
Then two days later it comes out that Karl Rove has done it .
Here is my advice for what it 's worth , I do n't know if they 'll take it or not , to the White House : Gather all the facts , gather them all together ; come clean with them ; give them to our committee ; let the witnesses testify .
Let 's see where this all goes , and then we can take corrective action to make sure it does n't happen again -- to let it leak out , to let the stories keep contradicting each other is no good for the administration , it 's no good for the Justice Department , and , most of all , it 's no good for America .
So let 's get all the facts out .
Let 's look at them thoughtfully , carefully , thoroughly .
Let 's not flinch from them , but then let 's take corrective action and move on .
MR .
RUSSERT : There are some supporters of the president who are saying , " Sure , Chuck Schumer 's a member of the Judiciary Committee , but he's also chairman of the campaign committee to elect Democratic senators , and this is all about politics . "
SEN .
SCHUMER : Yeah , this is much too serious to be about politics , and the bottom line is our committee is simply looking into the misdeeds in the executive branch , in the Justice Department , in the administration .
Anything that has to do with any elected official , any congressman , any senator , will be handled by the Ethics Committee so there is not conflict whatsoever .
MR .
RUSSERT : To be continued -- Senator Chuck Schumer , we thank you for sharing your views .
SEN .
SCHUMER : Thank you , Tim .
MR .
RUSSERT : And our viewers should know Attorney General Alberto Gonzales declined our invitation to join us on " Meet the Press . "
I believe I was the first person to tell you that once Hiller was hired on to the LA Times -- it would be a mess because of his Republican ties .... Bill Boyarski calls for an investigation into the tainted TIMES now .
I also told you about Rummy 's squash connection with Hiller .
Now we learn that Rummy was going to be a guest editor :
... It 's now Rumsfeldgate at the Los Angeles Times .
I 'm told that Donald Rumsfeld was asked to guest - edit the newspaper 's " Current " opinion section which appears on Sundays .
The ex-Defense Secretary is a long - time personal and professional friend of LA Times publisher David Hiller , who supervises the paper 's editorial , Op - Ed and opinion pages .
Rumsfeld also has strong ties to the LA Times ' parent company since he was a member of Tribune Co. 's board of directors for years ... read on
When will Karl Rove be asked to be guest editor ?
UPDATE : ( Nicole )
This is n't the first time the LA Times has used guest editors .
On Reliable Sources today , ( transcripts here ) :
KURTZ : A Hollywood producer guest - editing the " L.A. Times " Sunday opinion section , that was the plan hatched by editorial page editor Andres Martinez .
He handed the reins to Oscar winner Brian Grazer .
But publisher David Hiller wounded up -- wound up killing the special section , prompting Martinez to ( r)esign .
The reason ?
Martinez is dating a P.R. woman who works for Brian Grazer .
Joining us now by phone is Vernon Loeb , who recently quit as investigations editor of the " Los Angeles Times " .
Vernon , Andres Martinez says this whole controversy is overblown , but are you troubled by him bringing in Brian Grazer as a guest editor while dating his publicist ?
VERNON LOEB , FMR .
" L.A. TIMES " REPORTER :
Yes , I think there was a pretty obvious appearance problem here , and I think David Hiller , the publisher , and Jim O'Shea , the editor , did the right thing , obviously .
More at E&P .
So , because Martinez was dating an employee of a ( * gasp * )
Hollywood liberal , that had the appearance of impropriety , and necessitated the scrapping of the entire issue .
But it was okay for Hiller to ask his buddy , Don Rumsfeld , a far more direct association ?
Am I missing something ?
When in doubt , it 's clear that IOKIYAR is the rule for these bozos .
A little smug self - absorption might be a time - honored trait of at least some subsets of the under - 30 crowd .
But over the past few decades the prevailing disposition among college students – today labeled Generation Y or Millennials – has slid into full - blown narcissism , according to a study released this week .
The " all about me " shift means much more than lots of traffic at self - revelatory websites such as YouTube and Facebook .
It points , says the study 's author , to a generation 's lack of empathy , its inability to form relationships – and worse .
" Research shows [ narcissists ] are aggressive when they have been insulted or threatened , " says Jean Twenge , a psychology professor at San Diego State University and lead author of the report , called " Egos Inflating Over Time . "
" They tend to have problems with impulse control , so that means they 're more likely to , for example , be pathological gamblers [ or ] commit white - collar crimes . "
For some , the study validates their suspicions of educational and parenting techniques that put undue emphasis on the positive : tot - level self - esteem boosterism , luxury - as - necessity entitlement , and what one calls " instant fame - ification . "
" I can't imagine you can do a study on Gen - X , Gen -Y , Gen - Z and not have the takeaway be an inappropriate application of self - esteem , " says James Twitchell , an English professor at the University of Florida , Gainesville , and an author of books on cultural shifts in the US .
The trend is apparent even in student grading .
" Grade inflation is just [ another ] adaptation of Lake Wobegon to everyday life .
Everyone is ' above average , ' " he says .
But others – including proponents of the self - esteem movement , workforce experts , and students invited to assess the study 's unflattering mirror – take issue with the apparent lack of nuance in the study , still being reviewed for publication in a scholarly journal .
These young adults are " hard to define , " says Jody Turner of the Los Angeles business - strategy consultancy CultureofFuture.com .
" Most kids coming out of college are looking at ways of contributing but not giving up their material goals , " she says , and finding ways to do that by marrying Gen - X creativity with the " community desire " of other generations .
" You do have to be careful .
There 's a lot of conflicting evidence , " says Christina Hoff Sommers , a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington who has studied youths and morality .
" Millennials are also among the most hardworking and least inclined to self - destructive behavior , " she says .
" They 've behaved better than the Gen - Xers or the baby boomers ....
They 're closer to their parents than [ were ] previous generations . "
Still , according to the study , 30 percent more college students showed " elevated narcissism " in 2006 compared with 1982 .
Over 25 years , researchers have posed a series of " narcissistic personality inventory " questions , each with two possible answers , to more than 16,000 students , with the latest survey conducted last year .
That makes " current college students more narcissistic than baby boomers and Gen - Xers , " its authors conclude .
( Data points between 1982 and 1990 are few , says Professor Twenge , also the author of " Generation Me . " )
That quality can be amplified when school 's out .
" Gen -Y is the most difficult workforce I 've ever encountered , because part of them are greatest - generation great and the other part are so self - indulgent as to be genuinely offensive to know , let alone supervise , " says Marian Salzman , a trendspotter and senior vice president at JWT , the global advertising agency .
Millennials themselves do n't completely reject the new label .
But they offer some modifications .
" I know people who are attention - seekers and only think about themselves , " writes Jessica Riggin , a sophomore at California State University , Monterey Bay , in Seaside , Calif .
In an e-mail , she attributes the behavior mainly to overconsumption of low - brow media , which leads to crass celebrity - emulation among many of her peers .
She does n't buy in .
" I do n't care who Anna Nicole 's baby 's father is , " she writes , " and I do n't care who 's admitting themself [ sic ] into rehab . "
Ms. Riggin prefers another kind of social participation :
She volunteers at the Marine Mammal Center near her school and at the Monterey Bay Aquarium .
" We live in a society that emphasizes the power of the individual , " notes Zach Samson , a senior studying journalism at Northwestern University near Chicago .
" So it is very easy to see why my generation would be considered so narcissistic . "
Growing up , he was told he was " special , " he says , and that he could accomplish anything he worked for ( and he ended up interning with Oxfam , the antihunger group , last year in Thailand ) .
" But my parents were not emphasizing that I was this grand person who was better than everyone else , " Mr. Samson says , " just that I was unique , as was every other person . "
That kind of parenting is in line with the positive aspects of the self - esteem movement – success tied to relationships and the development of empathy , the inverse of narcissism , says Janis Keyser , coauthor of " Becoming the Parent You Want to Be , " the parenting bible of the '90s .
Some of the Twenge - study answers meant to indicate narcissism ( " I like to be the center of attention , " for example ) actually strike Ms. Keyser as " signals of somebody who is feeling insecure . "
Self - esteem today is often approached in terms of " personal worth " – feeling good about oneself , says Chris Mruk , professor of psychology at Bowling Green State University in Ohio .
But feeling good about oneself without demonstrating competence , he adds , does lead to narcissism .
" Our society tends right now to be a little more lopsided toward the feeling - good end , the individual end , " says Professor Mruk .
" You really do need to have both competence and worthiness .
The middle point is where the balance would be , " he says , " and where well - being would occur , both socially and individually . "

Gamelib
The gamelib project
Introduction
Gamelib is an attempt to provide a basic framework for game development in Common Lisp .
The initial aim is to get libraries ready for 2D games with a tile - based background and a 3D library for wire - frame display .
The early stages of the library will , essentially , be the extraction of " display and animation " code from two pre-existing games ( Gatlopp and Pantzer ) , to make an initial release of gamelib fairly rapidly .
License
Gamelib is released under an MIT license

Maurice Strong , Al Gore
Creators of carbon credit scheme cashing in on it
By Judi McLeod
There 's an elephant in global warming 's living room that few in the mainstream media want to talk about : the creators of the carbon credit scheme are the ones cashing in on it .
The two cherub like choirboys singing loudest in the Holier Than Thou Global Warming Cathedral are Maurice Strong and Al Gore .
This duo has done more than anyone else to advance the alarmism of man-made global warming .
With little media monitoring , both Strong and Gore are cashing in on the lucrative cottage industry known as man-made global warming .
Strong is on the board of directors of the Chicago Climate Exchange , Wikipedia - described as " the world 's first and North America 's only legally binding greenhouse gas emission registry reduction system for emission sources and offset projects in North America and Brazil . "
Gore buys his carbon off - sets from himself -- the Generation Investment Management LLP , " an independent , private , owner - managed partnership established in 2004 with offices in London and Washington , D.C. " of which he is both chairman and founding partner .
To hear the saving - the - earth singsong of this dynamic duo , even the feather light petals of cherry blossoms in Washington leave a bigger carbon footprint .
It 's a strange global warming partnership that Strong and Gore have , but it 's one that 's working .
Strong is the silent partner , a man whose name often draws a blank in the Washington cocktail circuit .
Even though a former Secretary General of the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( the much hyped Rio Earth Summit ) and Under - Secretary General of the United Nations in the days of a beleaguered Kofi Annan , the Canadian born Strong is little known in the Unites States .
That 's because he spends most of his time in China where he works to make the communist country the world 's next superpower .
The nondescript Strong , nonetheless is big cheese in the world of climate change , and is one of the main architects of the coming - your - way - soon Kyoto Protocol .
Gore is the glitzy , media approved front man in the partnership , the flashing neon lights on the global stage warning the masses of the end of Earth , as we know it , and Hollywood 's poster boy for greening the silver screen .
The skeptics of man-made global warming believe that Gore and Strong have made climate change " the new religion " .
Climate change is not the first religion both parties have tried to make stick .
Along with former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev , Strong , currently president of the Earth Council , has been boasting of replacing the Ten Commandments with the Earth Charter , a golden rule guide for how the masses should treat the environment .
Gore , who has given sermons at the United Nations sponsored Cathedral of St. John the Divine Church in New York City , is a promoter of the religion known as Gaia .
The two environmental gurus also share a belief in radical Malthusian population reduction .
According to them , too many people , particularly in the U.S. are polluting the planet , emitting excessive Freon through their refrigerators and jacking up the air conditioning .
But the conduct of Al Gore and Maurice Strong in the capitalist world is one for the books .
It 's a side of them that may have remained unknown had it not been for the investigative talent of the Executive Intelligence Review ( EIR ) .
The tawdry tale of the top two global warming gurus in the business world goes all the way back to Earth Day , April 17 , 1995 when the future author of An Inconvenient Truth traveled to Fall River , Massachusetts , to deliver a green sermon at the headquarters of Molten Metal Technology Inc. ( MMTI ) .
MMTI was a firm that proclaimed to have invented a process for recycling metals from waste .
Gore praised the Molten Metal firm as a pioneer in the kind of innovative technology that can save the environment , and make money for investors at the same time .
" Gore left a few facts out of his speech that day .
First , the firm was run by Strong and a group of Gore intimates , including Peter Knight , the firm 's registered lobbyist , and Gore 's former top Senate aide , " wrote EIR .
" Second , the company had received more than $ 25 million in U.S. Department of energy ( DOE ) research and development grants , but had failed to prove that the technology worked on a commercial scale .
The company would go on to receive another $ 8 million in federal taxpayers ' cash , at that point , its only source of revenue .
" With Al Gore 's Earth Day as a Wall Street calling card , Molten Metal 's stock value soared to $ 35 a share , a range it maintained through October 1996 .
But along the way , DOE scientists had balked at further funding .
When , in March 1996 , corporate officers concluded that the federal cash cow was about to run dry , they took action : Between that date and October 1996 , seven corporate officers -- including Maurice Strong -- sold off $ 15.3 million in personal shares in the company , at top market value .
On Oct. 20 , 1996 --a Sunday -- the company issued a press release , announcing for the first time , that DOE funding would be vastly scaled back , and reported the bad news on a conference call with stockbrokers .
" On Monday , the stock plunged by 49 % , soon landing at $ 5 a share .
By early 1997 , furious stockholders had filed a class action suit against the company and its directors .
Ironically , one of the class action lawyers had tangled with Maurice Strong in another insider trading case , involving a Swiss company called AZL Resources , chaired by Strong , who was also a lead shareholder .
The AZL case closely mirrored Molten Metal , and in the end , Strong and the other AZL partners agreed to pay $ 5 million to dodge a jury verdict , when eyewitness evidence surfaced of Strong 's role in scamming the value of the company stock up into the stratosphere , before selling it off .
In 1997 , Strong went on to accept from Tongsun Park , the Korean man found guilty of illegally acting as an Iraqi agent , $ 1 million from Saddam Hussein , which was invested in Cordex Petroleum Inc. , a company he owned with his son , Fred .
In that year , Gore , still U.S. vice president , was making news for " taking the initiative in creating the Internet . "
The leaders of the man -made global warming movement , you might say , get around .
Meanwhile Jumbo's still in global warming 's living room , but the duo with the tiniest carbon footprints on earth continue to just tiptoe past him .

SANTIAGO ( Reuters ) - The Chilean government wants Google to fix its Earth geographical search program that places a village named after Chilean independence hero Bernardo O’Higgins in Argentina .
The satellite image shows Villa O’Higgins , a tiny hamlet 1,000 miles ( 1,600 km ) south of the Chilean capital , Santiago , on the Argentine side of the border .
“ Chile has asked for this to be rectified , and it can only be hoped they do it soon , ” a Foreign Ministry spokesman in Santiago told Reuters on Saturday .
He declined to say when the complaint was filed .
Chile and Argentina share the southern cone of South America , where the border between the two nations runs through a complex landscape of islands , fjords and mountains .
The two countries nearly went to war in the late 1970s over ownership of remote islands in the south .
The dispute was resolved with the intervention of the Pope .
“ We have received the request and are working with our partners to get more precise data for the region , ” said Google spokeswoman Megan Quinn .
“ We ’re constantly working to improve the quality and accuracy of our maps .
This is an ongoing process as we receive new information from third party data providers and as names and borders around the world continue to evolve , ” Quinn said .

Sex , Drugs and Updating Your Blog describes how some small - scale recording artists are succeeding on the web .
One interesting bit mentions the “ pay what you can policy ” used by Jane Siberry .
The result : People wind up paying more than they would at iTunes .
The Canadian folk - pop singer Jane Siberry has a clever system : she has a “ pay what you can ” policy with her downloadable songs , so fans can download them free — but her site also shows the average price her customers have paid for each track .
This subtly creates a community standard , a generalized awareness of how much people think each track is really worth .
The result ?
The average price is as much as $ 1.30 a track , more than her fans would pay at iTunes .
Choose an option and you see stats on what other customers chose :
Her store provides an open letter that explains the policy :
Like many , I ’m restless and impatient with living in a world where people are made to feel like shoplifters rather than intelligent peoples with a good sense of balance .
I want to treat people the way I ’d like to be treated .
‘ Dumbing UP ’ ( as opposed to ‘ dumbing down ’ ) .... You decide what feels right to your gut .
If you download for free , perhaps you ’ll buy an extra CD at an indie band ’s concert .
Or if you do n’t go with your gut feeling , you might sleep poorly , wake up grumpy , put your shoes on backwards and fall over .

Since the twin Voyager spacecraft flew past Saturn ’s moon Titan , Scientists have been excited about what its hazy atmosphere can tell us about the earliest days of our own planet .
The Voyagers discovered that Titan ’s atmosphere is swirling with hydrocarbons and other complex organic molecules that could be the building blocks of life .
The latest findings from NASA ’s Cassini spacecraft have uncovered these organic molecules floating higher in Titan ’s atmosphere than scientists originally thought possible .
This latest research has been published in the May 11 , 2007 edition of the Journal Science .
It shows that these organic aerosols , called tholins , have been found in altitudes higher than 1,000 kilometres ( 620 miles ) above the surface of Titan .
And these molecules are formed differently than how scientists originally believed .
This inquiry is important because the Titan ’s environment is thought to be very similar to the Earth ’s early history , before the first life formed .
A similar process could have happened here .

The State Department has hired two native Arabic speakers to monitor Arabic political discussion forums on the Internet and to overtly participate in them in an effort to correct misperceptions about U.S. policy in the Middle East .
The small “ digital outreach team , ” which also includes a supervising Foreign Service officer , was created in December by Karen Hughes , undersecretary of state for public diplomacy , as part of her campaign to prevent mistakes and speculation about the United States from being accepted as truth , officials said .
“ We want to make sure that U.S. views are present in the Arabic cyberspace , ” said Jeremy Curtin , acting coordinator of the Bureau of International Information Programs at the State Department .
“ The two people who were hired just before Christmas monitor Arabic sites on current affairs in the Middle East and other issues we are interested in , ” he said .
“ They identify themselves as U.S. government employees . ”
Mrs. Hughes , a close friend and former adviser to President Bush , was appointed in 2005 to help improve perceptions of the United States overseas , particularly in the Arab and Muslim world , which suffered because of the Iraq war and other U.S. policies .
She has spent considerable time traveling to the Middle East , as well as meeting with Muslims in Europe and the United States .
She also has focused on exchange programs that bring Muslims to the United States .
“ There is an information explosion , and we are competing for attention and credibility in the midst of that explosion , ” Mrs. Hughes said in Mexico last month .
In addition to the new digital outreach team , the State Department employs as many as a dozen Arabic speakers who monitor various news outlets in the Middle East .
Some of them also help a so - called rapid - response team that reads all lead stories in the Arab press and writes guidance for U.S. embassies in the region if a response is deemed necessary or useful .
“ The first step of success is to be there and have people respond ” to publicly expressed views , Mr. Curtin said .
“ The second step is to engage in a conversation .
We try to adopt an informal tone , and we are careful what we say . ”
In a forum on one of the sites regularly monitored by the State Department ( www.egyptiantalks.org), the team recently began a thread asking , “ Will violence end in Iraq if U.S. forces withdraw ? ”
Another poster wrote that the thread was probably started “ in preparation for withdrawal from Iraq , so that the U.S. government can say that it has listened to Arab public opinion , ” Mr. Curtin said .
One of the team members responded that he was simply “ trying to stimulate discussion , ” adding that “ the U.S. is not planning a sudden departure ” from Iraq .
“ The plan all along has been to train and equip Iraqi forces to handle their own security , and , as they make progress in that area , you will naturally see a drawdown of U.S. forces . ”
In another thread , participants discussed “ accusations that the U.S. military is engaged in widespread rape of men and women in Iraq , ” Mr. Curtin said .
One of the posters accused the State Department team of discounting all accusations .
“ I never said nothing happened , ” the team member replied .
“ I stated that , when there have been cases of misconduct by U.S. soldiers against Iraqi civilians , a legal process has been implemented .
I also said allegations that such misconduct is widespread are untrue and unproven . ”
Mr. Curtin said that even when posters disagree with U.S. policies or opinions expressed by the State Department team , they are “ polite , respectful and courteous . ”

Oct. 27 , 2006  --
Most parents would agree that their kids always seem to grow up too quickly , but now , puberty is hitting young girls earlier than ever .
Nearly half of African - American girls start showing signs of puberty by 8 years old , and some American girls are developing as young as 5 , even 4 years old , experts say .
Skyla Jones is an energetic 5 - year - old from Georgia who loves to play .
Last year , her mother , Melissa Jones , noticed Skyla was tired all the time , had a body odor , and had blood in her urine .
" I did n't know what was going on , " Jones said .
" I just went ahead and thought she had a kidney infection .
And we went on antibiotics and still it did n't clear it up . "
Skyla was eventually sent to Andrew Muir , a pediatric endocrinologist at the Medical College of Georgia , who knew exactly what was going on .
Skyla was menstruating and was experiencing other unmistakable signs of puberty .
" That 's what he told me that it was -- that she was having a menstrual cycle , " Jones said .
" I was really freaked out . "
Studies have tracked an increasing trend of early sexual development .
By age 8 , almost half of African - American girls and 15 percent of Caucasian girls start developing pubic hair or breasts .
" The switch that normally gets turned on for pubertal development gets turned on too early , " said Dr. Diane Stafford of Children 's Hospital in Boston .
Until recently most doctors did n't expect to see these signs until age 10 .
" It can have many causes , " Muir said .
" Some are related to genetics , environmental factors , and sometimes we just do n't know why it happens . "
For Skyla , a thyroid problem caused her symptoms .
While she was too young to really understand what was happening , her mother worried that other kids might .
" I was worried kids would make fun of her because kids are cruel , " Jones said .
Because Skyla started treatment for her thyroid problem , all her symptoms have gone away .
Muir expects her next experience with puberty to be at a more reasonable age .
How I got banned from Google Adsense for life
Maybe you 've noticed , for the last few days some google ads appeared on this blog , but they have disappeared now again .
That 's because I just got banned from google adsense for life time ( as it seems ) , although I did n't do anything wrong .
Here is the story : This blog and the related other websites are getting more popular every month and generating more and more traffic .
So I thought it would be a good idea to place some few non-disturbing ads on the page to get in the costs of the webservers again .
So I did this and after two weeks it looked like it worked out :
The statistics at adsense told me I would get some very small amount of money out of it , enough to pay my costs .
Then in the beginning of this week , I released a new version of some free software ( irrKlang 0.5 )
I am working on in my spare time and this generated some attention : Several game development pages and blogs linked to my website , increasing its traffic .
The next morning , I received a mail from google , telling me that my account was suspended and on their site it reads that I 'll never be able to do business with google again , because of invalid clicks on my ads .
WTF .
In that mail , they did not even tell me any information about their problem with my ads , only " invalid clicks or page impressions " .
No IP adresses , no channel ID , no website , no time or date , no amount of clicks , nothing .
No way for me to find out what was wrong .
There was the possibility to contradict , and I tried to explain some possible causes like the sudden increased amount of traffic , but they ignored me .
The interesting thing :
They now even wo n't pay out the money I already earned before the occurance of their ' invalid clicks ' assert .
So from one day to the other , google completely locked me out of their program and are witholding all my money , without telling me why , no possibility to defend myself , being sure that I did n't do anything wrong .
And lets assume :
Even if for example some east asian click fraud company clicked a thousands of times on my ads ( which I 've read is today a standard way of companies getting rid of their competition ) , why the hell are they punishing ME for this ?
Do no evil ?
Sure , but it seems this is only valid if it has n't to do anything with money .
I 'm going to use some alternative ad providers now , if I find some good ones usable in Europe / Austria .
A bit more than a week later , google sent me a mail , apologizing for the trouble and unlocked my account again .

man that ’s crazy !
would be interesting to get to the bottom of this story – maybe someone should slashdot this — although that venue seems to think Google can do no wrong .
sure makes me think twice about setting up adsense on my site .

niko - 22 02 07 - 20:18
yeh you are probably right , even if it makes the front page its unlikely google would do anything to rectify this , but I just think what they did is wrong , and at least maybe some more people will know .
buhatkj - 22 02 07 - 20:22
so thats what you meant with losing your primary source of incomce …. and i thought you were talkin about your job ! :)

Some time ago I commented one of your blog entries and ( silly me ) entered my primary e-mail address in email field .
For last week or so I ’m getting spammed through it with some kind of completely nonsense spam messages , which appear to be sent automatically through allegeldy newly added comments on that thread ( that do not exist ) .
Maybe your site really is target of some strange spambot clicking through all the links …
It does not make google less ignorant , but maybe those things are connected .

Shame you ca n’t sue Google somehow but then that is what happens when a company is really big .
Impossible to put a dent in them . :P
Frobozz - 23 02 07 - 21:32
Maybe it was do - gooders clicking links as a thank - you for all your work , which caused your click - through ratio to increase to levels above some fraud threshold .
You should write back to Google and explain the situation , and include links to Irrlicht ’s download statistics , explain that you have a massive community and have only just started with AdSense .
Hopefully a real person will look into it , rather than a fraud - bot .

youtube is owned by google , i bet viacom paid some cash to google to stop adsense from your site niko , after that victory over viacom post you made !

When dinosaur hunters discovered the huge thighbone of a teenage Tyrannosaurus rex buried under tons of rock on a Montana cliffside four years ago , they were amazed to find what seemed to be soft tissues still preserved inside the bone after 68 million years .
Few scientists believed that any organic material in a fossil could last that long without turning to stone , but when Mary Schweitzer , a paleontologist at North Carolina State University , removed all the minerals that had formed the bone , she found fragments of tough , ropy fibers and what appeared to be clusters of intact cells and flexible blood vessels .
Under her scanning electron microscope , the material looked identical to blood vessels in modern ostrich bones .
It was the first time anyone had detected soft tissue in a dinosaur fossil , and Schweitzer 's tests convinced her that the ropy material was collagen , the main protein of connective tissue that makes bones strong and flexible in all animals , ancient or modern .
Now , with the most sophisticated equipment yet developed to analyze protein tissue , Harvard University researchers have determined the precise sequence of amino acids in seven fragments of Schweitzer 's dinosaur collagen -- the first time any tissue from such an ancient fossil has ever been precisely analyzed , and a possible clue to the nature of the genes behind the sequences .
The new tools used by Schweitzer and her Harvard colleagues are yielding novel molecular insights into the evolutionary paths that have led from the dinosaurs to their modern descendants -- the birds of today .
More than that , Schweitzer said Thursday in a teleconference with reporters , the Harvard technology should also help clarify the relationships between long - extinct fossils of many animals whose modern counterparts remain unknown .
Two reports on this first sequencing of amino acids in a dinosaur fossil are being published today in the journal Science .
Besides Schweitzer , the authors include John Asara and Lewis Cantley of Harvard Medical School and its Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , and John Horner , the famed dinosaur hunter at Montana State University 's Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman , Mont .
Horner , who led the fossil excavation , said the dinosaur must have become fossilized in sandstone rather than in wet mudstone after it died near a stream in what was once a sandy wasteland .
Those circumstances help explain how the animal 's soft tissues could have been preserved so long .
" If you think about a giant Tyrannosaurus drumstick rotting in the sand , " Schweitzer said , " the difference between sand and mud is that as tissues begin to liquefy and suppurate , the enzymes of decay and degeneration are drained away in sandstone , whereas in a mudstone it just sits and stews in its own juices . "
Horner said a major expedition this summer will seek more dinosaur fossils in a similar state of " exquisite preservation " embedded in the ancient sandstones of Montana and Mongolia .
The Harvard scientists employed uniquely sensitive new mass spectrometry instruments used for medical research to analyze seven fragments of Schweitzer 's dinosaur collagen , weighing a total of only 40 milligrams -- about a thousandth of an ounce .
They found three amino acid sequences that precisely matched those of modern chickens .
One matched a newt sequence , one matched a frog , and two matched collagen from chickens and several other animals , Asari said .
Schweitzer said she had also conducted antibody tests of the dinosaur and chicken collagen and found a surprising match there , too .
Besides the dinosaur samples , Asari said he had also been able to sequence protein fragments from a mastodon fossil estimated to be 16,000 to 600,000 years old -- another indication that under the right conditions proteins can remain remarkably stable over longer periods than anyone had previously thought .
In the records of past fossil discoveries , Schweitzer said , soft tissue has never been recovered from anything older than a million years , and she and her Harvard colleagues now hope to sequence the proteins in the cells and blood vessels she found in her T. rex bone .
UC Berkeley dinosaur evolution expert Kevin Padian , who was not involved in this new research , noted that for 15 years molecular biologists had been insisting that Schweitzer could not possibly get molecules out of a 68 million - year - old fossil , and that her methods were flawed despite all the many tests she used that confirmed her work .
" But the lesson , she 's saying now , is that nature does n't work like a lab bench , " Padian said .
" Chemicals that might degrade in a laboratory over a short period need not do so in a protected natural chemical environment .
Mary Schweitzer is just the best there is , so it 's time to readjust our thinking . "
As for the Harvard work sequencing the ancient protein for the first time , Padian called it " a brilliant technical achievement , and it 's because we know that birds evolved from dinosaurs that it makes sense . "

So the Expat Software offices have officially moved to Spain .
It 's sunny here every day .
The buildings are made of stone .
You can walk places .
Name me one city in America where they have all that and maybe I 'll move back .
Oh , and you 'll also need to find me a huge 3 bedroom apartment overlooking the town square of that city for less than a crappy studio would cost in the bad part of Seattle .
Getting this place was hard .
At least , it was hard for me and my girlfriend because neither of us speaks Spanish .
I mean sure , we can order beers and ask about hotel rooms and that sort of thing .
But we were in no way prepared to deal with the hassle of buying real estate in a foreign land .
Hopefully , if I spell out some of the things we did n't know , it might help somebody else !
Stupid simple things :
Spanish people like their families , so Spanish houses are HUGE .
In the countryside , you 'll have trouble finding anything with less than 6 bedrooms .
Seriously .
Renting a house is going to be hard .
In cities and towns , homes are often the entire floor of a building .
You can find smaller apartments , but they are still called a " Piso " ( floor ) .
So if you 're looking to rent one , you 're looking for a Piso en Alquilar .
It 's nearly impossible to find rental property in Spain on the Internet .
There are tens of thousands of websites devoted to finding holiday flats for Brits traveling to Costa Blanca , so any search for apartment rentals in Spain is futile .
Here are a few sites we found locally that actually rent property to Spaniards :
https://www.inmof3.com/
https://www.inmobiliaria.com/
https://www.enalquiler.com/
You can wander around your target town , looking for " en Alquilar " signs in windows and try making phone calls in a foreign tongue ( hard ) , or you can go to the various " Immobilaria " ( real estate ) offices scattered around and ask them .
It will still be a struggle , as nobody ever speaks English , but at least you can use hand gestures and point to things in dictionaries and so forth .
Spanish leases are One Year Minimum , so you 're basically hosed if you want to find a place for 6 months .
We spent an entire day walking around Pamplona trying to get around this fact , with no luck at all .
If you 're gonna go , go big .
Nobody will rent to you for less than a year .
Painful details
You 'll need a Spanish bank account .
All the utilities and rent payments will need to be set up as direct debits from a Spanish bank .
Overseas banks wo n't cut it .
Even if you have a Barclays account at home , and there 's a Barclays branch next door to the real estate agent , you 're still screwed .
International banking is not yet up to speed that way .
You 'll need to open an account locally , which is hard because …
You 'll need a Spanish address to open a bank account .
This seems more of a showstopper than it actually is .
If you have a sympathetic real estate agent on your side , you 'll hopefully be able to sit everybody down in the bank and work things out .
In this case , it definitely helps to have an account with an overseas branch of the same bank .
At least then it 's sort of in the bank 's best interest to help you out .
You 'll need permission to reside in Spain to open a bank account .
This one is tough for Americans , because it 's hard to get a resident visa without a residence .
And you need to get that visa before you leave home .
We got lucky here because my girlfriend is English , and she was able to handwave around the issue with a bunch of broken Spanish about the UK technically being part of the EU and reciprocity and a bunch of other confusing stuff that exasperated the banker until he just signed the papers .
I think I would have been screwed here had I been on my own .
Likely I would have had to go from Bank to Bank until I found one that forgot to ask about my Resident status .
You 'll need permission to reside in Spain to stay there a whole year .
Uhh …
Ask me about this in a couple months .
The Spanish Embassy website is down right now , so I have n't quite gotten around to looking into this .
Yeah …
It 's easier to ask forgiveness than permission , right ?
Getting set up once you 're here
Assuming you 're a small software development house staffed with Expat Americans , your first concern when you get here will be getting ADSL into your new apartment .
For the task , this little page is Gold ( use Google 's language tools to translate it to English ) :
https://www.redaragon.com/informatica/adsl/
That will give you a bunch of info you 'll need to know about various DSL suppliers in Spain .
If your place already has a land line , you should be able to limp through the online signup process for one of those providers .
If , like me , you do n't want any more hassle at this point , you can do it all in English through the phone company ( though for a bit more money ) :
https://www.telefonicainenglish.com/
You 'll need a mobile phone too .
That 's easy though .
Walk in to any phone shop on the street and try to look helpless .
These people have one task in life : to supply mobile phones to those who do n't yet have them .
Things will work themselves out .
( We 're on HappyMovil , which seems to be really cheap compared to the others , with $.05 calls to the United States ! )
There are a bunch of other things to set up too , but if you 're lucky the real estate people will get them switched over for you .
Here is some good info on utilities and stuff :
https://costablanca.angloinfo.com/countries/spain/services.asp
Anyway , I can't imagine that this has made for enjoyable reading , but hopefully it will be helpful to anybody else trying to get set up in Spain .
If you 're planning to come out and have more questions , do n't hesitate to drop me an email .
It is all good here !
Third Way To Get RIAA To Drop Lawsuit : Accuse Them Of Extortion

Earlier today we pointed to one way not to respond to an RIAA lawsuit , but it appears there are a few more effective ways of fighting back .
First , there were the cases that were dropped when the accused pointed out that many different people may have been responsible .
Second , there was the case that was dropped when the guy died and the RIAA was made to look insensitive .
Of course , they 've also dropped a bunch of other cases in the past when it became clear that they had absolutely sued the wrong person , such as the time they sued Penn State Professor Peter Usher , assuming that some of his papers that were found on a file sharing system were music by the musician Usher .
The fact that the courts let them off easy for each of these types of mistakes only encourages them to file more lawsuits -- since mistakes have no real consequence .
It 's that last point that 's the problem .
Earlier this week we pointed out that this had turned into a form of profitable lawsuit automation that bordered on extortion .
It appears that last word is the magic word .
Just a day after one person accused of file sharing filed a response that compared their tactics to extortion ( while also pointing out she has no clue how to download music or what Kazaa is ) , the RIAA has dropped the case .
It 's quite likely it was the " no idea how to download music " part , rather than the extortion claims that actually caused them to drop the case , but it did happen rather quickly .
There have been cases in the past that accused the RIAA of racketeering because of their lawsuits , but none have gone very far yet .
Jennifer Chowdhury demonstrates her Ph.D. thesis project at New York University , an interactive game called Intimate Controllers .
A set of sensors embedded in underwear direct the action on a video game .
Players touch each other to control the game .

I 've noticed a wonderful trend happening at universities these past few years : projects that integrate sex and technology in innovative ways to improve human health and well - being .
Students interested in how technology and sexuality fit together – who take technology 's role in sexual development for granted – are naturally drawn to fields like interactive telecommunications , human - computer interaction and affective computing .
It 's a multidisciplinary movement that inspires collaboration among engineers , artists , psychologists and sociologists – and in these studies , sex comes first .
Tech is merely a catalyst .
Because geeks make great lovers , you have to expect a certain level of practical interest in sex tech .
And because this generation grew up with the internet and mobile devices and do n't always distinguish between " virtual " and " real " life , they are comfortable with technology as a platform for both physical and emotional intimacy .
They also see value in something we do n't generally associate with academia : play .
Jennifer Chowdhury attended the interactive telecommunications program at New York University , where her prototypes drew on her engineering training , her artistic aspirations and her sense of humor .
Her master 's thesis project , Intimate Controllers , is not explicitly sexual – but it's not something you would use with your sibling , either .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puZclY7kbrs
Intimate Controllers is a set of sensors embedded in underwear that direct the action on a video game .
Rather than sit separately on the couch and jam fingers against small plastic buttons , players touch each other to control the game .
For her demo , Chowdhury made a video of herself and a partner playing Pong .
He stands behind her with his hands near her shoulders , and she reaches back toward his hips .
When he touches her left breast , the paddle moves to the left .
The sensor in the right bra cup moves the Pong paddle to the right .
" I thought long and hard about how to present Intimate Controllers so it would n't be viewed as ' girls gone wild ' + technology , " she said in an e-mail .
" It 's nerve - racking enough to give your thesis talk .
But imagine doing it and knowing your teachers and peers are about to see you in your underwear on screen . "
Lighthearted and playful , the invention nevertheless has a serious side .
With it , Jennifer acknowledges the seductive nature of video games and the deleterious effect a passion for games can have on relationships .
Yet " stop gaming " is hardly a solution .
( It 's like firemen .
You can't fall in love with a fireman and then ask or demand that he stop fighting fires , even if your intentions are good .
You can't fall in love with a gamer and expect him or her to give up gaming to spend more time with you . )
" Anything that gets a couple to spend more time with one another , or to experience each other in a new way , is good for a relationship , " she says .
" If a couple plays well together , they will probably do other things well together as well . "
Intimate Controllers is not the first sex - tech development at NYU .
The couple who invented the Talk2Me ( NSFW ) audio - responsive vibrator did so during their tenure with the interactive telecommunications department .
After graduation , they took their development commercial .
The Talk2Me is as much a communications device as it is a sex toy .
Unlike other audio vibrators , it does n't have to be attached to an audio device ; its receiver picks up sound from any source and transmits it wirelessly to the toy , which then splits the bass and treble signals apart to drive two motors .
Pretty sophisticated engineering for " just a toy . "
As its name suggests , the Talk2Me is designed to facilitate verbal play – as you talk dirty or whisper sweet nothings , the toy responds .
Like Intimate Controllers , the technology is subordinate to the relationship , a tool to bring you together and get you talking .
I can think of a number of scenarios in which this device could , ah , facilitate intimacy , but I 'll have to leave it to your imagination .
This is Wired , not Penthouse .
By now , some of you are thinking you should quit your jobs , take out loans and go back to school , if this is what the kids are doing these days .
I can't argue with that – especially when some programs are testing sex tech 's potential to save lives .
Paul Robert Appleby , research assistant professor of psychology at USC , has teamed up with Lynn Miller , professor at USC's Annenberg School of Communication , to study how effective interactive media can be in educating adults about safer sex practices .
The study uses an interactive DVD to take users on a virtual date .
As they make choices – accept the drink , decline the drugs , negotiate the use of a condom – they receive feedback on their decisions .
" It 's sexy , not X - rated but certainly NC - 17 , with simulated sex scenes shot from above the waist , " says Appleby .
" It is designed to get the participant at least mildly sexually aroused , the notion being if you learn a skill set in a particular affective state , you 're more likely to use it later when you 're in that situation . "
Using the technology to arouse you and then require you to make a decision is a particularly clever way to teach smarter sex .
It 's the element that has always been missing from high school curriculum , even back when there was such a thing .
Drill all you want on birth control and disease prevention – when a person is turned on and has the possibility of sex right there , they do n't always remember or care .
The study 's DVD uses actors , but Appleby anticipates an evolution to video games in the near future .
" Games allow more possibilities in terms of how many choices the user will be able to make , " he says .
" One would expect you could get an even better result , one more tailored to the individual , with a video game . "
So far , the tool seems to be working .
Follow - up research shows participants practice safer sex after their USC session more consistently than they did before .
Not all academics are willing to embrace sex tech .
University of Irvine Ph.D. student Amanda Williams , who arranged the sexuality track for the 2006 Computer - Human Interaction conference in Montreal , encountered a range of resistance and " what on earth for ? " when she proposed the sessions .
But the sex - tech panel she moderated at this year 's SXSW festival was greeted with overwhelming enthusiasm and taken seriously by organizers and attendees alike .
I bet it wo n't be long before you 'll be able to pursue a master 's degree specifically in the technology of sex .
If only one did n't have study for the GRE .
See you next Friday ,

" I never heard the word ' bomb ' on the plane , "
Update
to the effect
At least one passenger aboard American Airlines Flight 924 maintains the federal air marshals were a little too quick on the draw when they shot and killed Rigoberto Alpizar as he frantically attempted to run off the airplane shortly before take - off .
" I do n't think they needed to use deadly force with the guy , " says John McAlhany , a 44 - year - old construction worker from Sebastian , Fla .
" He was getting off the plane . " ... McAlhany told TIME in a telephone interview .
" I never heard the word bomb until the FBI asked me did you hear the word bomb .
That is ridiculous . "
Even the authorities did n't come out and say bomb , McAlhany says .
" They asked , ' Did you hear anything about the b-word ? ' " he says .
" That 's what they called it .
" When the incident began McAlhany was in seat 24C , in the middle of the plane .
" [ Alpizar ] was in the back , " McAlhany says , " a few seats from the back bathroom .
He sat down . "
Then , McAlhany says , " I heard an argument with his wife .
He was saying ' I have to get off the plane .
'
She said , ' Calm down .
'" Alpizar took off running down the aisle , with his wife close behind him .
" She was running behind him saying , ' He 's sick .
He 's sick .
He 's ill .
He 's got a disorder , " McAlhany recalls .
" I do n't know if she said bipolar disorder [ as one witness has alleged ] .
She was trying to explain to the marshals that he was ill .
He just wanted to get off the plane .
" McAlhany described Alpizar as carrying a big backpack and wearing a fanny pack in front .
He says it would have been impossible for Alpizar to lie flat on the floor of the plane , as marshals ordered him to do , with the fanny pack on .
" You ca n't get on the ground with a fanny pack , " he says .
" You have to move it to the side . " ...
McAlhany said he saw Alpizar before the flight and is absolutely stunned by what unfolded on the airplane .
He says he saw Alpizar eating a sandwich in the boarding area before getting on the plane .
He looked normal at that time , McAlhany says .
He thinks the whole thing was a mistake : " I do n't believe he should be dead right now . " :
The Feds are now backing off the ' B ' word remark as James E. Bauer , agent in charge of the air marshals '
Miami field office , stated that Alpizar " uttered threatening words that included a sentencethat he had a bomb . "
Ne perd toujours pas de poids ?
Il est temps d'examiner votre routine pour voir si vous commettez ces transgressions de sabotage de régime .
Contrairement à un bouton étonnant qui a soudainement apparu sur votre visage juste avant votre grande présentation , la perte de poids ne se produit pas du jour au lendemain .
Cela étant dit , si vous avez coupé des calories , en changeant de poulet frit pour le chou frisé , et en augmentant votre temps de gymnaste pendant un certain temps maintenant , vous devriez commencer à voir des progrès .
Et pourtant , votre échelle n'a pas semblé bouger .
Ce qui donne ?
Si vous n'avez toujours pas pu perdre du poids , votre routine quotidienne peut encore avoir des habitudes persistantes qui ont un retard de croissance dans votre progression .
Les bonnes nouvelles sont , nous sommes là pour vous aider .
Lisez la suite pour en savoir plus sur les défaiteurs de régime commun et sur la façon de les surmonter pour de bon .
1.Vous mangez trop des aliments sains
Juste parce qu'une nourriture est " saine " ne vous donne pas le règne diete 3 semaines avis libre pour manger autant que vous le souhaitez .
En fait , bon nombre des aliments nutritifs que vous commencez à ajouter à vos avocats , au chocolat noir , aux noisettes et au beurre de noix peuvent conduire à un gain de poids lorsqu'ils sont consommés en excès .
Tout se résume à des calories : chacun de ces aliments peut être bon pour vous , mais ils ont une forte densité d'énergie qui peut inonder votre système avec plus de macronutriments que vous ne le souhaitez à la fois , ce qui amène tout en excès à être stocké sous forme de graisse .
2.VOUS CROCHET SUR LES PLATS MICROWAVE
Le facteur de commodité est excellent , mais ces repas à micro - ondes sont souvent chargés d'un ingrédient du ventre : le sodium .
Ce ne sera pas seulement vous faire gonfler ;
En fait , les chercheurs de l'Université Queen Mary ont constaté que pour chaque gramme supplémentaire de sel que vous mangez dans un jour , ce que vous trouverez dans ces petits paquets de sel de restaurant , votre risque d'obésité augmente de 25 pour cent .
Les experts spéculent que le sodium modifie notre efficacité métabolique , changeant la façon dont nous procédons à la graisse et nous amène à emballer sur les livres .
Donc , faites - vous une faveur , et abandonnez les repas diététiques .
3.VOUS NE SUFFIT PAS SOMMEIL
Sans le bon sommeil , manger intelligemment et s'entendre n'est pas suffisant pour produire une perte de poids à long terme .
C'est parce que les personnes ayant des périodes de sommeil plus courtes ont des niveaux d'IMC plus élevés et des taille de taille plus grande , selon une étude de l'International Journal of Obesity .
Les experts croient que le lien entre le gain de poids et la privation de sommeil vient du fait que le manque d'œil fermé peut augmenter les niveaux d'hormone cortisol de stress ( et de stockage de graisse ) de votre corps ainsi que de saboter l'efficacité de vos hormones régulatrices de la faim .
La privation de sommeil interfère également avec la récupération de l'exercice , ce qui rend difficile de lui donner toutes vos fois que vous frappez la salle de gym et peut réduire votre brûlure potentielle en calories .
On May 15th , the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources conducted a hearing entitled Short - Term Energy Outlook Summer 2007 : Oil and Gasoline .
You can watch the web cast here .
I have done so , and this essay will be about my impressions of the hearing .
You can find the testimony of the various witnesses at the links below :
Mr. Guy Caruso - EIA Administrator
Paul Sankey
Geoff Sundstrom
Kevin Lindemer
Mr. Sankey is an analyst with Deutsche Bank , Mr. Sundstrom represents AAA , and Mr. Lindemer is an analyst with Global Insight .
The witnesses really knew their material , although Mr. Sundstrom seemed terrified and Mr. Caruso had to make sure some of his answers were " politically correct . "
On one occasion Mr. Caruso stated that the EIA does not foresee that cellulosic ethanol is going to scale up to even a billion gallons by 2030 , and one senator said " Is n't that in direct contrast to what the president thinks ? "
Then some pretty nifty tap - dancing ensued .
The Q&A , in my opinion , was an embarrassing display of partisan politics , and revealed serious deficiencies in some of the senators ' understanding of energy issues .
Some Republican senators took the opportunity to push for coal - to - liquids and drilling in ANWR , and some Democrats did a bit of grandstanding over windfall profits - directly ignoring the answers the witnesses were giving them .
For example , Paul Sankey had explained that oil companies lost a lot of money in the 80's and 90's , and therefore investments fell off .
A couple of different senators kept asking the same question again and again : " Yeah , but why are n't they investing today , with record profits ? "
Sankey 's answer to this question was that they are investing today .
His answer - delivered numerous times - was merely ignored .
Sankey did n't mince words at all , and at one point told the committee to keep in mind that these record high prices are less than half the level of the prices in Europe .
Anyway , here were some of the more interesting exchanges which I transcribed myself .
Senator Craig Thomas was the first to demonstrate that he did n't understand the answer to a question :
Senator Craig Thomas :
Most any time that you have great markets and so on , you also have investment , like in the refineries .
When the market is there , and the price is high , I do n't understand the lack of incentive to invest .
Paul Sankey :
The incentive is there , and the companies are now investing , it 's just not an issue that you can expect that 4 years after companies are making losses , that suddenly there is an exponential increase in investments in refining capacity .
It 's just not that simple .
It 's a very tough market out there for any kind of infrastructure investment , as I mentioned you have competition from the Canadian heavy oil sands , you have competition from Asia , in Europe ; but these companies are increasing their investments .
The fact is that the companies are deploying capital to the best of their ability .
One disincentive for investment is brought about by uncertainties in regulation and government interference .
One concern they have is that regulations will cause them to lose money if they invest now .
In my opinion it's in your interest to maintain a stable regulatory environment to encourage investment .
Senator Craig Thomas : I agree with that .
But if lack of infrastructure is causing the price to go up , and the companies are not investing in infrastructure then it seems to be a bit of a contradiction . "
So , right after Sankey says they are investing , Senator Thomas can't understand why they are n't investing .
I lost count of how many times Sankey went through this routine .
You would think eventually his answer might sink in .
Immediately after the above exchange , Senator Ron Wyden from Oregon apparently awoke from a slumber , because he asked the same question :
Senator Wyden : Mr. Sankey , quick question .
You stated that in the 80's and 90's , there were poor returns for the companies , and that contributed to their problems .
But now we also have the problem of starving investment in refineries , but we have record profits .
Certainly that 's been the case for the last 5 or 6 years .
Why would n't the companies have invested in refineries and in the infrastructure - the things that were missing in the 80's and 90's - in the last 5 or 6 years ?
Paul Sankey :
This goes to the same point .
You had losses as recently as 2002 , and there have been changes in regulations - potential threats to gasoline as the fuel you want to make in this country .
If you are talking about an investment of 2 or 3 billion dollars , it 's immensely expensive now to add refineries , and there are huge amounts of uncertainties over how much it will ultimately cost you because of all the other challenges that there are out there with global energy infrastructure competing away the staff and materials to do the job .
But even amongst all that , we have some fairly significant investment going on right now .
One of the subtleties here is that we may not be adding a tremendous amount of capacity , but in terms or our ability to upgrade more complex heavy , sour crude there is very definitely a surge of investment going on .
Senator Wyden : I can see the argument , and you make it eloquently in your paper for not going forward with investments in the 80's and 90's ; it just does n't make sense given these record profits .
You have to wonder whether he heard a word that Sankey said .
Is he just posturing ?
Or is he not paying attention ?
Or does he not understand that investments are actually being made ( as I show in later ) ?
Yes , these are the people formulating our energy policy .
The other exchange that I watched in disbelief happened between Senator Robert Menendez and Sankey :
Senator Menendez :
Over the past few years , it seems that bracing for the onslaught of record high prices at the gas pump has become as common as planning for the summer vacation .
And we see prices rise and fall , we understand the concept of a changing supply and demand chain , that 's not foreign to us , but when we see no singular event , no visible cause for the increase in prices , consumers scratch their heads and try to figure out what 's happening .
This is the 3rd year in a row in which consumers are facing gasoline prices above the $ 3 / gallon mark .
Yet there 's no devastating hurricane this year ; there 's no single event at a refinery or in an OPEC country that explains why , in the first half of May , consumers are already experiencing sticker shock .
Mr. Sankey , when you say there is no price manipulation through the whole supply chain , then why do prices seem to spike during times of greatest motorist activities such as the summer , and Memorial Day weekend ?
Now , I am sure that demand is part of the answer , but it seems that we find that it is in these time periods that the prices spike .
Is that just convenience , that it just conveniently happens that way ?
Is it just a pure coincidence ?
Now remember , Senator Menendez just said that he understands all about supply and demand , and now is asking if it's a coincidence that prices increase at the times of highest demand .
If I had been a witness , it would have been hard for me to hide my disbelief at this question from another member of the Senate who happens to be formulating energy policy .
Paul Sankey : I would highlight once again , that BP has 2 of the 5 largest refineries in the U.S. effectively running at half capacity right now because of the safety issues .
What happens in times of such tight capacity is that you have an extremely seasonal market .
What happens is that at times of demand run-up , you begin to exceed available supply and prices rise exponentially , attempting to price out demand or encourage more supply .
What you will find in such a tight market is that in winter you will suddenly get tightness in natural gas and heating oil , because there is n't that available spare capacity to address the sudden seasonal rise in demand , and when you get to driving season - because everyone loves to go to the beach on Memorial Day - what you find is that you exceed available supply and then prices rise exponentially .
Then Senator Menendez gets his facts completely wrong :
Senator Menendez :
Is n't there a reality that we are paying for some industry decisions that actually reduced refining capacity in this country ?
I mean there was a time that we had greater refining capacity , and the industry reduced that refining capacity , and as a result of making that decision , consumers today find themselves with exactly the consequences that you have described in your testimony before .
Sankey then tried to explain something about the cycle , but did not correct Senator Menendez on the key point :
Refining capacity has not been reduced ; it is at an all time high .
Some refineries have been closed down , but the expansion of the existing ones far surpasses the lost capacity from those that were shut down .
See my essay addressing this .
But Senator Menendez continued :
Senator Menendez :
My point is that the reduction in refining capacity helped drive up the cost .
Your point is incorrect , and you misinformed a lot of people when you made it .
Perhaps this kind of misinformation explains some of your anger at the oil industry ?
But do n't take my word for it .
Visit the EIA and see the numbers for yourself .
Refining capacity has increased by 2 million barrels per day in the past 10 years .
And in the past 5 years ?
The years that the senators complained that no investments were being made ?
Refining capacity has increased since 2002 by 700,000 barrels a day - 250 million barrels a year .
To put this in perspective , that amount is equal to 10.7 billion gallons , or about double the entire ethanol production in the U.S.
That 's the amount of refinery expansion that a number of senators on the committee pretended never happened because they believe no investments have been made ( and this on top of the investments to upgrade heavy , sour crudes and to produce ULSD and ULSG ) .
Final Thoughts
I do n't know if the committee members are really so uninformed , or whether they were just playing politics .
You got the impression watching the web cast that they were making some statements just to make sure those were picked up by the media , regardless of whether they were accurate .
Senator 's Wyden 's comments are a perfect example .
It was clearly explained to him that investments are being made , and then he turned around and asked why they were n't investing .
The comments from Senator Menendez may be another matter .
He may actually believe that refining capacity has been reduced .
But he is on the energy committee .
He should understand the overall picture .
This is important stuff , and we can't have energy policy being formulated by people who are either proceeding with half - baked ideas , or are just interested in scoring political points .
There is also one thing that all politicians must come to grips with .
Let me make it crystal clear that I firmly support tough environmental regulations .
I support the move to ultra - low sulfur diesel ( ULSD ) and gasoline .
I support phasing out benzene in gasoline .
I would also point out that Senator Wyden has been actively involved in this issue .
But the politicians have to understand that these regulations do have consequences .
If you tell refiners they must install equipment to produce ULSD , there are four things to keep in mind .
First , this necessarily redirects capital that might have gone into expanding refining facilities .
Second , it increases the costs of producing the fuel .
Third , this additional level of processing reduces the overall product yield .
Fourth , and perhaps of greatest importance , it increases the complexity of the refinery .
Those are the consequences .
The more complex the refineries are , the more unreliable they are going to be .
So , when you formulate these sorts of rules , do n't sit around and scratch your heads and ask " Gosh , I wonder why gasoline prices are going up ? "
Part of the reason gasoline prices are going up is because of the policies you have enacted .
Many of which - as in the case of the aforementioned environmental regulations - I believe were the correct policies to adopt .
Nonetheless , these are issues that helped to bottleneck the refineries and crimp supplies - driving up prices .
But I have to tell you that I am sick of the way these hearings are being conducted .
I want you guys to put your heads together and formulate a coherent energy policy .
Stop playing politics with this .
It is far too serious a matter .
The committee members also need to get up to speed ASAP on energy issues .
We do n't need members on the energy committee who have a tenuous grasp of these issues .
Finally , listen to what your experts are telling you .
If you are going to call expert witnesses to testify , do n't completely ignore their testimony just so you can quote your canned sound bites .

A diamond may be forever , but love and marriage sure is n’t .
With an estimated 50 percent of all marriages ending in divorce , a new Web site , " I Do , Now I Don't " is looking to capitalize on this more cynical side of diamonds .
Founder and CEO Joshua Opperman came up with the idea after his fiancée abruptly called it quits .
He explains :
" A few months into our engagement , I came home from a tough day at work only to find that my apartment was completely empty .
All of her stuff was gone , and all that was left was the engagement ring lying on my table . "
Ouch .
Rather then hopefully saving it for another woman , he went on an epic quest to " toss the ring back into the fiery chasm from whence it came . "
( OK , perhaps not , but I could n't resist a Lord of the Rings reference . )
Actually , he went back to the jeweler where he'd bought it three months earlier , but found he could only get 32 percent of its original cost .
What 's a jilted guy to do ?
Turn his pain into profit , naturally .
Opperman created " I Do , Now I Don't " to help others unload their bitter reminders and offer a good deal to those who still believe in love .
It 's like eBay for the " take this ring and shove it " set .
Engagement rings are posted , bid on and then sold to the highest bidder .
Only rings with GIA , AGS or EGL grading reports are accepted for auction and the site pockets 5 percent of the final sale .
I 'm not so sure a proposal that includes " Oh , and I got a great deal because the last owner of this ring was dumped " will go over well , but maybe he can put a positive spin on it .
After all , actress Ellen Barkin recently proved that ex-jewelry can be trendy to the tune of $ 20 million .
One can only hope that the new ring bearers will have better luck .

The new social networking players , which include Cisco and a multitude of start - ups like Ning , the latest venture of the Netscape co-creator Marc Andreessen , say that social networks will soon be as ubiquitous as regular Web sites .
They are aiming to create tools to let ordinary people , large companies and even presidential candidates create social Web sites tailored for their own customers , friends , fans and employees .
“ The existing social networks are fantastic but they put users in a straitjacket , ” said Mr. Andreessen , who this week reintroduced Ning , his third start - up , after a limited introduction last year .
“ They are restrictive about what you can and ca n’t do , and they were not built to be flexible .
They do not let people build and design their own worlds , which is the nature of what people want to do online . ”
Social networks are sprouting on the Internet these days like wild mushrooms .
In the last few months , organizations as dissimilar as the Portland Trailblazers , the University of South Carolina and Nike have gotten their own social Web sites up and running , with the help of companies that specialize in building social networks .
Last month , Senator Barack Obama unveiled My.BarackObama.com , a social network created for his presidential campaign by the political consulting firm Blue State Digital .
Many of these new online communities cater to niche interests .
Shelfari , a Seattle - based start - up , recently began a service to let book lovers share their opinions .
This week it received an investment from Amazon.com .
Mr. Andreessen ’s Ning , based in Palo Alto , Calif. , is fashioning itself as a one - stop shop catering to this growing interest in social networks .
Anyone can visit the site and set up a community on any topic , from the television show “ Battlestar Galactica ” to microbrew beers .
Ning users choose the features they want to include , like videos , photos , discussion forums or blogs .
Their sites can appear like MySpace , YouTube or the photo sharing site Flickr — or something singular .
On some days , Shawn does attend classes with about 10 other students who are also behind .
On many other days , he simply does not bother .
He likes math , but the algebra course he has been forced to take repeatedly is too easy , he said , so he does not make an effort .
“ The sad thing is , some of the kids ca n’t even do it , ” he said .
Murrow , a 4,000 - student school in the Midwood neighborhood with a far - reaching variety of course offerings that are reminiscent of a small liberal arts college , was founded in 1974 , and it gives its students considerable freedom .
Periods are called bands .
There are no bells , and no one is herded from class to class .
Free time is scheduled into every school day , and students can choose to eat , to sleep , to do homework , to do nothing or , as Shawn has often done , to play cards in the cafeteria .
“ It is a school where if you do n’t have your personal responsibility together , you could drop out , ” Shawn said .
Ms. Siegel - Graf , the assistant vice principal , said Shawn was allowed to accompany his teammates on the plane to Missouri on Wednesday afternoon after a conference at which he promised that , this time , he would begin going to school regularly .
Shawn turns 17 on April 24  11 days after the nationals start  and Ms. Siegel - Graf said Shawn and the school had worked out an arrangement in which although he would still be technically enrolled at Murrow , he would begin taking courses to prepare for the G.E.D diploma .
The rules for the national tournament require students to be enrolled full time in school in the United States or its territories for the entire semester .
They also state , “ The coach is responsible for assuring that all of his players are properly registered and eligible to participate as members of his team . ”
On a recent Thursday , a few weeks before the nationals , Shawn said he had not gone to school because he had a sore throat .
Later , he said he had run out of minutes on his mobile phone and needed to win some money playing chess to pay the bill .
Here , among the businesspeople and tourists on Wall Street , Shawn sticks out with his Yankees cap , baggy jeans and well - worn red and black Nike high tops , but he also mixes easily with the stockbrokers and others who come to play .

Oracle is in talks to buy three open source companies in a strategy that would potentially reinforce the company 's middleware against low - priced competitors , according to a report in BusinessWeek .
The database and applications giant is talking to JBoss , Zend Technologies and Sleepycat Software about deals that could exceed $ 600 m , the magazine reported .
JBoss is seeking up to $ 400 m and Zend could settle for $ 200 m , while no figure was given for Sleepycat .
Rumors of an Oracle and JBoss deal have circulated for awhile , but BusinessWeek is the first to claim all three companies are targets .
The companies could not be contacted at the time of going to press .
Any acquisitions would follow a 12 - month buying spree that saw Oracle snap up $ 18bn worth of vendors of varying sizes , spanning enterprise applications , databases and single sign - on software .
The deals were intended to deepen Oracle 's technology footprint and expand its customer base .
One primary target in Oracle 's 2005 acquisition spree was SAP , who Oracle whishes to unseat as the world 's largest supplier of business applications .
By making the open source deals , Oracle would rip a page from IBM 's strategy of surrounding its own middleware products with open source software that leads the way to the company 's full suite of proprietary products .
This strategy is designed to help ensure that license and service revenues from products go to IBM rather than competitors .
As such , IBM bought open source Java application server Gluecode to serve as a low - priced entry point for customers who were unable to afford , or unwilling to buy , IBM 's full WebSphere Java 2 Enterprise Edition ( J2EE ) application server .
Until now , Oracle has tackled open source middleware by offering " free " versions of existing products .
Last year , Oracle launched its 10g Express Edition , Oracle Database XE .
This was in keeping with IBM 's tactic of also offering a free version of its DB2 database , DB2 Universal Database Express -C , and Microsoft 's free Express edition of SQL Server 2005 .
With developers latching on to open source , though , it 's questionable just how popular a free version of a closed - source product would become .
In databases , for example , close to 44 per cent of developers are using the open source MySQL Server , according to analyst firm Evans Data Corp ( EDC ) .
A JBoss deal would deliver to Oracle a middleware stack that is popular among developers for a relatively low price , while Zend would unlock the knowledge and technology involved in PHP .
Zend last year completed optimization of PHP to Oracle 's database potentially helping millions of developers using the open source scripting language to build web applications that require a database tier .
Sleepycat would give Oracle another popular developer community , this time around databases .
Sleepycat claims more than 200 m deployments and has some of the world 's largest and best - known IT suppliers as customers .

" ... Frontline formulates the question in the clichéd form to which we have become accustomed , asking whether legitimate national security concerns can limit the public 's right to know .
I would frame the question slightly differently .

Are you in need a new Core 2 Duo MacBook Pro with 3GB of RAM and a 200GB hard drive and have no way of paying for it ?
Then why not sell advertising on the lid of the laptop to places like Firefox , Technorati , Digg , and other Web 2.0 startups ?
That is exactly what Leah Culver did and now she has a shiny new laser etched laptop to use wherever she goes .
You can contribute a bit of money to help me buy a new computer – a MacBook Pro laptop .
For $ 150 a square inch , I ’ll etch ( almost ) whatever you want on the top of my new laptop .
Your ad will be shown all around the Bay Area coffee shops , start - up offices , and Web2.0 conventions !
I now work at Instructables , a how - to / DIY website full of cool projects .
Instructables is located at Squid Labs and I have access to their laser etching / cutting machine .
I was thinking of laser etching my laptop but I do n’t think I ’ll let Instructables do it for me .
The etching job on Leah ’s MacBook does n’t look so great .
Some of the sponsor ’s logos are completely faded out .
The FireFox logo ( I assume it ’s FireFox ) looks terrible and you ca n’t make out the three logos at the bottom .
I think the laptop would have look better if she just asked the advertisers to send her decals to stick on the lid .
Then she can just charge by the month and add or remove advertisers as contracts come due .
Her idea is a good one however , and I admire her creativity and marketing skills .
I ’m sure she ’ll be getting many fan mails from geeky computer nerds .
1957 : Arthur Miller guilty of contempt
US playwright Arthur Miller has been convicted of contempt of Congress .
The conviction relates to an investigation last year by the House of Representatives ' Un - American Activities Committee ( HUAC ) into a Communist conspiracy to misuse American passports .
During the investigation 41 - year - old Mr Miller , who is married to Hollywood movie star Marilyn Monroe , refused to reveal the names of alleged Communist writers with whom he had attended five or six meetings in New York in 1947 .
He was said to be co-operative in all other aspects of the hearing but told the committee his conscience would not permit him to give the names of others and bring possible trouble to them .
' Exposure for exposure 's sake '
The guilty verdict was announced in a 15 - page " opinion " today by Federal Judge McLaughlin who presided over a six - day trial , which ended last week .
During the trial Mr Miller 's counsel , Joseph Rauh , had claimed that the questions his client had refused to answer had no reasonable connection with a passports inquiry .
He argued that the committee had simply wanted to expose the playwright and that " exposure for exposure 's sake " was illegal .
But Judge McLaughlin found that HUAC did have a valid legislative purpose in looking into the passport regulations and that Mr Miller had indeed experienced his own difficulties in obtaining a passport from the State Department .
The trial was told by the government that Mr Miller had joined the Communist party in 1943 but this was denied by the defendant who said that to the best of his belief he had never been a party member .
He did , however say that " there were two short periods - one in 1940 and one in 1947 - when I was sufficiently close to Communist Party activities so that someone might honestly have thought that I had become a member " .
Mr Miller was not in court when the guilty verdict was announced .
The maximum punishment for contempt of Congress is one year in jail , a fine of £ 357 or both .
No date was fixed for sentencing but it is understood the case will automatically go to appeal .
After the trial Mr Miller , who will remain on bail pending the next legal step , said through a spokesman : " I have no comment to make , nor has my wife . "
The case is now bound to call into question the whole system of Congressional inquiries and their impingement on individual rights .
WASHINGTON , May 11 — Two years ago , Robin C. Ashton , a seasoned criminal prosecutor at the Department of Justice , learned from her boss that a promised promotion was no longer hers .
“ You have a Monica problem , ” Ms. Ashton was told , according to several Justice Department officials .
Referring to Monica M. Goodling , a 31 - year - old , relatively inexperienced lawyer who had only recently arrived in the office , the boss added , “ She believes you ’re a Democrat and does n’t feel you can be trusted . ”
Ms. Ashton ’s ouster — she left the Executive Office for United States Attorneys for another Justice Department post two weeks later — was a critical early step in a plan that would later culminate in the ouster of nine United States attorneys last year .
Ms. Goodling would soon be quizzing applicants for civil service jobs at Justice Department headquarters with questions that several United States attorneys said were inappropriate , like who was their favorite president and Supreme Court justice .
One department official said an applicant was even asked , “ Have you ever cheated on your wife ? ”
“ Whatever future developments may prove to be , my best guess is that the US will continue to maintain a façade of Constitutional government and drift along until financial bankruptcy overtakes it . ”

And , the real value of the currency is absolutely nothing !
How is it that this scam persists when people appear to be aware of the massive debt and deficits which underwrite the dollar ?
Do they still believe in that puerile fairy tale about “ the full faith and credit ” of the United States backing up every greenback ?
Or are they pacified by the wizened graybeards , like Alan Greenspan and Hank Paulson , who soothingly bray about the “ strong dollar policy ” ?
What gibberish .
In truth , the dollar rests on the crumbling foundation of consumerism and oil .
The American consumer ’s gluttonous appetite for spending has kept the greenback flying high for decades .
Economists marvel at America ’s lust for electronic gadgetry , the latest fashions , and useless knick - knacks .
They call our profligate spending “ the engine for global growth ” ; and indeed it is .
No other country in the world is nearly as addicted to binge - spending as the US consumer .
As long as he can beg , borrow or steal his way into the shopping mall ; the orgy of spending is bound to continue .
( Consumer spending is 70 % of GDP )
Regrettably , there are signs that the US consumer is beginning to buckle from the weight of personal debt .
The Associated Press reported just this week that “ people are saving at the slowest rate since the Great Depression … and the Commerce Dept stated that the nation ’s personal savings rate for 2006 was a negative 1 % , the worst showing in 73 years . ”
Additionally , credit card debt has skyrocketed , which is an indication that homeowners are no longer able to siphon easy - money from their home - equity .
The nose - diving real estate market has slowed refinancing to a dribble ; cutting off the additional $ 825 billion of cash which was extracted from home - equity just last year .
Clearly , the well is running dry ; the housing bubble is hang - gliding into the abyss and there ’s nothing Fed - master Bernanke can do to save it from its inevitable crash - landing .
The central banks around the world are now watching for any sign that the American consumer is about to give up the ghost .
As soon as that happens , bank managers everywhere will swing into action , ditch their U.S.Dollars and head for the exits .
When the “ global engine ” sputters to a halt ; it ’ll be curtains for the greenback .
The Oil- extortion Racket
The dollar ’s link to oil has helped to keep it afloat but , in truth , it ’s just another dismal rip - off .
More than 70 % of the world ’s oil is denominated in USD ; a virtual monopoly for the USA .
Until last year , even Russia was using dollars in its oil transactions with Germany .
Imagine a comparable deal , like the US purchasing oil from Canada in rubles ?!?
It ’s lunacy ; and yet this is the system the US hopes to preserve so it can maintain its unique status as the world ’s “ reserve currency ” and keep expanding its debt into perpetuity .
It explains why the Federal Reserve has been able to increase the money supply by a whopping 15 % for the last 6 years !
Trillions of dollars are now circulating in the oil trade keeping the value of the dollar high by creating artificial demand .
The other reason the dollar has n’t succumbed to hyperinflation is because the current account deficit is running at roughly $ 800 billion per year .
The Asian giants ( China and Japan ) and the oil exporting countries are mopping up more than $ 700 billion of our red ink every year !
The dollar ’s link to oil forces central banks to maintain humongous stockpiles of USD to pay the steadily rising price of oil that keeps their industries and vehicles running .
Otherwise they would have chucked the flaccid greenback years ago and converted to the more steadfast euro .
The so - called ‘ global economic system ’ has nothing to do with competition , free markets or private enterprise ; that ’s just public relations gobbledygook .
In practice , it is the world ’s biggest extortion racket , wherein , the “ Godfather ” -- Uncle Sam -- holds a gun to the heads of his subjects and forces them to use our fiat - paper to purchase the oil that lubricates their economies .
Why would anyone accept a personal check from a nation that owes the bank more than $ 8.6 trillion dollars ?
Why , indeed ?
It ’s blackmail , pure and simple ; and yet , the Chinese , Japanese etc. continue to play along knowing full - well that we neither have the inclination nor the resources to pay them back in kind ?
It ’s madness .
Every so often , a rebel nation will try to break the shackle of greenback - tyranny and operate outside the US - run system ?
For example , Saddam Hussein switched to euros 6 months before he was carpet - bombed in Shock and Awe .
His defiance only hastened his ultimate downfall .
Now Iran and Venezuela are threatening to convert to euros .
Is it any surprise that they are both on Bush ’s axis - of - evil hit list ?
Russia has already made the conversion to euros and rubles ( and has considerably depleted his supplies of USD ) but , of course , regime change is more difficult when a state has nuclear weapons .
Instead , the mainstream media is conducting an impressive “ Swift Boat ” campaign against Putin , smearing him as a “ Russian autocrat ” who is “ rolling back democracy ” .
At the same time , the Bush administration is threatening to deploy missile systems in Eastern Europe and ratcheting up the pressure in the former Soviet republics .
Bush would rather restart the Cold War than abandon the supremacy of the greenback .
But , why ?
Is Dollar - primacy really that crucial to our economy ?
The greenback is the baling wire that keeps the global economy in the hands of the doddering old misers at the Federal Reserve .
It ’s the cornerstone of the whole wretched system ; a system which now includes torture , extraordinary rendition , and myriad other war crimes .
The young Muslim men who are abducted off the streets of Europe and Asia and taken to CIA Black Sites where they are waterboarded or stacked in naked pyramids ; are tortured in defense of the crumpled piece of green paper we carry in our pants pockets .
Think I ’m kidding ?
Just look at Bush ’s budget for 2007 - 2008 ; $ 700 billion for foreign wars ?!?
There ’s no way the US can pay off that debt through the normal means of increasing exports .
In fact , Bush has already said that he plans to preserve his unfunded tax cuts whether they produce massive deficits or not .
What Bush plans to do is force the foreign central banks to hold more dollar - based assets , thus , thrusting our gigantic debt onto our trading partners .
According to Bob Chapman of The International Forecaster , “ US debt was up 10.1 % to $ 4.085 trillion and accounts for 58.8 % OF ALL THE CREDIT ISSUED GLOBALLY LAST YEAR .
The US is producing more debt than the rest of the world combined .
As long as foreign lenders are willing to take our paper , Bush will keep expanding our debt .
As Chalmers Johnson opined , “ We are dependent on ‘ the kindness of strangers ’ ” .
( The Blanche Dubois economy )
Of course , if the central banks grow tired of this pyramid - scheme and dump the dollar ; the world can get on with the business of addressing global warming , poverty , AIDs , Peak Oil , nuclear proliferation etc .
That wo n’t happen as long as the dollar reigns supreme and a small cadre of unelected racketeers at the Fed continue Gerry - rig the system .
Economic justice and equitable distribution of wealth begin with greater parity among the currencies .
That requires “ regime change ” for the greenback and a loosening of its tyrannical grip on the system .
Sleepwalking in the Weimar U.S.A .
The good news is that the Bush administration is pushing the dollar towards extinction anyway .
Another few years of $ 800 billion trade deficits , lavish unfunded tax cuts for the mega-rich , and a Pentagon budget of $ 700 billion - plus ; and the old greenback will be going the way of the Dodo .
Jim Willie of GoldenJackass.com summarized it this way :
“ Never in the history of central bankers has the hidden coordination , influenced pressure , gargantuan money creation , doctored statistics , and interference with financial markets been so broad , so deep , and so profound .
My allegation is clear , that we now live in Weimar times , as has been warned for two years worth of scribbles .
Collectively , they have abused the privilege of printing money , and in doing so , have guaranteed a gold bull market . …
The more heavily the counterfeit press dispenses electronic dollars , devoted to operations , to credit , to consumer spending , to military adventures , to good old fashioned fraud , the gold bull benefits from ample new oxygen and blood flow ” .
Willie is right ; the system is rotten to the core .
Once the dollar crashes , other currencies rush in to fill the void generating greater competition between the energy and manufacturing giants .
A new paradigm will emerge distributing power more equitably among the states .
It ’s a way to resuscitate a system that is currently held together through force of arms .
Besides , how long will China and Japan continue to abet Washington ’s war - mongering adventurism ?
My guess is that the daggers have already been sharpened in Beijing , Caracas , Delhi and Moscow .
Everyone is just waiting for Bush to cross that invisible line in the sand before they fling their greenbacks into the jet - stream and wait for Goliath to tumble .
That “ invisible line in the sand ” is Iran .
The world is at a crossroads and everyone who can fog a mirror knows it .
The superpower model of global governance has failed miserably .
We need more responsible stewardship of the planet and its resources .
How can we build our economies when a handful of western plutocrats control the spigot for quickly dwindling oil reserves ?
How can we attack climate change when those same blinkered reprobates employ pseudo - scientists to dispute global warming ?
How can we address nuclear proliferation when neocon militarists believe in “ useable ” low - yield , bunker - busting warheads ?
The model is hopelessly shattered .
We ’d be better off boarding - up the White House and the Federal Reserve and starting from Square One .
The world needs a break from Washington ’s wasteful spending and unprovoked wars .
At the same time , foreign creditors are increasingly reluctant to keep financing America ’s extravagant consumption .
And , no one is hoodwinked by Bush ’s “ war on terror ” scam ; a conflict that was clearly concocted to assert control over the world ’s remaining resources .
The world is realigning according to mutual interests and a shared vision of the future .
The rise of energy alliances in Latin America and Asia ( particularly the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) which now controls most new oil deposits and output ) signals the waning of western influence and the ascendancy of a new energy paradigm .
Power is progressively shifting away from Washington .
That ’s bad news for the greenback which depends on its linkage to oil to sustain its enormous debt .
The dollar now faces challenges from all directions .
Western elites have savaged the country ’s economic base by hollowing out our manufacturing base in order to destroy the American labor movement .
Free trade has transformed the US into the biggest creditor nation in history .
The country exports nothing but bombs and misery .
Also , as Congressman Ron Paul notes , “ Most knowledgeable people assume that inflation of the money supply is not only going to continue , but accelerate .
This anticipation , plus the fact that many new dollars have been created over the past 15 years that have not been fully discounted , guarantees the further depreciation of the dollar . ”
Eventually , the markets will catch on , foreign lenders will stop buying our Treasuries , and the dollar will fall through the floor .
The laws of gravity apply to economics as well as science .
Red flags are going up everywhere .
China ’s central bank issued a warning in December about the risks of the weakening dollar :
“ If external capital stops flowing into the US , a significant drop in the dollar may occur with consumption and investment shrinking , interest rates rising , and financial markets experiencing turbulence , endangering global financial and economic stability .
There could be adjustments to how European private capital , Asian foreign exchange reserves and oil export proceeds are invested . ”
Yes , of course , a complete economic meltdown with capital fleeing the United States to foreign countries and the American economy collapsing in a heap .
The Chinese central bank statement adds :
“ If the US current account deficit continues to grow faster than GDP , then the investment value of US assets may be subject to doubts and challenges and the willingness of investors to continue holding and buying US financial products may weaken .
This could cause changes in capital flows , the exchange rates of major currencies , and the value of foreign exchange assets . ”
The Chinese bank is giving the Bush Team a chapter out of Econ. 101 : “ If you keep spending more than you are taking in ; the stock market will fall , the dollar will plummet , and the US economy will tank ” .
What could be clearer than that ?
The administration , however , chooses to ignore the basic laws of economics and pursue a madcap plan to wage aggressive war across the planet and pilfer the world ’s oil reserves .
So far , the results have been less than reassuring .
The Decline of U.S. Sovereignty ; blame it on the Fed
The United States set off on the road to perdition when it transferred the power to create money to the privately - owned Federal Reserve .
It ’s been downhill ever since .
The man who can set interest rates and create money is more powerful than the man who can move armies and change laws .
By conferring that authority on the Federal Reserve we have assured that the policies that govern our economy are decided by unelected members of the ruling elite whose choices will naturally reflect the interests of their class .
The wealth gap that has opened up like a yawning chasm between rich and poor in America originated with the class - based policies of the Fed .
The massive equity bubbles which arose from artificially low interest rates and the deliberate destruction of the dollar by reckless increases in the money supply have shifted trillions of dollars from working class Americans to the predatory aristocrats at the top of the economic food chain .
The gulf between rich and poor has grown so wide that it now poses a direct threat to our increasingly fragile democracy .
That ’s why Thomas Jefferson said :
“ If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of our currency , first by inflation , then by deflation , the banks and the corporations that will grow up will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered .
The issuing of power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people , to whom it properly belongs . ”
Free people cannot control their own destiny unless they control their own currency .
The Federal Reserve must be abolished .

A young man comes to town .
He is reasonably good looking , has a little money in his pocket .
He finds it easy to talk to women .
He does n’t speak much about his past , but it is clear that he spent a lot of time in a soulless big company .
He is naturally friendly and outgoing , and quietly confident without being arrogant .
So he finds it easy to pick up small gigs from the job board at the local Programmer ’s Cafe .
But he rapidly loses interest in insurance database projects , vanity web pages for housewives , and financial calculation engines .
After a year , he calculates that he has saved up enough money to pay his modest expenses for a year .
So , after consulting with his faithful Alsatian , he sets up a computer in a sunfilled room in his rented apartment above the grocery store and installs a carefully - chosen selection of tools .
One by one , he calls his friends and warns them that if he seems remote over the next months , it is only because he is hard at work .
And he sits down to spin code .
And what code it is .
Flawless , artistic , elegant , bug free .
The user interface so perfectly mimics a users ’ thought process that the people he shows it to at the Programmer ’s Cafe hardly notice that there is a user interface .
It ’s a brilliant piece of work .
Encouraged by the feedback of his peers , he sets up in business and prepares to take orders .
His modesty precludes any pretensions , but after a month , the situation in his bank account is not looking encouraging .
So far only three orders have been taken : one from his mother , one from an anonymous benefactor at the Programmer ’s Cafe , and the one he submitted himself to test the commerce system .
In the second month , no more orders come in .
This surprises him and leaves him feeling melancholy .
At the big company , new products were created on a regular basis , and even if they were inelegant and homely , they still sold in reasonable quantities .
One product he worked on there went on to be a big hit .
After a few more months pass , his financial situation starts to look a little bit precarious .
His dog looks at him sadly , not quite certain what is wrong , but aware that his face is looking a little bit gaunter than usual , and he seems to be unable to get up the energy to go out with friends , or go shopping to restock the dangerously low larder , or even to bathe .
One Tuesday morning , the local grocer has refused to extend him any more credit , and his banker has long since refused to return his calls .
The big company is not vindictive .
They recognize talent , and are happy to hire him back , at a higher salary .
Soon he is looking better , he has some new clothes , and he ’s got his old confidence back .
But something , somewhere , is missing .
A spark in his eye .
The hope that he might become the master of his own destiny is gone .
Why did he fail ?
He ’s pretty sure he knows .
“ Marketing , ” he says .
Like many young technicians , he is apt to say things like , “ Microsoft has worse products but better marketing . ”
When uttered by a software developer , the term “ marketing ” simply stands in for all that business stuff : everything they do n’t actually understand about creating software and selling it .
This , actually , is not really what “ marketing ” means .
Actually Microsoft has pretty terrible marketing .
Can you imagine those dinosaur ads actually making someone want to buy Microsoft Office ?
Software is a conversation , between the software developer and the user .
But for that conversation to happen requires a lot of work beyond the software development .
It takes marketing , yes , but also sales , and public relations , and an office , and a network , and infrastructure , and air conditioning in the office , and customer service , and accounting , and a bunch of other support tasks .
But what do software developers do ?
They design and write code , they layout screens , they debug , they integrate , and they check things into the source code control repository .
The level a programmer works at ( say , Emacs ) is too abstract to support a business .
Developers working at the developer abstraction layer need an implementation layer — an organization that takes their code and turns it into products .
Dolly Parton , working at the “ singing a nice song ” layer , needs a huge implementation layer too , to make the records and book the concert halls and take the tickets and set up the audio gear and promote the records and collect the royalties .
Any successful software company is going to consist of a thin layer of developers , creating software , spread across the top of a big abstract administrative organization .
The abstraction exists solely to create the illusion that the daily activities of a programmer ( design and writing code , checking in code , debugging , etc. ) are all that it takes to create software products and bring them to market .
Which gets me to the most important point of this essay :
Your first priority as the manager of a software team is building the development abstraction layer .
Most new software managers miss this point .
They keep thinking of the traditional , Command - and - Conquer model of management that they learned from Hollywood movies .
According to Command - and - Conquer , managers - slash - leaders figure out where the business is going to go , and then issue the appropriate orders to their lieutenants to move the business in that direction .
Their lieutenants in turn divide up the tasks into smaller chunks and command their reports to implement them .
This continues down the org - chart until eventually someone at the bottom actually does some work .
In this model , a programmer is a cog in the machine : a typist who carries out one part of management ’s orders .
Some businesses actually run this way .
You can always tell when you are dealing with such a business , because the person you are talking to is doing something infuriating and senseless , and they know it , and they might even care , but there ’s nothing they can do about it .
It ’s the airline that loses a million mile customer forever because they refuse to change his non-refundable ticket so he can fly home for a family emergency .
It ’s the ISP whose service is down more often than it ’s up , and when you cancel your account , they keep billing you , and billing you , and billing you , but when you call to complain , you have to call a toll number and wait on hold for an hour , and then they still refuse to refund you , until you start a blog about how badly they suck .
It ’s the Detroit automaker that long since forgot how to design cars that people might want to buy and instead lurches from marketing strategy to marketing strategy , as if the only reason we do n’t buy their crappy cars is because the rebate was n’t big enough .
Enough .
Forget it .
The command - hierarchy system of management has been tried , and it seemed to work for a while in the 1920s , competing against peddlers pushing carts , but it ’s not good enough for the 21st century .
For software companies , you need to use a different model .
With a software company , the first priority of management needs to be creating that abstraction for the programmers .
If a programmer somewhere is worrying about a broken chair , or waiting on hold with Dell to order a new computer , the abstraction has sprung a leak .
Think of your development abstraction layer as a big , beautiful yacht with insanely powerful motors .
It ’s impeccably maintained .
Gourmet meals are served like clockwork .
The staterooms have twice - daily maid service .
The navigation maps are always up to date .
The GPS and the radar always work and if they break there ’s a spare below deck .
Standing on the bridge , you have programmers who really only think about speed , direction , and whether to have Tuna or Salmon for lunch .
Meanwhile a large team of professionals in starched white uniforms tiptoes around quietly below deck , keeping everything running , filling the gas tanks , scraping off barnacles , ironing the napkins for lunch .
The support staff knows what to do but they take their cues from a salty old fart who nods ever so slightly in certain directions to coordinate the whole symphony so that the programmers can abstract away everything about the yacht except speed , direction , and what they want for lunch .
Management , in a software company , is primarily responsible for creating abstractions for programmers .
We build the yacht , we service the yacht , we are the yacht , but we do n’t steer the yacht .
Everything we do comes down to providing a non-leaky abstraction for the programmers so that they can create great code and that code can get into the hands of customers who benefit from it .
Programmers need a Subversion repository .
Getting a Subversion repository means you need a network , and a server , which has to be bought , installed , backed up , and provisioned with uninterruptible power , and that server generates a lot of heat , which means it need to be in a room with an extra air conditioner , and that air conditioner needs access to the outside of the building , which means installing an 80 pound fan unit on the wall outside the building , which makes the building owners nervous , so they need to bring their engineer around , to negotiate where the air conditioner unit will go ( decision : on the outside wall , up here on the 18th floor , at the most inconvenient place possible ) , and the building gets their lawyers involved , because we ’re going to have to sign away our firstborn to be allowed to do this , and then the air conditioning installer guys show up with rigging gear that would n’t be out of place in a Barbie play - set , which makes our construction foreman nervous , and he does n’t allow them to climb out of the 18th floor window in a Mattel harness made out of 1/2 ″ pink plastic , I swear to God it could be Disco Barbie ’s belt , and somebody has to call the building agent again and see why the hell they suddenly realized , 12 weeks into a construction project , that another contract amendment is going to be needed for this goddamned air conditioner that they knew about before Christmas and they only just figured it out , and if your programmers even spend one minute thinking about this that ’s one minute too many .
To the software developers on your team , this all needs to be abstracted away as typing svn commit on the command line .
That ’s why you have management .
It ’s for the kind of stuff that no company can avoid , but if you have your programmers worrying about it , well , management has failed , the same way as a 100 foot yacht has failed if the millionaire owner has to go down into the engine room and , um , build the engine .
You ’ve got your typical company started by ex-software salesmen , where everything is Sales Sales Sales and we all exist to drive more sales .
These companies can be identified in the wild because they build version 1.0 of the software ( somehow ) and then completely lose interest in developing new software .
Their development team is starved or nonexistent because it never occurred to anyone to build version 2.0 … all that management knows how to do is drive more sales .
On the other extreme you have typical software companies built by ex-programmers .
These companies are harder to find because in most circumstances they keep quietly to themselves , polishing code in a garret somewhere , which nobody ever finds , and so they fade quietly into oblivion right after the Great Ruby Rewrite , their earth - changing refactoring - code code somehow unappreciated by The People .
Both of these companies can easily be wiped out by a company that ’s driven by programmers and organized to put programmers in the driver ’s seat , but which have an excellent abstraction that does all the hard work to convert code into products below the decks .
A programmer is most productive with a quiet private office , a great computer , unlimited beverages , an ambient temperature between 68 and 72 degrees ( F ) , no glare on the screen , a chair that ’s so comfortable you do n’t feel it , an administrator that brings them their mail and orders manuals and books , a system administrator who makes the Internet as available as oxygen , a tester to find the bugs they just ca n’t see , a graphic designer to make their screens beautiful , a team of marketing people to make the masses want their products , a team of sales people to make sure the masses can get these products , some patient tech support saints who help customers get the product working and help the programmers understand what problems are generating the tech support calls , and about a dozen other support and administrative functions which , in a typical company , add up to about 80 % of the payroll .
It is not a coincidence that the Roman army had a ratio of four servants for every soldier .
This was not decadence .
Modern armies probably run 7:1 .
( Here ’s something Pradeep Singh taught me today : if only 20 % of your staff is programmers , and you can save 50 % on salary by outsourcing programmers to India , well , how much of a competitive advantage are you really going to get out of that 10 % savings ? )
Management ’s primary responsibility to create the illusion that a software company can be run by writing code , because that ’s what programmers do .
And while it would be great to have programmers who are also great at sales , graphic design , system administration , and cooking , it ’s unrealistic .
Like teaching a pig to sing , it wastes your time and it annoys the pig .
Microsoft does such a good job at creating this abstraction that Microsoft alumni have a notoriously hard time starting companies .
They simply can’t believe how much went on below decks and they have no idea how to reproduce it .
Nobody expects Dolly Parton to know how to plug in a microphone .
There ’s an incredible infrastructure of managers , musicians , recording technicians , record companies , roadies , hairdressers , and publicists behind her who exist to create the abstraction that when she sings , that ’s all it takes for millions of people to hear her song .
All the support staff and management that make Dolly Parton possible can do their jobs best by providing the most perfect abstraction : the most perfect illusion that Dolly sings for us .
It is her song .
When you ’re listening to her on your iPod , there ’s a huge infrastructure that makes that possible , but the very best thing that infrastructure can do is disappear completely .
Provide a leakproof abstraction that Dolly Parton is singing , privately , to us .
Bush declares public opinion supports him
Posted Tuesday , May 29 , 2007 10:18 am
Tuesday , May 29
WASHINGTON -- Confronted with strong opposition to his Iraq policies , President Bush decides to interpret public opinion his own way .
Actually , he says , people agree with him .
Democrats view the November elections that gave them control of Congress as a mandate to bring U.S. troops home from Iraq .
They 're backed by evidence ; election exit poll surveys by The Associated Press and television networks found 55 percent saying the U.S. should withdraw some or all of its troops from Iraq .
The president says Democrats have it all wrong : the public does n't want the troops pulled out -- they want to give the military more support in its mission .
" Last November , the American people said they were frustrated and wanted a change in our strategy in Iraq , " he said April 24 , ahead of a veto showdown with congressional Democrats over their desire to legislation a troop withdrawal timeline .
" I listened .
Today , General David Petraeus is carrying out a strategy that is dramatically different from our previous course . "
Increasingly isolated on a war that is going badly , Bush has presented his alternative reality in other ways , too .
He expresses understanding for the public 's dismay over the unrelenting sectarian violence and American losses that have passed 3,400 , but then asserts that the public 's solution matches his .
Article Continues After These Ads
" A lot of Americans want to know , you know , when ? " he said at a Rose Garden news conference Thursday .
" When are you going to win ? "
Also in that session , Bush said : " I recognize there are a handful there , or some , who just say , ' Get out , you know , it 's just not worth it .
Let 's just leave . '
I strongly disagree with that attitude .
Most Americans do as well . "
In fact , polls show Americans do not disagree , and that leaving -- not winning -- is their main goal .
In one released Friday by CBS and the New York Times , 63 percent supported a troop withdrawal timetable of sometime next year .

とりあえず、疑問があれば、このスレで粕に公開質問するようにorz
一連の報道を見てみると、確かに微妙に事実関係に揺れがあります。
朝日新聞の記者 がJASRAC の役員に 、「 2006年度の決算書にアップルからの支払いが載っていないようだが」と質問したところ、JASRACの役員は「暫定的な金額は支払ってもらっているが、権利者への分配がまだ終わっていないから、決算書に載せてない」と回答したという。
このasciiの記事が正しくて、決算書に載せてないとすると、次のような問題が。

決算書に載せてない 決算書に載せてない 決算書に載せてない は？ カスラックさん2.5億円の著作権使用料を決算書に計上しないって
粉飾ですか？ 脱税ですか？ 裏金ですか？？ ところで、決算書に計上しなかった、使用料はどこいっちゃうんですか？ 配当するなら、普通は積立金で計上しますよね？ なんで、未払使用料に計上しなかったんですか ？

いけない金だから、アップルからのは該当しない。

The other day my BlackBerry alarm went off at 5 AM , as usual .
For some reason I was abnormally tired so I stayed in bed another hour .
At 6 AM I popped out of bed , walked across the street to my office and started my workday .
After an hour or so of happily working , I noticed the sun had n’t come up on time .
I could think of two possible explanations :
1 . The Earth had stopped rotating and I did n’t live on the lucky side of the planet .
2. I had forgotten to reset the time on my BlackBerry after my trip from the East Coast .
Naturally I decided to first check on the rotation of the Earth .
So I flushed a toilet to see if there was any change in the Coriolis effect .
Unfortunately , I did n’t have a control toilet on a planet I knew was rotating , so the test was inconclusive .
I moved to plan B and checked the time .
This was easier .
All it required was looking at the lower right hand side of my computer display .
Oops .
I had accidentally gone to work at 3 AM .
Luckily , I ’m a morning person .
So I just kept working .
It was n’t an issue .
But that ’s not my point .
My point is this :
If you thought my joke about the Coriolis effect was funny , I predict no one wanted to have sex with you in the past week .
And next week is n’t looking good for you either .
And if you read this post and thought to yourself , “ There ’s no way he would have the sensitive instruments necessary to measure the Coriolis effect , ” I predict you have not had sex for at least a month .
And next month is n’t looking good for you either .
How close is my prediction ?
Army Secretary resigns , soldiers gagged
Washington tries to quash scandal over neglect of wounded troops
By Bill Van Auken
3 March 2007
In an increasingly desperate bid to quell a raging scandal over the gross neglect of severely wounded troops , US Secretary of the Army Francis Harvey resigned Friday , just one day after he himself had fired the commanding officer at Walter Reed Army Medical Center .
President Bush , meanwhile , announced that he is forming a bipartisan commission to investigate medical care provided at Walter Reed as well as to wounded soldiers and military veterans in general .
The resignation and firing came a week and a half after the Washington Post published a series of articles detailing the appalling conditions in Walter Reed ’s outpatient facilities and the bureaucratic abuse that confronts the war - wounded , many of them recovering from amputations , severe head wounds or psychological disorders resulting from the carnage in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The Army issued a statement Thursday declaring that it had “ lost trust and confidence ” in Maj .
Gen. George Weightman , who had occupied the top post at the facility for just six months .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates , however , issued a subsequent statement Friday accusing “ some in the Army ” of failing to recognize “ the seriousness of the situation pertaining to outpatient care at Walter Reed . ”
On the same day as General Weightman ’s firing , the Army Times published an article revealing that the Pentagon has imposed a gag order on the wounded at Walter Reed , ordering them not to talk to the media .
Soldiers also told the newspaper that new procedures requiring them to wake at 6 a.m. each morning and submit to room inspections were being instituted .
“ Some soldiers believe this is a form of punishment for the trouble soldiers caused by talking to the media , ” one wounded patient told the Army Times .
The paper further reported that wounded soldiers are being moved out of Building 18 , a squalid former motel across the street from the Walter Reed complex that was the focus of the Post ’s series , and into a barracks inside the medical facility ’s grounds .
It noted that to get into the new facility “ reporters must be escorted by public affairs personnel . ”
The article further revealed that the Pentagon has “ clamped down on media coverage of any and all Defense Department medical facilities , to include suspending planned projects by CNN and Discovery Channel . ”
Amid the hypocritical bipartisan expressions of outrage over the unconscionable treatment of maimed and traumatized young soldiers , this is the essence of the official response to the revelations — scapegoating , retaliation and cover-up .
There is ample reason for this vindictive response .
The exposé has appeared as military officials in Iraq are reporting mounting concerns over falling morale among US occupation forces under conditions in which the vast majority of the American public has turned against the war .
Moreover , a sharp increase in US casualties is anticipated as the Bush administration ’s “ surge ” in Baghdad goes into effect , throwing an increased number of US troops into bloody urban combat .
The conditions revealed at Walter Reed not only exposed appalling incompetence and indifference ; they also gave the lie to a central ideological pillar of the criminal wars and occupations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Both major parties — Democrats as much as Republicans — ceaselessly justify their continued support for these wars in the name of “ supporting the troops . ”
Both parties treat any suggestion that funding for these wars be cut off as unthinkable .
According to this twisted logic , the only way to support the soldiers and marines deployed in Iraq is to keep them in a dirty war in which more and more are being killed and maimed daily , while taking them out off harm ’s way — and ending an occupation that has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis — would constitute some kind of betrayal .
What has been revealed at Walter Reed only confirms the obvious — official Washington could not give a damn for the troops .
They are invoked only as needed in the attempt to suppress popular opposition to the war within the US itself .
Drawn overwhelmingly from working class backgrounds , they are viewed as mere cannon fodder for American imperialism ’s wars of aggression and conquest in Central Asia and the Middle East , a disposable commodity that once damaged can be thrown onto the scrap heap .
And scrap heap , as the Washington Post series demonstrated , is no rhetorical exaggeration .
“ Signs of neglect are everywhere : mouse droppings , belly - up cockroaches , stained carpets , cheap mattresses , ” the Post ’sDana Priest and Anne Hull wrote in the articles published last month .
The outpatient facility housing hundreds of maimed soldiers just five miles from the White House is also marred by holes in the walls , floors and ceilings and mold in the patients ’ rooms .
“ Many soldiers with impaired memory from brain injuries sat for weeks with no appointments and no help from staff to arrange them , ” the Post reported .
“ Many disappeared even longer .
Some simply left for home . ”
The report recounted the case of one 19 - year - old soldier who returned from Iraq with post traumatic stress disorder , who was found dead in his room from alcohol poisoning .
Others just wandered away from the facility , and two were killed in a high - speed car crash last November after leaving the hospital .
Woefully understaffed , the hospital has assigned wounded soldiers — many of them facing their own psychological problems — to supervise other patients , some of whom are suicidal .
In an attempt to maintain some semblance of military discipline , the wounded troops are compelled to fall in each day for roll call .
“ Soldiers limp to an old Red Cross building in rain , ice and snow , ” the Post reports .
“ Army regulations say they ca n’t use umbrellas , even here .
A triple amputee has mastered the art of putting on his uniform by himself and rolling in just in time .
Others are so gorked out on pills that they seem on the verge of nodding off . ”
The worst of it is that the wounded soldiers are kept in this facility on average for 10 months and some for as long as two years , waiting for the military ’s medical boards to render a decision as to whether they will be returned to duty or discharged .
If it is the latter , this bureaucracy must further determine how much compensation the soldiers will receive — if any — for their disabilities .
As the Army Times points out , in 2001 , before the Bush administration launched the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , 10 percent of military personnel who were medically discharged received permanent disability benefits .
By 2005 , with the number of wounded steadily mounting , this ratio had fallen to just 3 percent .
A similar decline was registered among reservists , with those receiving such benefits falling from 16 percent to 5 percent .
The paper further points out that the staff assigned to handle such claims has been drastically reduced .
It cited testimony by a senior Army personnel officer , who told a House panel in 2005 that three Army evaluation boards with a total staff of just 70 had handled 15,000 cases in 2004 .
He pointed out that the last time the military had confronted such a caseload was in 1972 during the Vietnam War .
At that time , the Army had six boards with a total of 260 employees .
The result , the Post report indicates , is the fumbling of paperwork and delays in the process that lead many to walk away from the process in despair .
Large numbers of those rendered physically or psychologically disabled are denied benefits , often on the grounds that their problems stem from preexisting conditions and cannot be attributed to the effects of combat .
The most telling signal of the contempt of the White House and the Pentagon for these wounded soldiers is the decision to replace the sacked General Weightman with his superior , Lt. Gen .
Kevin Kiley , who had previously commanded Walter Reed and is blamed by many for doing nothing to ameliorate the squalid conditions that were already well known when he was in charge .
Kiley , who is now surgeon general of the Army and chief of the US Army Medical Command , was the commander at Walter Reed until 2004 .
He still resides at the facility , inhabiting plush quarters across the street from Building 18 , with a clear view of the ramshackle outpatient facility .
Public criticism of Kiley ’s interim appointment was widely seen as a probable motive for Harvey ’s being forced to resign as Army secretary .
On the same day as the resignation , the Army hastily named another senior medical officer , Gen. Eric Shoomaker , as a permanent appointment to the senior post at Walter Reed .
Various Democratic politicians have seized upon the Walter Reed scandal for political purposes , seeing in the issue an opportunity to attack the Bush administration while posing as champions of “ our troops , ” and , by implication , of militarism in general .
Typical of this response was New York ’s Senator Hillary Clinton , a front - runner in the emerging contest for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination .
Calling for an investigation into “ what Army leaders knew and when they knew it , ” Clinton wrote , “ Our nation has a duty to honor and support those who have served and sacrificed so much in the defense of our nation .
Yet these recent news reports indicate that for nearly four years , since the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq began , not enough has been done to assist these courageous men and women in recovering from the wounds of battle . ”
Clinton , of course , voted in October 2002 to authorize the war and thus bears a direct responsibility for the deaths of nearly 3,200 troops , the wounding of nearly 25,000 as well as the slaughter of an estimated 655,000 Iraqis .
Moreover , as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , she was charged with oversight of the military , something which proved of precious little use to the amputees and other wounded languishing in Walter Reed ’s outpatient facility .
That the Democrats intend to do nothing to halt this carnage was spelled out once again this week , with the announcement by Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives that the party intends to push through a budget offering $ 98 billion to continue waging the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq — $ 5 billion more than was requested by the White House .
The Sinclair ZX Spectrum helped kickstart a revolution
The small , black computer with iconic rubber keys ignited the home computer age in the UK and beyond , led to an explosion in computer manufacturing and developed software programming talent that is still in evidence today .
The computer was the brainchild of British technology entrepreneur Sir Clive Sinclair who also , with the Sinclair Cambridge , developed one of the first cheap and slim pocket calculators in 1972 .
The Spectrum was the third home computer to be released by Sinclair - following the ZX80 and ZX81 - but was the first aimed squarely at the home .
The machine came in two models - £ 125 for a 16KB machine and £ 175 for a 48 KB machine , making it one of the first affordable machines .
First experience
For many people in the UK the Spectrum was their first experience of using a computer and it quickly gained a loyal following .
Sir Clive Sinclair with his latest invention , the A - bike
Enlarge Image
At the time it was competing against the BBC Micro , which had been released the year earlier and was popular in schools , but was priced starting at £ 235 .
Other machines from rival firms in the UK followed , among them the Jupiter Ace , Dragon 32 and Oric Atmos .
Rick Dickinson , who was responsible for the look and shape of the machine , said the company had no idea it would make such an impact .
" We started selling kit computers to hobbyists and thought we would sell 1,000 machines a month .
" We went on to sell 200,000 a month and ran into supply problems . "
He said cost was the driving factor behind the design .
' No references '
" At the time Sinclair was producing pocket calculators , electronic watches , miniature TVs and until they were made , they did not exist in the market .
" Likewise , with the ZX80 , ZX81 and Spectrum , there were no references .
" Everything was cost driven .
The design was the face of the machine .
" All the Sinclair products have a very minimalist , very Bauhaus approach - there 's no unnecessary detail , or superfluous featuring .
They are very elegant . "
Mr Dickinson modestly described his design as " nothing revolutionary " .
" Form does tend to follow function .
We wanted a thin , elegant form . "
Many of today 's video game luminaries cut their teeth on Sinclair computers , among them Dave Perry , who runs Shiny Entertainment , and Tim and Chris Stamper , who founded Rare .
In 1967 Sir Cive Sinclair pioneered the miniature TV
" Sir Clive Sinclair gave so many British people an incredible step up into the videogame industry , which in a few more years will be bigger than the music industry , " said Mr Perry , who began writing games as a school child on the ZX81 and became a professional programmer thanks to the Spectrum .
" Clive is a national hero , " said Mr Dickinson .
" He loved looking for technology ideas and often had an idea and had to wait for the technology to catch up .
' Pioneering techniques '
" As a consequence , we were constantly pushing the envelope , pioneering manufacturing techniques which had not been done before .
" All of the technologies in Sinclair products are now implemented all over the world - from the button on your toothbrush to the buttons on a mobile phone . "
INSIDE THE SPECTRUM 8 - bit Z80 processor 16KB or 48 KB of RAM memory 16KB of ROM Eight colours displayed 256*192 resolution
Many computer programmers today say they owe their careers to the Spectrum .
Nick Humphries , a programmer in the UK who runs a website devoted to the machine , said : " The Spectrum was the first computer we owned .
" It was quite intimidating at the time .
We had to get a neighbour round to help get it working .
" But it had an astonishing impact .
I did an incredible amount of experimentation with it during my time with it .
It was a great tool . "
Two more models were released by Sinclair Research between 1982 and 1986 , before Amstrad bought the Spectrum range and brand .
More models with improved processor speeds , more memory and built - in disk drives were released but the machines were facing intense competition from cheaper PC clones , Japanese manufacturers , and the arrival of dedicated games consoles .
Discontinued
It was officially discontinued in 1992 .
For many people the Spectrum now lives on through emulation ; there are many computer programs for PC and Mac as well as mobile devices , that can play digital versions of old Spectrum games .
But there are also a number of websites dedicated to the machine .
Martijn van der Heide , who runs the website World of Spectrum , said the day a friend received his Spectrum is one he will never forget .
" We were all sitting there , looking intently as he opened the box , pulled out the various pieces of hardware , manuals and tapes .
" It was nothing short of astonishing , with a colourful loading screen , weird noises coming out of the speaker while loading , and the games on that tape .
Simple ones , sure , but they made a great impact . "
Mr Humphries said : " The enthusiasm lives on .
It 's partly nostalgia but also because at the time we were too young to master the machine and take it to the next level .
Now we can . "
The Spectrum 's reign as the UK's most popular computer was brief but its legacy and the affection in which it is held remains to this day .
When Congress passed a law last year providing for an earlier start , and later finish , to Daylight Savings Time , the primary justification given was the assertion that it would lead to decreased energy consumption as people spent more time outside during the extended daylight hours .
Well , now that we ’ve made it through the three extended weeks of DST , the evidence is out and it ’s not very convincing :
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) –
The early onset of Daylight Savings Time in the United States this year may have been for naught .
The move to turn the clocks forward by an hour on March 11 rather than the usual early April date was mandated by the U.S. government as an energy - saving effort .
But other than forcing millions of drowsy American workers and school children into the dark , wintry weather three weeks early , the move appears to have had little impact on power usage .
“ We have n’t seen any measurable impact , ” said Jason Cuevas , spokesman for Southern Co. , one of the nation ’s largest power companies , echoing comments from several large utilities
This should n’t come as much of a surprise , since the Energy Department told Congress this would happen last year :
That may come as no surprise to the Energy Department , which last year predicted only modest energy savings because the benefits of the later daylight hour would be offset .
For example , households may draw less electricity for lights at night , but will use more power in the early in the day as they wake to darker and chillier mornings .
One would have thought Congress would ’ve figured this out on it ’s own ……..
A private venture hailed as the beginning of a new age of cheap and reliable access to space suffered a setback yesterday when its first rocket was lost over the Pacific Ocean about a minute after liftoff .
The rocket , called Falcon , was being launched from Omelek Island in the Marshall Islands by SpaceX , a company that has $ 200 million in contracts from the Pentagon , foreign governments and private companies to put small payloads in orbit .
The company said Falcon was carrying an Air Force satellite .
The founder of SpaceX , Elon Musk , said in a statement , " We had a successful liftoff , and Falcon made it well clear of the launch pad , but unfortunately the vehicle was lost later in the first - stage burn . "
In an interview , a spokeswoman for the company , Diane Molina , said no further information would be available until SpaceX had a better idea of what went wrong .
Mr. Musk has put $ 100 million of his fortune from dot - com ventures like PayPal into the space company .
He has been an evangelist for the notion that going to space , for cargo and human flight , could be far cheaper than the systems paid by governments and large contractors .
Introduction
Rails has already planted its flag firmly in the ground of database driven web applications .
ActiveMessaging is a Rails plugin framework that extends the borders of Rails territory by adding simplified messaging integration .
With ActiveMessaging and Rails now you can loosely integrate with systems as disparate as mainframes sending MQ messages or J2EE webapps , offload processing long - running tasks , or create applications with event or message - driven architectures .
As others have put it , ActiveMessaging is trying to do for messaging what ActiveRecord does for databases .
This article will introduce you to ActiveMessaging and related technologies , and get you started using it in your Rails applications now .
Messaging Standards and Brokers
Three things you need to get messaging working : a communication protocol , a broker speaking this protocol , and a client library for your applications speak the protocol .
Technically , the fourth thing is a system to send messages to , but in this example we 'll create a system that 's a bit pathetic and talks to itself .
For the protocol , ActiveMessaging supports Stomp : Streaming Text - Oriented Messaging Protocol .
Stomp is a messaging standard to exchange text based messages over wire connections , usually tcp / ip .
The idea was to make a protocol simple enough that clients and servers for it can be created easily in almost any language ( e.g. the Ruby Stomp client is about 400 lines , soaking wet with comments and blank lines ) , so it should be possible to integrate almost any system .
The Apache ActiveMQ message broker supports Stomp natively , though other broker options are available , with more coming all the time .
In fact , the recently announced StompConnect project makes any JMS broker into a Stomp broker , which opens up Stomp , and ActiveMessaging , to practically every open source and proprietary messaging product .
On the client side , ActiveMessaging supports protocols using an adapter pattern , and for Stomp it extends the Stomp RubyGem to be that adapter .
More adapters are possible and in the works , but Stomp is the only one supported today .

For this article , I 'll be using ActiveMQ as the broker , and working with the as yet unreleased 4.2 branch .
ActiveMQ has install instructions for all platforms , but here 's a simple procedure that assumes you have Java 1.4 or later :
cd /usr / local / src
#unix and cygwin
wget http://people.apache.org/repo/m2-snapshot-repository/org/apache/activemq/apache-activemq/4.2-SNAPSHOT/apache-activemq-4.2-20070221.081507-10-src.tar.gz
#os x
curl - O http://people.apache.org/repo/m2-snapshot-repository/org/apache/activemq/apache-activemq/4.2-SNAPSHOT/apache-activemq-4.2-20070221.081507-10-src.tar.gz
cd ..
tar xvfz apache - activemq-4.2-20070221.081507-10-src.tar.gz
cd apache - activemq-4.2-incubator-SNAPSHOT
./bin/activemq
That 's it !
By default , ActiveMQ's Stomp support should be configured to start up automatically , but if not you should add the following line to conf / activemq.xml :
< transportConnectors >
...
<!--
Add this line -->
< transportConnector name = " stomp " uri=" stomp://localhost:61613 " />
</transportConnectors >
That 's the minimum , to configure ActiveMQ to your heart 's desire , check out the ActiveMessaging wiki page on ActiveMQ , and the using ActiveMQ guides .
Rails Setup
Assuming you have Rails 1.1 + and MySql already , you 'll also need 2 more RubyGems : daemons and Stomp :
sudo gem install daemons
sudo gem install stomp
Let 's start with a newly minted Rails ' MessageMonster ' , a database for it , and install the ActiveMessaging plugin :
cd /usr / local/dev
rails MessageMonster
mysqladmin create messagemonster_development -u root
cd MessageMonster
script / plugin install http://activemessaging.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/activemessaging
All the pre-requisites are in place , so it 's time to write an application .
Processing Messages
We 'll start by creating a ' processor ' , which in ActiveMessaging lingo is a class that subscribes to destinations in order to receive and act on messages .
It is the message driven equivalent of your controllers , and along with your model where you 'll put most of your code .
As Rails has taught you to expect , there is a generator to create processors .
Let 's create one that saves messages it receives to show ActiveRecord integration :
script / generate processor PersistMessage
Running this generate for the first time outputs the following :
create app / processors
create app / processors/persist_message_processor.rb
create config/messaging.rb
create config/broker.yml
create app/ processors/application.rb
create script / poller
app / processors is the directory for all the processors .

app/processors/persist_message_processor.rb is the new processor , with a default implementation for you to work from .

is used for the rest of the messaging configuration , like destinations and message headers .
script / poller is the daemon used by ActiveMessaging to listen for messages .
More on this script later .
Let 's talk about each of these a moment .
Let 's check out the broker .
yml file first , to see the options and make sure the development broker configuration is right :
development :
adapter : stomp
login : " "
passcode : " "
host : localhost
port : 61613
reliable : true
reconnectDelay : 5
...
All of these values are exactly what we need for our default ActiveMQ installation , but for production you will likely have a user and password , and if you run your broker remotely , a different host and port .
So now let 's look at the persist_message_processor.rb :
class PersistMessageProcessor < ApplicationProcessor
subscribes_to :persist_message
def on_message ( message )
logger .
debug " PersistMessageProcessor received : " + message
end
end
By default you 'll see it is subscribed to : persist_message and has one method , on_message , which will be invoked by ActiveMessaging when messages for the : persist_message subscription arrive .
The body of the message is passed in as the string argument message , but if you need to get to the Stomp message object itself , it is available in the @message processor attribute .
Processors can subscribe to more than one queue , simply add anther call to subscribes_to .
The : persist_message symbol is a logical name for the destination to which this processor subscribes , the definition of this destination was generated in config / messaging.rb :
ActiveMessaging :: Gateway .
define do | s |
s . queue : persist_message , ' / queue / PersistMessage '
end
To use a comparison to Rails , messaging.rb is most like routes.rb .
It allows you to map a logical name ( : persist_message ) to a destination on the broker ( / queue / PersistMessage ) .
Though there is much more that can be configured here , the generated default is fine for this example .
Now we 'll teach the processor to save its messages for a rainy day , starting with creating a model for the messages .
script / generate model message
Now update ' db/migrate/001_create_messages.rb ' with 2 additional columns :
create_table : messages do | t |
t . column : body , : text
t . column : received_date , : datetime
end
Call migrate to create the table ...
rake db:migrate
... and on to updating the processor on_message method to use the new Message model :
def on_message ( message )
logger .
debug " PersistMessageProcessor received : " + message
my_message = Message .
create ( : body= > message , :received_date= > DateTime . new )
end
Now , you 're looking at this and thinking that 's nothing new - this is just how you would write the same thing in a Rails controller .
That 's the point , when you use ActiveMessaging , all the convenience of the Rails application environment is available to you .
With a processor to catch them , it 's time to start throwing messages ( bottles sold separately ) .
Sending Messages
To send messages we 'll use a Rails view and controller in the same application :
script / generate controller SendMessage index
Edit the view to submit message text , and to show a refreshable list of previously persisted messages :
< p style= " color : green " > <%= flash [ : notice ] %> </ p> < h1 > Send Message </h1 > <%= start_form_tag :action => ' new ' %> < label > Message </ label > <%= text_field_tag : message , @message %> < %= submit_tag " submit " %> <%= end_form_tag %> <%= link_to " Refresh List " , :action => " index " %> < table > <% @messages .
each do | m | -%> < tr>< td> <%= m . received_date %>
</td><td> <%= m . body %>
</td></tr> <% end %> </ table >
Edit the controller to send the message .
To make sending from any class easier , ActiveMessaging has a mixin MessageSender that provides a simple publish method .
The publishes_to method declares to which destination a class intends to send , but does nothing more than validate that the destination is in config / messaging.rb .
Here is how the controller uses these methods :
require ' activemessaging / processor '
class SendMessageController < ApplicationController
include ActiveMessaging :: MessageSender
publishes_to :persist_message
def index
@messages = Message . find : all
end
def new
@message = params [ : message ]
publish : persist_message , @message
flash [ : notice ] = " ' # {@message} ' sent "
@messages = Message . find : all
render :action => ' index '
end
end
And that , as they say , is that .
The controller will send a message on submit , and when next you view or refresh the page you 'll see the messages saved by the processor .
Running the Example
ActiveMessaging runs in its own process , controlled by the script / poller , which can be a gotcha – just starting the Rails server is not enough if you want to receive messages , and messages are received into a different running process than Rails .
To run this example , we need 3 processes : the ActiveMQ broker , the Rails server running to send the message , and the script / poller to receive it , each running in their own terminal :
Start ActiveMQ :
cd /usr/local/apache-activemq-4.2-incubator-SNAPSHOT
./bin/activemq
Start Rails :
cd /usr / local/dev/MessageMonster
script / server
Run ActiveMessaging :
cd /usr / local/dev/MessageMonster
script / poller run
The script / poller follows the usual daemon semantics .
Besides ' run ' which keeps the processing in the foreground , you can also pass it ' start ' , ' stop ' , 'restart ' and ' status ' .
It also uses allows you to run multiple instances simultaneously , a useful for handling higher volumes of messages .
Now navigate to the test page ( i.e. http://localhost:3000/send_message ) and enter a message such as the canonical " Hello World " .
When the message is sent you should see the following in the poller window :
Loading /usr / local/dev/MessageMonster/app/processors/application.rb
Loading /usr / local/dev/MessageMonster/app/processors/persist_message_processor.rb
=> Subscribing to / queue / PersistMessage ( processed by PersistMessageProcessor )
=>
All subscribed , now polling
PersistMessageProcessor received : Hello World
The poller always shows what processors it loads on start - up , and what subscriptions requests on the broker .
If the broker is unavailable or lost , it will try to reconnect based on your broker .
yml configuration .
After the poller start output , you can now also see the ActiveMessaging processor has received the message sent from Rails .
Likewise , if you use the ' Refresh List ' button , you 'll see the message in the Rails view once it is persisted by the ActiveMessaging processor .
Where to go from here
I hope you enjoyed this intro to ActiveMessaging , hopefully you can see both its potential and ease of use .
ActiveMessaging has more advanced capabilities not covered in this article , such as improved exception handling , grouping processors to be run by multiple pollers , or how to use Stomp and ActiveMQ message headers for tricks like synchronous messaging , JMS integration , and selective subscriptions .
If you are thinking after seeing the basics that ActiveMessaging is too limited for your needs , I think you might be pleasantly surprised .
For more information , I recommend perusing the ActiveMessaging project site , especially the wiki and the code .
We are constantly improving ActiveMessaging , so to both stay up on changes ( and recommend or submit your own ) read or join the mailing list .
Thanks for your attention , and happy messaging !

World ’s Tallest Billboard ?
30 - story Transformers billboard in Hollywood
Googling around , I could find a 1 km long billboard in Kuwait being touted as the world ’s largest billboard , but could n’t find anything taller than this one .
This is an entire building under construction at Sunset & Vine in Hollywood , which has been covered in its entirety by an advertisement for the Transformers Movie .
Personally , I think it ’s damn impressive , and it has nothing whatever to do with the fact that I was an avid Transformers fan as a little kid , and can of course still sing the Transformers theme song verbatim .
Personally , I think it ’s a brilliant advertising piece .
I think immediately of L. Ron Hubbard ‘s brilliant text from the Scientology administrative volumes called Marketing Posters , where he says ,
“ A totally effective poster stands all by itself without needing any words . ”
“ The ideal poster is something which you just paint without any captions or illustrations and people will see it and interpret it at once .
That is the ideal poster . ” — LRH
That bulding has an enormous Megatron on the east side of the building which at night has an ominous 2 - story glowing red eye .
It ’s impinging .

Work completed by physics professors at Rowan University shows that light is made of particles and waves , a finding that refutes a common belief held for about 80 years .
Shahriar S. Afshar , the visiting professor who is currently at Boston 's Institute for Radiation - Induced Mass Studies ( IRIMS ) , led a team , including Rowan physics professors Drs. Eduardo Flores and Ernst Knoesel and student Keith McDonald , that proved Afshar ’s original claims , which were based on a series of experiments he had conducted several years ago .
An article on the work titled " Paradox in Wave - Particle Duality " recently published in Foundations of Physics , a prestigious , refereed academic journal , supports Albert Einstein ’s long - debated belief that quantum physics is incomplete .
For eight decades the scientific community generally had supported Niels Bohr ’s ideas commonly known as the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics .
In 1927 , in his “ Principle of Complementarity , ” he asserted that in any experiment light shows only one aspect at a time , either it behaves as a wave or as a particle .
Einstein was deeply troubled by that principle , since he could not accept that any external measurement would prevent light to reveal its full dual nature , according to Afshar .
The fundamental problem , however , seemed to be that one has to destroy the photon in order to measure either aspects of it .
Then , once destroyed , there is no light left to measure the other aspect .
“ About 150 years ago , light was thought to behave solely as a wave similar to sound and water waves .
In 1905 , Einstein observed that light might also act as being made out of small particles .
Since then physicists found it difficult understanding the full nature of light since in some situations it acts like a particle and in others like a wave , ” Flores said .
“ This dual nature of light led to the insight that all fundamental physical objects include a wave and a particle aspect , even electrons , protons and students . ”
Afshar conducted his initial theoretical and experimental work at IRIMS , where he served the privately funded organization as a principal investigator .
He later continued his work at the Harvard University Physics Department as a research scholar , where he was able to verify his initial findings before going to Rowan .
In 2004 , Afshar claimed that he had devised an experiment that challenged Bohr ’s principle of complementarity .
The Rowan team was formed to verify Afshar ’s claim at extremely low light intensity levels .
Afshar , Flores and Knoesel conducted experiments at Rowan that validated Afshar ’s initial findings for single photons .
In this modified double - slit experiment , a laser beam hits a screen with two small pinholes .
As a particle , light goes through one of the pinholes .
Through a lens system , the light is then imaged onto two detectors , where a certain detector measures only the photons , which went through a particular pinhole .
In this way , Afshar verified the particle nature of light .
As a wave , light goes through both pinholes and forms a so - called interference pattern of bright and dark fringes .
“ Afshar ’s experiment consists of the clever idea of putting small absorbing wires at the exact position of the dark interference fringes , where you expect no light , ” Knoesel said .
“ He then observed that the wires do not change the total light intensity , so there are really dark fringes at the position of the wires .
That proves that light also behaves as a wave in the same experiment in which it behaves as a particle . ”
The findings of the Afshar experiment were published online on January 23 in the Foundations of Physics , an international journal devoted to the conceptual bases and fundamental theories of modern physics , biophysics and cosmology , with several distinguished Nobel laureates on its editorial board .
The print version was published in the February 2007 edition and is now available in libraries throughout the world .
“ The important new contribution is that light carries both wave and particle aspects at all times , and future experiments will further clarify the nature of each component . ”
Afshar said .
Flores continued , “ It is interesting to note that even after 80 years we can still gain a better understanding about the nature of light using refined measurement techniques and creative ideas and therefore are able add to the vast insights of former scientists . ”

Brian Aker was a recent guest on the LinuxCast podcast with Don Marti .
Brian has some interesting thoughts in this podcast and elsewhere on his blog , on motivations for writing Free and / or Open Source software .
Here ’s why I do it myself .
First an overview of the podcast , for context : the topics were storage engines , distributed version control , and motivation for open - source .
( You should listen to it , if you have n’t — it ’s short and Brian is a great speaker .
I listened to it twice . )
I ’ve been thinking for a while about why I write the MySQL Toolkit and innotop InnoDB and MySQL monitor for free .
Some people have even tried to convince me to sell them .
Brian ’s comments gave me some things to think about .
The simplest — but incomplete — reason I is I like doing it , I have a lot of unfinished things I can’t finish fast enough to keep up with my new ideas as it is , and I do n’t want to divert effort into making it a business .
My feeling is that would add a lot to my list of things I need to learn and do .
But there are many more reasons , in fact .
It helps me avoid commitment and the guilt of not meeting commitments — if I do n’t get something done , that ’s fine .
What I do is more than nothing , and nobody should complain .
And I know if I lose interest or for some other reason stop doing this , others can take it over .
That ’s why I made such an effort to put it on Sourceforge ( and yes , it is more work to put it on Sourceforge than to do it myself .
They do n’t even back up your files for you ) .
It builds my personal brand , helps me network , and opens doors for me .
People know me through my work who would n’t know me otherwise , and vice versa .
I get a lot of opportunities I suspect I would n’t have if I were trying to make a business out of these tools .
My employer uses these tools .
I build them to solve my own problems .
25 % of the work is done anyway ; why not release it ?
Releasing it also gives me the incentive to turn the tools into much more finished products , with real documentation and test suites and decent command - line behavior that conforms to expectations .
My employer gets community improvements sometimes .
Brian mentions the pervasive myth that when you open the source code for something you get a flood of improvements , feedback , and patches .
As he says , this does n’t happen .
But it occasionally does , and seldom is better than never .
This is probably one of the biggest reasons my employer lets me release things , under my name with my copyright , that I sometimes even work on while I ’m at work .
That , and we have a great company culture and my boss knows I believe deeply in Freedom , and what ’s important to me is important to him too .
I ’m being of service , and that feels good .
Brian is probably right that this is a fairly small factor for most people who develop Free Software , in my opinion .
I ’m learning and having fun .
Brian comments on people who want to fill missing functions in a commercial product , and make money from that .
I do provide missing functions , and that ’s intentional , but it ’s not to make money — it ’s because I need it .
Providing missing functionality is not an obvious and inevitable reason to write something , by the way .
If I wanted to make a business out of some product , I could just as easily try to duplicate someone ’s work but compete with them on quality or convenience .
Or marketing and packaging , for that matter ; we all know which very large company has made a lot of money doing that .
There are many good business models .
There ’s another element Brian did n’t mention : selling these tools would put me in a totally different frame of mind , one I do n’t think I would enjoy .
I ca n’t say for sure , but I think it would become a chore and I ’d get burned out and resent it .
Sometimes that happens anyway — but when it does I can take a break .
I do spend quite a bit of free time on these things , as Brian says .
Evenings , weekends , and so on .
If you ’re not willing to do that , I suggest you do it for a business .
Speaking of all this , just today I got an email offering me a bounty for fixing a bug in my Javascript number - formatting library .
This is the first time this has ever happened , I think .
A CS Research Topic Generator

How To pick A Worthy Topic In 10 Seconds
Computer Science is facing a major roadblock to further research .
The problem is most evident with students , but afflicts many researchers as well : people simply have a tough time inventing research topics that sound sufficiently profound and exciting .
Many Ph.D. students waste needless years simply coming up with a thesis topic .
And researchers often resort to reading documents from government grant agencies so they will know what to work on for the next proposal !
Good news for the CS community : the problem has at last been solved .
The table below provides the answer .
To generate a technical phrase , randomly choose one item from each column .
For example , selecting synchronized from column 1 , secure from column 2 , and protocol from column 3 produces :
A synchronized secure protocol
A synchronized secure protocol for an interactive knowledge - based system

The researchers have also found a link between sexual inhibition and sexual risk - taking : men who are low in inhibition do not necessarily engage in more or kinkier sex than do their high - inhibition counterparts , but the odds are greater that they will forgo condoms if they indulge .
Most of the studies on the autonomy of sexual brakes and accelerators have been done on men , but scientists lately have begun applying the dual - control model to their studies of female sexuality as well .
At first they used a slightly modified version of the excitement / inhibition questionnaire that had proved valuable for assessing men , but they soon realized that their menu of sex situations and checklist of physical arousal cues might be missing large swaths of a woman ’s sexual persona .
What was the feminine equivalent of an erection anyway ?
Was it vaginal swelling and lubrication , or something else entirely ?
Women are generally smaller and less muscular than men .
What might the feeling of being physically threatened do to enhance or hamper a woman ’s sexual appetite ?
“ We started putting together focus groups , asking women to tell us the various things that might turn them on and turn them off sexually , and how they know when they ’re sexually aroused , ” said Stephanie A. Sanders of the Kinsey Institute and Indiana University .
“ They mentioned a heightened sense of awareness , genital tingling , butterflies in the stomach , increased heart rate and skin sensitivity , muscle tightness .
Then we asked them if they thought the female parallel to an erection is genital lubrication , and they said no , no , you can get wet when you ’re not aroused , it changes with the menstrual cycle , it ’s not a meaningful measure . ”
Through the focus groups , Dr. Sanders and her colleagues compiled a new , female - friendly but admittedly cumbersome draft questionnaire that they whittled down into a useful research tool .
They asked 655 women , ages 18 to 81 , to complete the draft survey and scrutinized the results in search of areas of concurrence and variability .
The researchers have identified a number of dimensions on which their beta testers agreed .
For example , 93 to 96 percent of the 655 respondents strongly endorsed statements that linked sexual arousal to “ feeling connected to ” or “ loved by ” a partner , and to the belief that the partner is “ really interested in me as a person ” ; they also concurred that they have trouble getting excited when they are “ feeling unattractive . ”
But women ’s tastes varied widely in many of the finer details of seduction and setting .
“ Some women say they find the male body odor attractive , others repulsive , ” Dr. Sanders said .
“ Some women are turned on by the idea of having sex in an unusual or unconcealed place where they may be caught in the act , while others have a hard time getting aroused if they think others may hear them , or the kids will walk in . ”
During an hour - long discussion , Hurley and Chen indicated that a long - awaited platform for showing video ads could be ready within the next couple months , although Google 's recently announced $ US3.1 billion acquisition of online ad distributor DoubleClick could delay things .
They also said developing more effective tools to identify videos that violate copyrights remains a priority , and not just because YouTube and Google face several copyright infringement lawsuits that include a $ US1 billion claim by Viacom .
Developing better methods of detecting protected material will pave the way for YouTube to work with copyright holders to negotiate more revenue - sharing agreements that include its vast community of users , Hurley said .
" We will be able to reduce the clutter of stuff that people do n't even watch on our site , " he said .
" That will give us more opportunities to reward the people that are really creating great content for our system . "
In its first step toward that goal , YouTube earlier this month said it was negotiating revenue - sharing agreements with contributors whose videos become big hits .
Yet Hurley believes YouTube would thrive even if Hollywood studios and music labels had all of their material removed from the site .
" What our users want to watch is themselves , " he said .
" They do n't want to watch professionally produced content .
There are so many people with cameras that have the opportunity to create their own content and so many more people with editing tools to tell their stories , we feel this is just the tip of the iceberg . "
Because of its emphasis on grainy , homemade videos , YouTube is n't worried about the efforts of NBC Universal and New Corp to launch their own Internet video channel this summer .
Nor are they concerned about another site , Joost , that has gained the backing of major media like Viacom and CBS .
Those alternatives all seem interested in providing slick , lengthy videos akin to traditional television programming rather than invading YouTube 's niche of serving up two - to three - minute clips , Hurley said .
" We have never been about full - length programming .
We have never been about high - quality .
We do n't really see ourselves building the largest audience by moving in that direction . "
Hurley said YouTube now streams more than 200 million videos each day while adding more than 200,000 videos to its library .
" You Tube is becoming much more than an entertainment destination , " Hurley said , citing the political , news and instructional videos that have poured into YouTube in recent months .
" We want to entertain , inform and empower people with video around the world . "
Toward that end , YouTube plans to create specialised web addresses to serve countries outside the United States .
Foreign viewers already watch about 70 percent of the videos streamed on YouTube , Hurley said .
Hurley , now 30 , and Chen , 28 , never envisioned having such a huge impact on society a little more than two years ago when they began working in a Silicon Valley with another friend , Jawed Karim , to develop an easy way to share videos online .
Karim left YouTube before it became a cultural phenomenon , leading to the Google deal that turned Hurley and Chen into very wealthy , high - tech celebrities .
They both received Google stock now worth more than $ US325 million , but their lifestyles have n't changed that much so far , they said .
" Hopefully , we come across as accessible and humble , " Chen said .
" I try to spend as much time with the same friends and people that were around before the whole user phenomenon started .
I do pay for more dinners now than I did . "
YouTube itself is still trying to justify its hefty sales price .
Despite its huge audience , the company generated about $ US15 million in revenue last year , based on figures provided in Google 's annual report .
Although YouTube already has been showing some ads , analysts do n't expect the site to begin generating dividends until it starts showing video ads .
Hurley said YouTube has been testing ways to target video ads based on the type of content being watched , coupled with viewer 's demographics and physical location .
That approach mirrors some of the methods that have helped establish Google as the internet 's most profitable company .
The ads only will be shown if a viewer chooses to watch them , Hurley said .
Rolling out the new system becomes " a little more complicated with DoubleClick in the mix , to be honest with you .
We want to roll out with an ad strategy that is going to be effective and unified with Google 's plans . "
On the copyright front , YouTube is working with Los Gatos - based Audible Magic to flag unauthorised music posted on site , Chen said .
Developing a " digital fingerprinting " technology to track video copyrights is proving to be more vexing simply because it has never been done very effectively before .
" There are companies putting out press releases after they meet with us about their copyright tools and what they are doing , " Hurley said .
" But basically they 're just learning about what we are doing .
We do n't feel the need to put a press release out there because we are actually working on it and building these tools . "
Once the new copyright tools are finished , Hurley believes more media will view YouTube as friend rather than foe .
" We are working with media companies not only to create new models , but help them stay relevant [ and ] get in front of this new audience that is spending time in different places , " he said .

“ It is the policy of the Board of Supervisors to encourage the continued production of forest products , ” reads the county code , written in 1976 by former Supervisor Gary Patton , long known for his strong environmental stances .
But while the code he wrote has not changed , the attitude of some county leaders has .
And next month , they will further their attempt to curb one of the county ’s first and most controversial industries : harvesting trees .
At their April 24 meeting , supervisors are scheduled to consider increasing the size that a piece of land must be before it can be rezoned for logging .
The requirement sits at five acres , set by supervisors – including Patton – in the 1970s .
Supervisors could raise it as high as 80 acres , which would prohibit logging on 22,600 acres and 1,600 forested parcels , according to documents from the county Planning Department .
That pleases environmentalists , who do n’t like trees falling in the Santa Cruz Mountains .
But it irks some property owners and logging companies already frustrated by the red tape they must cut through to qualify land for logging .
Especially frustrated is Big Creek Lumber Co. owner Bud McCrary , who owns about 15 acres of personal property that he has not rezoned .
Now , he ’s not sure if he will have enough time to do it before a new rule passes .
“ Suppose I were in a situation where I really needed to harvest my 14.96 acres to put one of my kids through school , ” McCrary said .
“ What would I do ?
I could n’t do anything with it .
I would stand there and watch [ the trees ] get bigger and bigger . ”
Other landowners share his fear , said Bob Briggs , on the board of directors for the 150 - member Central Coast Forest Association , which represents small timber landowners and forestry professionals in Santa Cruz County .
“ It ’s essentially reducing the value of what they have considered a personal asset , reducing it to something approaching zero , ” Briggs said .
County leaders , however , consider themselves equally stymied .
Last year , the county won a lawsuit allowing supervisors to require land be zoned for timber production before owners could log it .
But they lost what many considered a crucial point of the suit : rules that would have allowed the county to impose stricter limits on harvesting around streams and other areas than what the state requires .
As a result , while loggers must rezone their land , supervisors legally must approve all the applications to do so if state standards are met .
In the past month , about 20 rezoning applications have breezed through .
The proposed new rule increasing land - size requirements could change that .
“ I think local people are frustrated with the fact that so much local say has been taken out of the community when it comes to timber harvesting , ” said Supervisor Neal Coonerty , who has not decided how he will vote on the issue .
The minimum parcel size remains one thing county leaders can control , he said .
But to McCrary , that ’s not a good reason .
“ Why would they exercise control just because they have it ? ” McCrary asked .
In addition , McCrary said county leaders misled him and the courts into thinking they would not further limit logging once the case was settled .
To Supervisor Mark Stone , though , the issue is important as he hopes raising the minimum parcel size will discourage property owners from zoning their land for logging , cutting the trees and then rezoning the property and developing it .
However , assistant planning director Mark Demming said he has never seen that happen in Santa Cruz County .
If supervisors require parcels to be larger than 80 acres – the maximum allowed by the state – before logging can occur , about 22,600 acres and 1,600 parcels of timber land could be affected , according to the county ’s planning department .
If supervisors place the restriction at 40 acres , about 1,560 parcels and almost 20,600 acres could be affected .
Most of that property that would be affected rests in the mountains between the Forest of Nisene Marks and Castle Rock state parks .
Property owners could still cut trees to prevent wildfires , curb disease or to protect their homes under the proposed rules .
The fight has been brewing since the mid-1970s , when the state took away local control over logging .
Previously , the county kept a forester on staff to review timber harvest plans and make tweaks and recommendations the board deemed necessary 1/3 a process many loggers loathed but environmentalists were comfortable with , Patton said .
But in those days , he added , environmentalists considered logging the better of two options often presented to owners of large swaths of land : cut trees , or build houses .
“ A bad timber harvest can cause some real damages , but over a 100 - year period , the land will revive and take care of itself , ” Patton said .
“ Once you put a house there , it ’s there forever . ”
However , voters passed Measure J in 1978 , which limited growth in the mountains and concentrating new development in Live Oak and other , more urbanized areas .
That , combined with the loss of local logging control , turned many environmentalists against logging , Patton said .
With the residential pressures all but gone , they could do away with the tree- cutting , too , he said .
The Galileo Legend
18 January 2007 at 1:23 pm Peter G. Klein
| Peter Klein |
We noted previously how little most practicing scientists know about the history and philosophy of science .
In many cases this is harmless ; does the average chemist really need to know Lavoisier from Priestly ?
However , when scientists speak and write about the meaning of science , the role of science in society , public policy toward science , and such broader issues , such ignorance can be devastating .
An example is the legend that Galileo Galilei was persecuted by the Catholic Church for his heretical belief that the earth revolves around the sun .
In popular myth Galileo represents the lone crusader , the revolutionary with the courage to speak out against the Establishment and the popular fallacies of his day .
Don Boudreaux titles an ( otherwise excellent ) item on free trade “ What Galileo Must Have Felt , ” writing that “ [ w ] hen I read or hear protectionists such as Sen.
Byron Dorgan , I think that I can imagine what Galileo felt as he listened to the Leaders of his day insist that the sun revolves around the earth . ”
The problem is that the leaders of Galileo ’s day did n’t think the sun revolves around the earth .
My former colleague Thomas Lessl is an expert on Galileo , and from him I learned that virtually every aspect of the Galileo legend is false .
Consider these facts :
1. Neither Galileo , nor any other scientist , was put to death by the medieval Church .
Giordano Bruno , a 17th - century Dominican , was indeed condemned by the Inquisition , not for his scientific views , but for preaching a quirky , New Age - ish view called hermeticism , which was only incidentally connected to heliocentrism .
2 . The Catholic authorities of Galileo ’s day had little trouble with heliocentrism per se .
Many of the leading Catholic scientists were actually Copernicans .
Copernicus ’s treatise on heliocentrism had been in print for seventy years prior to Galileo ’s conflict with the Church .
3. Galileo remained a devout and loyal Catholic until the end of his life .
He held no animosity toward the Church over his conflict with Church authorities .
4 . Most important , the conflict between Galileo and the Church took place in the context of the Protestant Reformation , a context that is almost always omitted from popular accounts of Galileo ’s trial .
The key issue in this conflict was not heliocentrism per se , but the authority of the individual Believer to interpret Scripture .
Galileo ’s argument that scientists should interpret the Bible to conform to their scientific views was close to Luther ’s view that the Believer should be his own interpreter of Scripture .
It was Lutheranism , not heliocentrism , that alarmed the Church leaders .
Galileo , in other words , was caught up in a larger , theological and ecclesiastical controversy .
He was not simply a truth - seeking scientists going up against a bigoted Establishment .
Why does all this matter ?
As Lessl shows in a 2000 essay in the New Oxford Review ( reprinted online here ) , the Galileo myth is useful as a rhetorical device to suggest that organized religion is the enemy of science ( and , by implication , peace , freedom , progress , justice , etc. ) .
Lessl takes Stephen Hawking to task for the off - hand remark , in A Brief History of Time , that “ Galileo , perhaps more than any other single person , was responsible for the birth of modern science .
His renowned conflict with the Catholic Church was central to his philosophy , for Galileo was one of the first to argue that man could hope to understand how the world works , and , moreover , that we could do this by observing the real world . ”
Every part of Hawking ’s statement is an exaggeration or falsehood .
Writes Lessl :
By suggesting that science sprang from the mind of Galileo , like Athena from the brow of Zeus , Hawking sets his readers up for his second sweeping claim that science , ( now mythically personified in Galileo ) , was opposed by the Church because of its novel claim that “ man could hope to understand how the world works ” by “ observing the real world . ”
Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the relationship between Catholicism and science in the centuries leading up to Galileo ’s generation , would know that this statement is fundamentally wrong .
Science based on observation had been the norm in Catholic universities since the Aristotelian revival of the thirteenth century , and religious objections to science , which were much more exceptional than popularly imagined , occurred only where science ’s boundaries overlapped with those of theology .
This was true in Galileo ’s case as well .
The Church was generally favorable to his work .
Indeed , in 1611 , after Galileo published The Starry Messenger , the book which reports the discoveries he made with his telescope , the Vatican college in Rome honored him with a full day of festivities .
Throughout his career , Galileo was befriended by numerous religious intellectuals .
The fact that one of these was Maffeo Barberini , under whose papacy Galileo would latter be prosecuted , merely indicates that the Church ’s action against Copernicanism was more complex than Hawking imagines .
Moral of the story :
Be wary when scientists — not only physical scientists , but social scientists as well — make sweeping claims about the nature or historical significance of their discipline .
Such claims are often based on myth , not fact .

Dell has quietly stopped selling its Axim X51 handheld computer , effectively bringing its range of pocket PCs to an end .
" The Axim X51 family is no longer being offered , and we have no plans for a follow - on product at this time , " a Dell spokesperson told Cnet .
The computer giant had been a major player in the Pocket PC arena since the introduction of its hugely popular Axim line in late 2002 .
It later developed the model to include Bluetooth and Wi-Fi technology while keeping the price tag desirable .
But with the recent arrival of smart phones , sales of pocket PCs have dropped .
There are rumours on various internet forums that Dell could soon enter the smart phone market .
Dell is still selling pocket PC accessories on its website .
MobilitySite had been saying for several months that Dell was planning on withdrawing its pocket PC range , and a comment posted yesterday morning about Axim 's demise said : " It was a great run Dell , good job , but I think you guys are making a big mistake pulling out completely . " ®

It 's Undeniable Friday !
Every Friday , in addition to an odd little factoid , UndeniableFacts.com gives you a fun puzzle , illusion , or activity to enjoy and share .
Today : How to make magnetic water !
Now , I know what you 're thinking : " Dan , water is n't made of metal ! "
Well , you 're right , but I 'll tell you what is made of metal - iron .
What I 'm getting at is that if you could find a way to get iron into some water , we'd be in business .
Enter our friend , Spinach .
As it turns out , spinach 's composition is as much as 27 % iron or more .
But it 's all locked up in the stubbornly tenacious cellular structure of the spinach leaf .
How will we extract it into our water ?
The same way our bodies do : Vitamin C , in the form of lime juice .
So here 's how to do it .
First , get a glass and put about one half cup of water in it .
Grab four limes and squeeze the juice into the glass .
Next , get about three sizable leaves of spinach and submerge them in the water .
Place the glass in your refrigerator ( otherwise the water will turn green ) , and leave overnight .
The next day , carefully fish out the spinach leaves , get a powerful magnet , and go to town !

Researchers at Oxford have built an x86 emulator that runs purely on Java , making it ideal for security researchers who want to analyze and archive viruses , host honeypots and defend themselves against buggy or malicious software without hosing their machines .
The JPC also emulates a host of other environments , giving technophiles the ability to play Asteroids and other software that 's sat on shelves for years collecting dust .
What 's more , JPC will run on any device with a Java virtual machine , so cell phones , set - top boxes and RISC systems are all fair game , according to researchers in the university 's physics department , where the project was developed .
" Some might see JPC as part of a nefarious plot by mad scientists who want to harness every last CPU in the world for their research - but we prefer to see JPC as Java - hardened protection against their buggy programs , " they say .
JPC's Java - based architecture gives it cross- platform capability , the security of running code in the Java sandbox and the flexibility of configuring virtualization platforms and software libraries .
The researchers boast its x86 emulation , at 10 per cent native speed , puts it among the fastest x86 emulators .
( Note : an earlier version of this story incorrectly reported JPC emulated other environments . ) ®
CHANCES are that in the last week someone has irritated you by standing too close , talking too loud or making eye contact for too long .
They have offended you with the high - pitched shrill emanating from the earphones of their iPod or by spreading their legs unnecessarily wide on a packed subway car .
But what makes you feel hostile toward “ close talkers , ” as the show “ Seinfeld ” dubbed people who get within necking distance of you when they speak ?
Or toward strangers who stand very near to you on line ?
Or toward people who take the bathroom stall next to yours when every other one is available ?
Communications scholars began studying personal space and people ’s perception of it decades ago , in a field known as proxemics .
But with the population in the United States climbing above 300 million , urban corridors becoming denser and people with wealth searching for new ways to separate themselves from the masses , interest in the issue of personal space — that invisible force field around your body — is intensifying .
Scientists who say Americans share patterns of movement and behaviors to protect their personal space have recently found new evidence in a cyber game .
My summary of C4 includes what I think are the main points from John Gruber ’s “ HIG is dead ” talk .
( For those who are n’t famiiliar , HIG stands for Human Interface Guidelines , and is a long - lived and ever - violated prescriptive document from Apple ) .
In that entry , I forced myself to ( mostly ) reiterate what I took away as the intended messages from the various speakers .
But these guys got me thinking , and I ’d like to expand upon my reaction to some of the most interesting ideas .
I ’ll start with Gruber .
Is the HIG dead ?
I do n’t know .
But Gruber ’s talk was thought - provoking , and I ’m feeling pretty convinced right now , high on sleep deprivation and freshly returned from the fray .
At the very least I think it ’s time for us crotchety old engineers indoctrinated by System 7 or earlier values to mellow out a bit .
I got so used to defending the party line for so many years , that I stopped questioning whether it was worth defending .
Taking a step back now , I have to wonder why none of us , noticing that Apple was “ constantly violating its own HIG , ” stopped to consider whether we were the suckers for being so hung up about these problems on their behalf .
I ’m picturing some Rowan Atkinson character standing alone on a sinking boat , foolishly but adamantly refusing to bail water as his knees , and then waist , succumb to the rising tide .
“ Queens order !
Bailing shall not be performed by officers !
Somebody bail this water at once !
That ’s an order ! ”
He ’ll die , but he ’ll die having been right .
Is that your fate ?
Cry all you want , but the ship is sinking .
Gruber presented two high - level alternatives for dealing with this situation , so that we continue to produce mechanically and visually beautiful applications ( paraphrased , again because I have no notes ) :
Synthesize an implicit HIG based on prevailing standards .
Do your own thing with gusto .
But these are optimistic instructions .
They only cover the decisions that lead to a beautiful app .
By putting the choices into a context where the ugg - tastic choices are also visible I think we can learn something , and obtain some calm in the face of these “ changing times . ”
I propose that Mac developers have always been neatly divided into two groups : those who give a damn at all about HIG , and those who do n’t .
You know which group you fall into !
I further propose that this high - level differentiator neatly and naturally directs developers towards either Gruber Choice 1 or 2 .
And never the twain shall meet :
Developer gives a damn at all about HIG :
Follow HIG to the letter ( knee - tastically ugly result ) .
Synthesize an implicit HIG based on prevailing standards ( beautiful result ) .
Developer could care less about HIG :
Leveraging X - Windows , Java , and tcl ( ass - tastically ugly result ) .
Do your own thing with gusto ( beautiful or ass- tastic result ) .
Extemporaneous charts do n’t lie .
Obviously you can make beautiful applications whether you believe in the HIG or not .
But most of us prefer to play it safe , and do n’t have the confidence to do our own thing with complete gusto .
So for most of us the decision is the same as it ’s ever been .
We believe in the HIG because it helps us make decisions , but we also recognize that changing tides require changing our own personal rules about these decisions .
If you ’re a developer who gives a damn at all about HIG , then you ’ve already been either following it to the letter or synthesizing an implicit HIG .
The only thing that ’s changed now is the sheer amount of adaptation that may be required in formulating this implicit HIG .
There ’s a lot more work adapting to the current tides .
Bail faster , peon !
Those charmed and beautiful people who can do their own thing with gusto and obtain beutiful results … bastards !
I mean , more power to them .
But they ’ve always been doing it and getting away with it .
They were doing it on System 7 , in their own special way .
They ’re more resilient to the changing implicit HIG , because they choose not to abide by it .
Only those of us ( the masses ) who rely on some form of HIG advice need to adapt furiously in times like these .
And the first step toward a successful adaptation may be , as Gruber suggests , recognizing that the world is comfortable with all kinds of freakin’ buttons .
And gradients are good , mmkay ?
Feeling glum about the implicit HIG ?
Do n’t worry – unlike the real HIG , this one is a sliding scale arrangement .
It ’s a sort of “ gusto and beauty ” plan with a safety net .
You only adopt as much from the prevailing standards as you feel comfortable with .
And if you mess up and end up erring too much in the direction of “ HIG to the letter , ” well things could be worse .
You could look like an ass - tastic Java app .
And when some crotchety old - timer challenges your UI and claims it does n’t comply with the HIG , you can be Apple for the day and smugly reply : “ it complies with my damn HIG ! ” and get back to work .
Update : Scott Stevenson and Michael Tsai have each written thoughtfully about this in their blogs .

It has all the ingredients for the ultimate conspiracy theory .
Take President Bush and his father , throw in a legendary Apache chief , strange rituals performed in the dead of night in a building named the Tomb , grave robbing , and a secret society of elite students called Skull and Bones .
The oft - told tale is that Bush 's grandfather , Prescott Bush , and some of his buddies at Yale , dug up the grave of Apache chief Geronimo , removing his skull and femur and placing them in a glass case in the lobby of the Tomb , the headquarters of the university 's notorious Skull and Bones society back in 1917 .
It 's a story that 's become legend at Yale , passed down from generation to generation .
Despite the lack of clear evidence , every new clue or rumor just adds to its allure .
But could a medicine man in Mescalero , N.M. , be able to definitively prove whether the story is true ?
Harlyn Geronimo , the great grandson of the Apache warrior , wants to prove that the skull is authentic by offering his DNA to see if it matches the bones , and he 's demanding the return of the remains .
" I really believe that that 's my great grandfather 's skull , " Geronimo tells ABCNews.com .
" We want to return him to the Gila Wilderness , where he was born , so the spirit can complete its journey and go on to the next world .
Presently , he 's buried as a prisoner of war and it still has that status over him . "
Geronimo has written to the White House , hoping to obtain the president 's help at retrieving his great grandfather 's remains .
And he 's considering legal action against the society .
The ultrasecret Skull and Bones society 's close - knit members have gone on to powerful positions in both government and business .
Past Bonesmen — including both presidents Bush , President William Howard Taft , Sen. John Kerry , William F. Buckley , Time magazine founder Henry Luce , financier William H. Donaldson , and numerous CIA agents — are sworn to secrecy about the club 's rituals .
At least one member was willing to talk , emphatically stressing that the story is just a tall tale .
Coit Liles claims that Geronimo 's skull is not sitting in the Tomb .
" It 's not there and it never has been there , " Liles says , adding that Prescott Bush or any other Bonesman never dug up the bones .
" It 's just a story . "
Liles is the secretary of RTA Incorporated , the trust that runs the society .
The society may be secretive about their rituals but the trust is a little more open about its activities .
In its 2005 tax return , the New Haven , Conn . - based trust claimed $ 3.7 million in net assets , and that it spent $ 236,683 on education programs of " intellectual inquiry , sensitivity training and personal development " for Yale students .
Despite the denials , plenty of other people believe that the tale rings true based on recent evidence .
Last year , a Yale historian uncovered a letter that seemed to confirm the story .
Written in 1918 , from one Bonesman to another , the letter describes how Prescott Bush and some friends dug up the grave when they were stationed for military duty in Fort Sill , Okla .
" The skull of the worthy Geronimo the Terrible , exhumed from its tomb at Fort Sill by your club ... is now safe inside the [ Tomb ] together with his well - worn femurs , bit and saddle horn , " reads the letter .
The authenticity of the letter certainly lent some credibility to the story , says Alexandra Robbins , who wrote " Secrets of the Tomb , " a history of Skull and Bones .
" Of all the tales about Skull and Bones booty — the skull of [ President ] Martin Van Buren : not true , Pancho Villa : not true , Geronimo : possibly true , " says Robbins .
" Of all the rumors , that one has the most plausibility .
The letter included a very detailed description of the skull . "
As part of her research into what she calls " the country 's most powerful elite alumni network , " Robbins interviewed over 150 Bonesmen .
" They say there is a skull in a glass case just inside the entrance to the Tomb and they 've called it Geronimo . "
Almost two decades ago , another Native American , Ned Anderson , attempted to obtain the skull .
He claimed that then - Congressman John McCain and then - Congressman Morris Udall arranged for him to meet Jonathan Bush , the first President Bush 's brother .
" According to Ned , they brought out a skull but it was obviously a skull of a ten - year - old and they were trying to bluff him and tried to get him to sign papers saying that he would never speak about it again , " says Robbins .
Anderson claimed that he rejected the offer .
The 1918 letter was authenticated by Judith Schiff , the chief research archivist at Yale 's Sterling Memorial Library .
" I think a lot of people thought it was just a legend , but the letter says that students dug up the bones and thought it was Geronimo's , " says Schiff .
" Prescott Bush and the others were at Fort Sill , getting ready to go fight in World War I as part of Yale ROTC , and they may have been roaming the area and had a chance to bring it back to Yale or sent it somehow . "
But is it Geronimo 's skull ?
" Your guess is as good as mine , " says Schiff .
" They thought it was Geronimo 's skull , but who knows ? "
Another Skull and Bones expert , writer Ron Rosenbaum , has his doubts .
" There is no evidence that the skull brought back to New Haven by Prescott Bush and those other people was Geronimo 's skull , " he says .
" Local anthropologists say the grave was unmarked .
Skull and Bonesmen like to boast about it , but it 's more likely that they were conned by some locals who said , ' Hey , you want to buy Geronimo 's skull ? ' "
Christian K. needed to wash his Nitro , which according to Google is probably either a Dodge car , snowboard , fishing boat , punk rock album , sexy movie guide , or web development framework .
Anyhow , he had no outside spigot to use in his apartment complex , so he needed a way to hook it up to his kitchen sink .
Google tried to correct his search , and I have to admit that I 'm more than a little afraid to check this out in Google Image Search .

Sunspots are plentiful nowadays
Scientists based at the Institute for Astronomy in Zurich used ice cores from Greenland to construct a picture of our star 's activity in the past .
They say that over the last century the number of sunspots rose at the same time that the Earth 's climate became steadily warmer .
The warming is being amplified by gases from fossil fuel burning , they argue .
' Little Ice Age '
Sunspots have been monitored on the Sun since 1610 , shortly after the invention of the telescope .
They provide the longest - running direct measurement of our star 's activity .
The variation in sunspot numbers has revealed the Sun 's 11 - year cycle of activity as well as other , longer - term changes .
In particular , it has been noted that between about 1645 and 1715 , few sunspots were seen on the Sun 's surface .
This period is called the Maunder Minimum after the English astronomer who studied it .
Ice cores record climate trends back beyond human measurements
Over the past few thousand years there is evidence of earlier Maunder - like coolings in the Earth 's climate - indicated by tree - ring measurements that show slow growth due to prolonged cold .
In an attempt to determine what happened to sunspots during these other cold periods , Dr Sami Solanki and colleagues have looked at concentrations of a form , or isotope , of beryllium in ice cores from Greenland .
The isotope is created by cosmic rays - high - energy particles from the depths of the galaxy .
The flux of cosmic rays reaching the Earth 's surface is modulated by the strength of the solar wind , the charged particles that stream away from the Sun 's surface .
And since the strength of the solar wind varies over the sunspot cycle , the amount of beryllium in the ice at a time in the past can therefore be used to infer the state of the Sun and , roughly , the number of sunspots .
Latest warming
Dr Solanki is presenting a paper on the reconstruction of past solar activity at Cool Stars , Stellar Systems And The Sun , a conference in Hamburg , Germany .
He says that the reconstruction shows the Maunder Minimum and the other minima that are known in the past thousand years .
But the most striking feature , he says , is that looking at the past 1,150 years the Sun has never been as active as it has been during the past 60 years .
Over the past few hundred years , there has been a steady increase in the numbers of sunspots , a trend that has accelerated in the past century , just at the time when the Earth has been getting warmer .
The data suggests that changing solar activity is influencing in some way the global climate causing the world to get warmer .
Over the past 20 years , however , the number of sunspots has remained roughly constant , yet the average temperature of the Earth has continued to increase .
This is put down to a human - produced greenhouse effect caused by the combustion of fossil fuels .
This latest analysis shows that the Sun has had a considerable indirect influence on the global climate in the past , causing the Earth to warm or chill , and that mankind is amplifying the Sun 's latest attempt to warm the Earth .
British singer Dido is one of the artists affected
The final approval to the settlement for lawsuits against the music giant was granted by a US judge on Monday .
Sony BMG was accused of using copy protection program on CDs that left computers vulnerable to hackers .
The episode caused much embarrassment for the world 's second largest music label .
Hidden files
The dispute began in November 2005 after software developer Mark Russinovich found that anti-piracy software XCP used by Sony employed virus - like techniques to hide itself on PCs .
This cloaked technology , he said , could be exploited by hackers .
Following the reports , several lawsuits were taken against the record label .
At the same time , other consumers took action over Sony CDs that were being protected with another anti-piracy technology known as MediaMax .
According to the settlement , consumers who bought a CD with the XCP software can receive a replacement disc .
They will also receive either a cash payment of $ 7.50 and one free album download , or three free album downloads .
Those with discs with MediaMax will only get free downloads .
Lawyers said as many as 20 million CDs containing MediaMax were sold .
The software had been loaded onto 27 titles .
Discs containing XCP were recalled in November and the record label also provided a method to remove of hidden files .
Fifty - two Sony BMG titles contained the technology .
CDs by artists such as The Coral , Alicia Keys , Dido , the Foo Fighters and the Backstreet Boys were amongst the affected discs .
Under the terms of the settlement deal , the record label must also stop using the CD software .
US District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald gave the final approval at a hearing on Monday .
The deal was tentatively approved in January .
In a statement , Sony BMG , said it was pleased with the settlement .
PROTECTED for centuries by the sea from the depredation of Europe 's various despots , the English are , unsurprisingly , rather fond of their little channel .
History has taught them to see it as something benign , like a faithful dog — unlike the Dutch , for instance , who have been encouraged by experience to look out to sea with trepidation .
Where defences are built to keep seawaters out of homes and offices , flood planners prepare for just a little unruliness .
They build the walls high enough to withstand the biggest flood expected every 200 years ( or 100 years for walls along flood - prone rivers ) but no higher .
The Dutch build their dykes to withstand the worst storm that nature is likely to throw at them for 10,000 years .
Yet three fresh reports suggest that Britain would do well to start thinking like its neighbours .
In the first , the Environment Agency gave warning that the risk of flooding in London is increasing as sea levels rise .
It reckons that at least £ 4 billion will have to be spent strengthening the Thames Barrier protecting the capital .
Separately , Sir David King , the government 's chief scientist , said floods are the biggest immediate threat to Britain from global warming .
More worrying , though , are the conclusions of a study of flood defences by the National Audit Office , a spending watchdog .
It reckons that only half of such systems are in “ good ” or “ very good ” condition , despite the fact that last year some £ 176 m was spent maintaining them and £ 162 m on building new ones .
The Environment Agency says it needs an extra £ 150 m a year to keep them all in serviceable shape .
That may be money well spent .
The government estimates that £ 1 spent on protection saves at least £ 6 in damage from flooding .
Insurers , meanwhile , are buying their own protection .
In April Allianz issued a $ 150 m ( £ 75 m ) bond that lets it pass on the risk of , among other catastrophes , the flooding of London .
Despite an enormous launch campaign , the Macintosh was a failure .
Steve Jobs had predicted that Apple sell 500,000 Macs the first year , but by 1985.03.11 the company had sold only 10 % of Jobs ’ original prediction .
What ’s worse , Jobs was misbehaving .
After Apple ’s 1984 reorganization , the Macintosh and Lisa teams were merged into a division called SuperMicro .
Inexplicably , Jobs was given control .
He probably made matters much worse during the first meeting of the new division by announcing that the Lisa team “ really fucked up ” .
Jobs had instantly alienated some of the most talented engineers in the company and had stunned members of his own team .
John Sculley , who had been CEO for only a year , was n’t ready to castigate Apple ’s chairman and largest shareholder , so Jobs was allowed to continue .
Beyond the Mac
Jobs ’ top priority was to create the successor to the Macintosh and to create a network for existing Macintoshes .
The Age of the Workstation was beginning , and companies like Sun were experiencing explosive growth .
The next generation of workstations were dubbed “ 3 M ” because they had a Megabyte of RAM , Megapixel displays , and Megaflop performance .
The replacement for the Macintosh 128K and 512K was dubbed BigMac ; it would be a 3 M workstation in disguise , but it would n’t cost any more than an average personal computer .
The most interesting part of BigMac was the software it would run : Unix with a Macintosh virtual machine .
Jobs had Apple acquire a very expensive Unix license from UniSoft , but very little progress being made .
The other program that Jobs was spearheading was Macintosh Office , a very ambitious networking system for the Macintosh .
The system was inspired by the visits that Jobs and the Lisa team had made to Xerox PARC in 1981 , where they saw the ethernet network that linked the Altos into a proto - intranet with email , shared printers , and file shares .
Macintosh
Office was going to include a file server , a printer , and a brand new networking protocol .
Ideally , BigMac would serve as the hub of the Macintosh Office , allowing third party developers to create custom servers for the network and Macintosh applications .
By late 1984 , work on the networking protocol and printer was complete , but the file server software and BigMac hardware would never be completed .
The Macintosh plants in Boulder , Colorado , had fallen silent as demand plummeted .
Even with the reduced production schedules , there were millions of dollars in unsold inventory around the world .
Standing Against Jobs
Sculley was not yet willing to counter Jobs ’ Macintosh strategy , but there were people willing to stand up against Jobs .
His own marketing manager , Mike Murray , who had backed Jobs on the 1984 ad , favored removing Jobs and placing him in control of research and development , where he would be able to work on projects with little bearing on Apple ’s short term financial performance .
The board of directors , which had made it clear to Sculley that his primary task was to contain Jobs , decided to act , and on 1985.04.11 , Arthur Rock , an early Apple investor , told Sculley that if he did not restrain Jobs , he and Jobs would both be fired .
Sculley reacted by removing Jobs as the head of the Lisa and Macintosh group , replacing him with Jean - Louis Gassée , a colorful Macintosh marketer from France .
Nothing could be more galling than seeing Gassée seize control of the Macintosh , the group that Jobs had devoted years to – especially since Gassée was the antithesis of Jobs ’ understated cool .
Jobs would wear tailored Italian suits ; Gassée would strut around the executive suite in leather jacket and pants .
Jobs had quoted Bob Dylan in the unveiling of the Macintosh ; Gassée made dirty jokes with the secretaries .
A Failed Coup
Jobs began plotting a major reorganization / coup that would split Apple into four different divisions .
Sculley would be in control of the retail division , where he could capitalize on his expertise in brand management from his Pepsi days , but Jobs would be chairman .
Days after the Gassée promotion , Sculley left for China , and Jobs acted on his plan .
Jobs shared the plan with all the major executives in the Lisa and Macintosh groups , including Gassée , hoping that he would be able to rally support behind his cause .
Gassée felt no loyalty towards Jobs and reported the plot to trusted Sculley ally and corporate lawyer , Al Eisenstat .
Eisenstat , in turn , made a trans -Pacific telephone call to alert Sculley to Jobs ’ machinations .
Sculley was enraged and returned to Cupertino , snubbing the president of China over a palace coup .
During an emergency meeting of all the company ’s important executives , Sculley harangued Jobs for three hours .
Sculley wanted Jobs out of Apple altogether .
He took a tally of how many of the executives supported Jobs and how many supported Sculley .
The vote was unanimous in Sculley ’s favor .
The next morning , Jobs drove to Sculley ’s house with his reality distortion field running at full kilter and took Sculley on a long walk in the mountains , just as he had in 1983 when he was courting Sculley to move to Apple .
Jobs convinced Sculley that he was only acting in the best interests of Apple .
Personal ambition had nothing to do with his plans .
Amazingly , Sculley was under the impression that Jobs was telling the truth , though he insisted that Jobs would not return to any real position of power at Apple .
Instead , he would function as a corporate mouthpiece , granting interviews and heading a think tank or research group .
That afternoon Jobs had all of his allies at Apple at his expansive Spanish manse and was discussing strategies for Jobs being reinstalled as head of the SuperMicro group .
Towards the end of the afternoon , Mike Markkula showed up , and Jobs ’ lieutenants presented their plans .
Markkula was not swayed and immediately phoned Sculley to tell him what was going on .
On 1985.05.28 , Sculley ’s patience ran out .
With the support of the board , he stripped Jobs of all his power at Apple .
Jobs could stay with Apple , but he would have no sway over operations .
Jobs was heartbroken .
Murray was worried for Jobs ’ safety , and after no one picked up the phone at Jobs ’ manse , he drove over to make sure Jobs was okay .
Murray found Jobs lying on a mattress in his unfurnished bedroom , sobbing .
Jobs showed up for work the next morning , but his new role was extremely distasteful to him .
Before this , he met with dozens of people every day , giving advice , approving budgets , approving designs , and reading dozens of memos about Apple ’s internal affairs .
Now nobody sought out his advice , and the memos stopped coming .
Eager to take his mind off his embarrassing demotion , Jobs began a tour of Europe promoting the pending Macintosh Office .
After that , he would promote the Apple II in Russia ( the US government had only recently approved exports of the Apple II to the USSR , though Mikhail Gorbachev was rumored to be a Macintosh user ) .
Jobs stayed in Europe for most of the summer and was determined to not let Sculley put an end to his career .
NASA had recently started accepting applications for civilian astronauts to fly on Challenger three years later .
Jobs was rebuffed .
The government was not going to put a celebrity in space .
His next plan was to leave Apple altogether .
He wanted to create hardware exclusively for students – an interesting choice for a man who had n’t completed a single year of college .
He was not just interested in the educational market ; he wanted to prove that he did n’t need Apple or any adult supervision to succeed .
When he returned to Apple , his resolve was steeled .
His office had been moved into a building on Bandley Drive that was completely empty , except for his secretary .
He dubbed the building “ Siberia ” and stopped showing up for work .
Jobs ’ Departure
On 1985.09.12 , Jobs was n’t completely sure what he wanted to do with the rest of his life .
He vaguely wanted to stay in computer hardware , and he wanted to market that new hardware to college students , as Apple had done with the Macintosh .
There was one thing he did know for certain , and it was that he could n’t build his computer at Apple .
He had tried with the BigMac and was thwarted by the exhausted and depleted engineering staff , and when he tried to seize control and divert resources and talent to his division , he was rebuffed .
During the board meeting called that day , Jobs revealed his plans to found a new company to the shocked body .
The ineffective manager they held responsible for the slow sales of the Macintosh and internal strife at Apple suddenly turned into a threat to Apple ’s survival .
Longtime investors , including Arthur Rock and Mike Markkula , were terrified by the terrible publicity that Jobs would cause if he left Apple for a startup – and of the effects that negative publicity might have on Apple ’s stock price .
John Sculley was the only one not offended by Jobs .
He resented the power that Jobs still held over the company ( even after his reorganization that removed Jobs from any meaningful position ) .
Perhaps Apple could make a major investment in Jobs ’ new company and maybe even market its products under Apple ’s brand .
Jobs agreed to think about accepting an investment from Apple and left the headquarters for good – he would n’t return for more than a decade .
Over the previous six months , Jobs had kept in contact with some of the senior staff in the Macintosh division , even after Gassée took control .
Five of these staffers agreed to become cofounders of the new company with Jobs .
Chief among these were Bud Tribble , Susan Barnes , and Dan’l Lewin .
Tribble , a senior staffer at the Macintosh division , was the Mac ’s first software manager and the man responsible for the Mac ’s shift from the 6809E processor to the 68000 .
Susan Barnes was the executive in control of the Mac ’s finances and budgeting .
The most influential staffer that Jobs took with him was Dan’l Lewin , who ran the Apple University Consortium , the sales team that won Macs a significant presence in the university market .
NeXT
The five cofounders left Apple early on Friday , September 13 , 1985 ( after Jobs gave Sculley a list of the staffers who would leave with him and his own resignation letter , which he had already released it to the media ) and joined Jobs at his manse for a dinner of fresh pasta .
The cofounders all found the experience eerie .
The palatial house was almost entirely unfurnished , sprinkled with a few hyper - expensive leather sofas and a Bang & Olufsen stereo .
Over dinner they discussed whether or not to accept an investment from Apple , which markets they would target , the name of the company ( they decided on NeXT Computer , Inc. ) , and whether or not Apple would sue the group .
Jobs had a high power Palo Alto lawyer , Larry Sonsini , make a presentation on that subject .
This was a very real threat .
Jobs was the only one who had officially resigned from Apple ; the rest were still employees .
Beyond that , they were all very senior staffers , privy to confidential plans and projects .
They all decided that they would have to resign and did so on the next business day , Monday , September 16 .
Word of the resignations quickly got back to Apple and incensed the coterie of executives who reported to Sculley – but not Sculley himself .
A senior staff meeting , which had been planned to discuss the board meeting , was chaos .
Bill Campbell and Jean - Louis Gassée wanted to know whether the resignations would stop or whether NeXT would continue to leach staffers from Apple .
Sculley still did n’t perceive much of a threat from NeXT , probably because he was not familiar with the SuperMicro division , but he was overridden by the other executives .
They unanimously wanted to sue NeXT for copyright infringement .
Another meeting was held the next day to start planning for a lawsuit against Jobs and NeXT .
Despite the fact that Apple saw NeXT as a dire threat to its business , Jobs and the rest of the cofounders had little idea exactly what their company would produce .
Perhaps a result of his own abortive college career , Jobs was fiercely interested in creating hardware for universities and colleges .
In fact , one of the few groups at Apple having a great deal of success selling the Mac was the Apple University Consortium .
In his role as chairman , Jobs was regularly invited to symposiums and expos for education buyers to promote the Consortium .
Jobs said he was most inspired by a conversation he had with Paul Berg in 1984 .
The two had met a Stanford hosted lunch held for the visiting François Mitterrand .
Awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his DNA research , Berg explained his goals for personal computers in the classroom .
Berg wanted to make recombinant DNA experiments accessible to freshmen while making cutting edge research less expensive by eliminating wet labs , where DNA was physically extracted from cells and manipulated with virii .
He told Jobs that such an advance would accelerate research many times over and help students everywhere ( even those in high school ) understand DNA .
Jobs managed to convince Berg to meet him again at a café near the campus to elaborate on his needs for a computer .
Berg believed that a 3 M workstation would be powerful enough to host such complicated simulations – but they would also be too expensive .
3 M workstations from companies like Sun , IBM , and Apollo cost well over $ 25,000 , and it seemed unlikely they would become affordable anytime soon , at least not to use for lower - level biology classes .
Jobs , in a heated monologue , declared that he would create a workstation as easy to use as a Macintosh , as powerful as a 3 M , and at a cost no more than $ 500 .
Essentially , Jobs had promised Berg a NeXT - developed BigMac .
Lawsuit
NeXT still did n’t have a business plan or concrete plans for its first product .
This would prove fortuitous for NeXT , because on November 4th , Apple filed suit .
Apple ’s case was based on NeXT ’s raiding of senior Macintosh executives and conspiring to use the confidential knowledge Jobs and the others had about upcoming Apple projects ( like BigMac ) .
Fortunately for NeXT , Apple ’s hubris was on display .
Apple failed to list any specific trade secrets that NeXT had violated , which violated a new law in California .
A week later , Apple came back with a list of twenty complaints but failed to demonstrate how NeXT had any “ nefarious ” ( a term that was used extensively throughout Apple ’s documents ) plans against Apple .
The case proved to be a major embarrassment for Apple .
All it did was get NeXT ’s name in the news and show that Apple was deathly afraid of whatever products the company might produce .
Sculley was still trying to turn Apple around and get the Macintosh into businesses and homes .
The lawsuit served as an embarrassing distraction from a resurgent Apple .
Sculley directed Apple ’s legal team to settle with NeXT .
In order to save face , Apple made NeXT agree to two conditions .
First , NeXT would not release any products that competed with an Apple product released before 1985 .
Second , NeXT would have to show Apple all of its products before they were announced to the press so Apple would have the opportunity to file suit before the products got to consumers .
Building NeXT
Despite the lawsuit , Jobs began laying the groundwork for the perfect company .
NeXT would be built to keep Jobs in control and improve his public image .
This process began with a new logo , name , and office for NeXT .
Jobs had always had an eye for good design .
He was especially taken with the logos of ABC , IBM , UPS , and Westinghouse , all of which were created by Yale professor Paul Rand .
Rand offered to create NeXT ’s logo for $ 100,000 , but only if IBM consented .
This was an outrageous price , many times more than what Rand had charged IBM for its now - iconic logo .
Two months later , Rand sent Jobs a copy of the logo and a brochure explaining every detail .
For the sake of a more interesting design , Rand even renamed the company NeXT , saying the ‘ e ’ stood for education .
The new logo ( and the name behind it ) lent prestige and clout to a company without customers or a product .
The office space did n’t fit the profile of a startup without any outside investors .
Instead of cheap office space ( a la Texaco Towers ) , Jobs chose some of the most expensive space in Silicon Valley .
Named Deer Park ( for the street it was on ) , the office space was outfitted with hardwood flooring and was decked out with lavish leather couches and Ansel Adams prints .
Jobs eventually hired a full - time interior decorator for NeXT .
The engineers and executives would all have desks on the second level .
The first floor of the office was dedicated to manufacturing .
Instead of building a large factory , payroll , and stockpiles of parts , NeXT would buy preassembled components from outside companies , adopting the Japanese strategy of just in time manufacturing .
The only manufacturing NeXT would do was assemble the finished components into computers , then ship them to resellers .
This made NeXT very flexible .
It could change the number of computers it built very easily , making NeXT immune to shortages and surpluses that affected other companies ( like Apple and the Lisa ) .
Communication was fostered by the layout of the offices .
There were no closed office ; everyone ( even executives ) worked at desks in a common area rimmed with conference rooms .
Jobs led weekly “ communication meetings ” in the middle of the common area , where he briefed all employees on all facets of the company .
Employees were even allowed to look at the company ’s payroll to compare salaries ( very few did ) .
Looking for a Product
For all the enlightened corporate policies , NeXT did n’t have a product .
Jobs wanted NeXT to be in the higher education market , but he did n’t know just who he wanted to sell to .
Would he create a personal workstation , inexpensive enough for individual students to buy , or a workstation for Paul Berg ’s wet lab simulations that only the most well off universities could afford ?
For the rest of 1985 and the first half of 1986 , NeXT executives canvassed conventions like EduCom and talked to higher education buyers to find out what they wanted from a workstation .
The largest workstation vendor , Apollo , sold workstations that ran a proprietary operating system , Domain / OS , that was remarkably stable but very difficult to develop for .
Also , there was no intuitive GUI for Domain / OS , meaning that undergraduates would almost never use the system .
It would simply take too much time to train them .
Unlike Apollo or the upstart , Sun , which sent product managers and engineers to these conventions , NeXT sent Susan Barnes , its CFO , and the rest of the cofounders .
Most buyers wanted a workstation that ran a variant of Unix , was easy to develop for , and was cheap enough to give to students to use as personal computers .
Such a system would cost around $ 1,000 and could be configured up if needed .
The projected price point had already been bumped up with the addition of new features .
Development
Development began tentatively in January 1986 .
One of the earliest decisions was to have NeXTstep ( the name Jobs had chosen for NeXT ’s operating system ) run on a microkernel .
This meant that the operating system would be split into several different “ servers ” that ran independently of each other .
This had a couple advantages .
First , if one server crashed , it could be restarted without restarting the entire operating system .
Second , it meant that very little software dealt directly with the hardware , making the operating system very easy to move to different platforms .
Another major element of NeXTstep would be ease of development .
Academic developers frequently wanted to recycle parts of programs .
If there was a graphing utility in a spreadsheet , then it did n’t make sense to create a graphing utility for data gathering software .
NeXTstep would be completely object oriented .
This meant that developers could reuse scraps of other programs very easily .
Instead of writing a brand - new graphing utility , a programmer just had to make references to the existing software .
This made for a much faster development process and more satisfying programs .
The hardware design for the NeXT computer was not particularly sophisticated , though it suffered from one major flaw .
It used a standard processor from Motorola ( the same line used in the Macintosh ) and even featured two Apple Desktop Bus ( ADB ) connectors for the keyboard and mouse .
The one unique feature was the inclusion of a DSP ( Digital Signal Processor ) .
DSP ’s accelerated sound processing .
DSP ’s were only featured in the highest end workstations and the computers that ran AT&T ’s telephone network .
Instead of a hard drive to store users ’ data , the NeXT computer used a magneto - optical disk drive , which was actually cheaper by the megabyte than hard drives .
Data was stored on fat cartridges that kind of looked like DATs .
The media was much less expensive than a hard drive , but it was very slow .
Worse , the magneto - optical drive was the only removable media on the computer .
This meant that a user could n’t transfer files using a disk ; everything would have to go through the network .
Just as with the Macintosh , Jobs devoted most of his attention to the user interface and physical design of the case , probably because he was n’t a trained engineer .
Jobs designed the Macintosh as a personal information appliance .
The NeXT computer was an institutional information appliance .
Instead of looking for a disarmingly cute design , Jobs wanted a computer that conveyed strength and power .
He hired several different design houses to create prototypes .
The first company was based in London .
It had gained notoriety for a design for a flashlight that had won an award .
After a 16 hour flight and almost an hour of explanation , the company unveiled its design : a human head .
Jobs was disgusted .
He ended up hiring frogdesign , a company started by the designer of the Snow White design language Apple would use in some form for almost a decade , Hartmut Esslinger .
The design that Esslinger had envisioned was unique .
Unlike most other workstations , which were housed in boxy towers designed for ease of expansion and assembly rather than aesthetics , the NeXT computer was housed in a magnesium cube .
The design was eye grabbing and effective .
It allowed for a much smaller fan to cool the computer than a similarly outfitted tower , though it did take up more space on a desktop .
When frogdesign revealed the cube to Jobs , he immediately made the case the computer ’s namesake : The NeXT computer was to be called the NeXTcube .
frogdesign also created a sophisticated monitor stand that tilted and raised the display with ease .
The stand was so sophisticated that NeXT sought a patent for its design ( which is very similar to the iMac G5 stand ) .
Unfortunately for NeXT , it became clear that the NeXTcube would feature too many custom components to implement the “ just in time ” plan Jobs had envisioned .
NeXT moved some engineers to the first floor of the Deer Park office , and NeXT acquired a large warehouse in the working - class neighborhood of Fremont , near San Francisco Bay .
Jobs was obsessed with the user interface of NeXTstep .
As a result , he spent most of his time hovering over the UI team .
NeXT ’s chief graphics designer , Susan Kare ( who also created the icons and publications for the Macintosh ) , created the color scheme and widgets for the interface .
Since the NeXTcube had a grayscale display and Display Postscript , Kare was able to create objects with depth while the rest of the world was still working with monochrome displays .
Some unique elements of the interface included the Dock ( a combination application launcher , desktop , and task manager ) , draggable windows , and WYSIWYG editing .
The printer and the display both used Postscript , so their output were consistent with each other .
Ross Perot
NeXT was burning through money .
By late 1986 , though NeXT was still far from shipping the Cube , it had used most of the initial $ 7 million investment Jobs had made .
Jobs could invest more of his own money , but that would look bad to potential customers .
Jobs and his CFO , Susan Barnes , started making the rounds of venture capital firms , but nobody was interested .
Jobs was offering a 10 % stake in the company for $ 3 million .
That meant NeXT was worth $ 30 million , an outlandish figure considering that NeXT had no customers and no products – and would n’t for at least a few more years .
In 1987 , after Jobs had nearly given up on finding an outside investor , NeXT had received an unexpected call from Ross Perot .
Perot had founded IT giant , EDS , and had recently sold his company to GM .
Perot had seen the series The Innovators on PBS , which had featured a segment on NeXT .
Jobs , Perot , and several executives met at the Fremont factory , which was still empty ( supposedly because Jobs was unable to decide on a color scheme ) and discussed Jobs ’ vision for NeXT .
Jobs charmed
Perot into making the investment , except instead of a 10 % stake for $ 3 million ; Perot paid $ 20 million for 16 % , valuing NeXT at $ 125 million .
After Perot signed the contract in the Fremont factory , he went to Deer Park and met the entire staff ( more than a hundred people ) .
One week later , Perot returned and greeted everyone by first name .
This was radically different from Jobs , who lavished attention on the best and brightest at NeXT but rarely acknowledged the newer , less experienced staffers .
The gap in thinking between Jobs and Perot was huge , but Perot was too infatuated with Jobs to realize it .
Personal Life
As NeXT readied the NeXTcube for introduction , Jobs ’ personal life was in flux .
Jobs , who had been adopted , recently discovered his full sister , Mona Simpson , a famed novelist and writer .
Simpson and Jobs became very close .
Simpson ’s first novel , Anywhere but Here , was based on her experiences with an absentee father .
The novel was a critical success , and Simpson became a celebrity in the literary world .
Unbeknownst to Jobs , Simpson began work on a second novel , A Regular Guy , which was based on Jobs and the development of the Macintosh .
The novel revealed details about Jobs ’ sex life and his first daughter that had not been known by the public .
Simpson did change the names in her novel ( Jobs was Tom Owens , Apple was Genesis , and Lisa was Jane ) , but the novel still hurt their relationship .
Jobs ’ romantic life was tortured during the early years at NeXT .
Since he still had his luxurious condo in near Central Park in Manhattan , Jobs went to several parties every year thrown by his tenants .
At one of these parties , Jobs met Tina Redse , a graphics designer from California .
Jobs was enchanted by her good looks .
Redse and Jobs began an unsteady relationship .
She moved in with Jobs for a while but left after a few months .
The two stayed close for years to come .
In 1987 , Jobs was invited to a party thrown by Washington Post publisher , Katherine Graham , in Georgetown .
Famously , Jobs convinced King Juan Carlos of Spain into buying a personal computer .
Later that night , Jobs met John Akers , the CEO of IBM .
Though the two men were fierce competitors ( or at least would be once NeXT released the NeXTcube , which competed with the first RISC workstation in the world , the IBM RT / PC ) , Jobs was charming and kind .
During their conversation , Jobs made references to the sophisticated NeXTstep .
Jobs did n’t think about the meeting again , but Akers pressed his executives to investigate NeXT and NeXTstep .
Prerelease
In 1985 , NeXT executives had told university buyers that the NeXTcube would be released by 1987 , but 1987 came and went .
The slipping release date was partly due to the new features that were added during development and partly due to NeXT ’s ( Steve Jobs ’ ) perfectionist attitude .
Jobs spent months agonizing over NeXT ’s patented monitor stand and even had the factory repainted when he did n’t like the shade of gray paint used .
Despite the delays , Jobs pushed ahead , refusing to pare back the NeXTcube ’s specs .
By 1988 , there were 200 NeXT employees housed in two adjacent buildings .
The growing campus was just as lavishly decorated as the original offices were .
Jobs even commissioned a freestanding glass staircase to connect the first and second floor of the original Deer Park offices .
Ultimately , a prerelease version of the NeXTcube was made available to educators and students running beta NeXTstep in 1989 at US $ 6,500 .
This was well above the proposed $ 500 price point of 1985 , making it too expensive for students to buy a NeXTcube to use as a personal computer .
The base price included a NeXTcube , monitor , mouse , keyboard , and MO ( magneto - optical ) disk containing the operating system and a few add - on programs .
The software was all incredibly intuitive , but universities were willing to deal with the arcane UI ’s of cheaper and faster workstations .
Instead of quietly releasing the prerelease NeXTcube to select customers , NeXT threw a lavish party to celebrate the event .
The company rented the Davies Symphony Hall , supposedly because of its good acoustics , to show off the DSPs that allowed the Cube to play full stereo sound .
Jobs personally promised exclusive , behind the scenes access to the event to three publications .
The editors found out about the other exclusives but put NeXT on the front page anyways .
The actual presentation was as meticulously planned as any Stevenote at Apple .
Unlike any other Apple CEO , Jobs wrote his presentations himself , slaving over every slide and demo .
The preparation showed , and the debut was a success .
The audience was wowed by the machine ’s multimedia abilities .
It played a duet with a violinist from the San Francisco Symphony , navigated electronic versions of Shakespeare ’s plays , sent and received emails with embedded images and sounds , and showed off truly impressive graphics .
Release
Months after the debut at Davies Symphony Hall , NeXT released the final version of the NeXTcube , which retailed for US $ 10,000 .
Jobs and the senior executives made another grand tour looking for customers and developers .
Most of the companies ( like Disney and AT&T ) remained solidly Macintosh , but Jobs charmed a couple big customers .
NSA became a loyal NeXTstep user ; so did Lotus ( which agreed to develop an “ object oriented spreadsheet ” , Lotus for NeXTstep ) and GM .
Stanford and Carnegie Mellon both made small orders of NeXTcubes as well .
The outside world did n’t know about NeXT ’s poor sales , since it was a privately held company .
As a result , NeXT had a grossly disproportionate mindshare compared to its much larger competitor , Sun Microsystems .
Even before the NeXTcube was released , retailers wanted to become official NeXT dealers , but Jobs was n’t interested .
He believed that the higher education market would be more than enough for NeXT .
When sales failed to materialize , NeXT made Businessland , a large office supply chain , a NeXT dealer .
NeXTcubes would be offered in a few locations , and the NeXTcube ’s successor would be featured nationwide .
More important than the displays in the stores was Businessland ’s expanding sales team .
Businessland ’s sales team was already several times larger than NeXT ’s , so it had valuable relationships with businesses .
Even if an executive was not wowed by the NeXTcube ’s pedigree or feature list , his or her relationship with the salesman might be enough for a sale .
Interestingly , NeXT replaced Compaq at Businessland , whose computers accounted for $ 150 million in sales .
David Norman , a cofounder of Businessland , proclaimed that NeXT ’s sales would top Compaq ’s within a year .
Investors
The factory that Jobs had configured to produce 10,000 computers every month produced hundreds every month .
Because of the low volume , human labor was cheaper than maintaining the automated equipment .
The business world did n’t know about NeXT ’s disastrous sales , since NeXT was a private company .
NeXT would go bankrupt if Jobs was unable to increase sales or find another investor .
In order to appease Perot , Jobs sacrificed Lewin .
The man , who had done so much to get NeXT considered in higher education , was out .
Jobs had invited universities to invest in NeXT .
Carnegie Mellon and Stanford agreed and together invested $ 20 million .
This would allow NeXT to operate for at least one more year .
NeXT ’s true savior was Canon , the manufacturer of the Jobs - inspired Apple LaserWriter and the Hewlett Packard LaserJet .
Jobs convinced Canon to invest $ 100 million in NeXT , a tremendous sum for a company with basically no sales and few prospects on the horizon .
The truly shocking part was that Canon would only get 16.7 % of the company , which meant that NeXT was now worth $ 560 million .
After the investment , Canon suspiciously canned Jef Raskin‘s Cat project , which was essentially a hyper -Macintosh Macintosh .
At the end of 1989 , Jobs received excellent news .
NeXT ’s sales were still terrible , but IBM was now interested in licensing NeXTstep to use with its new line of personal computers – and perhaps even replace OS / 2 .
His contact with Akers had finally paid off .
After about a month of negotiations and demonstrations , IBM agreed to pay $ 65 million to license NeXTstep indefinitely .
When William Lowe ( the first manager of the IBM PC group ) showed Jobs a hundred page contract , Jobs threw it away .
If IBM wanted to do business with NeXT , it would have to have a contract with fewer than five pages .
Surprisingly , IBM complied .
NeXT was now flush with cash and ready to develop the successor to the NeXTcube .
Romance
After the well received NeXTcube launch , Jobs delivered a talk on entrepreneurialism to Stanford University .
Jobs lost his train of thought halfway through the talk and was n’t able to recover .
Jobs is renowned for his speaking abilities ; he is usually poised and charming .
He was fixated on a woman sitting in the front row , Laurene Powell , a Stanford Business School student .
After the speech , Jobs got ready to leave for a business meeting .
In a later interview , he said , “ I was in the parking lot with the key in the car , and I though to myself , ‘ If this is my last night on earth , would I rather spend it at a business meeting or with this woman ? ’
I ran across the parking lot [ and ] asked her if she ’d have dinner with me . ” ( iCon 182 )
In the weeks following , Jobs regaled his colleagues at NeXT about Powell .
She was beautiful , vegetarian , smart , and had a good résumé to boot .
Powell had worked at Goldman Sachs before she entered Stanford Business School , where she told her roommate that she wanted to marry “ a Silicon Valley millionaire like Steve Jobs ” – Powell had decided on Jobs even before he set eyes on her .
The two started seeing each other regularly , creating a spectacle at both NeXT and Stanford .
When Powell stayed overnight at the Jackling House , she would drive to classes in Jobs ’ BMW with “ NEXT ” vanity plates .
Jobs began eating lunch on campus at the Tressidor café .
After classes ended at Stanford , Powell moved in with Jobs .
NeXTstation
Jobs was willing to compromise if it meant surviving .
The new workstation from NeXT , the NeXTstation , addressed the Cube ’s major shortcomings .
It now had a floppy drive ( allowing for file transfers without a hard drive or over ethernet ) and a hard drive .
Motorola ’s newest processor , the 25 MHz 68040 , was included .
The processor would not be used in a Macintosh for more than a year .
The computer was housed in a pizza box style enclosure , eschewing the Cube .
The major differences between the NeXTstation and the NeXTcube were color and distribution .
Unlike the NeXTcube , the NeXTstation supported color , though a color display was an expensive option .
This made the machine much more attractive as a multimedia workstation .
The NeXTcube was offered in a few college bookstores – and at less than a dozen Businessland locations .
The NeXTstation was available in every Businessland in the country .
On top of that , the NeXT sales staff was complemented by thousands of Businessland salespeople who were eager to earn commissions on the expensive workstation .
The color version of the NeXTstation cost $ 7,995 ( $ 975 less than the top of the line Macintosh IIfx , released the same year ) , and the monochrome version cost $ 4,995 .
There was a typically Jobsian introduction for the NeXTstation .
During a highly choreographed September 1991 press conference , Jobs ’ staff had licensed the scene from Wizard of Oz where the black and white world of Kansas transforms into the colorful Oz .
The scene played , and it stunned the audience .
Nobody had ever seen full color , high resolution video on what was basically a high - end personal computer .
The demonstration was something of a fraud , however , since the video did n’t actually play on the computer .
NeXT engineers had connected the machine to a LaserDisc player and simply used the NeXTstation as a display .
Even with a reduced price , enlarged distribution , and color graphics , the NeXTstation was a flop .
NeXT managed to sell a few hundred every month through ComputerLand and had a couple big orders from the NSA and CERN , but not nearly enough to turn a profit .
NeXT had already burned through most of the investors ’ money , almost $ 247 million .
Marriage
As NeXT was burning through other people ’s cash , Jobs ’ personal life was in flux .
In 1991 , Powell found out that she was pregnant .
Aside from Chris - Ann , a girlfriend Jobs had when he started Apple ( who gave birth to Lisa , Jobs ’ first daughter ) , Jobs had not been in any serious , long term relationship .
After much hand wringing , he agreed to marry Powell , though he would not be a slave to tradition .
Instead of holding an opulent ceremony to appease the press , Jobs arranged to be wed at Yosemite National Park ( a four hour drive from his Woodside home ) by longtime friend and Buddhist monk , Chino Kobin .
The guests were taken from the Jackling House to Yosemite on a large rented party bus .
Jobs had hired a Stanford professor to play guitar through the ceremony .
In between guitar playing , gongs were hit and incense burned .
After a brief ceremony , the two were married , and the party went on a wedding walk , not unlike the walks Jobs took with Sculley around Palo Alto and New York City .
Six months later , Laurene gave birth to Job ’s first son , Reed Paul Jobs , named after Jobs alma mater ( though Jobs had dropped out after his freshman year ) .
Jobs abandoned the Jackling House ( which fell into disrepair ) and moved to a large home in old Palo Alto , near Andy Hertzfeld .
Saving NeXT
Jobs poured himself into the failing NeXT .
He started going on more sales calls than ever before .
This led to a few farcical and tragic incidents , but it did n’t result in a huge , NeXT - saving order .
From his years at Apple , Jobs had become a member of the American elite .
He had an apartment occupying the top two floors of the San Remo , a twin towered building adjacent to Central Park .
Other tenants included Rita Hayworth , Steven Spielberg , and Steve Martin .
He rubbed elbow with the business elite from coast to coast .
When Jobs and a NeXT sales rep were in Detroit , Jobs stopped at Cadillac Place , the headquarters of General Motors , and asked to speak to Roger Smith , like Michael Moore had in his documentary , Roger & Me .
The sales rep was shocked at the response – Jobs was ushered to the top floor , where Smith ’s office was guarded by uniformed security and dogs .
Smith came out and warmly greeted Jobs .
Pixar
Jobs tried to capitalize on his celebrity during a sales call with Disney , too .
In 1991 , Pixar and Disney were in the midst of discussions over a possible animated film .
Jobs decided to pitch NeXTcubes and NeXTstations to Jeffrey Katzenberg , the head of Disney ’s motion picture division .
Jobs launched into an unscripted speech on the merits of the two computers .
Jobs passion got the better of him , and his speech veered into the possibilities of NeXTstep to foster an animation revolution , making it possible for everyone in America to produce their own animated films , without the help of studios like Disney ( or Pixar ) .
Katzenberg said he might be interested in the monochrome NeXTcube , but in a cold voice he said , “ I own animation , and nobody ’s going to get it .
It ’s as if someone comes to date my daughter .
I have a shotgun .
If someone tries to take this away , I ’ll blow his balls off . ”
( The Second Coming of Steve Jobs , 150 )
Jobs was momentarily stunned by Katzenberg , but he resumed his presentation as if nothing had happened .
Unfortunately for NeXT , Disney did n’t make any significant order of NeXTcubes or NeXTstations .
However , in the spring of 1991 , Katzenberg agreed to produce a Pixar animated film .
Departures from NeXT
This was excellent news for Pixar , but NeXT was not so lucky .
Jobs fired Lewin for the failure of the NeXTcube , and another cofounder , CFO Susan Barnes , left over the slow sales of the NeXTstation .
Barnes , who was married to Bud Tribble , another cofounder , had concluded that NeXT was hopeless and took a position at Richard Blum and Associates in San Francisco .
When Barnes had given Jobs her month ’s notice , he had her email and voicemail cut off before she got back to her office .
Tribble followed suit .
The next day , he tried to enter the office but found his security card was no longer valid .
The same month , Businessland went belly up , ending NeXT ’s only retail distribution .
After the high level resignations and Businessland closings , Canon got worried about their $ 100 million .
NeXT was short of cash again , so Canon invested another $ 30 million to keep it going through 1991 .
Sales increased slightly , to almost 20,000 computers a year .
Another cofounder left in 1992 , Rich Page , and sales failed to get better .
Canon was forced to invest another $ 55 million in the company just to keep it solvent .
Saving NeXT
Morale at NeXT was terrible .
Jobs himself considered resigning and handing control over to Canon , but he refused to admit that he could n’t make another Macintosh .
Weeks after Page left , three VPs resigned .
During a staff meeting , Jobs tolled the remaining executives that “ Everyone here can leave – except me . ”
( The Second Coming of Steve Jobs , 177 )
Later in that meeting , it became clear that Theo Webgran ’s ( the head of NeXT ’s European operations ) sales staff was guilty of channel stuffing .
Channel stuffing means selling more machines to retailers than they would ever be able to sell .
NeXT was able to report the computers as sales , but retailers were stuck with unpopular , unsellable machines .
Jobs took radical steps to save NeXT – and his reputation .
He announced to employees that NeXT would go public sometime in 1992 or 1993 .
Morale skyrocketed , since most employees had stock options that could possibly become quite valuable .
News of the impending IPO got out , and pretty soon it was enjoying a wave of positive publicity .
The newly motivated employees pressed harder for sales , since financial results , including detailed sales reports , would be publicly available information if NeXT was publicly held .
The first ever NeXTworld Expo was held on 1992.01.22 .
Among the minor hardware upgrades , it was revealed that NeXT would start shipping NeXTstep 486 , a version of the operating system that would run on Intel hardware .
The newly liberated software only took a few months to port , but it would have a huge impact on NeXT – and eventually on Apple as well .
Also announced was NeXTstep 3.0 , which included better networking and file system compatibility with Windows and DOS .
Weeks later , Jobs dismissed Webgrans and most of the European staff .
The headquarters in the French Riviera , which Jobs had only authorized because of the sales from channel stuffing , was closed .
NeXT also cut off most of its dealers .
The new management in Europe was unable to account for millions of dollars of NeXT inventory , but Jobs would n’t press criminal charges , because the negative publicity would kill his hopes of brining NeXT public .
Even counting the suspect sales in Europe , NeXT had sold only 8,000 computers and motherboards in 1992 .
The most radical changes at NeXT had not yet come to pass .
Jobs had prided himself in building an egalitarian company creating tools for educators and students .
This strategy was untenable .
NeXT Software , Inc .
On 1993.02.08 , InfoWorld ran a story claiming that NeXT was abandoning its hardware business .
On Wednesday of the same week , Jobs confirmed the rumors : NeXT would become a software - only company , which meant new hardware partners and big layoffs .
NeXT ’s staff of 530 would be reduced to 200 .
Jobs always thought of himself as a hardware designer .
Though the public at large considered the Macintosh and NeXTcube groundbreaking software achievements , Jobs was much more involved in the hardware .
Jobs spent weeks obsessing over the positioning of the floppy drive on the Macintosh or the shade of black used on the magnesium case of the NeXTcube .
And now NeXT was essentially a startup software company with no product , no customers , and few prospects .
Without a factory , NeXT ’s office space was its biggest expense .
The company could no longer afford its Deer Park offices ( it could n’t afford them before , either ) .
All of the extra computers and office furniture were auctioned off in September as NeXT moved to far more humble rented office space .
Half a dozen national periodicals ran exposés on Job ’s erratic management style and the failure of NeXT .
Dejected , Jobs began spending less and less time in the office , preferring to stay home with Reed and Laurene .
As NeXT settled into its new space , it released its first new software , NeXT for Intel Processors ( renamed because it would also run on Pentium machines ) for $ 995 .
The major difference between NeXTstep for Intel and NeXTstep 3.0 was utilities that allowed dual booting with Windows and limited file sharing between the operating systems .
Profits
Sales from NeXTstep for Intel made NeXT “ consistently profitable ” , according to Jobs , making at least $ 1 million in 1994 on $ 49 million of revenue .
With the new money and success , NeXT began developing versions of NeXTstep to run on Windows and even the Internet .
Though the Windows software would never make it past developer releases , the Internet version of NeXTstep , WebObjects , was very successful and eventually supplanted NeXTstep as NeXT ’s biggest money maker .
WebObjects was an object oriented environment for the Internet .
It allowed developers to create intelligent websites that were able to update themselves for individual customers .
The software was most famously used by Dell as the basis of its online store , and it was also used by the BBC and Disney .
Sun Microsystems was beginning to feel the pinch from Windows NT .
Workstation performance was now possible on ordinary PCs running Windows NT .
Worse , the next generations of workstations with PowerPC or MIPS processors were all capable of running Windows NT .
Sun needed a competitive edge , and SunOS ( renamed Solaris ) was not providing it .
NeXT and Sun reached an agreement for Sun to license the NeXTstep environment and port it to Solaris .
This put several million dollars in the bank and made NeXT solvent for the next three years .
The new product was called OpenStep ; it was available for Solaris and other Unix operating systems .
The partnership was announced in late 1993 , and NeXT released its version of OpenStep for Solaris in 1996 , though Sun never incorporated it into Solaris as was first planned .
Personal Successes
As NeXT recovered , Jobs ’ personal life thrived .
His other company , Pixar , was gearing up for the wildly successful Toy Story release , and an IPO that would make Jobs a billionaire .
Laurene was pregnant again in 1994 , and Jobs ’ first daughter , Lisa Brennan - Jobs , started her freshman year at Harvard .
Apple ?
Jobs had never given up on the idea of returning to Apple .
As Michael Spindler , the successor to John Sculley , stumbled , Jobs visited the headquarters of National Semiconductors to talk to Apple ’s newest board - member , Gil Amelio .
He told Amelio , “ There ’s only one person who can rally the Apple troops , only one person who can straighten out the company . ”
That person was Jobs .
Jobs wanted to enlist the support of Amelio in a possible coup against Spindler at the upcoming shareholder ’s meeting ( Jobs was still entitled to attend , since he still owned one Apple share ) .
Amelio was taken aback by the discussion and quickly forgot about it .
By early 1996 , Apple was struggling to create a brand new operating system to replace increasingly unstable Mac OS .
Efforts had begun even before Jobs left ( such as the BigMac project ) , but all had failed .
Apple ’s most recent – and least ambitious – attempt to create a modern operating system to compete with the looming threat of Windows NT for Consumers ( a product which would be released as Windows XP five years behind schedule ) was named Copland and was n’t making much progress .
In order to make Copland compatible with existing Mac OS applications , there would be very few changes to the underlying Mac OS code .
The biggest change would be its new nanokernel and networking capabilities .
Changing Direction
After spending hundreds of millions of dollars on Copland , Gil Amelio ( Apple ’s new CEO of less than a hundred days ) decided that the software would never be ready for release and directed his CTO , Ellen Hancock , to make a list of possible outside operating systems to to license or buy outright .
The most obvious choice would be to buy the fledgling Be Inc. , which was founded by former Apple executive , Jean Louis Gassée , and was working on BeOS , which was available to the public through developer releases .
BeOS was incredibly fast , and it was built on a microkernel , just as NeXTstep was .
Unfortunately , BeOS was still buggy , and worse , it had almost no outside developers or customers .
Still , buying BeOS would have been better than licensing Solaris or Windows NT , and relying on outside companies for Apple ’s most important asset .
Gassée sensed that BeOS was the first choice of Apple and was very cocky in his negotiations .
Gassée offered to sell Be to Apple for $ 200 million and lead the new division himself .
Amelio was put off by the price , especially after Apple ’s legal team valued
Be at no more than $ 50 million .
Still ,
Be was the best that Apple could afford , for now .
Out of the Blue
Out of the blue , Jobs called Amelio shortly before Thanksgiving and urged him , for Apple ’s sake , to steer clear of Gassée .
A month later , a NeXT sales rep , Garret L. Rice - supposedly acting on his own volition – suggested that Apple consider NeXTstep , which was in the process of being ported to PowerPC , to one of Hancock ’s staffers .
Hancock began to research NeXT , which by now had several developers and hardware partners – and , most importantly , two finished operating systems , OpenStep and NeXTstep .
On 1996.12.02 , Jobs met with Amelio and Hancock on the Apple campus and discussed Apple ’s future .
Jobs gave a demo of NeXTstep and explained how object oriented programming could revitalize Apple ’s developers and attract enterprise customers to the Mac .
Seven days later , NeXT engineers began meeting with Apple engineers to discuss how a Mac OS - NeXTstep transition would work and how to preserve Mac OS compatibility .
On 1996.12.20 , Amelio announced to the public that Apple would buy NeXT for the price of $ 427 million and would base the next version of the Mac OS on NeXTstep .
Jobs returned to Apple as an advisor to help with the transition .
It was the first time Jobs had been at the Apple campus in almost eleven years .

Google does not appear to like being upstaged .
In the wake of this month 's announcement of Amazon Pages , Google has reportedly approached ( subscription required ) a book publisher about offering short - term rentals of new books online .
For a fee , buyers who cannot wait to get their hands on a copy of a book will be granted complete online access for a week .
Access will be via the Internet only ; no downloading or printing allowed .
According to the publisher in question , Google suggested charging 10 percent of the book 's list price as a rental fee , which the publisher characterized as too low .
Google 's book - rental gambit appears to be a response to the upcoming Amazon Pages , which will give buyers the ability to buy just a portion of a book ( e.g. , the two chapters covered in the syllabus ) for online access only .
Another upcoming Amazon offering will give book buyers complete online access to a book in conjunction with the purchase of a printed copy .
Google has developed quite a fascination with the printed word over the past year or so .
The Google Print Library , which has been operating in fits and starts since its inception , plans to digitize the library collections of a handful of universities .
Since Google began scanning , it has been hit with lawsuits on grounds of copyright infringement .
Earlier this month , a beta of Google Print went live , much to the consternation of some authors and publishers .
Since eBooks failed to catch the imagination of the book - buying public , print publishers have been leery of embracing the Internet as a content delivery system .
They are enamored of Amazon 's approach , which is a novel means of content delivery that should result in additional revenues for publishers while respecting the authoritah of the almighty copyright .
If Google can come up with an attractive price for an online book rental service and a rock - solid means of safeguarding against copyright infringement , it may cause publishers to overlook the search giant 's perceived peccadillos with Google Print .
If the world 's future lies in scientists ' hands , the answers are unlikely to come from the UK unless we reverse decades of political neglect , argues Nobel laureate Harry Kroto
There is food for thought in the fact that , after a decade of Labour government and at the same moment that the prime minister was making a speech about how important he considered science , the University of Reading announced the closure of its physics department .
Thirty per cent of physics departments have either been closed or merged in the past five years .
What is one to make of the deafening silence of ministers when , last year , the small Sussex chemistry department - a fantastic department to work in , where I stayed for some 37 years and which has housed some 12 fellows of the Royal Society , three Nobel laureates and a Wolf prize winner since it was created in 1962 - was under threat of closure ?
It was only through the concerted efforts of staff and students that a U - turn occurred .
Does no one in the government care , or is there a hidden agenda ?
Some government measures , such as those aimed at improving technology transfer and the encouragement of start - ups , have been successful .
However , nothing effective has been done by this government , or for that matter the previous one , to improve the situation on the science education front .
Indeed , several new measures have exacerbated the problem .
The laissez - faire attitude to science education has resulted in a disaster exemplified by the fact that more young people are opting for media studies than physics .
As a new five - storey chemistry building nears completion here at Florida State University ( where I was wanted ! ) , the jaws of American colleagues drop with incredulity at news of each successive UK science department closure .
All of this matters because the need for a general population with a satisfactory understanding of science and technology has never been greater .
We live in a world economically , socially and culturally dependent on science not only functioning well , but being wisely applied .
Dwindling numbers
Unfortunately , the numbers of young people opting for scientific training has dwindled frighteningly all over the developed world , not just in the UK .
It is worth noting that , over decades , the US has been spectacularly successful in making up its homegrown science and technology shortfall by draining first western European scientists , and now eastern European and Asian scientists .
As well as trained engineers and scientists , we desperately need a scientifically literate general population , capable of thinking rationally - and that includes lawyers , businesspeople , farmers , politicians , journalists and athletes .
This is vital if we are to secure a sustainable world for our grandchildren .
The facts that a ) we use in one year an amount of fossil fuel that took a million years to accumulate , b ) we may be on the verge of a climate change catastrophe of global proportions and c ) powerful technologies may soon fall into the hands of disturbed individuals with minds riven with those twin cancers of nationalism and religious fanaticism , seem to concern the scientific community a lot more than they do politicians or the media .
As my Sussex colleague , the Nobel laureate Sir John Cornforth , has written : " If you are a scientist , you realise before long that if the world is in anyone 's hands , it is in yours . "
The failure of our general science educational policy is manifest in the fact that so few are aware of the true level of our dependence on science and technology , or the truly humanitarian contributions that science and technology have made to society : from raising the health of the population ( half of all 18th - century children died by the age of eight ) to the advanced technologies that pervade our everyday lives ( the internet and mobile phones being archetypal examples ) .
The personal reasons for choosing a science education are also overwhelming .
A Royal Society of Chemistry / Institute of Physics study found that graduates with chemistry and physics degrees earn , for the most productive 15 - 20 years of their working lives , some £ 15,000 more annually than most other graduates .
They earn thousands more than those studying psychology , that seductively popular subject diverting a large proportion of our best young people into dead - end , uncreative careers .
It is actually a triple whammy , as the government gets greater investment return in tax from this better - paid workforce , and there are science and technology industries for graduates to enter .
The chemical industry posts a £ 50bn annual turnover with a £ 5 bn profit .
Which is more than can be said for law .
At a time when China and India are producing the hordes of scientists and engineers upon which they know their futures depend , all we hear from our government is that it is not its job to interfere with a secondary or tertiary education system that is graduating 10 times as many psychologists , linguists , historians and media people than there are jobs for .
Too bad if young people are not going to be qualified for the careers available and commensurate with their abilities , forcing many to settle for poorly paid , uncreative jobs .
Many think of the sciences as merely a fund of knowledge .
Journalists never ask scientists anything other than what the applications are of scientific breakthroughs .
Interestingly , I doubt they ever ask a musician , writer or actor the same question .
I wonder why .
Inquiring mindset
The scientific method is based on what I prefer to call the inquiring mindset .
It includes all areas of human thoughtful activity that categorically eschew " belief " , the enemy of rationality .
This mindset is a nebulous mixture of doubt , questioning , observation , experiment and , above all , curiosity , which small children possess in spades .
I would argue that it is the most important , intrinsically human quality we possess , and it is responsible for the creation of the modern , enlightened portion of the world that some of us are fortunate to inhabit .
Curiously , for the majority of our youth , the educational system magically causes this capacity to disappear by adolescence .
Without it , we have no instinctive ability to assess the importance of the technical issues that impinge on our everyday lives .
We are unable to gauge accurately the validity of fears over such issues as climate change and the looming energy crisis , or grasp the socio-economic and humanitarian importance of new genetic technologies .
Scientific education is by far the best training for all walks of life , because it teaches us how to assess situations critically and react accordingly .
It gives us an understanding based on reverence for life - enhancing technologies as well as for life itself .
If we do not know how things work , how can we fix things ?
And how are we going to use these powerful technologies wisely ?
The situation in universities is exacerbated by present policy , which actively encourages vice - chancellors who know the cost of everything and the value of nothing to eliminate science departments in favour of trendy , cheap courses .
These VCs bleat about how important their freedom is to do whatever they wish with taxpayers ' money , and steer funds earmarked for the sciences into softer areas that students prefer .
Just as cheap fast food has resulted in unprecedented levels of obesity , so this McDonald 's approach to cheap , trendy , seductively soft courses designed for mass consumption in tertiary education has resulted in a plethora of students trained for non-existent jobs .
Another major factor , encouraging VCs to close science departments - even if , as at Exeter University , they have plenty of students - is the inadequate provision made by the government to cover the real cost of science education .
The unit of resource ratio for an arts graduate versus a science graduate is 1:2 , when a more realistic ratio is at least 1:4 .
It is no wonder that VCs who fail in their primary role - to bring in outside funds - are encouraged by such manifest governmental disdain for science education to eliminate science departments .
Divisive dogma
Do I think there is any hope for UK ?
I am really not sure .
It is beyond belief that in the 21st century , our prime minister and the Department for Education and Skills are diverting taxpayers ' money to faith - based groups intent on propagating culturally divisive dogma that is antagonistic to the secular , enlightened philosophy that created the modern world .
It is a scandal that the present system is enabling a car salesman to divert significant government funds to propagate dogma such as " intelligent design " in our schools .
State funds are also being used to support some schools that abuse impressionable young people by brainwashing them into believing that non-believers will burn for all eternity in the fires of hell .
This policy is a perfect recipe for the creation of the next generation of homegrown and state - educated suicide bombers .
I think there is every likelihood that the lack of scientifically educated and aware young people in the UK will result in ever poorer performance on a global scale , and a takeover by the next generation of young Chinese and Indians , ravenous for the scientific knowledge that will free them from the shackles of present poverty levels .
They are being actively encouraged by their governments , who understand that the future lies in a scientific education based on doubt and questioning , rather than on belief .
It is truly disturbing that a well - funded cohort of religious groups - aided , abetted and condoned by the Labour government - is undermining our science education .
If they achieve any more success in their subversion of the intrinsic secular safeguards embodied in our democratic institutions and our educational system , there can be no doubt there is major trouble ahead .
So my final message is : " Do Panic ! "

In a nutshell
The Boost Lambda Library ( BLL in the sequel ) is a C++ template library , which implements a form of lambda abstractions for C ++.
The term originates from functional programming and lambda calculus , where a lambda abstraction defines an unnamed function .
The primary motivation for the BLL is to provide flexible and convenient means to define unnamed function objects for STL algorithms .
In explaining what the library is about , a line of code says more than a thousand words ; the following line outputs the elements of some STL container a separated by spaces :
for_each ( a.begin( ) , a.end ( ) , std::cout << _ 1 << ' ' ) ;
The expression std::cout << _ 1 << ' ' defines a unary function object .
The variable _1 is the parameter of this function , a placeholder for the actual argument .
Within each iteration of for_each , the function is called with an element of a as the actual argument .
This actual argument is substituted for the placeholder , and the “ body ” of the function is evaluated .
The essence of BLL is letting you define small unnamed function objects , such as the one above , directly on the call site of an STL algorithm .
Despite the best efforts of the Advanced Access Content System ( AACS ) Licensing Administration ( AACS LA ) , content pirates remain one step ahead .
A new volume key used by high - def films scheduled for release next week has already been cracked .
The previous AACS volume key was invalidated by AACS LA after it was exposed and broadly disseminated earlier this month .
The latest beta release of SlySoft 's AnyDVD HD program can apparently be used to rip HD DVD discs that use AACS version 3 .
Although these wo n't hit store shelves until the May 22 , pirates have already successfully tested SlySoft 's program with early release previews of the Matrix trilogy .
AACS LA 's attempts to stifle dissemination of AACS keys and prevent hackers from compromising new keys are obviously meeting with extremely limited success .
The hacker collective continues to adapt to AACS revisions and is demonstrating a capacity to assimilate new volume keys at a rate which truly reveals the futility of resistance .
If keys can be compromised before HD DVDs bearing those keys are even released into the wild , one has to question the viability of the entire key revocation model .
After the last AACS key spread far and wide across the breadth of the Internet , AACS LA chairman Michael Ayers stated that the organization planned to continue clamping down on key dissemination , despite the fact that attempts to do so only encouraged further dissemination .
In a monument to comedic irony , the AACS LA has elected to put out the fire by pouring on more gasoline .
AACS clearly has yet to stop those determined to break the DRM scheme from copying movies , but its key revocation model does create additional burdens for device makers , software developers , and end users .
As the futility of trying to prevent copying continues to become more apparent and the costs of maintaining DRM schemes escalate , content providers will be faced with a difficult choice of whether to make their content more or less accessible to consumers .
We are already seeing the music industry beginning to abandon DRM , but it does n't look like the movie industry is ready to take the same logical step .
Instead , the MPAA wants to have the best of both worlds by making DRM interoperable and designing it in a manner that , according to MPAA head Dan Glickman , will permit legal DVD ripping " in a protected way . "
Although the MPAA 's plans for DRM reform could reduce the incentives for hacking AACS , the war between hackers and DRM purveyors will continue for the foreseeable future .

In the late 1950s , a group of ingenious but misguided Americans began development of a nightmarish missile system : The Supersonic Low - Altitude Missile , or SLAM .
It also came to be known as “ The Flying Crowbar ” due to the missile ’s low complexity and high durability .
The missile was intended to use a very simple nuclear ramjet engine … outside air would be forced into a duct on the front using ram pressure , and then this air would become superheated by a nuclear reactor inside the missile .
The heated air would expand rapidly , pushing the exhaust out of the rear to provide enough thrust to reach three times the speed of sound .
The theory was workable , but the design had the unfortunate tendency to rain radioactive fission fragments everywhere it went , which is a lot of ground considering that this was a low - altitude long - range weapon .
The weapon ’s design called for a complement of hydrogen bombs inside , which could be peppered upon targets while the missile zig - zagged over the general area .
As an added bonus , any enemies which were not killed by the nukes were likely to die from the passing missile ’s shockwave , or by exposure to the gamma and neutron radiation belched out by its unshielded nuclear reactor .
The full story of this charming and delightful weapon was written for Air & Space Magazine in 1990 , and it ’s a fascinating read .

use Symbol : : Approx :: Sub ( xform => ' Text : : Metaphone ' ) ; use Symbol : : Approx :: Sub ( xform => undef , match => ' String : : Approx ' ) ; use Symbol : : Approx :: Sub ( xform => ' Text : : Soundex ' ) ; use Symbol : : Approx :: Sub ( xform => \&my_transform ) ; use Symbol : : Approx :: Sub ( xform => [ \&my_transform , ' Text : : Soundex ' ] ) ; use Symbol : : Approx :: Sub ( xform => \&my_transform , match => \&my_matcher , choose => \&my_chooser ) ;
DESCRIPTION
This is _really_ stupid .
This module allows you to call subroutines by _approximate_ names .
Why you would ever want to do this is a complete mystery to me .
It was written as an experiment to see how well I understood typeglobs and AUTOLOADing .
To use it , simply include the line :
use Symbol : : Approx :: Sub ;
somewhere in your program .
Then each time you call a subroutine that does n't exist in the the current package Perl will search for a subroutine with approximately the same name .
The meaning of ' approximately the same ' is configurable .
The default is to find subroutines with the same Soundex value ( as defined by Text : : Soundex ) as the missing subroutine .
There are two other built - in matching styles using Text :: MetaPhone and String : : Approx .
To use either of these use :
use Symbol : : Approx :: Sub ( xform => ' text_metaphone ' ) ;
or
use Symbol : : Approx :: Sub ( xfrom => undef , match => ' string_approx ' ) ;
when using Symbol : : Approx :: Sub .
Configuring The Fuzzy Matching
There are three phases to the matching process .
They are :
transform - a transform subroutine applies some kind of transformation to the subroutine names .
For example the default transformer applies the Soundex algorithm to each of the subroutine names .
Other obvious tranformations would be to remove all the underscores or to change the names to lower case .
A transform subroutine should simply apply its transformation to each item in its parameter list and return the transformed list .
For example , a transformer that removed underscores from its parameters would look like this : sub tranformer { map {
s/_//g ; $ _ } @_ ; } Transform subroutines can be chained together .
match - a match subroutine takes a target string and a list of other strings .
It matches each of the strings against the target and determines whether or not it ' matches ' according to some criteria .
For example the default matcher simply checks to see if the strings are equal .
A match subroutine is passed the target string as its first parameter , followed by the list of potential matches .
For each string that matches , the matcher should return the index number from the input list .
For example , the default matcher is implemented like this : sub matcher { my ( $ sub , @subs ) = @_ ; my ( @ret ) ; foreach ( 0 .. $ # subs ) { push @ret , $ _ if $ sub eq $ subs [ $_ ] ; } @ret ; }
choose - a chooser subroutine takes a list of matches and chooses exactly one item from the list .
The default matcher chooses one item at random .
A chooser subroutine is passed a list of matches and must simply return one index number from that list .
For example , the default chooser is implemented like this : sub chooser { rand @_ ; }
You can override any of these behaviours by writing your own transformer , matcher or chooser .
You can either define the subroutine in your own script or you can put the subroutine in a separate module which Symbol : : Approx : : Sub can then use as a plug - in .
See below for more details on plug-ins .
To use your own function , simply pass a reference to the subroutine to the use Symbol : : Approx : : Sub line like this :
use Symbol : : Approx :: Sub ( xfrom => \&my_transform , match => \&my_matcher , choose => \&my_chooser ) ;
A plug - in is simply a module that lives in the Symbol : : Approx : : Sub namespace .
For example , if you had a line of code like this :
use Symbol : : Approx :: Sub( xfrom => ' MyTransform ' ) ;
then Symbol : : Approx :: Sub will try to load a module called Symbol : : Approx : : Sub:: MyTranform and it will use a function from within that module called tranformer as the transform function .
Similarly , the matcher function is called match and the chooser function is called choose .
The default transformer , matcher and chooser are available as plug-ins called Text :: Soundex , String : : Equal and Random .
Subroutines
import
Called when the module is use d.
This function installs our AUTOLOAD subroutine into the caller 's symbol table .
CAVEAT
I can't stress too strongly that this will make your code completely unmaintainable and you really should n't use this module unless you 're doing something very stupid .
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This idea came to me whilst sitting in Mark - Jason Dominus ' " Tricks of the Wizards " tutorial .
In order to protect his reputation I should probably point out that just as the idea was forming in my head he clearly said that this kind of thing was a very bad idea .
Leon Brocard is clearly as mad as me as he pointed out some important bugs and helped massively with the ' fuzzy - configurability ' .
Matt Freake helped by pointing out that Perl generally does what you mean , not what you think it should do .
Robin Houston spotted some nasty problems and ( more importantly ) supplied patches .

It is time for the Justice Department to stop issuing rote denials that are becoming increasingly hard to believe about the suspicious firing of eight United States attorneys .
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales should appoint an impartial investigator to get to the bottom of this unfolding scandal .
Just this week , David Iglesias , one of the eight fired United States attorneys , charged that he was dismissed for resisting pressure to begin a politically charged prosecution before the 2006 election .
His allegation came shortly after performance evaluations came to light that throw considerable doubt on the Justice Department ’s claim that the United States attorneys were fired for poor performance .
United States attorneys , the highest federal prosecutors at the state level , must be insulated from politics .
Their decisions about whether to indict can ruin lives , and change the outcome of elections .
To ensure their independence , United States attorneys are almost never removed during the term of the president who appointed them .
The Bush administration ignored this tradition , and trampled on prosecutorial independence , by firing eight United States attorneys in rapid succession , including one , Carol Lam of San Diego , who had put a powerful Republican congressman in jail .
Mr. Iglesias , who was the U.S. attorney in New Mexico , says two members of Congress called him last October and urged him to pursue corruption charges against a prominent Democrat before the November election .
He did not .
He was dismissed .
Liberty and Security , Then and Now
By chance , I had just finished rereading a famous speech by Ronald Reagan when I heard the news that President Bush had confirmed the existence of secret CIA prisons .
Yesterday , while looking over it again , I heard the “ Judge Advocates General ” : http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/washington/08detain.html?hp&ex=1157774400&en=fa1da1053abb2a24&ei=5094&partner=homepage strongly resist the White House ’s plan for military tribunals that would allow conviction based on secret evidence .
When Reagan spoke in 1964 on behalf of Barry Goldwater , he presented TV viewers with a stark choice between those with the courage to make a principled stand for Freedom and Liberty , and those who would capitulate to the global threat of Communism for the sake of a quiet life .
He did n’t pull any punches .
bq .
Those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state have told us that they have a utopian solution of peace without victory .
They call their policy ‘ accommodation . ’ …
We can not buy our security , our freedom from the threat of the bomb by committing and immorality so great as saying to a billion human beings now in slavery behind the Iron Curtain , ‘ Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skin we are willing to make a deal with your slave masters . ’ …
Admittedly there is risk in any course we follow other than this , but every lesson in history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement , and this is the specter our well - meaning liberal friends refuse to face …
When Nikita Khrushchev has told his people [ that ] we are retreating under the pressure of the cold war , and … our surrender will be voluntary because by that time we will have been weakened from within spiritually , morally , and economically .
He believes this because from our side he has heard voices pleading for “ peace at any price ” or “ better Red than dead ” …
Where then is the road to peace ?
You and I have the courage to say to our enemies , “ There is a price we will not pay . ”
There is a point beyond which they will not advance ! …
You and I have a rendezvous with destiny .
We will preserve for our children this , the last best hope of man on earth , or we will sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness .
Strong stuff .
The parallels to present - day rhetoric from the White House are striking .
Reagan ’s vision of a cataclysmic fight between two alternative worldviews finds its direct counterpart today in the way President Bush and his supporters talk about the war on terror .
Both raise the specter of appeasement by well - meaning liberals .
In both cases the enemy ’s leader is said to predict the collapse of the United States , while “ home - grown subversives ” : http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php/weblog/abf_friday_blame_america_first_edition/ help him by morally enervating the country .
Millions awaiting liberation abroad are invoked in both cases .
And the way forward is also clear : resolve to fight , unto the bitter end , lest we condemn our children to “ a thousand years of darkness , ” be it under Communism or Islamofascism .
The main substantive difference , of course , is the scale of the threat posed by the Soviet Union in the 1960s and that posed by international terrorism today , not least the fact that the Russians really did have a a huge army , an arsenal of nuclear weapons , and a country from which to launch them .
Al Qaeda ’s global counterinsurgency is serious , but pales in comparison .
Even faced with the truly apocalyptic threat of a global nuclear conflict , most people at the time thought Reagan ’s ( and Goldwater ’s ) attitude was dangerous , guaranteed — even intended — to provoke a Third World War .
Today , in the face of a much smaller threat , some conservative commentators simply assert that we are presently fighting World War III , as if saying it made it so .
Setting the real differences aside , it ’s also clear that the parallel between Reagan ’s rhetoric and current conservative tropes is not perfect .
A decisive gap has opened .
The parts of Reagan ’s speech I quoted are really only half of his message .
He also said this :
bq. Alexander Hamilton said , ‘ A nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master , and deserves one ! ’ …
You and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery .
If nothing in life is worth dying for , when did this begin — just in the face of this enemy ? — or should Moses have told the children of Israel to live in slavery under the Pharaohs ?
Should Christ have refused the cross ?
Should the patriots at Concord Bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the short heard round the world ? …
Well , it ’s a simple answer after all .
It is this libertarian strand , focused on what individuals should be prepared to sacrifice to hold onto their freedoms , that is wholly absent from the official conservative line today .
Rick Perlstein ’s book , _Before the Storm_ , chronicles the rise of Barry Goldwater culminating in his 1964 run for President .
He argues that Goldwater ’s apparent failure in the short - run — his crushing defeat by Lyndon Johnson — hid a long - term success , as his supporters put down the ideological and organizational roots of the Reagan revolution .
Positions in American politics that were on the fringes when Goldwater began his national career were at the center of things when Reagan ended his Presidency .
Reagan initiated the changes that helped do away with such “ soup kitchens of the welfare state ” as ever existed in America , and in that respect the libertarian program made its mark .
But almost the reverse has happened in the realm of national security , where a key component of Reagan ’s message has been jettisoned .
The libertarian strand has been replaced by extravagant promises of government protection against terrorist threats , and the constant fomenting of fear amongst the public .
One odd result is that principled libertarians and left - leaning critics find themselves making common cause , often to the the surprise or irritation of both .
From the libertarian side , present circumstances mean that a real commitment to individual liberty lines up with left - wing calls for the preservation and application of civil rights .
On the left , concern about the burgeoning security state sounds a lot like libertarian critiques of the grasping hand of government bureaucracy and its insatiable desire for power .
Most conservatives now remember only half of what Reagan said — the lines about accommodation and appeasement , about having a rendezvous with destiny .
They forget the other half , so much so that his words apply more accurately today to them than to liberals : do n’t sell your liberty for the illusion of security .
When faced with the choice , “… have the courage to say to our enemies , ‘ There is a price we will not pay . ' ”
The Vlaams Belang [ Flemish Interest ] is Belgium ’s largest party .
It strives for the independence of Flanders and its election victories might lead to the falling apart of Belgium and , since Belgium ’s capital Brussels is the EU capital , threaten the stability of the European Union .
Frank Vanhecke , the party leader and a member of the European Parliament , and Filip Dewinter , the leader of the party in the Flemish regional parliament and the Antwerp municipal council ( as well as “ the worst Belgian ever ” ) will be visiting Washington DC from 20 to 24 February .
The Robert Taft Club has asked Mr Vanhecke and Mr Dewinter to speak on the subject “ Immigration , Multiculturalism , and Free Speech in Europe . ”
The event takes place on Friday , Feb. 23 , 7:00 to 10:00 pm at the
Chrystal City Marriott
1999 Jefferson Davis Highway
Arlington , Virginia ( Chrystal City Metro ) .
Admission is free .

Last December , Professor Michel Korinman of Paris’ Sorbonne University , asked me to address a conference organized by the Daedalos Institute of Geopolitics in Nicosia , Cyprus , on “ Peoples in Migration in the 21st century , ” and explain why the VB is the most successful of the so - called “ Euronationalist ” parties , opposing immigration and multiculturalism .
Below is the text of my Nicosia speech .
Why is the Vlaams Belang so popular ?
The Vlaams Belang is the largest single party in Belgium .
It has not lost a single election in 25 years , growing slowly but continuously from 3 % of the vote in 1987 , to 10.3 % in 1991 , 12.3 % in 1995 , 15,8 % in 1999 , 18.2 % in 2003 to 24.1 % in 2004 .
It is the most successful of all the so - called “ Euro - nationalist ” parties .
Originally founded in 1977 as a radical Flemish - secessionist break - away of the Flemish - nationalist party , its main political goal is the establishment of Flanders , the Dutch - speaking northern half of the federal kingdom of Belgium , as a sovereign state , an independent republic .
In the late 1980s the party managed to transform itself into a mainstream conservative party , aptly filling the gap that the free - market Liberals and the Christian - Democrats created when they moved to the left .
The Vlaams Belang is also the only Euro- sceptic party in Belgium and the only one that rejects the official state ideology of multiculturalism .
The Vlaams Belang says it is firmly established on three pillars : Flemish independence , the opposition to multiculturalism , and the defence of traditional Western values .
The party differs from the other Euro - nationalist parties in three ways .
First , it has a collective leadership and does not depend on strong charismatic and often impulsive leaders such as Jean - Marie Le Pen in France , Jorg Haider in Austria , or the late Pim Fortuyn in the Netherlands .
The media , who by their nature want to personalize politics , often depict Filip Dewinter as the leader of the Vlaams Belang , but Dewinter is not the party president .
Dewinter is the chairman of the Antwerp chapter of the party and the president of its group in the Flemish regional council , but he is not the party ’s national leader nor the chairman of its group in the federal Belgian House of Representatives .
The Vlaams Belang is not a one - man - show .
Second , though generally depicted as an islamophobic anti-immigration party , the Vlaams Belang is not a one - issue party but rather a coalition of people who for various reasons oppose Belgium ’s traditional parties and its policies .
Third , the party is seen by the Belgian establishment as a mortal enemy of the state , not only because it rejects the multiculturalist state ideology but primarily because it wants to dismantle the state itself .
Imagine a Front National in France , with a young , collective leadership , with a broad electoral base enabling it to attract a broad range of conservative voters which other parties no longer cater for , and a party programme that states as its primary goal that it wants to abolish France .
The Vlaams Belang is a unique phenomenon unlikely to occur elsewhere , except perhaps if the European Union should ever develop into a fully fledged federal superstate .
Then one could easily imagine a kind of pan-European Vlaams Belang which would oppose multiculturalism and islamisation while at the same time aiming for the abolishment of the European superstate and the reestablishment of the old , former nation - states .
The Vlaams Belang ’s opposition to Belgium and the European Union are motivated by the same considerations .
It considers multi-national Belgium , an artificial state constructed by the European powers in 1831 , to be the prototype of the federal European state that Eurofederalists want to establish .
The Vlaams Belang opposes Brussels and does not really differentiate between Brussels as the capital of Belgium and Brussels as the capital of Europe .
It sees both Belgium and Europe – in other words Brussels and Brussels – as enemies of Flanders and of the Flemish people , whose national identity these enemies want to subvert and destroy .
According to the Vlaams Belang – and its success in conveying this message explains its continuous electoral successes – immigrants are being used by the Belgian establishment as a weapon against the Flemings .
In other words immigration has been deliberately promoted with the goal of undermining national loyalties which people adhere to because it gives meaning to fundamental existential questions such as “ Who are we ?
What is our identity ? ”
Belgium is a country consisting of different peoples : Dutch - speaking Flemings , French - speaking Walloons , and a small number of Germans .
Islamic immigrants who settled in Belgium and have acquired ( or rather been given ) Belgian nationality , tend to be the only group of Belgians whose loyalty is to Belgium , rather than to Flanders or Wallonia .
Similarly it is imaginable , and even probable , that if Europe ever becomes an artificial superstate , non-European immigrants would be the only group to identify with this European state and new nationality rather than with that of the old former national entities .
The Belgian authorities have always seen Flemish nationalism as endangering the existence of the multinational Belgian state .
They have also explicitly stated that immigrants are to be used by the ruling establishment as a weapon against the Vlaams Belang .
Until 2004 the Vlaams Belang was called the Vlaams Blok .
Its party slogan was “ Our own people first . ”
After the party had become the largest party in the local elections in Antwerp in 2000 , the Belgian establishment decided to extend the right to vote in local elections to non-Belgian residents .
It also decided to make it easier for non-Belgians to acquire Belgian nationality , with the intention of creating so - called “ new Belgians ” entitled to vote in the general elections .
In September 2000 , Leona Detiège , the then Socialist mayor of Antwerp , told the press ( Knack Magazine , 13 Sept. 2000 ) : “ The Vlaams Blok is currently overrepresented because the immigrants are not allowed to vote . ” while Johan Leman , the then director of the Center for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism ( CEOOR ) , a government agency working for the Belgian Prime Minister , announced ( De Standaard , 15 Jan. 2000 ) : “ What will ‘ our own people ’ still mean fifteen years from now ?
We will get so many new Belgians that this slogan becomes meaningless .
The Vlaams Blok is a thing of the past . ”
In last October ’s local elections in Belgium the immigrant vote tipped the balance in favour of the ruling establishment .
In Brussels more than one fifth ( 21.8 % ) of the municipal councillors are now immigrants of non-European origin .
Most of them are Muslims , and most of them have been elected as Socialists .
The non-European immigrants vote overwhelmingly Socialist , owing to the fact that many of them migrated to Western Europe attracted by the subsidies of its generous welfare states .
The immigrants have become the electoral life insurance of European Socialism .
In the Brussels borough of Sint - Joost - ten - Node ( where the party headquarters of the Vlaams Belang is located ) 11 of the 16 Socialist municipal councillors are non-European immigrants , as are 4 of the 5 Christian - Democrats , 2 of the 3 Greens and 2 of the 3 Liberals .
In Antwerp almost one third of the Socialist councillors ( 7 of 22 ) are Muslims , as are one third of the Christian - Democrat councillors ( 2 of 6 ) .
In Ghent , one quarter of the Socialist councillors are Muslims .
In Vilvoorde , a Flemish town 20 kms north of Brussels , half the Socialist representatives are Muslims .
Many of these Muslims have radical islamist sympathies .
It bothers many traditional indigenous Socialists that their party has sold out to radical Islamism .
After the elections one of them told the Brussels newspaper Le Soir ( 11 October 2006 ) : “ Whenever one of the Belgo - Belgians [ the indigenous Belgians ] complained he was told off for being a racist . ”
No wonder that even many French - speaking indigenous former Socialists have begun to vote for the Vlaams Belang .
The Belgian establishment ’s harassment of the party has only brought it more sympathy from the public .
On 9 November 2004 , the Supreme Court in Brussels declared the Vlaams Blok , then already the country ’s largest party , a criminal organisation .
In the 1990s in an effort to kill the party the Belgian Parliament changed the Constitution and voted a series of new laws , including an Anti-Racism Act and an Anti-Discrimination Act , which define “ discrimination ” so broadly that anyone and everyone is vulnerable to hate - crime prosecutions .
These new laws were used against the Vlaams Blok .
The party was convicted on the basis of an anthology of as few as 16 texts published by various local Vlaams Blok chapters between 1996 and 2000 .
Though many of these texts simply quoted official statistics on crime rates and social welfare expenditure the court posited that they had been published with “ an intention to contribute to a campaign of hatred . ”
One of the texts , which dealt with the position of women in fundamentalist muslim societies , was written by Belkiz Sögütlü , a female Turkish - born Vlaams Blok member who had herself been raised in such an environment .
Following the verdict the Vlaams Blok was forced to disband .
Its leaders , however , promptly founded another party , the Vlaams Belang ( which means “ Flemish Interest ” ) .
It went on to win the next elections .
At this moment the Vlaams Belang is again in court .
The Council of State , a Belgian administrative court , will rule early next year whether or not to defund the party .
This is an attempt to kill it by depriving it of its finances .
Ten years ago the Belgian authorities decided to make it illegal for political parties to accept private donations .
Instead they have since been subsidised by the state in accordance with the number of votes gained in the last elections .
Parties that are considered to be “ enemies of the state ” can , however , be defunded on the grounds that it is illogical for the state to fund its own enemies .
There is little doubt that the party will , indeed , be defunded .
The party leadership says that they have set aside funds in a so - called “ war chest ” to allow it to participate in the general elections next June .
There is little doubt that the Vlaams Belang will also win these elections .
If the Belgian authorities take their money away from them this will cause an outrage and even more indigenous voters will flock to them .
The party does realize , however , that its ability to keep winning elections depends on demographics .
Its electoral potential will decline when the number of indigenous voters goes down .
The Vlaams Belang was the only party in last October ’s local elections that did not put forward Muslim candidates .
In Antwerp , Flanders ’ largest city , it won 33.5 % of the vote , compared to 33.0 % in 2000 .
This may look like a small gain , but it is significant since the demographic makeup of Belgium ’s cities is rapidly and dramatically changing .
The municipality of Antwerp has half a million inhabitants .
Every year on average 4,000 indigenous Flemings move out of Antwerp , while 5,000 immigrants settle there .
Most immigrants are Muslims .
These people do not vote for a party that has no Muslims on its list , that opposes multiculturalism and demands that immigrants assimilate and respect the values of their host country .
According to the marxist sociologist Jan Hertogen
“ The immigrants saved democracy in Belgium ” ( Gazet van Antwerpen , 9 Oct. 2006 ) .
Hertogen calculated that if the franchise had not been extended to immigrants the Vlaams Belang would have polled 40.4 % in Antwerp instead of 33.5 % .
Filip Dewinter , the party ’s leader in Antwerp , told the press before the elections that his party cannot continue to win .
“ I am a realist , ” he said .
“ The number of potential voters for our party is declining year by year . [ … ]
In ten years ’ time the number of new Belgians in Antwerp – half of whom are Moroccans – has doubled . [...]
If the number of foreigners in Antwerp continues to grow by 1.5 % a year , as it currently does , then in twenty years from now there will be more people of foreign than of indigenous extraction in this city . [… ]
Our party has foreign members , but I do not want to be a hypocrite .
At present we do no put forward ‘ alibi Ali ’ candidates .
But I know that it is bound to happen some day .
We extend our hands to welcome every foreign - born person who wants to become a Fleming among the Flemings . ”
It is doubtful , however , that many rentseeking immigrants , attracted by welfare benefits , would want to join a conservative party that is generally perceived as being opposed to the European welfare system .
This is why I think that the shift to the right in Belgium , but also in West - European politics in general , will be over by the end of the decade , when the impact of the immigrant vote will shift politics dramatically to the left .
The Belgian and European social - democrat establishments are slowly but gradually succeeding in what Bertold Brecht advised totalitarian regimes to do : “ dissolve the people and elect another . ”
What happens when a VoIP blog ( yours truly ) writes about the fact that a former Nortel subsidiary ( Blade Network Technologies ) went looking for a new phone system , chose an open - source Asterisk - based solution from Fonality instead of using Nortel 's own PBX and then agreed to go on record on the VoIP & Gadgets blog about why they made such a shocking decision ?
A)
Nothing - it 's a VoIP blog - who cares ?
Nortel is an $ 11 billion dollar company that certainly does n't read blogs for their news .
B)
Nortel reads the blog post , is a little peeved , but other than some emails sent internally , no one outside Nortel would ever know they were annoyed .
C ) A Nortel Board Member flips out over the article , contacts Blade and then pressures Blade to return the Fonality system and have Fonality ( and the subsequent press release ) .
If you answered C ) congratulations , we have a winner !
Yes , it 's true - and in true David ( Fonality ) vs. Goliath ( Nortel ) fashion it would appear that we have Nortel peeved that one of their former subsidiaries chose an open - source IP - PBX ( PBXtra from Fonality ) and who had the audacity to speak to the press about why they made such a decision .
Why , the nerve !
Although they are a former subsidiary of Nortel , I should point out that according to InternetNews.com , Nortel still has a minority interest in Blade .
Interestingly , according to Blade 's website , Eric Schoch , the Vice President of Business Development for Nortel , serves on Blade 's board of directors .
As if we needed any more proof of the power that the blogosphere holds , the fact that a Nortel executive took exception to my blog post and contacted Blade to apply pressure is almost beyond belief .
I spoke with Fonality 's CEO , Chris Lyman to get the exact facts from his perspective .
Here is my phone conversation with him transcribed : Chris explained , " Fonality sells it 's PBXtra IP PBX to Blade .
During the sale , Blade 's Director of IT , Amon Prasad agrees to go on record in a Fonality press release about why he made this decision against his parent company .
Then you ( Tom ) decided to do a story about such an interesting customer win .
" Chris continues , " Here is where it gets interesting .
The day after your story hits the net , Fonality gets a panicked call from Stefan Zuckut , Blade ’s Vice President of Corporate Development .
Stefan tells us that a board member from Nortel read your ( Tom Keating ) blog and hit the roof .
" Chris explains , “ Well , Stefan must have been telling the truth , because 30 minutes later , the CEO of Blade , Vikram Mehta , is demanding to speak with me personally .
I acquiesce .
When Vikram gets me on the phone he immediately tells me that Blade is going to return their brand - new , still - in - the - box phone system .
I ask , ' Why are you returning ? ' "
To which Vikram replies : “ We changed our mind .
’“ You ca n’t change your mind .
That ’s not how our terms and conditions work . ” says Chris , and then continued , " The next thing out of the Blade executive ’s mouth astonishes me “ We also want a retraction of your press release about how the Fonality system was more affordable and easier to use than Nortel .
” Stunned , Chris asks , “ Why ? ” “ Because you did n’t follow our internal process for authorizing a press release .
” “ But it is * your * internal process , and we spoke , with permission , to your own Director of IT , who personally signed off on the release .
All that press release said and all Tom Keating 's article said was that we 're less expensive and easier to use than Nortel .
What you want me to publish a document that we 're more expensive than Nortel and harder to use ?
How the heck do you expect me to print a retraction for something that is a ) true and b ) out of my control now that it is in the blogosphere ?
” I interrupted Chris 's retelling of the conversation with Vikram and asked Chris , " How long have they had PBXtra for ?
" Incredulously , Chris responds , " They have n't even installed it yet .
It 's still in the box .
" I responded , " Right .
I recall when speaking to Blade 's Director of IT last week that he explained Blade had n't deployed it yet , but were excited to do so .
" After Vikram pressed Chris for a retraction , Chris in an irate mood , issued an ultimatum - " You have 60 seconds to change your mind .
If within the next 60s you do n't change your mind , you 're going to discover how an incident turns into a scandal .
Because either way , any reporter worth his salt is going to find the fact that Nortel 's board of directors is putting pressure on you to get us to print a retraction about the comparative price of our systems much more juicy than the stupid article in the first place .
This is getting better all the time and it's good for us and bad for you .
" Chris told me they got so upset they hung up on him before he got five seconds into his count .
I asked who was on the call and Chris said it was Vikram Mehta , Blade ’s CEO , Stefan Zuckut , their VP of Corporate Development and Jim Sladek , VP of Finance .
Chris told me , " That 's when I called you Tom on Friday to tell you about what was happening .
" Chris , " Then I told Arnold , my SVP to play good cop .
Call them back and tell Blade that my CEO ( that ’s me ) is chain dialing the press .
All they have to do is call off the dogs about us printing a retraction and returning the system and everything will be fine .
We wo n't even talk about the little incident .
" According to Chris , " Blade came back within an hour and changed their mind about returning - agreeing to keep it and be friends and we 're sorry .
Everything was lovely .
That was all on Friday .
Well , I came in this Monday morning and they 've again decided to return the unopened system .
The reason quoted in the RMA ticket is : “ Poor customer service , Arnold Waldstein . ”
Chris laughed , " Arnold is our SVP of Marketing .
Ha !
" I asked Chris , " So they let me get this straight .
They changed their mind a second time ?
They flipped on the flip - flop ?
" Chris acknowledged , " Yes , they re-changed their mind again .
This is a bit of a watershed event when big big iron like Nortel calls Blade to pressure little ole '
Fonality into printing a retraction of what is absolutely the truth from inside their own company .
And that company goes crazy at the executive level and makes 3 decisions within 24 hours - to return it , then to not return it , then to return it again .
" I contacted Blade 's Stefan Zuckut their VP of Corporate Development , to get their perspective .
I explained who I was and said , " I was the one who wrote the Blade & Fonality story and I was wondering if I could have your comments on what transpired between yourself , Fonality and Nortel ?
" Stefan replied , " I can not comment on that , but I 'd be happy to have our CEO give you a call . "
I then asked , " What 's you 're CEO 's name ? " and Stefan said , " Vikram Mehta , but he 's in a meeting right now , is there a way of reaching you ?
" I gave my contact information , but no one called me back so I called back a few hours later and this was my conversation with the Blade 's CEO : Tom : Hi this is Tom Keating with Technology Marketing Corporation .
I was the one who wrote the Blade & Fonality story and I was wondering if I could have your comments on what transpired between yourself , Fonality and Nortel ?
Vikram : I 'm not quite sure I know what you 're talking about .
Tom : I spoke with Chris Lyman and he mentioned that your Director of IT was pretty pleased with the Fonality system and I was wondering what changed over the weekend as far as far as why you are no longer using their solution ?
Vikram : I 'm not ...
First of all , I 'm a little concerned about getting into details about what we do on a day - to - day basis and our commercial relationships with Fonality and Nortel are in confidence , so ... Tom :
So basically you 're answer as to why you decided to return Fonality is -- " no comment " ?
Vikram : I did n't say that .
You said that .
Tom : Well I 'm just trying to understand why your Director of IT very much loved the Fonality solution and then as the result of my article resulted in you guys changing your mind .
Vikram : Like I said , our relationship with our suppliers and customers are commercial - in - confidence and I do n't want to be getting into any details about what we 're doing with Nortel and likewise I do n't want to be getting into what we are doing with Fonality .
That is my comment .
Tom : Well Fonality gave me the green light to talk to you .
They were very open and honest as far as their position so I 'm just trying to get what your take on it is .
Vikram : I can't speak for what Fonality told you and what they did not , but like I said my position is that our relationships with our customers and suppliers are commercial - in - confidence Tom : Chris gave me the green light to speak about the relationship with you .
He mentioned you spoke with a Nortel board member .
If you let me know the contact information at Nortel , I can speak with them and find out if they would be willing to give me the green light as well .
Vikram :
Our relationships , like I said , with customers and suppliers are commercial - in - confidence .
I am not at liberty to divulge what we are doing with anybody .
Tom :
That 's fine .
So if you like I can contact Nortel directly and get their perspective and they can either comment or no comment .
If you just give me the person to speak with I can get their position .
Vikram :
Do n't know that I can point to ... uhhh .
Do n't you have public relations contacts at Nortel ?
Tom :
Yes I do , but it 's a big company , but I do n't know who exactly you spoke with at Nortel , so I would n't know who to refer to .
I would need a specific person for me to contact their PR firm about .
So is there a specific person on the board at Nortel you spoke with ?
Vikram : Like I said , our relationships with our customers and suppliers are commercial - in - confidence .
I cannot divulge anything about our commercial relationship with our customers and suppliers .
Tom :
But I 'm not asking you to divulge the relationship , I 'm just asking to speak to Nortel .
Vikram :
Go right ahead .
Tom :
But who do I speak with ?
Vikram : I wish I could help you .
Tom : Ok , so did Nortel offer anything in exchange for you returning Fonality 's PBX .
Was there a quid pro quo ?
Vikram : I do n't even know what you 're talking about .
Tom : According to Chris Lyman you said you were returning the Fonality system .
Vikram : Like I said , our relationships with our customers and suppliers are commercial - in - confidence and I 'm not in a position to divulge anything about our commercial relationships with anybody .
Whether that is Fonality , Nortel , other customers , suppliers who we do business with .
I 'm not in position to speak about any of that stuff with the press .
We spoke a little more , but as you can tell , I was getting nowhere with Vikram .
However what " was n't said " spoke volumes -- both from his demeanor and his avoiding answering my questions , in my mind confirmed what Chris said was accurate .
I then contacted Nortel to get their perspective .
I spoke with a Nortel employee who wishes to remain anonymous .
He stated that Eric Schoch , the Nortel board member was travelling and therefore was n't able to get him to respond .
The employee did however admit that he was aware that Eric sent Vikram ( CEO of Blade ) a note about the Fonality press release where it simply stated " I would appreciate seeing copies of any news releases that have our name ' Nortel ' in it before they go out . "
The Nortel official explained , " Anything that uses our trademark name we like to take a look at it . "
The employee added that he was not aware of any pressure applied by Nortel to have Blade reverse their decision on selecting Fonality or forcing a retraction .
Let 's tally the score to try and figure out who is lying and who is telling the truth .
Chris Lyman and Arnold Waldstein from Fonality claim that Vikram called them and stated unequivocally that a Nortel board member was very upset over the blog article and press release and as a result Blade demanded a retraction and a return .
When I contacted Vikram at Blade , he was evasive , would n't set the record straight , and simply hid behind " customer - in - confidence " .
Finally , I contacted Nortel , and although the board member in question was not available for comment , the Nortel representative .
Nortel claims however they were simply upset that Nortel was not consulted for approval in the issuance of the press release .
So let me get this straight - this whole story is simply about not giving Nortel a heads - up on a press release wherein Nortel does n't exactly come out smelling like a rose resulting in Blade demanding a retraction and returning Fonality 's PBXtra ?
C'mon !
Just to put this all in perspective , according to the latest research I 've seen , Nortel 's market share has declined from 29 % in the fourth quarter of 2004 to 17 % in the third quarter of 2005 , according to Merrill .
With Nortel 's slipping marketshare is the new way of retaining marketshare by strong - arming or pressuring open source PBX rivals from telling their successful stories to the press / media including blogs ?
While I cannot confirm this is the case with 100 % certainty , it certainly is quite suspicious .
As Chris stated , this is indeed a watershed event for open source telephony .

Splitting a string into parts based on a token delimiter is a very common operation in some problem domains .
Languages such as Perl or Java provide a split function in their standard library to execute this algorithm , yet I ’m often surprised to see how many languages do not have one .
As far as I can tell neither C++ nor Haskell have it so I have coded such a function in the past multiple times in both languages .
( This is not exactly true : Haskell has the words function which splits a string by whitespace characters .
Nevertheless I did n’t know this when I wrote my custom implementation . )
When I implemented a custom split function in Haskell I was really amazed to see how easy and clean the resulting code was .
I ’m sure there is some better and even cleaner way to write it because I ’m still a Haskell newbie !
Here is it :
split :: String -> Char -> [ String ] split [ ] delim = [ " " ] split ( c : cs ) delim | c == delim = " " : rest | otherwise = ( c : head rest ) : tail rest where rest = split cs delim
The above code starts by declaring the function ’s type ; this is optional because Haskell ’s type system is able to automatically deduce it .
It then uses pattern matching to specify the algorithm ’s base and recursive cases .
At last , the recursive case is defined by parts , just as you do in mathematics .
Oh , and why recursivity ?
Because iteration does not exist in functional programming in the well - known sense of imperative languages .
Also note the lack of variables ( except for the input ones ) and that everything is an evaluable expression .
Let ’s now compare the above code with two implementations in C ++.
A first approach to the problem following common imperative programming thinking results in an iterative algorithm :
std :: deque < std :: string > split_iterative ( const std :: string & str , char delim ) { std :: deque < std :: string > parts ; std :: string word ; for ( std :: string :: const_iterator iter = str . begin ( ) ; iter != str . end ( ) ; iter ++ ) { if ( * iter == delim ) { parts .
push_back ( word ) ; word . clear ( ) ; } else word += * iter ; } parts .
push_back ( word ) ; return parts ; }
This is certainly uglier and much more difficult to prove right ; iteration is a complex concept in that sense .
In this code we have variables that act as acumulators , temporary objects , commands , etc .
Be glad that I used C++ and not C to take advantage of STL containers .
OK , to be fair the code should be implemented in a recursive way to be really comparable to the Haskell sample function .
Let ’s attempt it :
std :: deque < std :: string > split_recursive ( const std :: string & str , char delim ) { std :: deque < std :: string > parts ; if ( ! str . empty ( ) ) { std :: string str2 = str ; parts = split_recursive ( str2 . erase ( 0 , 1 ) , delim ) ; if ( str [ 0 ] == delim ) parts .
push_front ( " " ) ; else parts [ 0 ] = str [ 0 ] + parts [ 0 ] ; } else parts .
push_front ( " " ) ; return parts ; }
This split_recursive function follows the same algorithm as the split written in Haskell .
I find that it is still harder to read and more delicate ( I had some segmentation fault s until I got it right ) .
Of course Haskell is not appropriate for everything ( which is true for every language out there ) .
I have yet to write a big and useful program in Haskell to really see its power and to be able to relly compare it to other languages .
All I can do at the moment is to compare trivial stuff as the above .

Women sit separately from men on Israel 's " modesty buses "
When the Number 40 bus arrived , the most curious thing happened .
Husbands left heavily pregnant wives or spouses struggling with prams and pushchairs to fend for themselves as they and all other male passengers got on at the front of the bus .
Women moved towards the rear door to get on at the back .
When on the bus , I tried to buck the system , moving my way towards the driver but was pushed back towards the other women .
These are what orthodox Jews call " modesty buses " .
The separation system operates on 30 public bus routes across Israel .
The authorities here say the arrangement is voluntary , but in practice , as I found out , there is not much choice involved .
' Abuse and threats '
Naomi Ragen is one of a group of women now taking the separation bus system to court .
She is an orthodox Jew herself .
" I was n't trying to start a revolution , all I wanted to do was get home , " she tells me .
" I was in downtown Jerusalem and I saw a bus going straight to my neighbourhood and I got on and sat down , in a single seat behind the driver .
" It was a completely empty bus , and all of a sudden , some men started getting on , ultra - orthodox men .
They told me I was not allowed to sit there , I had to go to the back of the bus . "
Not only is the segregation system discriminatory , says Ms Ragen , but it can also be dangerous , she says , for those like her who ignore it .
" I said to him look , if you bring me a code of Jewish law and show me where it 's written that I have to sit at the back of the bus I 'll move .
" And he tried to gain support from the rest of the passengers and I underwent a half - hour of pure hell - abuse , humiliation , threats , even physical intimidation . "
' Positive discrimination '
Supporters of the separation system say the buses involved serve mainly religious Jewish neighbourhoods - but not exclusively .
Men only through the front door of Israel 's " modesty buses "
One man told me that if some people wanted segregation buses they should pay a private company to provide them .
Another told me that in a society that is democratic and where the buses are subsidised by the government , a minority 's concerns should not override those of the majority .
But Shlomo Rosenstein disagrees .
He is a city councillor in Jerusalem where a large proportion of Israel 's segregation lines operate .
" This really is about positive discrimination , in women 's favour .
Our religion says there should be no public contact between men and women , this modesty barrier must not be broken . "
Uphill struggle
Opponents of the separation buses face an uphill struggle .
Orthodox Jewish leaders are a powerful minority in Israel .
Naomi Ragen says the buses are just part of a wider menacing pattern of behaviour towards women in parts of the orthodox Jewish community .
" They 've already cancelled higher education in the ultra - orthodox world for women .
They have packed the religious courts with ultra-orthodox judges .
" In some places there are separate sides of the street women have to walk on . "
She says that there are signs all over some religious neighbourhoods demanding that women dress modestly .
" They throw paint and bleach at women who are n't dressed modestly and if we do n't draw a line in the sand here with this seat on a bus , then I do n't know what this country and this religion is going to look like in 20 years , " Ms Ragen said .
Petitioners like Naomi Ragen have asked Israel 's High Court to either ban the segregation buses altogether or to force bus companies to provide parallel bus routes for passengers wanting to sit where they like .
We invited readers to send in their comments .
Here is a selection :
As an American who has chosen to live in Israel , and who travels the buses all the time , I am happy to say that I am quite comfortable on any bus that I ride .
The " modesty buses " travel through the most religious neighborhoods here in Jerusalem , and by far the majority of those routes appreciate the effort .
I have found that I am always treated politely .
Mrs. Ragen has written numerous books that depict orthodox Judaism as fanatical and demeaning to women .
Just because she is outspoken does n't mean she is correct or that the overwhelming majority of women feel like she does .
Shira W. , Jerusalem , Israel
I 'm a secular student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem .
I did n't take a ride on one of these buses .
However , one time I got lost in one of those religious streets .
It was a cold day and I was covered with layers of clothes , but that did n't seem to be enough .
Every religious man who walked down the street there had to tell me something between his teeth .
I did n't understand it because it was in Yiddish .
I started to run because I was so scared ...
Einav Bury , Jerusalem , Israel
Just a few weeks ago I got on a bus to Jerusalem .
The front was all men , but I just kept walking to the back .
I then realized that it was all women , but I kept walking .
Quickly I realized that it must have been a religious group that do n't sit together .
Oops .
But I sat in the back of the bus the whole time in my shorts , tshirt and sandals .
I got looks from the women the entire time , but oh well .
Fighting the system ...
Dovid Glottier , Moshav Shdema , Israel
I ride these " modesty " buses on a daily basis .
I think the above article is lacking in a lot of information .
The main reason for the segregation came as a public backlash to overcrowded buses particularly in religious neighbourhoods .
Things came to a head when , in August 2002 a suicide bomber killed 23 passengers on a bus # 2 in the Religious Beis Yisrael neighbourhood .
The higher than usual fatalities was a result of overcrowding .
Overcrowding in this part of society means that people who lead a spiritually holy life are shoved against the hum and scrum of society .
Bear in mind , the National bus company Egged will tell you that Modesty buses are the most successful lines in the country , such as # 402 # 450 # 451 # 350 # 418 .
Aryeh , Jerusalem
I absolutely agree with Ms. Ragen ( a wonderful author ) .
The forceful behavior of orthodox Jews in some parts of Israel towards women ( non religious as well as religious and even tourists ) is appalling .
This minority group is usually backed by the government because of political allies and it has gained power in recent years .
No intervention is in sight and the only thing to do is try to hold ground , petition and keep the status quo ( segregation buses break it for the worse ) .
Israel is mostly secular and democratic and we should strive to keep it that way .
Lior Haner , Ramat Gan , Israel
I live in Israel .
I am a Hassidic man , but with a very secular outlook as far as politics are concerned .
I detest the religious involvement in purely political issues such as The Law of Return and even those that purport to uphold Jewish Law and modesty , for I am a firm believer in the unalienable right of the individual to decide .
However , what is not stressed in your article is that those buses run IN ADDITION to other , non-segregated buses on the same routes .
The incidents in your articles are of people who happened to miss the so called secular buses , or chose those buses for other reasons .

Outline
0. Prologue
This living hypertext is a systematic summary of the knowledge attained by human civilization .
For each subdivision of human knowledge , the text identifies its fundamental concepts , principles , mysteries , and misunderstandings .
Status .
This draft contains
a complete section on philosophy ;
a complete section on futurology ;
partially complete sections on logic and physics ;
a complete section on economics ;
some notes and tables on astronomy , biology , political science , linguistics , and history ;
over 1500 internal hypertext links .
Copyright .
This text is the copyrighted property of the author .
Certain forms of copying are permitted and even encouraged ; see the Copyright section for details .
Positions
This text aims to assert humanity 's analyses and theories that are most valid ( i.e. convincing and defensible , as opposed to merely logically well - formed ) .
These analyses and theories are not necessarily the most widely - believed or well - known .
Potentially contentious assertions are
biological evolutionism , and technological optimism .
Relatively uncontentious assertions appear as normal text .
Potentially contentious assertions appear like this .
Denials of widely - held beliefs appear like this .
Questions whose answers lie outside human knowledge appear like this .
Innovations
Almost all of the facts and analyses asserted in this text have of course been asserted before by other humans .
Nevertheless , there are some things in this text that the author believes may be novel or at least independently original .
Arrangements .
The text places various unoriginal pieces of information into some arrangements that might not have been presented elsewhere before .
Among these are
a list of humanity 's most important questions ;
a list of humanity 's most important unanswered questions ;
a taxonomy of paranormal phenomena ;
a summary of arguments against Christianity ;
a synopsis of where and how fast Earth is heading in space ;
lists of major biological and historical advances ;
summaries of the platforms of the major American political parties ; and
an extension of the classical Libertarian 2D map of political space .
Analyses .
The text gives certain analyses and definitions that , while not wildly original , are nevertheless believed by the author to be improvements on any he had seen before .
Among these are
Inventions .
The text presents a few notions that may be wholly new .
They are
the idea of memeware ;
the idea that without quantum indeterminacy one could in principle store unlimited amounts of information within a finite medium ;
the idea that the question " why is there something rather than nothing ? " might be answered by a combination of anthropic reasoning and the observation that it is not possible for nothing to be possible .
Predictions .
The section on Futurology collects , filters , and refines many predictions by other humans , but also makes predictions that the author has never seen clearly stated by anyone else .
They are predictions of
Judgments .
The author naturally hopes that the most significant innovation of this text is the judgments it makes and the worldview it synthesizes them into .
The text asserts a worldview it calls autocosmology that includes by endorsement the positions of positivism , empiricism , functionalism , atheism , capitalism , federalism , evolutionism , and evolutionary psychology .
The text also advances as part of autocosmology some slightly customized versions of other positions .
They are
a materialist ontology that attempts to build from logic to events to causality to existence ;
an extropian axiology that values life and intelligence and the autonomy needed to increase them ;
a libertarian ethics that recognizes all persons ' right to life and liberty , and all beings ' right not to suffer torture or extinction ;
a libertarian political philosophy that sharply defines the duties , powers , and limits of the state ; and
a futuristic optimism that predicts increasing liberty and prosperity and decreasing ignorance and superstition .
This text aims to survey the foundations and limits of the knowledge attained by humanity since the dawn of civilization .
It
the time when it was attained ;
the place where it was attained ;
the techniques with which it was attained ;
the domain to which it applies ;
the purposes for which it is used ;
the names of its topics ;
the thinkers who created it ;
the writings that first recorded it .
Science is about truth that is not necessary but rather contingent , because it is based on actual observations and inductions about regular or pattern - following phenomena in the universe .
The truths of science should be agreed upon by any thinkers in the universe that observe the same regular phenomena .
The most interesting known phenomena in the universe are those concerning persons , and so science is divided accordingly .
Natural science studies regular phenomena that do not necessarily involve persons and thus are likely to be universal ( although many details of terrestrial life science are inevitably parochial ) .
Technology applies mathematics and science toward accomplishing goals .
Technological principles are likely to coincide wherever in the universe there are thinkers dealing with similar phenomena and desiring similar goals .
Social sciences strive to induce truths that would apply to any kind of person anywhere in the universe , but this is not always possible because humans know of only one kind of person : humans .
Most parochial of all would be topics relating to human arts and leisure , which this text excludes as not involving fundamental knowledge .
0.5 . Prologue / Questions Asked
Students could use it to gauge how much they have left to learn , and how a given piece of knowledge fits in with all the rest .
Teachers could use it to show the relationships among the various parts of human knowledge .
It could also help them audit how well their course plans cover fundamentals , and help them prepare tests for achievement of basic understanding .
Colleges could use it as a model report required to be written by graduating students .
Educated people could use it to help correct any areas of forgetfulness , incompleteness , or obsolescence in their education .
People building systems of knowledge or opinion could use it as an example of how to address the important and fundamental areas of human knowledge .
Investigators could use its compilation of mysteries to choose a research area available for important contribution .
Present - day futurists could consider it as a worldview toward which humanity might be moving .
Future historians could use it to understand what was known and believed in these times .
Humans from outside of Western culture could use it to help understand Western thinking .
Engineers could upload it to help populate the knowledge base for a potential artificial intelligence .
Archivists could store it to help safeguard human knowledge against catastrophes that might threaten human civilization .
Persons from outside human civilization -- such as extraterrestrials -- could use it to evaluate the state of human knowledge and ignorance .
Persons ( such as psychics , spiritualists , and alien abductees ) allegedly in contact with non-human intelligence could authenticate their claims by answering some of humanity 's unanswered questions listed in it .

The number of possible valid human knowledge summaries no longer than this text is immense but finite .
This text is certainly far from being the best possible such summary .
If the goal of approaching such an optimal summary is worthwhile , then an effective method might be to first produce a suboptimal summary and then to continually correct it or replace it outright with better ones .
Thus corrections and replacements of this text are welcome .
At the end of this text is a list of some of the references used in writing it .
Because this text attempts to say so much , it contains few references for particular statements .
The text tries to explain or justify some of its statements , but most it merely asserts , due to space constraints .
Words in single - quotes are being mentioned rather than used .
( ' Ten ' is a word , while ten is a number . )
Words in double - quotes are being used verbatim from some source .
Words in italics are being used with emphasis .
Words in bold and used at the beginning of a sentence are being defined .
Some will find parts of this compendium uninteresting .
The author hopes the text will reawaken their childhood curiosity about the big questions , and tap their adult capacity for marvel at what humanity knows and does not know .
Aristotle or Newton would probably each have given his right eye for access to the knowledge that most modern humans choose to ignore .
Some will note that while the author is known for his sense of humor , there is no humor in this text .
The author believes that humor would be inappropriate in what is essentially a reference work .
There are probably funny lexicographers , but you would n't know it by reading a dictionary .
Some will say this text has too many definitions and reads like a dictionary .
A large part of knowledge is indeed analysis : the carving of nature at the joints .
Some will say this text has too few definitions , in that it uses too many academic or obscure words .
For the sake of brevity , this text indeed takes full advantage of the vocabulary of English .
Some will regard the text as grandiose or presumptuous .
An assertive summary of human knowledge is necessarily grand in scope and must presume to make judgments .
However , the reader should not mistake terseness for any claim to authority or certitude .
Some will not like the way the text organizes and partitions knowledge .
There are many useful ways to organize knowledge , but a linear text can only choose one .
Some will quibble with the relative emphasis the text gives to certain subjects .
A text this broad must give incomplete treatment to any topic it covers .
Some will argue that the text offers few new ideas .
The text strives for truth and not mere novelty .
Few ( if any ) of the ideas in this text may be original , but their systematic assertion may be unprecedented .
Some will consider the text simplistic .
As long as it is appropriately categorical and not false or misleading , simplicity will be its virtue and not its vice .
Some will note that the text does not justify many of its assertions .
Indeed , this text necessarily devotes its space to conclusions rather than demonstrations , describing the destination and not the path .
Some will disagree with the text 's assertions .
Reality and history will determine which assertions are true and which are not .
The truths advanced in this text may not find widespread acknowledgment in the author 's lifetime .
But as these truths prevail over the third millennium 's first century or two , historians will have trouble ( as did the author ) finding a prior exposition of the emerging worldview that the text identifies and summarizes .
Some will claim that no valid summary of human knowledge is possible , and that knowledge is subjective to the knower or relative to the context .
Such mysticism and cynical relativism can be refuted only by the objective regularity of the universe itself .
This objective regularity is the reason why science works .
Some will question the authority or motivation of the author .
Indeed , the qualifications and intentions of an author should never be exempt from questioning .
However , the truth or falsity of each ( non-self - referential ) statement in the text is nevertheless independent of who wrote it , no matter how hard some might wish otherwise .
Some will say that this text , so full of second - hand facts and personal judgments , is and will be of no importance .
They likely are correct about the text , but not about the worldview it identifies and summarizes .
1. Philosophy
Metaphysics : the study of ultimate reality .
Epistemology : the study of knowledge .
Axiology : the study of values .
Necessary Questions
Philosophy asks the questions :
What is existing ?
What is knowing ?
What is good ?
The first two questions face anyone who cares to distinguish the real from the unreal and the true from the false .
The third question faces anyone who makes any decisions at all , and even not deciding is itself a decision .
Thus all persons practice philosophy whether they know it or not .
What is existing ?
Reality consists ultimately of matter and energy and their fundamentally lawlike and unwilled relations in space - time .
To exist is to have a causal relationship with the rest of the universe .
The universe is the maximal set of circumstancesthat includes this statement and no subset of which is causally unrelated to the remainder .
Humans do not know why the universe exists or what it is for .
The universe operates without supernatural intervention and according to lawlike regularities that can be understood through empirical investigation and without special intuition .
Humans have no credible evidence of any supernatural agency or unity .
Humans have no credible evidence that any minds enjoy eternal existence .
What is knowing ?
Knowledge is justified true belief .
Truth is logical and parsimonious consistency with evidence and with other truth .
Meaning is the context - sensitive connotation ultimately established by relevant denotation and use .
All synthetic propositions ( including this one ) can only be known from experience and are subject to doubt .
A synthetic statement is propositionally meaningless if it is in principle neither falsifiable nor verifiable .
A mind is any volitional conscious faculty for perception and cognition .
Minds and ideas consist ultimately of matter .
Mental states are functional states consisting of causal relations among components for processing information .
Consciousness is awareness of self and environment .
Intelligence is the ability to make , test , and apply inductions about perceptions of self and world .
There are no forms of reasoning or kinds of knowledge that are in principle inaccessible to regular intelligence .
What is good ?
As autonomous living intellects , we persons value intelligence and life and the autonomy they need to flourish .
A person is any intelligent being with significant volitional control over how it affects other beings .
All persons have the right to life and liberty .
All beings have the right not to suffer torture or extinction .
Liberty is volition in the absence of aggression .
Aggression consists essentially of 1 ) coercion or 2 ) damage to a person 's body , property , or rightful resources .
Coercion is compulsion of one person by another through force or threat of aggression .
Justice is the minimization , reversal and punishment of aggression .
The purpose of the state is to effect justice , provide aid and sustenance to persons in mortal danger , protect species in danger of extinction , and prevent torture .
Autocosmology is a synthesis of metaphysical naturalism , ontological materialism , epistemological empiricism and positivism , mental functionalism , theological atheism , axiological extropianism , political libertarianism , economic capitalism , constitutional federalism , biological evolutionism , evolutionary psychology , and technological optimism .
Autocosmology is the worldview asserted by this text .

Skepticism succeeds by exempting nothing from questioning , while cynicism fails by exempting no answer from disbelief .
Darwin made faith essentially indefensible among Western philosophers .
Modern Western philosophy is broadly divided into two traditions , each of which starts with skepticism and takes it to a certain extreme .
Analytic philosophy is popular in English - speaking nations and focuses on logical and linguistic clarification .
The Analytic tradition has spawned two major schools :

The Analytic tradition has spawned two major schools : Logical Positivism is an analytic school holding that meaningful propositions must be either logically provable or empirically verifiable , and that propositions about metaphysics and ethics are therefore nonsensical or at best emotional .

Ordinary Language Analysis ( or Oxford philosophy ) is an analytic school holding that the meaning of propositions lies in how their constituent terms are used in ordinary language .

Continental philosophy is popular in France and Germany and attempts to directly confront human existence and ethical freedom without any preconceived notions or categories .

Critical Theory ( or the Frankfurt School ) is a Continental school that uses Marxist and Hegelian theory to question the social structures underlying traditional rationality .
Analytic philosophy takes skepticism to an extreme by saying that philosophy is only about necessary answers ( logic and mathematics ) and not necessary questions ( metaphysics and axiology ) .
Continental philosophy fails by turning methodological skepticism into mysticism ( Phenomenology , Existentialism ) and cynical relativism ( Deconstructionism , Critical Theory ) .
Ontology : the study of being .
Theology : the study of universal being and knowing .
Reality
Reality is everything that exists .
Reality consists ultimately of matter and energy and their fundamentally lawlike and unwilled relations in space - time .

Atheism is the thesis that supernatural agency does not exist .
is the thesis that supernatural agency does not exist .
Agnosticism is the thesis that one does not or cannot know whether supernatural agency exists .
Fideists usually believe in theism or deism .
Theism stems from the human propensity to take any mysterious phenomenon as an indication of supernatural intentionality .
Primitive humans invented supernatural explanations for :
the daily cycle of the Sun ; the motions of the Moon and planets ;
the seasons ; rivers , currents , winds , thunder , lightning , precipitation and drought ;
the genesis , design , and diversity of life ; success in farming and hunting ;
the human mind ; evil , misfortune , disease , pestilence , war , and death .
However , the Scientific Revolution had established by the middle 1800s that physics , chemistry , astronomy , meteorology , and physiology could be understood in naturalistic terms .
Supernatural explanations still seemed necessary for the origin and mechanism of life and mind , and for the origin of the universe itself .
In the subsequent century , science outlined the basic answers for these questions , and theism began to be abandoned by serious thinkers .
Always hoping that the gaps in scientific knowledge are about to miraculously stop shrinking , some fideists clung to a theism based on an increasingly irrelevant " God of the gaps " .
Deists retreat directly to the last trench , and use God only to answer the question of why there is something rather than nothing .
Deism is unparsimonious , because it cannot answer the question of why there is God rather than not God .
Mystics usually believe in pantheism or outright idealism .
Pantheism and Idealism are incorrect because they too are unparsimonious .
They infer spiritual aspects of reality from psychological phenomena that can be explained more parsimoniously in materialist terms .
Skeptics usually believe in naturalism .
The varieties of naturalism differ primarily according to their explanation of how matter relates to mind .
While naturalists do not know why the universe exists , there is no credible evidence or convincing argument that its existence implies supernatural agency .
Parsimony demands that supernatural agency be held not to exist until shown otherwise .
Agnosticism constitutes either ignorance of this demand , or a redundant restatement of the principle that synthetic propositions are subject to doubt .

Humans have no credible evidence for these phenomena .
Over time these phenomena will recognized as delusions , hysteria , myths , nonsense , and hoaxes .
Understanding of reality and existence is built up according to experience from elements provided by logic : terms , their properties and relations , and the attributions and inferences that can be made among them .
From these can be derived the ontological notions of causality , existence , time , identity , and space .
Causality
A circumstance is a set of terms and their fixed properties and relations that as a whole can be distinguished from other such sets and identified with itself .
A change is a relation between an ordered pair of distinguishable circumstances and is defined by the two circumstances that it relates .
An effect is a change that can be attributed .
A cause is that to which an effect can be attributed in whole or in part .
An influence is that to which an effect can be only partly attributed .
Attribution is a fundamental concept that underlies the notions of both ontological causality and logical properties .
A necessary cause is one which can be inferred from the effect .
A sufficient cause is one from which the corresponding effect can be inferred .
To determine is to be the necessary and sufficient cause for .
Possibility is the property of not being contradicted by any inference .
Logical possibility is the property of not contradicting the laws of logic .
Physical possibility is the property of not contradicting the laws of nature .
Is causality an illusion ?
Does every effect have a cause , or do some effects have no cause ?
Can there be a cycle of causality , in which an effect both precedes and contributes to its cause ?
Can one know the answers to these questions ?
Existence
The universe is the maximal set of circumstances that includes this statement and no subset of which is causally unrelated to the remainder .
To exist is to have a causal relationship with the rest of the universe .
An entity is any term that exists .
Two circumstances are causally unrelated if neither could ever influence the other .
It is unparsimonious to say other universes exist .
One could imagine a set of circumstances causally unrelated to the maximal set that includes this sentence , and could choose to consider it a separate universe .
But to say those imagined circumstances " exist " is to cheapen existence from causal reality to mere imaginability .
An imagining does not establish the existence of the thing imagined .
Why is there something rather than nothing ?
Is there an objective purpose for that which exists ?
How could one recognize an answer to these questions ?
Are these questions meaningless ?
Humans do not know why there is something rather than nothing , or if the question is even meaningful .
If this question has a parsimonious answer , it must consist in a self - explaining fact or cycle of facts .
A candidate for such a fact would be the concept of God in the Ontological Proof , but that proof is not convincing .
Humans do not know any such fact ( s ) , or even if they could possibly exist .
If it is asserted that non-existence is more likely or natural than existence , one could ask why this asserted tendency ( toward non-existence ) itself exists .
A possibly meaningful ( but unparsimonious ) answer to the Ultimate Why is that the universe exists ( more precisely , is perceived to exist ) roughly because it is possible .
The reasoning would be as follows .
Absolute impossibility -- the state of affairs in which nothing is possible -- is itself not possible , because if nothing truly were possible , then absolute impossibility would not be possible , implying that at least something must be possible .
But if at least one thing is possible , then it seems the universe we perceive should be no less possible than anything else .
Now , assuming that physicalism is right and that qualia and consciousness are epiphenomena , then the phenomenology of a mind and its perfect simulation are identical .
So whether the universe we perceive existed or not , it as a merely possible universe would be perceived by its merely possible inhabitants no differently than our actual universe is perceived by its actual inhabitants .
By analogy , the thoughts and perceptions of a particular artificial intelligence in a simulated universe would be the same across identical " runs " of the simulation , regardless of whether we bothered to initiate such a " run " once , twice -- or never .
Thus , the universe might merely be the undreamed possible dream of no particular dreamer .
Time
An event is a change that cannot interestingly be subdivided into constituent changes .
Time is the ordering of events according to the potential of some events to causally influence other events .
If ( as in this universe ) causal influence propagates through space only at finite speed , then some events can be far enough apart in space as to be in principle unable to influence each other .
In this case time is a partial order on events instead of a total order .
An instant is a point on a linear continuum onto which events have been associated in a particular reference frame according to their order in time .
Duration is a measure of the separation between two instants in time determined by counting intervening events of the kind that recur in proportional numbers to each other .
Examples of such events are the swings of a pendulum or the vibrations of an atom .
Eternity is an entire linear continuum of instants .
Thus by definition there is between any two instants another instant .
However , it is not necessary that between any two events there is another event .
Nor is it necessary that there be a first event , even if the past is of finite duration .
Just as there is no smallest positive real number , there might be no first event , because there might be no event associated with a first instant ( t=0 ) .
Instants are mathematical constructs that do not always have an associated actual event .
The future is , from the perspective of a particular event , the set of all events that the event potentially influences .
The past is , from the perspective of a particular event , the set of all events by which the event is potentially influenced .
The present is , from the perspective of a particular event , the set of all events simultaneous with it .
Simultaneity is a relation enjoyed by two events if and only if they share identical sets of past and future events .
Hypertime .
Time is often said to pass or flow or to be moved through .
This metaphor of motion is misleading , because motion is spatial displacement over time , measured for example in meters per second .
But a ' motion of time ' measured in seconds per second is nonsensical , and so temporal displacement ' over time ' requires a notion of hypertime , measured in seconds per hyper -second .
This is no help , because hypertime too will be said to flow -- through hyper - hypertime .
There is no reason to posit an absolute or universal or extra-temporal or distinguished present that flows or passes or marches and continuously turns absolutely future events into absolutely past ones .
Past , present , and future are relations with a particular event and are not absolute properties in themselves .
Changing the future .
The present can affect a future event , but it cannot " change " a future event .
An event is itself a change and time is no more than an ordering of these changes .
If changes themselves can change , these hyper - changes are hyper-events that can be ordered into hypertime .
Events cannot change over time because events are defined by their pre- and post - conditions .
To talk of different post - conditions for an event is really to talk of a different event , just as to talk of different cardinality for a number is really to talk of a different number .
This does not imply determinism , because determinism is a statement about inference and not about inevitability .
Determinism is the thesis that a sufficient knowledge of any particular set of circumstances could be used to completely infer any subsequent circumstance .
Some humans take determinism to be the thesis that the future is already decided , that the present was always going to be the way it is , that statements about probability and possibility are merely statements about one 's incomplete knowledge , and that only actual possibility is that which is already inevitable .
Such a notion of ontological determinism is different from epistemic determinism only if there is a hypertime in which different points of normal time can " already " coexist .
A notion of ontological determinism that is strictly different from epistemic determinism can have no practical consequences .
As a difference that makes no difference , ontological determinism is a thesis that parsimony demands be rejected .
Adopting the thesis makes as much sense as adopting the thesis that the universe is five minutes old .
It is inconsequential -- and thus meaningless -- to say the future is already decided .
Some humans argue that if determinism is true , then no argument is to be considered valid as it is simply a train of statements following a predestined track .
First , this misconceived argument applies as well to itself as it does to any other argument .
Second , even in a deterministic system there can arise processes that tend to produce certain results .
If viable organisms can arise , reproduce , and evolve due to natural selection in a deterministic universe , then surely viable arguments can arise , reproduce , and evolve due to competition in a marketplace of ideas .
The viability of an idea or argument is closely related to its epistemological validity , and so the opposite misconception could occur : an argument might be considered more valid merely because it is at the end of so many predestined tracks .
Time Travel .
Time travel would imply the existence of either hypertime or circular causality .
Humans have no reason to think either exists .
Temporal Anisotropy .
In a short video clip showing two billiard balls bouncing off each other , forward and backward in time are indistinguishable if one ignores friction and inelasticity .
In a longer video of a billiards break , the future is the end in which the balls are no longer in a nicely ordered triangle .
If causes can be attributed to effects as easily as effects can be attributed to causes , then causal laws do not distinguish past and future , and the future for an event is the direction of increasing disorder in the system .
Traces and memories of the past are a localized increase in order at the expense of an increase in system - wide disorder .
Due to statistical considerations , some systems can cycle between order and disorder .
In such systems the direction locally considered to be future can vary over the timeline of the system .
Temporal anisotropy is not determined by the expansion of the universe , nor by the direction of electromagnetic radiation .
For electromagnetism , the attribution of influence works equally well in both time directions .
There is no inherent difference between the absorption and emission of a photon .
Boundary conditions are logically possible in which photons are set in motion without having been emitted from anything , and which converge in shrinking spheres on an anti-emitter .
Identity
A given entity is identified through time with its closest close - enough continuous - enough continuer .
A continuer is an entity which is similar to a previous entity and exists because of it .
A continuer is close enough if it retains enough of the original entity 's properties .
A continuer is closest if it retains more of the original entity 's properties than any other continuer .
A continuer is continuous enough if there is no extraordinary discontinuity in its relationship to the original entity .
Space
Do space and time have absolute existence independent of their contents ?
Or are they simply a system of relations among entities and events ?
Is there a way to answer these questions , or would any answer not make a difference ?
God
God is supernatural agency or unity , often considered necessary , perfect , timeless , omniscient , omnipotent , benevolent , and personal .
A deity is
Divinity is the property of being supernatural and sacred .
Sacredness is the property of being worthy of reverence or worship .
Humans have no credible evidence or convincing proof of any deities , including a God , Creator , First Cause , Perfect or Necessary Being .
Humans have proposed philosophical proofs of God as an alternative or supplement to historical revelation of God 's existence .
Ontological Proof .
God is the most perfect idea .
If God did not exist , then the idea of god would be imperfect in its existence , and would not be the most perfect idea .
Cosmological Proof .
All effects must have a cause , and an infinite regress of causes is impossible .
Therefore , God is the First Cause .
Teleological Proof .
The universe ( or its set of physical parameters ) is evidently designed , and therefore must have a Designer .
Anthropological Proof .
Humans have a universal sense of morality and spirituality , and the cause of this effect is God .
Mystical Proof .
God can be experienced directly .
Pascal 's Wager .
Blaise Pascal argued that it is a safer bet to incorrectly believe in God than to incorrectly disbelieve in God .
The Ontological proof assumes without evidence that ideas can exist independently of minds , or that universals can exist independently of instances , or in general that logical necessity is the same thing as ontological necessity .
The Cosmological proof is unparsimonious .
If God can be self - caused , then so can the universe .
Also , an infinite regress of causes is as logically possible as an infinite progress of effects .
The Teleological proof is undermined by unrelenting progress in reducing the number of those initial parameters and by anthropic arguments for why they should allow the development of life and intelligence .
The Anthropological proof is undermined by other , more plausible naturalistic explanations for the origin of human nature .
The Mystical proof is undermined by other , more plausible naturalistic explanations of mystical experiences .
Pascal 's
Wager provides no method for choosing among conflicting actual and possible religions , and invites one to follow false hope and blind fear rather than clear reason .
Some religions might offer some hopes ( e.g. that good behavior will be reciprocated ) that may in fact be justified ( even if on grounds other than those the religion offers ) .
But the primary hopes offered by all major religions -- of afterlife , or communion with a consequential ultimate reality -- are false .
There is no credible evidence that any such revelation has been competently attempted by any god(s ) .
Afterlife
Humans have no credible evidence of reincarnation or any kind of afterlife .
Faith
It is possible ( but unlikely ) that this epistemological belief could one day stop yielding satisfactory results .
For example , if God appeared and started violating physical laws , predicting the future , punishing infidels , and rewarding believers , then faith would suddenly be more satisfactory than skepticism .
Until such a development , skepticism continues to be more satisfactory than faith .
Faith is not simply an absence of doubt , because tautologies are beyond doubt and yet are recognized not revealed .
Faith is not simply any confident reliance on authority , because an authority can be relied upon even confidently without being held exempt from all doubt .
Faith is not simply any provisional hypothesis believed without complete evidence , because a proposition can be provisionally believed without being held exempt from all doubt .
Faith is not simply any affirmation of values , because to affirm a value is not to posit a proposition but to make a valuation .
Faith is belief based on revelation and exempt from doubt .
Fideists often say skeptics too have " faith " in science or reason , but this corrupts the definition of ' faith ' .
Faith must be embarrassing if its only defense is the claim that everybody is guilty of it .
Origin of faith .
Humans ' propensity for faith derives perhaps from their dependence on teaching by parents and society .
In the absence of a biological mechanism for offspring to inherit knowledge directly , a predisposition for unquestioning belief in authority might help spare each generation from having to rediscover or verify everything .
Mysticism
Mysticism is belief base on private and direct experience of ultimate reality .
Mysticism holds that belief can be justified simply by the intensity or directness of an experience , and without a showing that the experience has any objective basis or consequences .
Rejecting objectivity and the distinction between the experiencer and the experienced , mysticism thus mistakes feeling for knowing .
Mystics are forever free to claim that anyone who does n't feel what they feel is somehow " doing it wrong " .
The conclusions of mysticism are usually unfalsifiable or inconsequential and thus propositionally meaningless .
Some mystics compare meditation to advanced mathematics and claim that both yield conclusions that can only be verified by adept practitioners .
This claim is misleading .
It is true that creating and even comprehending advanced mathematical conclusions usually requires specialized training .
But all mathematical demonstration is by definition subject to verification through mechanical symbol manipulation .
This symbol manipulation is not necessarily private or " interior " like the experience of a mystic , but is expressly public and exterior .
Origin of mysticism .
Humans ' propensity for mysticism derives perhaps from their nature as intelligent social animals who survive by detecting patterns and especially intentions in an environment dominated by their social interactions .
Humans appear biased to see intentionality not only in friends , foes , predators , and prey , but also in weather , the heavens , or the universe itself .
This bias is perhaps related to the general human tendency ( known in psychology as the Fundamental Attribution Error ) to incorrectly emphasize intentional explanations over situational or circumstantial ones .
Religion
Religion is any system of belief based on faith or mysticism ,
Science and Religion .
A common misconception is that science might be an alternative to religion for answering questions about meaning and value .
Those questions are the domain of philosophy , whereas science deals with objective phenomena .
Science depends on the epistemological principle of skepticism , and any " conflict " between science and religion is really a conflict between skepticism and faith ( or mysticism ) .
Religion can be made superficially compatible with science by restricting itself to questions that are a ) scientific but unanswered or b ) philosophical .
However , faith - or mysticism - based religion can never be compatible with the skepticism on which science -- and all epistemologically valid philosophy -- is built .

Fideisms
BCE
BCE
Zoroastrianism is the Persian monotheistic fideist religion founded by Zarathustra ( c628 -c551 BCE ) and which teaches that good must be chosen over evil in order to achieve salvation .
Christianity is the West Eurasian monotheistic fideist religion professing that Jesus of Nazareth ( c6 BCE - c30 AD ) is the descendent of Abraham and the Son of God whose sacrifice for humanity 's sins was recorded in the New Testament ( c50-100 ) , and who fulfilled the prophecies of the divinely inspired Old Testament .
Islam is the Middle Eastern monotheistic fideist religion professing surrender to the will of Allah ( God ) , whose revelations in the Old and New Testaments were superseded by the Koran revealed to Muhammad ( c570 - 632-06 ) for his chosen people , the children of Abraham 's son Ishmael ( c1800 BCE ) .
Sikhism is the Punjab monotheistic fideist religion founded by Guru Nanak ( 1469 - 1539 ) and whose sacred Adi Granth ( 1604 ) overlays a spartan righteousness onto Hindu cyclical cosmology .
These religions place unwarranted faith in purported revelations for which there is no credible evidence of authenticity or validity .
Mysticisms
BCE
Taoism is the Chinese polytheistic mystical religion based on the Tao - Te - Ching ascribed to Lao Tzu ( c550 BCE ) and which advocates a path ( tao ) of minimalist serenity and reverence for various deities .
Shintoism is the Japanese polytheistic mystical religion involving mainly the observance of customs and festivals honoring various deities .
Jainism is the Indian pantheist mystical religion founded by Mahavira ( 599 - 527 BCE ) and which blends monastic asceticism with Buddhist cyclical cosmology .
Buddhism is the East Asian nontheistic mystical religion founded in India c525 BCE by the Buddha , who taught that existence is cyclical suffering caused by desiring and can be overcome by the " eightfold path " of right thought and deed .
Confucianism is the Chinese nontheistic mystical religion based on the sayings of Confucius ( c500 BCE ) recorded in the Analects , and which teaches social order , scholarship , filial reverence for family and ancestors , and divination .
These religions posit entities ( such as gods or spirits or forces ) to explain subjective mystical experiences which have simpler naturalistic explanations .
These religions allege phenomena ( such as rebirth and divination ) for which there is no credible evidence .
Of the belief systems in the world that currently have mass followings , Buddhism and Confucianism ) are the least misguided .
For this reason , thet are attractive to Westerners who recognize the bankruptcy of revelation - based religion but who are still looking for an off - the - rack worldview rather than learning enough philosophy to assemble one themselves .
Evidence For Christianity
Since Christianity is the most prevalent belief system among humans , it deserves special attention .
The best evidence for the Christian doctrine of a divine Jesus is :
Epistles c.50-60CE
Paul 's letters broadly confirm the teachings and miracles of Jesus , and specifically his resurrection [ 1 Cor 15 ] .
Gospels c.60-90CE
The veracity of the gospel accounts is supported by their mutual aggreement and their inclusion of embarrassing and vivid details .
The gospels are unanimously persuasive that Jesus died , and report many vivid accounts of encounters with the risen Jesus .
The gospels describe in vivid detail Jesus ' miracles ( many healings , three reanimations , etc. ) and their acceptance throughout Judea and Galilee .
Extra-biblical evidence
The 1st - century Jewish historian Josephus confirms the historicity of Jesus by mentioning him as the brother of the martyred James .
Non-Christian writers like Josephus and Celsus agree that Jesus was known for his " feats " and " wonders " .
Christianity as a movement survived even in Palestine among the people who would have had the best available opportunity for refuting its claims .
Arguments Against Christianity
There are at least eight insurmountable problems within the extant evidence that each independently refute the
Christian doctrine of a divine Jesus
:
Jesus ' endorsement of the murderous immorality of Yahweh in the Torah ;
Jesus ' doctrine of " eternal punishment " in the " eternal fire " of Hell ;
Jesus ' failure to claim actual divinity ;
Jesus ' failed prophecy of his imminent return ;
Jesus ' failure to competently reveal his doctrines ( concerning e.g. salvation , hell , divorce , circumcision , and diet ) in his own written account or that of an eyewitness ;
Jesus ' failure to perform miracles the accounts of which cannot be so easily explained as faith - healing , misinterpretation , exaggeration , and embellishment ;
Jesus ' failure to attract significant notice ( much less endorsement ) in the only detailed contemporaneous history of first - century Palestine ;
Jesus ' failure to recruit
anyone from his family ,
any acquaintance from before his baptism ,
a majority of Palestinian Jews , and even
some of those who heard his words and witnessed his alleged miracles .
An omnipotent omniscience benevolent deity competently attempting a revelation would have foreseen and corrected all of these problems .
The existence of any one of them implies that Christian doctrine is false .
The reasons
not to believe the Christian doctrine of a divine Jesus can be divided into four categories :
the alternative naturalistic explanations of the existing evidence ;
the missing evidence needed to prove such divinity ;
the implausibility of such divine activity ; and
the cascading implications of accepting such evidence .
In addition , the Christian gospels themselves are suspect because of their sources , contradictions , and apologetics .
Naturalistic explanations .
Jesus of Nazareth was a faith healer and self - proclaimed divinely - special savior who tried to reform his native Jewish religion .
However , the evidence about Jesus is less likely to have resulted from divinity than from misinterpretation , exaggeration , rationalization , delusion , deception , and mythologizing .
Indeed , perhaps the greatest weakness of the claims for Jesus ' divinity is the gospels ' reliance on and vouching for the Old Testament , a patchwork of folklore , legends and myths about a tribe whose patriarch Abraham turned to monotheism because of fertility problems .
Jesus was a Jewish prophet who affirmed Jewish law [ Mt 5:17 - 18 ; Lk 2:27,39 ; Jn 10:35 ] , observed the Jewish calendar [ Lk 4:16 , Mt 24:20 ] , and preached about the God of Israel [ e.g. Mk 12:29 ] in Jewish synagogues [ Mk 1:21 , 1:39 , 6:2 ; Mt 4:23 , 9:35 , 13:54 ; Lk 4:15 , 4:44 , 6:6 , 13:10 , 19:47 ; Jn 6:59 , 18:20 ] exclusively for Jews [ Mt 10:5 , Mt 15:24 ] .
Jesus no doubt echoed the Torah theme that " all nations " would witness the majesty of Israel 's God , but his only command to actually convert and baptize " all nations " is in a post - Easter speech alleged only in one gospel [ Mt 28:19 ] ( and in an appendix later added to Mark [ 16:15 ] ) .
Miracles .
In the gospels Jesus heals the sick ( possession , blindness , skin disorder , bleeding , fever , paralysis , withered hand ) , revives the recently deceased , calms a storm , multiplies food , and walks on water .
The miracles ascribed to Jesus seem not to have been very convincing [ Mt 11:20 , Lk 10:13 , Jn 6:66 , 10:32 , 12:37 , 15:24 ] , and seem explainable by a combination of conventional faith healing , exaggeration , and mythologizing .
The three people Jesus allegedly reanimates [ Mk 5/Lk 8 ; Lk 7 ; Jn 11 ] might not actually have been clinically dead , and the gospels report not a single indication supporting such a diagnosis .
Any cases of blindness , paralysis , or demonic possession cured by Jesus could have been psychogenic .
Jesus apparently admits [ Lk 11:24 - 26 ] that his cures for demonic possession are often not permanent , and in the synoptic gospels there is only one mention [ Mt 21:14 ] of a cure being performed in Jerusalem .
The one case of congenital blindness is recorded as disputed , and only in the latest gospel [ Jn 9 ] .
God ?
The Christian doctrine of the " trinity " , attempting to reconcile Jewish monotheism with Jesus ' self - revelation , holds that Jesus 1 ) is both fully human and fully divine , and 2 ) is God ( in a different " person " ) .
The former is a contradiction , and the latter has no scriptural basis .
In the gospels Jesus never claims identity with God or even explicit divinity , but rather a divinely special status as " the Son of God " and the " Anointed One " ( Hebrew : messiah ; Greek : christos ) .
Jesus repeatedly distinguishes himself from God :
Why do you call me good ?
No one is good -- except God alone .
[ Mk 10:18 , Lk 18:17 , Mt 19:17 ]
No one knows about that day or hour , not even the angels in heaven , nor the Son , but only the Father . [ Mk 13:32 ]
And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven , but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven .
[ Lk 12:10 ]
Father , if you are willing , take this cup from me ; yet not my will , but yours be done .
[ Lk 22:42 -43 ]
Father , into your hands I commit my spirit .
[ Lk 23:46 ]
the Father judges no one , but has entrusted all judgment to the Son [ Jn 5:22 ]
By myself I can do nothing ; I judge only as I hear , and my judgment is just , for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me .
[ Jn 5:30 ]
I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me .
[ Jn 8:28 ]
I came from God and now am here .
I have not come on my own ; but he sent me .
[ Jn 8:42 ]
If I glorify myself , my glory is nothing ; it is my Father who is glorifying me , of whom ye say that He is your God . [ Jn 8:54 ]
I did not speak of my own accord , but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it . [ Jn 12:49 ]
The words I say to you are not just my own .
Rather , it is the Father , living in me , who is doing his work [ Jn 14:10 ]
If you loved me , you would be glad that I am going to the Father , for the Father is greater than I . [ Jn 14:28 ]
I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me .
[ Jn 14:31 ]
Though I have been speaking figuratively , a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father . [ Jn 16:25 ]
I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf .
No , the Father himself loves you [ Jn 16:26 - 27 ]
I am returning to my Father and your Father , to my God and your God . [ Jn 20:17 ]
As the Father has sent me , I am sending you .
[ Jn 20:21 ]
When Jesus ' opponents say his assumption of authority could be interpreted as a claim of divinity , all three synoptics agree [ Mk 2:10 , Mt 9:6 , Lk 5:24 ] that Jesus merely asserted " authority on earth " , and none intimates that his accusers concluded he was affirming their accusation .
In the one instance in the gospels [ Jn 10:33 ff ] in which Jesus ' identity with God is explicitly discussed , Jesus cites a Psalm [ 82:6 ] as a precedent for his metaphor , and hastily retreats to his formulation of being " God 's Son " , adding vaguely that " the Father is in me , and I in the Father " .
However , 1 Jn 2:15 says this is true of anyone who acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God , and Jesus used the same mutual inclusion poetry about him and his disciples [ Jn 14:20 ] .
When at another time [ Jn 5:18 ff ] the Jews characterized the " Son of Man " title as " making himself equal with God " , Jesus answered not by claiming identity but by drawing distinctions :
the Son can do nothing by himself
the Father loves the Son
the Father judges no one , but has entrusted all judgment to the Son
the Father sent the Son
the Father has granted the Son to have life in him
the Father has given him authority to judge
I seek not to please myself but him who sent me
Thus Jesus retreats the only two times he is accused of claiming identity or equality with God .
In the Passion story , Jesus was mocked or accused as a faith healer , prophet , king of the Jews , Messiah , and " Son of God " [ Jn 19:7 ] -- but never as divine or as a god .
When Jesus died , onlookers are said to have exclaimed not that Jesus was God , but rather the " Son of God " [ Mat 27:54 ] .
The title of ' God ' is never reliably applied to Jesus anywhere in the New Testament .
( In many translations of 2 Pet 1:1 and Titus 2:13 , the description " God and Saviour " is seemingly applied to Jesus , but the scholarly consensus regards these two letters as late and pseudoepigraphic . )
Acts quotes [ 2:22 , 2:36 , 3:13 , 10:38 , 17:31 ]
Peter and Paul describing Jesus in terms of a man appointed to an office , but never calling him God .
The gospel authors never explicitly claim Jesus to be God , and the closest they come is the vague language of Jn 1 : " the Word was God " and " became flesh " .
John quotes Thomas exclaiming [ Jn 20 ] " my Lord and my God " , but immediately states [ 20:31 ] as a creed merely " that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God " .
The " mystery " of Jesus ' nature was hardly clarified by the Apostles [ e.g.
Phil 2:6 , Rom 1:4 , Col 1:15 , Col 2:9 ] , whose epistles never claim Jesus has any kind of identity with God .
( Christian scribes tried to change that ; cf. the differing manuscripts for Rom 9:5 , Acts 20:28 , and 1 Tim 3:16 . )
Even the alleged angelic annunciation of Jesus to his parents ommitted [ Lk 1:32 , Mt 1:20 , Mt 2:13 , Mt 2:20 ] the claim that Jesus was Yahweh incarnate .
Thus , just as Jesus failed to leave clear teachings about salvation , hell , divorce , circumcision , and diet , he also did not effect a competent revelation of who precisely he was .
Depending on e.g. various 4th - century Roman emperors , there waxed and waned such christological heresies as Ebionism , Docetism , Adoptionism , Dynamic Monarchianism , Sabellianism , Arianism , Marcionism , Apollonarianism , Nestorianism , Monophysitism , and Monothelitism .
The doublethink of the " trinity " is not found in the Bible , but instead was invented to reconcile Jewish monotheism with Jesus ' idiosyncratic Sonship claims .
" Son of God " .
Jesus seems to have been illegitmate , and to have been known to be such in his community [ Mt 1:18 - 24 , Jn 8:41 ] .
His only recorded words before his ministry concern his disobedience [ Lk 2:48,51 ] at age 12 to his mother and stepfather , whom he denied [ cf. Mt 23:9 ] by calling the Temple " my Father 's house " .
He spurned his stepfather 's trade of carpentry to take up a ministry proclaiming himself the son not of Joseph but of God.
Despite angelic revelations [ Lk 1:32 , Mt 1:20 , Mt 2:13 , Mt 2:20 ] to Mary and Joseph , Mary 's knowledge [ Lk 1:34 ] of the virgin conception , and Mary 's witness of at least one miracle [ Mk 2 ] , they ( and Jesus ' siblings ) did not believe in him [ Jn 7:5 , Mt 13:57 ] and thought him " out of his mind " [ Mk 3:21 ] , leading Jesus to repeatedly stress [ Mk 3:33 , 10:29 ; Mt 10:37 , 12:48 , 19:29 ; Lk 11:27 - 28 , 14:26 ] that one should choose God over one 's biological family .
Only on the day of his death do the gospels record a single friendly word [ Jn 19:26 ] from Jesus to his family .
Delusional Schizophrenic ?
Jesus began his ( apparently one - year ) ministry as a follower of John the Baptist ( whose embarrassing baptism of Jesus is played down or not mentioned in the later gospels ) .
In the earliest gospel ( Mark ) , Jesus never calls himself Christ / Messiah , is reluctant for his special nature to be known , and ( as he does in Matthew ) despairs on the cross .
( By contrast , in the later Luke and John , Jesus asserts he is Christ , and confidently assures a co-crucified convict of their impending ascension . )
Jesus " could not do many miracles " in his hometown [ Mk 6:5 , Mt 13:58 , Lk 4:24 ] , and he at times was considered mad by other Jews [ Jn 8:48 , 10:20 ] .
Jesus ' movement seems not to have been joined in his lifetime by a single family member or prior acquaintance , but only by strangers .
Jesus satisifed the diagnostic criteria of paranoid schizophrenia :
hallucinations : hearing or seeing God , Satan , demons , and angels ;
delusions of grandiosity : belief that he is the salvific Christ / Messiah with miraculous powers and apocalyptic foreknowledge ;
delusions of persecution : temptation by Satan ; opposition by demons ;
an insidious reduction in external relations and interests : nomadic asceticism ; estrangement from his family .
However , Jesus was not so mentally ill as to believe he was omnipotent .
The gospels say repeatedly [ Jn 7:1 , 8:59 , 11:53 - 54 , 12:36 ; Mt 12:14 - 15 , Mk 3:6-7 , Lk 13:31,33 ] that Jesus retreated from or avoided danger .
He was secretive and evasive about his special nature [ Mk 3:12 , 8:30 , 4:41 ; Lk 9:21 , 10:22 - 24 ; Mt 16:20 ; Jn 2:24 , 8:25 - 29 , 10:24-38 , 12:34 ] , and reluctant to have his powers tested [ Mk 8:12 ; Lk 11:29 , 23:8 ; Mt 4:7 , 12:39 , 16:4 ; Jn 2:18 ] .
He was likely neither liar nor lunatic , but rather a preacher , faith - healer , and apocalyptic prophet who in the months leading up to his anticipated execution came to believe he was the Jewish Messiah and even the divinely - special savior of mankind .
Resurrection .
At his death the apostles abandoned Jesus in panic , even though they should have been expecting his resurrection if they had indeed witnessed his miracles , heard his divinity claims , and heard him say at least four times [ Mk 8:31 , 10:34 ; Mat 16:21 , 17:23 , 20:19 ; Lk 9:22 , 18:33 , 24:7 , 24:46 ] that he would " rise from the dead " or be " raised to life " " on the third day " .
The New Testament accounts of the resurrection appearances develop over time from silent to vague to contradictory to fantastic .
The Empty Tomb story could have resulted from a discreet reburial or removal -- perhaps by a disciple , as in a rumor reported in Mt 28 .
Possible conspirators were Joseph of Arimathea and Mary Magdalene , a longtime disciple [ Lk 8:2 ] " out of whom [ Jesus ] had driven seven demons " [ Mk 16:9 , Lk 8:2 ] and who ( unlike any apostle ) attended both the crucifixion and entombment .
She was the first to visit the tomb on Easter [ Mt 28:1 , Jn 20:1 ] , and the possibility of removal [ Jn 20:2,14,15 ] was not unimaginable to her .
She weepingly lingered [ Jn 20:11 ] after the apostles left the empty tomb , and thereupon was the first [ Mk 16:9 , Mt 28:9 , Jn 20:14 ] to claim seeing an appearance .
The appearances were suspiciously exclusive : " He was not seen by all the people , but by witnesses whom God had already chosen " [ Acts 10:40 - 41 ]
" Why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world ? " [ Jn 14:22 ] .
Many of the " appearances " seem to have been unimpressive to the disciples who heard about them ( and should have been expecting them ) and even to those who witnessed them :
But they did not believe the women , because their words seemed to them like idle tales .
[ Lk 24:11 ]
When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him , they did not believe it .
Afterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them [ Mk 16:11 - 12 ]
These returned and reported it to the rest ; but they did not believe them either .
[ Mk 16:13 ]
When they saw him , they worshiped him ; but some doubted .
[ Mt 28:17 ]
Jesus himself came up and walked along with them ; but they were kept from recognizing him .
[ Lk 24:15 - 16 ]
she turned around and saw Jesus standing there , but she did not realize that it was Jesus .
Thinking he was the gardener , she said ... [ Jn 20:14 - 15 ]
Jesus stood on the shore , but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus . [ Jn 21:4 ]
What probably happened is that some disciples began having epiphanies , perhaps involving the occasional dream , ecstatic vision , encounter with a stranger , case of mistaken identity , or outright hallucination ( or fabrication ) .
The disciples in their desperation and zeal initially interpreted these experiences as manifestations of a triumphant and vindicated ( but not necessarily reanimated ) Jesus , who had apparently predicted that he would in some sense return or at least that his ministry would require but survive his death .
If a tomb had in fact been found empty , that does n't necessarily imply that these early manifestations were initially interpreted as experiences of a physically reanimated corpse .
The disciples might have just believed that Yahweh had “ raised ” Jesus ' body to heaven so as to not “ abandon [ it ] to the grave ” and to “ decay ” [ Ps 16:10 , cited in Acts 13:35 - 37 ] .
An empty tomb belief would greatly have helped the early epiphanic experiences be misinterpreted , exaggerated , and embellished over the subsequent half century into the reanimated corpse stories that appear only in the two oldest gospels ( Luke and John ) .
The gospels themselves give precedent for the idea of a dead person being “ raised from the dead ” [ Mk 16:14 ] by inhabiting the body of some other person currently living .
When some [ Mk 6:14 , Mk 8:28 , Mt 16:14 , Lk 9:19 ] -- including Herod [ Mk 6:16 , Mt 14:2 ] -- thought that John the Baptist had been " raised from the dead " , at least a few of these people would have known that Jesus ' body had ( like the Easter gardener 's ) been animate before the Baptist 's death .
There is no record that anyone ever considered checking the Baptist 's body ( the grave of which was known to his disciples [ Mk 6:29 , Mt 14:13 ] ) , and there is no record that anyone wondered why Jesus ' neck did not show signs of John 's earlier beheading .
Missing evidence .
A divine Jesus could trivially create new miracles to unambiguously vouch for some modern school of Christianity .
For the gospel accounts of Jesus to be believable , two kinds of evidence would have to surface :
Textual discoveries that Jesus did not believe in the literal truth of the entire Old Testament , and that the unjust Christian notion of eternal damnation is a misunderstanding .
Compelling corroboration of gospel miracles through physical artifacts ( e.g. the Shroud of Turin ) or historical records ( e.g. of the three - hour darkness on Good Friday ) .
However , available extra-scriptural records do not corroborate the gospel miracles .
Christian apologists often claim that if false , the gospel traditions would have been refuted and discredited by skeptics in 1st - century Palestine .
However , there is no indication that the Jesus movement was important enough then to merit the sort of early written debunking that would have been preserved despite skeptical apathy and Christian hostility .
Except for the stolen - body rumor denied in Mat 28 , the earliest records of anti-Christian skepticism date after the first century and are preserved mainly as excerpts in Christian rebuttals .
Celsus ( quoted by Origen ) dismissed the miracles as the " tricks of jugglers " that he said are " feats performed by those who have been taught by Egyptians " , and the Jewish slander reported by Tertullian claimed the empty tomb was faked .
The 1st - century Jewish historian Josephus is hard to count as anti-Christian , even after discounting his affirmation ( unnoticed by all of his earliest Christian commentators ) of the resurrection as an interpolation .
Josephus may have written that Jesus " performed surprising works " and even that Jesus was believed to have been resurrected , but the ( possibly interpolated ) mention is only in passing .
Josephus devotes more space each to John the Baptist and James , and while reporting much minutiae over the entire period during which Jesus lived , does not mention :
the Christmas Star that disturbed Herod and " all Jerusalem " [ Mt 2:3 ] , Herod 's massacre [ Mt 2:16 ] , Jesus ' triumphal entry into Jerusalem [ Mt 21:8 - 11 ] , the Good Friday earthquake [ Mt 27:51 ] , the Good Friday resurrectees that " appeared to many people " in Jerusalem [ Mt 27:53 ] , or the Good Friday 3 - hour darkness " over all the land " [ Mk 15:33 , Lk 23:44 , Mt 27:45 ] .
These events in fact went unnoticed by every non-Christian writer , including the historians Seneca and Pliny the Elder .
Contrast this with the supernova of 1006CE that was noted in China , Egypt , Iraq , Italy , Japan , and Switzerland .
( Syncellus quotes a lost text of the Christian historian Julius Africanus which itself cites a lost text by Thallus : " Thallus calls this darkness an eclipse " .
The identification of Thallus ' eclipse with " this darkness " might just be in the mind of Julius Africanus , and Thallus at any rate cannot be reliably dated as writing independently of the gospels . )
The Alexandrian philosopher and commentator Philo outlived Jesus by 15 or 20 years , and as a visitor to Jerusalem should have met witnesses to the Easter miracles .
His silence suggests that Jesus and his followers did not make the early impression that they should have if the gospels were true .
Implausibility .
The gospel story o f a secretive unpublished family - resenting bastard faith healer in the rural outback of a peripheral province of a regional empire seems an u nlikely self - revelation for the omnipotent , omniscient , omnibenevolent Creator of the universe :
Why such ambiguous and picayune miracles ?
Why not raise a new mountain in the desert , or install a new star in the heavens ?
Why such vague and equivocal claims of divinity ?
Why after his resurrection appear so ambiguously , so briefly , and to only his disciples ?
Why not -- after perhaps a more convincing execution , e.g. beheading -- march back to Pilate and Herod and ascend in front of Jerusalem assembled ?
Why not write his revelation himself , and ensure that it survive in perfect copies ?
Why not include in it indisputible authentication , e.g. by predicting a fundamental physical constant ?
The God of the Torah 's holy scrolls is far too pedestrian in his works , parochial in his concerns , petty in his decisions , and primitive in his policies .
Works .
In the gospels Jesus heals the sick , revives the recently deceased , calms a storm , walks on water , and multiplies food .
The god of the Torah makes appearances , speeches , promises , and predictions ; raises the dead ; and takes credit for various plagues , fires , floods , astronomical events , victories , healings , and deaths .
It is implausible that the Creator 's works would be so confined to ancient times and so apparently constrained by ancient imaginations .
Concerns .
After creating billions of galaxies in Genesis , the god of the Torah is implausibly obsessed with the family of Abraham and the Jordan valley where they live .
It seems implausible that an omnibenevolent , omniscient , infallible deity would entrust a few fallible men in a backward corner of the world with such paltry evidence and then demand that everyone else either hear and believe them or suffer eternal damnation .
Decisions .
In the gospels Jesus damns entire towns [ Mt 11:23 ] , compares non-Israelites to dogs [ Mt 15:26 ] , and affirms even " the smallest letter " [ Mt 5:18 , Jn 10:35 ] of the Torah .
The god of the Torah tests and torments his followers , commits mass murders of e.g .
Noah 's flood victims [ Gen 6:7 , 7:21 ] and the firstborn sons of Egypt [ Ex 12:29 ] , creates linguistic division for fear of an ancient construction project [ Gen 11:6 ] , and curses mankind because Adam dared to " become like one of us , knowing good and evil " [ Gen 3:22 ] .
It is implausible that the Creator of the universe would be so petty and wicked .
Policies .
The god of the Torah promotes or demands extravagant worship , dietary taboos , animal sacrifice , repressive sexual codes , human mutilation , monarchy , subjugation of women , slavery , human sacrifice [ Lev 27:29 , Jud 11:30 - 39 , cf. Heb 11:17 , Jam 2:21 ] , and mass murder of even infants [ Gen 6:7 , 7:21 , Ex 11:5 , 12:29 , 1 Sam 15:3 , cf. Heb 11:7,28 ] .
In the gospels Jesus affirms the Torah [ Mt 5:18 , Jn 10:35 ] , endorses the murderous flood of Noah [ Mt 24:38 , Lk 17:27 ] , and promises sinners not a thousand years ' unrelenting torture , nor a million or a billion , but an eternity of excruciating torture by fire [ Mk 9:43 , Mt 18:8 , 25:41 , 25:46 ] .
It is implausible that a competent and benevolent deity would in his revelation allow the endorsement of such heinous crimes and evil policies .
Cascading implications .
If the existing evidence about Jesus of Nazareth is considered a convincing proof of his divinity , then many other things can be proven with similar evidence .
Miracles were reported commonly in ancient times and are attested in many other religions .
Christians might argue that competing miracles were wrought by demons , but those very miracles could be used by a competing religion to justify the same claim about Jesus ' miracles .
Martyrs have been common throughout human history .
If dying for a belief can show the belief is true , then the kamikazes of Japan showed that Emperor Hirohito was divine .
Note that Peter and James are the only alleged resurrection witnesses who the New Testament names ( John 21:18,19 , Acts 12:2 ) as martyrs , but there is no evidence that recanting their alleged belief in physical resurrection could have saved them .
They probably just died for their very sincere belief in some Easter - related experiences that they interpreted as evidence of a triumphant and vindicated Jesus .
All other Christian martyrs died for what they were told about the alleged resurrection and not for what they witnessed about it .
Prophecies .
No non-trivial prophecy in the Bible has both a ) been documented as having been made before the predicted event and b ) had its fulfillment documented independently of the Bible itself .
If self - fulfilling prophecy is considered valid , then for example the Book of Mormon is a valid prophetic text .
Gospel sources .
The gospels were stitched together decades after the crucifixion by non-eyewitness zealots freely borrowing from oral traditions and now - lost earlier texts .
Other gospels .
At least a dozen other gospels ( e.g. of Thomas and Peter ) are known from whole texts , fragments , and ancient references , but were not deemed by the early Christians to be divinely inspired .
Differing manuscripts show that the gospels have undergone insertions , deletions , additions , and revisions .
Copying .
Matthew and Luke are based in part on copying from Mark and in part apparently on a now - lost earlier compilation of Jesus sayings .
Anonymity , Contemporaneity .
The gospels were written 35 - 60 years after Jesus ' death , and ( unlike every other intact work of classical nonfiction ) no authors are identified in the earliest copies .
Only about a century later did the gospels become associated with the names of their alleged authors .
Writing extensively twenty years after Jesus ' death , Paul gives no hint that any gospel had yet been written down .
Mark was written c.65-70 by an unknown author who later church tradition said was an associate of the apostle Peter .
The earliest copies of this gospel end abruptly at 16:8 before any visions of the risen Jesus , which were added later in various differing endings .
Matthew was written c.70 - 80 by an unknown author who later church tradition identified with the apostle Matthew , but the text heavily quotes the non-eyewitness Mark rather than providing an independent eyewitness account .
Matthew changes ( 21:5 vs. Mk 11:7 ) or embellishes ( 2:15 , 2:23 ) its narrative to make it fulfill Old Testament prophecies .
Luke is a second - hand [ 1:2 ] account written c.80 by a supposed companion of Paul .
Luke is confused ( 4:23 , 31 , 44 ; 24:12 ) about Palestinian geography .
Writing after the fall of Jerusalem , Luke in 21:8 modifies Mark 13:6 to say the end is not necessarily near .
John was written c.90 by an unknown author who is ambiguously identified ( in the third person : 21:24 ) with the apostle John only in the final chapter , which is itself an apparent addendum .
Gospel contradictions .
Among the many minor contradictions and inconsistencies in the gospels are several that cast significant doubt on the gospels ' central message of a divine messiah foretold by the prophets .
Genealogy .
Wildly contradictory genealogies for Jesus are given in Mt 1 and Lk 3 , which cannot even agree on the father of Joseph .
Birthplace .
Lk 2:4 and 2:39 say Joseph and Mary lived in Nazareth before Jesus ' birth , but Mt 2:23 says Joseph only later moved his family to " a town called Nazareth " .
Birthdate .
Luke says Jesus was born during [ 2:2 ] the census of Quirinius and before [ 1:5 ] the death of Herod .
The census was in 6 CE , but Herod died in 4 BCE .
Chronology .
John indicates Jesus ' ministry lasted two or three years , while the earlier Synoptic gospels indicate one .
John says Jesus cast out the money changers at the beginning of his ministry , while the Synoptics say it was right before his crucifixion .
Second coming .
Jesus said [ Mt 16:28 , Lk 9:27 ] some " standing here " would live to see " the kingdom of God " .
Jesus also said [ Mk 13:30 , Lk 21:32 , Mt 24:34 ] that " this generation " would not pass away before the " see[ing ] the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory " as well as a " distress " " never to be equalled " .
Jesus ' audience of course saw no such " kingdom " or " coming " , and no " distress " like e.g. the Black Death or Holocaust .
Appearances .
The poor geographer Luke places resurrection appearances only around Jerusalem [ Lk 24:33,49 ] , while the other three gospels [ Mk 16:7 , Mt 28:10 - 16 , Jn 21:1 ] report Galilee appearances .
Gospel apologetics .
Certain assertions and omissions in the gospels seem to either suspiciously deny or unwittingly create embarrassing alternative explanations for the claims therein .
Self - fulfilling prophecy .
The gospels repeatedly relate [ Lk 2:4 , Mt 2:15 , 21:4 , 27:9 , Jn 19:23 , 36 ] hard - to - verify ( and easy - to - fabricate ) details and then cite them as fulfillment of prophecy .
Each of these details is in only one gospel .
Vouching .
The author(s ) of John protest ( 19:35 and 21:24 ) that the testimony quoted in this gospel is true , and admit ( 20:31 ) it has " been written so that you may believe " .
The 2nd letter of Peter claims [ 1:16 ] the gospels are not " cleverly invented stories " , then warns [ 2:3 ] that " false prophets " will employ " stories they have made up " .
John dies .
John 21:23 ( in the appended final chapter ) makes an excuse for Jesus ' apparent promise that John would not die before the second coming .
Empty tomb .
Alone among the gospels , Matthew [ 27:64 ] alleges an order by Pilate that Jesus ' tomb be guarded to prevent his disciples from secretly removing his body .
Matthew 28 reports a widespread story of such a secret removal and attempts to discredit it by saying Pilate 's guards were bribed .
In the other gospels the first disciples to check the tomb encounter no guards .
Appearances .
In order of writing , the gospels give accounts of Jesus ' resurrected appearances that are increasingly elaborate .
None of the alleged ( and almost certainly pseudepigraphic ) letters of Peter , James , Jude , and John mention an empty tomb or a physical resurrection , even in contexts [ 1 Pet 3:18 , 1 Pet 5:1 , 2 Pet 1:16 ] where one might expect them to .
The first written account of appearances ( 1 Cor 15 ) vaguely lumps them together with post - ascension manifestations to Paul in a discussion of spiritual resurrection , making them suspect as accounts of bodily resurrection .
Original Mark claims an empty tomb but describes no appearances .
Matthew says simply that the two Marys and later the Eleven " saw him " but " some were dubious " .
Luke elaborates on both of these episodes , building the latter into an account that approaches the full Doubting Thomas story finally told in John .
Thus , reports of the resurrection become more assertive as the accounts grow more removed from the actual events .
Eyewitnesses .
There is no reliably first - hand testimony to the physical resurrection of Jesus .
Paul does not claim to be such a witness .
Original Mark contains no appearances at all .
Matthew is anonymous and contains no assertions of first - hand witness by the author .
The anonymous author of Luke admits he was not an eyewitness .
In what appears to be an addendum , the anonymous author of John vaguely refers to " the beloved disciple " in the third person as " the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down " [ 21:24 ] , and otherwise makes no assertions of his own eyewitness .
Philosophy Of Mind : the study of the faculty for thinking and knowing .
Philosophy Of Science : the study of scientific knowledge .
Knowledge
Knowledge is justified true belief .
Belief in a proposition p is justified if 1 ) it is developed though a process that reliably yields truth , 2 ) it is appropriately caused by the fact that p is true , and 3 ) it would generally not be held if p were false .
The reliability criterion entails that synthetic ( i.e. inductive ) knowledge is always provisional .
The causal and counterfactual criteria entail that whether a true belief counts as knowledge depends on inherently imprecise judgments concerning whether the believer is accidentally right .
Operationally , a belief is justified if and only if it is convincing and defensible .
Truth
Truth is logical and parsimonious consistency with evidence and with other truth .
Evidence is any and all perceived circumstances .
The Principle of Parsimony ( or Occam 's Razor ) is that the simpler of two explanations is to be preferred when they are otherwise equivalent .
Humans have proposed several criteria for truth .
The Correspondence Theory of Truth is that the terms of true propositions map to elements of reality in a way that validates the proposition .
is that the terms of true propositions map to elements of reality in a way that validates the proposition .
The Coherence Theory of Truth is that true propositions are those in the system of mutually coherent propositions that is more complete than any rival system .
is that true propositions are those in the system of mutually coherent propositions that is more complete than any rival system .
The Pragmatic Theory of Truth is that true propositions are those that are most useful to believe and that are thus " fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate " .
The Correspondence Theory begs the question by assuming we have access to reality that is sufficiently direct and certain to dispose of the problem of the nature of truth .
Depending on the meaning of ' complete ' , the Coherence Theory either reduces to the Correspondence Theory , or it makes truth a purely social ( or divine ) construct .
The Pragmatic
Theory either underdetermines the truth of certain propositions , or it reduces to a variant of the social version of the Coherence Theory .
The proper notion of truth is coherence grounded in correspondence , and its propriety is justified by the pragmatic meta-consideration of which truth theory to endorse ( as opposed to which particular propositions to endorse as true ) .
Origins of Knowledge
Analytic propositions are those whose truth value can be deduced from only the definitions of their terms .
are those whose truth value can be deduced from only the definitions of their terms .
Synthetic propositions are those whose truth value cannot be deduced from only the definitions of their terms .
Epistemic Provisionality .
All synthetic propositions ( including this one ) can only be known from experience and are subject to doubt .
It is logically possible that all experience is deceptive and that the world is illusory .
The only absolutely certain truths are true analytic propositions and the synthetic proposition that something exists .
Cogito Ergo Sum .
Descartes argued " I think , therefore I am " .
However , " I " could be illusory , and the fact of my thinking only warrants the certainty that something exists : cogito ergo est .
Meaning
The meaningof a term is the context - sensitive connotation ultimately established by its relevant denotation and use .
The Verifiability Principle holds that a statement is propositionally meaningless ( i.e. states no proposition ) if it is neither logically decidable nor empirically verifiable .
Positivism is a stricter form of Empiricism that asserts the Verifiability Principle .
Theories of Meaning
The Referential Theory of Meaning is that the meaning of a term is the things in the world it refers to .
is that the meaning of a term is the things in the world it refers to .
The Conceptual Theory of Meaning is that the meaning of a term is the properties and concepts associated with it .
is that the meaning of a term is the properties and concepts associated with it .
The Behavioral Theory of Meaning is that the meaning of a term consists of the behaviors and dispositions associated with it .
The Referential Theory is confounded by terms that have the same referent but different meaning , such as ' morning star ' and ' evening star ' .
The Conceptual Theory reduces to dictionary - like circularity for many concepts that can only be described by the word (s ) to which they help give meaning .
The Behavioral Theory is undermined by behaviors and dispositions that underspecify the meanings they are supposed to impart .
Theories of Knowledge
Rationalism is the thesis that some synthetic propositions can be known from reason alone and independent of any experience .
is the thesis that some synthetic propositions can be known from reason alone and independent of any experience .
Empiricism is the thesis that all synthetic propositions can only be known from experience .
Rationalism incorrectly assumes that existence arranges for reason to discover the nature of reality through introspection alone .
1.2.1 . Philosophy / Epistemology / Philosophy Of Mind
Minds and ideas , like all of reality , consist ultimately of matter .
Mental states are functional states consisting of causal relations among components for processing information .
Theories of Mind
mind ( or spirit or soul ) : that which can think and perceive ;
ideas ( or universals or forms ) : that which can be thought ; and
matter ( or substance ) : that which can be perceived .
Human theories of mind differ according to how they explain these phenomena in general and the Mind - Body Problem in particular .
The Mind - Body Problem is the problem of explaining how mindless unconscious matter can give rise to or interact with mind and consciousness .
Human theories of mind include :
Idealism is the thesis that reality consists ultimately of mind and ideas rather than matter .
is the thesis that reality consists ultimately of mind and ideas rather than matter .
Dualism is the thesis that reality consists ultimately of both the material or physical and the ideal or mental .
is the thesis that reality consists ultimately of both the material or physical and the ideal or mental .
Substance Dualism is the thesis that the material and the ideal or mental constitute two different and fundamental kinds of objects .
is the thesis that the material and the ideal or mental constitute two different and fundamental kinds of objects .
Property Dualism is the thesis that the material or physical and the ideal or mental constitute two different and fundamental kinds of properties .
Property dualism can be a form of materialism if it says that mental properties are nevertheless fundamental material properties ( analogous to mass or charge ) .
is the thesis that the material or physical and the ideal or mental constitute two different and fundamental kinds of properties .
Property dualism can be a form of materialism if it says that mental properties are nevertheless fundamental material properties ( analogous to mass or charge ) .
Materialism is the thesis that reality consists ultimately of matter .
is the thesis that reality consists ultimately of matter .
Logical Behaviorism is the thesis that mental states can be fully and best explained in terms of behaviors and behavioral dispositions .
is the thesis that mental states can be fully and best explained in terms of behaviors and behavioral dispositions .
Identity
Theory is the thesis that mental states and brain states are identical .
is the thesis that mental states and brain states are identical .
Functionalism is the thesis that mental states are functional states consisting of causal relations among components for processing information .
Idealism is incorrect because its explanation of matter is either inadequate or unparsimonious .
Dualism is incorrect because it unparsimoniously posits a realm of the ideal .
Logical Behaviorism is unsatisfactory because behavioral explanations are too unwieldy .
Identity
Theory is incorrect because it holds that the essence of mind is its construction instead of its function .
A mind is any volitional conscious faculty for perception and cognition .
Cognition
Cognition is the process of learning , reasoning , and knowing .
Perception
Perception is the process of organizing sensation into experience
Sensation is the process of external influence on a monitoring or control system .
Consciousness
Consciousness is awareness of self and environment .
Volition
Volition is the power or act of making decisions about an agent 's own actions .
A decision is the causing by a system of events which were not physically determined from outside the system but rather were at least somewhat contingent on the internals of the system , and which were not predictable except perhaps by modeling the internals of the system .
Free will is either of the doctrines that human choices are a ) determined internally rather than externally ( volitional free will ) or b ) not pre-determined at all ( indeterminate free will ) .
Determinism is incompatible with indeterminate free will , but is compatible with volitional free will if agents have internal state that influences ( and thus helps determines ) their actions .
Volitional free will is also compatible with forms of indeterminism in which the acausality is not so rampant as to undermine agent self - influence .
Indeterminate free will requires indeterminism , but degenerates into uncaused chance if acausality confounds not only prediction of effect but also attribution of cause .
Since most effects seem caused rather than uncaused , and since the complexity of minds makes them hard to predict , minds appear to have at least weak free will .
Weak free will is sufficient for assigning ethical responsibility to decision - making systems even in the face of complete determinism .
Do minds have strong free will , or can their decisions in principle be inferred from sufficient knowledge of prior circumstances ?
Anti-materialists posit an immaterial soul or will that is free from both deterministic causality and random acausality .
This notion violates the law of the excluded middle .
Either the immaterial will is subject to ( perhaps probabilistic but nonetheless causal ) causes , or it is not .
The same is true of material minds .
The actions of an immaterial will could be said to be caused by its own internal causal processes , but the same can be said of material minds .
Subjectivity
Subjective experience consists of complex associations among perceptions , and necessarily occurs in systems having such associations .
If a subjective experience is not " like " anything ( i.e. not associated with any other perceptions ) , it is not a subjective experience at all .
Physicalism is the thesis that all facts can be described in physical ( and thus non-subjective ) terms .
Some humans have what they call a " natural belief that collections of cells do not generate minds " [ McGinn 1999 ] and that therefore physicalism must be false .
Such a belief seems only as " natural " as the belief that collections of atoms do not generate life , and just as unjustified .
The operation of e.g. the human brain does not mysteriously causeconsciousness , but rather it simplyconstitutes consciousness .
Qualia are ineffable intrinsic subjective qualities of perception , such as the redness of red , beyond the functional or dispositional properties of perception .
Qualia are taken by opponents of physicalism to be a mysterious phenomenon that physicalism cannot explain .
However , qualia do not exist , because the functional and dispositional properties of perception can , in fact , explain the subjective qualities of perception .
The functional role of certain sorts of perceptions in a conscious system necessarily and understandably entails that the system will report qualia .
Thus there are no ineffable intrinsic subjective qualities of perception beyond its functional qualities .
The Knowledge Argument is an argument made by Frank Jackson in 1982 purporting to show that physicalism is false because knowledge of all the relevant physical facts does not include , for certain experiences such as the redness of red , knowledge of what it is like to have them before they are had .
Jackson hypothesizes in the distant future a brilliant neuroscientist Mary spending her whole life in a colorless room learning all the physical facts about seeing the color red .
Jackson claims that only when Mary sees something red can she learns the new fact of what redness is like , and that therefore physicalism is false .
Jackson 's argument fails because it ignores the difference between memorizing an algorithm and executing it .
The experience of the redness of red consists in the operation of a complex set of functional components for processing information .
While we can conceive of Mary having serial access to arbitrarily many memorized facts about such components , we cannot conceive of her having a large enough working memory or a fast enough mind to " manually " perform the operations " in her head " in order to recreate the experience of redness .
Similarly , Mary could memorize the sequence of pixels in a monochrome bitmap and yet still not be able to mentally visualize what the bitmap will look like -- even if it is an image of a favorite drawing which she had already memorized in arbitrary detail .
A zombie is a hypothetical creature that is stipulated to lack subjective experience but is behaviorally and physically indistinguishable from a human .
The conceivability or logical possibility of zombies is taken by opponents of physicalism to show that physicalism is false .
It seems impossible to conceive of a creature that lacks subjective experience but nevertheless exhibits all the self - reporting behaviors of humans that help us to ascribe subjective experience to them .
Therefore , zombies are inconceivable and do not show physicalism to be false .
Intentionality
A system has intentionality by virtue of its potential and actual causal relations with the world .
The Chinese Room is a thought experiment devised by John Searle in 1980 to show that there cannot be intentionality or understanding in a formal symbol manipulation system such as a room in which a speaker of English manually executes an algorithm allowing the room to pass the Turing Test in Chinese .
Searle claims that intentionality " is a biological phenomenon , and it is as likely to be as causally dependent on the specific biochemistry of its origins as lactation [ or ] photosynthesis " .
Searle charges that functionalism is a form of dualism because it says mind is in principle independent of the specific biochemistry of the brain .
The human in the Chinese Room does not understand Chinese , but the human running the algorithm implements a system that does indeed understand Chinese .
The system has intentionality by virtue of the causal relations that allow it to correctly answer questions posed to it in Chinese .
Intentionality is a formal or informational property , whereas lactation and photosynthesis involve chemistry and energy .
Simulated thinking can indeed produce understanding , just as simulated musical composition can indeed produce a sonata .
If a functional explanation of mind is " dualistic " , then so is a functional explanation of long division or carburetion .
Affect
Is affect indeed an inevitable property of any volitional system with complex motives ?
Mind and Object
Realism is the thesis that universals are essences that have existence independent of any instances .

Fox links ' lefty - Rosie ' to ' Rage Against the Machine '
David Edwards and Josh Catone
Published : Wednesday May 2 , 2007 Print This Email This
After Time Magazine placed Rosie O'Donnell on their list of the world 's 100 most influential people this week , Fox News host John Gibson was livid .
Referring to O'Donnell as " our favorite loudmouth , " Gibson said , " She 's been named one of Time Magazine 's one hundred most influential people in the world .
That 's right , the most influential in the world .
This is the same women who spends a large part of her air time , on ' The View , ' bashing the president and his administration . "
According to Gibson , Rosie 's influence is " rubbing off . "
Cutting to a clip of the recent reunion show of the politically - minded rock group ' Rage Against the Machine , ' he said the band " got together again to join the Bush - bashing party . "
Citing incendiary ' Rage ' lyrics that call for the president to be " hung , and tried , and shot " Gibson made the claim , " These radical lefties not only want the president impeached , they want him dead . "
Later in the report , Fox News ran a graphic banner posing the question : " Did radical - lefty Rosie influence ' Rage Against the Machine ? ' "
The following video is from Fox 's Big Story .

Destroying the Earth is harder than you may have been led to believe .
You 've seen the action movies where the bad guy threatens to destroy the Earth .
You 've heard people on the news claiming that the next nuclear war or cutting down rainforests or persisting in releasing hideous quantities of pollution into the atmosphere threatens to end the world .
Fools .
The Earth is built to last .
It is a 4,550,000,000 - year - old , 5,973,600,000,000,000,000,000 - tonne ball of iron .
It has taken more devastating asteroid hits in its lifetime than you 've had hot dinners , and lo , it still orbits merrily .
So my first piece of advice to you , dear would - be Earth - destroyer , is : do NOT think this will be easy .
This is not a guide for wusses whose aim is merely to wipe out humanity .
I can in no way guarantee the complete extinction of the human race via any of these methods , real or imaginary .
Humanity is wily and resourceful , and many of the methods outlined below will take many years to even become available , let alone implement , by which time mankind may well have spread to other planets ; indeed , other star systems .
If total human genocide is your ultimate goal , you are reading the wrong document .
There are far more efficient ways of doing this , many which are available and feasible RIGHT NOW .
Nor is this a guide for those wanting to annihilate everything from single - celled life upwards , render Earth uninhabitable or simply conquer it .
These are trivial goals in comparison .
This is a guide for those who do not want the Earth to be there anymore .
For the purposes of what I hope to be a technically and scientifically accurate document , I will define our goal thus : by any means necessary , to change the Earth into something other than a planet or a dwarf planet .
The International Astronomical Union defines a planet as :
and a dwarf planet as :
Since " celestial body " does not include the Earth , we shall assume for the sake of pedantry that the IAU meant to say " astronomical body " .
These definitions instantly suggest some very simple ways of stripping the Earth of its planethood , such as hurling it into interstellar space , moving it into orbit around a gas giant , or moving it into a solar orbit whose neighbourhood is not cleared ( the main asteroid belt being the most obvious choice ) .
A slightly less obvious method would be redefining " planet " not to include the Earth .
Naturally , these methods ( the latter of which is by far the most feasible method listed in this document ) will not be considered to count - redefining something does n't make it go away .
We are left , therefore , with the challenge of significantly altering the Earth 's physical structure , or else reducing its mass such that it can maintain a shape which is not round .
For example : blowing it up , turning it into a dust cloud , merging it with a larger body , et cetera .
Information courtesy of the International Earth - Destruction Advisory Board
To be listed here , a method must actually work .
That is , according to current scientific understanding , it must be possible for the Earth to actually be destroyed by this method , however improbable or impractical it may be .
Methods are ranked in order of feasibility .
Feasibility ratings are given out of ten - these are based primarily on my gut instinct and do not reflect actual mathematical probabilities in any way .
Several methods involve moving the Earth a considerable distance off its usual orbital track .
This is an essay in itself , so a separate page has been created for it .
Annihilated by an equivalent quantity of antimatter
You will need :
An entire planet Earth made from antimatter Antimatter - the most explosive substance possible - can be manufactured in small quantities using any large particle accelerator , but this will take preposterous amounts of time to produce the required amounts .
If you can create the appropriate machinery , it may be possible to find or scrape together an approximately Earth - sized chunk of rock and simply to " flip " it all through a fourth spacial dimension , turning it all to antimatter at once .
Method :
Once you 've generated your antimatter , probably in space , just launch it en masse towards Earth .
The resulting release of energy ( obeying Einstein 's famous mass - energy equation , E=mc2 ) is equivalent to the amount the Sun outputs in some 89 million years .
Alternatively , if your matter - flipping machinery is a little more flexible , turn half the Earth into antimatter ( say , the Western Hemisphere ) and watch the fireworks .
Earth 's final resting place :
When matter and antimatter collide , they completely annihilate each other , leaving nothing but energy .
All that would be left of Earth is a scintillating flash of light expanding across space forever .
This method is one of the most permanent and total on this list , as the very matter which makes up the Earth ceases to exist , making it virtually impossible to even reassemble the planet afterwards .
Feasibility rating : 2/10 .
It IS possible to create antimatter , so , technically , this method IS possible .
But since the proposed matter - to - antimatter flipping machine is probably complete science fiction , we 're looking at stupid , stupid amounts of time to pull this off .
Comments :
With a significantly smaller amount of antimatter , you can simply blow the Earth up - see later .

This method suggested by Thomas Wootten .
Fissioned
You will need : a universal fission machine ( e.g. a particle accelerator ) , an unimaginable amount of energy Method :
Take every single atom on planet Earth and individually split each one down to become hydrogen and helium .
Fissioning heavier elements to become hydrogen and helium is the opposite of the self - sustaining reaction that powers the Sun : it requires you to put energy in which is why the energy requirements here are so vast .
Earth 's final resting place : While Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune are gas giants composed primarily of hydrogen and helium , they are massive enough to actually hold on to their tenuous atmospheres .
The Earth is not ; the gases would dissipate away .
You'd get a wispy mess of gas where there should have been a planet .
Feasibility rating : 2/10 .
Technically possible , but , again , hopelessly , mind - bogglingly inefficient and time - consuming .
You 're looking at billions of years minimum , folks .

This method suggested by John Routledge .
Sucked into a microscopic black hole
You will need : a microscopic black hole .
Note that black holes are not eternal , they evaporate due to Hawking radiation .
For your average black hole this takes an unimaginable amount of time , but for really small ones it could happen almost instantaneously , as evaporation time is dependent on mass .
Therefore your microscopic black hole must have greater than a certain threshold mass , roughly equal to the mass of Mount Everest .
Creating a microscopic black hole is tricky , since one needs a reasonable amount of neutronium , but may possibly be achievable by jamming large numbers of atomic nuclei together until they stick .
This is left as an exercise to the reader .
Method : simply place your black hole on the surface of the Earth and wait .
Black holes are of such high density that they pass through ordinary matter like a stone through the air .
The black hole will plummet through the ground , eating its way to the centre of the Earth and all the way through to the other side : then , it 'll oscillate back , over and over like a matter - absorbing pendulum .
Eventually it will come to rest at the core , having absorbed enough matter to slow it down .
Then you just need to wait , while it sits and consumes matter until the whole Earth is gone .
Earth 's final resting place : a singularity with a radius of about nine millimetres , which will then proceed to happily orbit the Sun as normal .
Feasibility rating : 3/10 .
Highly , highly unlikely .
But not impossible .
Comments : Hmm .
The problem is , the microscopic black hole would still be in hydrostatic equilibrium , so it would still qualify as a planet according to the IAU !
Source : The Dark Side Of The Sun , by Terry Pratchett .
It is true that the microscopic black hole idea is an age - old science fiction mainstay which predates Pratchett by a long time , he was my original source for the idea , so that 's what I 'm putting .
Cooked in a solar oven
You will need : Means for focusing a good few percent of the Sun 's energy output directly on the Earth .
What I 'm talking about here is : mirrors , and lots of them .
Intercept several decent sized asteroids for raw materials and start cranking out kilometre - square sheets of lightweight reflective material ( aluminised mylar , aluminium foil , nickel foil , iron foil or whatever you can scrape together ) .
They need to be capable of changing focus direction at will because , while a few may be placed at the Earth - Sun system 's Lagrangian points , the vast majority cannot be stationary in space and the relative positions of the Earth and Sun will be shifting as time passes , so attach a few manoeuvering thrusters and a communications and navigation system to each sheet .
Preliminary calculations suggest you would need roughly two trillion square kilometres of mirror .
Method : Command your focusing array to concentrate as much solar energy as you can directly on the Earth - perhaps on its core , perhaps at a point on its surface .
So the theory goes , this will cause the Earth to generally increase in temperature until it completely boils away , becoming a gas cloud .
A variation on this method involves turning the Sun into a gigantic hydrogen gas laser .
Earth 's final resting place : A gas cloud .
Feasibility rating : 3/10 .
The major problem here is :
What 's to stop the matter cooling and becoming a planet again ?
In fact , once the top layer of planet becomes gaseous , what would compel it to vent into space rather than remaining on the surface , absorbing more heat and preventing the lower layers from even being heated ?
Unless the amount of heat put in was really immense , all you 'd get is a gas planet at best , and a temporary one at that .
Moving the Earth towards the Sun ( see later ) is likely to be a far more viable method .

This method suggested by Sean Timpa .
Overspun
You will need : some means of accelerating the Earth 's rotation .
Accelerating the Earth 's rotation is a rather different matter from moving it .
External interactions with asteroids might move the Earth but wo n't have a significant effect on how fast it spins .
And certainly it wo n't spin the Earth fast enough .
You need to build rockets or railguns at the Equator , all facing West .
Or perhaps something more exotic ...
Method :
The theory is , if you spin the Earth fast enough , it 'll fly apart as the bits at the Equator start moving fast enough to overcome gravity .
In theory , one revolution every 84 minutes should do it - even slower would be fine , in fact , as the Earth would become flatter and thus more prone to breaking apart as you spun it faster .
Feasibility rating : 4/10 .
This could be done - there is a definite upper limit on how fast something like the Earth can spin before it breaks apart .
However , spinning a planet is even more difficult than moving it .
It 's not as simple as attaching rockets pointing in each direction to each side ...
Source : This method suggested by Matthew Wakeling .
Blown up
You will need : 25,000,000,000,000 tonnes of antimatter .
Method :
This method involves detonating a bomb so big that it blasts the Earth to pieces .
This , to say the least , requires a big bomb .
All the explosives mankind has ever created , nuclear or non- , gathered together and detonated simultaneously , would make a significant crater and wreck the planet 's ecosystem , but barely scratch the surface of the planet .
There is evidence that in the past , asteroids have hit the Earth with the explosive yield of five billion Hiroshima bombs - and such evidence is difficult to find .
It is , in short , insanely difficult to significantly alter the Earth 's structure with explosives .
This is not to mention the gravity problem .
Just because you blasted the Earth apart does n't mean you blasted it apart for good .
If you do n't blast it hard enough , the pieces will fall back together again under mutual gravitational attraction , and Earth , like the liquid metal Terminator , will reform from its shattered shards .
You have to blow the Earth up hard enough to overcome that attraction .
How hard is that ?
If you do the lengthy calculations you find that to liberate that much energy is equivalent to the complete annihilation of around 1,246,400,000,000 tonnes of antimatter .
That 's assuming zero energy loss to heat , neutrinos and radiation , which is unlikely to be the case in reality :
You 'll probably need to up the dose by at least a factor of twenty .
Once you 've generated your antimatter , probably in space , just launch it en masse towards Earth .
The resulting release of energy ( obeying Einstein 's famous mass - energy equation , E=mc2 ) should be sufficient to split the Earth into a thousand pieces .
Greg Bear 's novel , " The Forge Of God " , contains an interesting refinement of this technique .
Here , the antagonist instead generates antimatter in the form of a " slug " of anti-neutronium - superdense material massing a billion kilograms per cubic centimetre .
This is fired into the Earth 's core .
Neutronium passes through ordinary matter as easily as a ball flies through the air , so the anti-neutronium slug does n't annihilate immediately ; rather , it builds up a protective sheath of plasma around it as it plunges downwards towards the Earth 's core .
It 's then followed up by a slug of regular neutronium , which also falls into the core , at a time calculated to meet the first slug head - on at the exact centre of the Earth , where they annihilate themselves , and soon afterwards , the Earth itself .
Highly space - efficient , and with the added bonus of all the energy being released at the Earth 's core , where it can do the most damage .
In the book , the antagonists simultaneously detonate nuclear warheads in certain oceanic trenches , to weaken the crust and allow the planet to be blown apart more easily .
Rearranging Earth into two planets - which , provisionally , is sufficient according to my current criteria - would take slightly less energy , but considerably more finesse .
Earth 's final resting place : A second asteroid belt around the Sun. Comments : trembling writes , " I still think that antimatter is crazy s**t , i.e. would n't want it on my flapjacks " .
Charles MacGee presents a very well - realised alternate source of explosives in his blog ; this method involves generating the explosive energy by fusing together the lighter elements of Earth 's mantle ( magnesium and oxygen ) .
Of course , this would involve the invention of an efficient magnesium fusion bomb .
And then turning all of the Earth 's mantle into bombs .
How implausible !
Well .
Implausibility is a relative thing .
Getting easier .
Feasibility rating : 4/10 .
Just about slightly possible .
Sucked into a giant black hole
You will need : a black hole , extremely powerful rocket engines , and , optionally , a large rocky planetary body .
The nearest black hole to our planet is 1600 light years from Earth in the direction of Sagittarius , orbiting V4641 .
Method : after locating your black hole , you need get it and the Earth together .
This is likely to be the most time - consuming part of this plan .
There are two methods , moving Earth or moving the black hole , though for best results you 'd most likely move both at once .
See the Guide to moving Earth for details on how to move the Earth .
Several of the methods listed can be applied to the black hole too , though obviously not all of them , since it is impossible to physically touch the black hole , let alone build rockets on it .
Earth 's final resting place : part of the mass of the black hole .
Feasibility rating : 6/10 .
Very difficult , but definitely possible .

Comments :
It 's clear that dropping the Earth into a singularity is massive overkill .
A reasonably strong gravitational field , such as might be associated with any body between Jupiter and a neutron star , would be sufficient to rip the Earth apart via tidal forces .
These possibilities are dealt with further down .
Meticulously and systematically deconstructed
You will need : a mass driver .
A mass driver is a sort of oversized electromagnetic railgun , which was once proposed as a way of getting mined materials back from the Moon to Earth - basically , you just load it into the driver and fire it upwards in roughly the right direction .
Your design should be powerful enough to hit escape velocity of 11 kilometres per second .
At a million tonnes of mass driven out of the Earth 's gravity well per second , this would take 189,000,000 years .
One mass driver would suffice , but ideally , lots ( i.e. trillions ) would be employed simultaneously .
Alternatively you could use space elevators or conventional rockets .
Method : Basically , what we 're going to do here is dig up the Earth , a big chunk at a time , and boost the whole lot of it into orbit .
Yes .
All six sextillion tonnes of it .
We will ignore atmospheric considerations .
Compared with the extra energy needed to overcome air friction , it would be a relatively trivial step to completely burn away the Earth 's atmosphere before beginning the process .
Even with this done , however , this method would require a - let me emphasize this - titanic quantity of energy to carry out .
Building a Dyson sphere ain't gonna cut it here .
( Note : Actually , it would .
But if you have the technology to build a Dyson sphere , why are you reading this ? )
Earth 's final resting place :
Many tiny pieces , some dropped into the Sun , the remainder scattered across the rest of the Solar System .
Feasibility rating : 6/10 .
If we wanted to and were willing to devote resources to it , we could start this process RIGHT NOW .
Indeed , what with all the gunk left in orbit , on the Moon and heading out into space , we already have done .
Source : this method arose when Joe Baldwin and I knocked our heads together by accident .
Comment : Could this also be achieved with a titanic , solar - powered electromagnet ?
Pulverized by impact with blunt instrument
You will need : a big heavy rock , something with a bit of a swing to it ... perhaps Mars .
Method : Essentially , anything can be destroyed if you hit it hard enough .
ANYTHING .
The concept is simple : find a really , really big asteroid or planet , accelerate it up to some dazzling speed , and smash it into Earth , preferably head - on but whatever you can manage .
The result : an absolutely spectacular collision , resulting hopefully in Earth ( and , most likely , our " cue ball " too ) being pulverized out of existence - smashed into any number of large pieces which if the collision is hard enough should have enough energy to overcome their mutual gravity and drift away forever , never to coagulate back into a planet again .
A brief analysis of the size of the object required can be found here .
Falling at the minimal impact velocity of 11 kilometres per second and assuming zero energy loss to heat and other energy forms , the cue ball would have to have roughly 60 % of the mass of the Earth .
Mars , the next planet out , " weighs " in at about 11 % of Earth 's mass , while Venus , the next planet in and also the nearest to Earth , has about 81 % .
Assuming that we would fire our cue ball into Earth at much greater than 11 km / s ( I 'm thinking more like 50 km / s ) , either of these would make great possibilities .
Obviously a smaller rock would do the job , you just need to fire it faster .
Taking mass dilation into account , a 5,000,000,000,000 - tonne asteroid at 90 % of light speed would do just as well .
See the Guide to moving Earth for useful information on manoeuvring big hunks of rock across interplanetary distances .
For smaller chunks , there are more options - a Bussard Ramjet ( scoop up interstellar hydrogen at the front and fire it out the back as propellant ) is one of the most technically feasible as of right now .
Of course , a run-up would be needed ...
Earth 's final resting place : a variety of roughly Moon - sized chunks of rock , scattered haphazardly across the greater Solar System .
Feasibility rating : 7/10 .
Pretty plausible .

This method suggested by Andy Kirkpatrick Comments : Earth is believed to have been hit by an object the size of Mars at some point in the distant past before its surface cooled .
This titanic collision resulted in ... the Moon .
You can download a simulated video of the impact from this page .
While the Mars - sized object in question obviously did n't hit Earth nearly as hard as we 're proposing with this method , this does serve as a proof of concept .
Many useful planetary facts can be found here .
Hurled into the Sun You will need : Earthmoving equipment .
Method : Hurl the Earth into the Sun , where it will be rapidly melted and then vaporized by the Sun 's heat .
Sending Earth on a collision course with the Sun is not as easy as one might think .
Contrary to popular opinion , Earth 's orbit is not " unstable " and Earth will not begin to spiral into the Sun if we give it the slightest of nudges ( otherwise , you can bet it would have happened already ) .
It 's surprisingly easy to end up with Earth in a loopy elliptical orbit which merely roasts it for four months in every eight .
Careful planning will be needed to avoid this .
There is at least one way of moving the Sun itself .
Although the Sun is much bigger , and the Earth would be carried along by its gravity , it might be possible accelerate the Sun hard enough that it eventually catches the orbiting Earth , with the same net result .
Earth 's final resting place : a small globule of vaporized iron sinking slowly into the heart of the Sun.
Comments :
As far as energy changes are concerned , this method is inferior to the next one .
This method is essentially a variation on the Solar Oven method listed above , wherein you bring the Sun to the Earth ( in a manner of speaking ) .
Feasibility rating : 9/10 .
Impossible at our current technological level , but will be possible one day , I 'm certain .
In the meantime , may happen by freak accident if something comes out of nowhere and randomly knocks Earth in precisely the right direction .

Even as Congress moved to approve President George W. Bush ’s request for continued funding of the Iraq war through the end of this fiscal 2007 , a major new poll released Thursday found that public disillusionment with the war has reached record highs .
The New York Times / CBS
News poll , the latest in a series of recent surveys that have shown an unexpectedly sharp drop in support both for Bush and the war , came as Congress prepared to vote on a controversial compromise bill that would give Bush some $ 100 billion more for U.S. military operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan .
The bill , the product of protracted negotiations between the White House and Congress ’ Democratic leadership which had hoped to impose a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq by some time next year , is expected to reach Bush ’s desk by this weekend , the start of a week - long holiday recess .
According to the survey , which was conducted May 18 - 23 , more than three out of four citizens ( 76 percent ) now believe the Iraq war is going badly  up from 66 percent just a month ago .
A record 47 percent of respondents said the war was going " very badly . "
Perhaps even more important , a majority of 52 percent of self - described Republicans say the war is going at least " somewhat " badly  a whopping 16 percent increase from mid-April and a strong indication that pressure on Republican lawmakers , who have remained remarkably loyal to the White House in a series of Iraq - related votes this spring , to abandon the president is increasing .
" It ’s the Republican numbers that you have to watch , given the way the White House has governed , " according to Steven Kull , director of the University of Maryland ’s Program on International Public Attitudes ( PIPA ) .
" Ultimately , it ’s only the Republicans in Congress who can persuade the president to change course . "
Particularly alarming to the White House in the latest poll , as in several others conducted over the past several weeks , is the apparent lack of confidence that Bush ’s vaunted " surge " strategy  the addition this spring of some 30,000 troops to the 135,000 already deployed to Iraq  is working .
Only 20 percent of respondents said the surge  which is designed mainly to tamp down sectarian violence in Baghdad  was improving the situation in Iraq .
Three in four respondents , including a majority of Republicans , said the additional deployments , which are expected to be completed by mid-June , was either having no impact or was making things worse there .
The new survey also found that 61 percent of Americans now believe that invading Iraq was a mistake , as opposed to only 35 percent who believe hat it was the right thing to do .
The 26 - percent spread was the widest found in any major national polling on that question .
Less than five weeks ago , respondents were much more evenly split on whether or not the invasion was a mistake .
At that time , 51 percent of respondents in a CBS poll said the U.S. should have stayed out of Iraq  a significant decline from 58 percent in January , when the surge was first announced  while 44 percent said it had done the right thing .
Last month ’s tighter margin may have reflected hope that the surge , which began in February , might be successful .
Indeed , the mainstream media at the time focused much of its coverage on the apparent reduction in sectarian violence in the Iraqi capital which it credited to the administration ’s new counterinsurgency strategy .
Since then , however , media attention has focused more on the rising death toll among U.S. soldiers in Iraq , particularly the May 12 attack on a military patrol near Mahmoudiya , in which five soldiers were killed and the subsequent search for three others who were apparently captured by insurgents .
In addition , reports that sectarian violence was once again on the rise , including in Baghdad , appears to have dampened the initial optimism .
" We seem to be seeing a reaction to the anticipation that the surge might make things better , " said Kull about the latest figures .
" The conclusion that this is not really working seems to be consolidating , particularly among Republicans . "
Bush himself appeared to recognize that perception during a press conference early Thursday in the White House Rose Garden which he opened by welcoming Congress ’ imminent approval of the compromise bill that will provide the war funding he wanted virtually without conditions .
He soon found himself on the defensive , however , repeatedly appealing for patience from the public in permitting the surge strategy to take its course , particularly in light of what he said he anticipated would be a particularly violent summer in the run-up to a scheduled September assessment by the strategy ’s author and commander , Gen. David Petraeus .
" It could make August a tough month , because , you see , what ( the insurgents ) are going to try to do is kill as many innocent people as they can to try to influence the debate here at home , " he said .
Democratic lawmakers have vowed to try again to impose a timetable for a troop withdrawal in legislation for 2008 that will be considered this summer and into September , when Petraeus is expected to make his report .
The fiscal year begins Oct. 1 .
The poll found that 63 percent of respondents agreed with various proposals by the Democratic leadership that combat troops should be withdrawn no later than the end of next year .
At the same time , nearly seven in 10 respondents said Congress should continue funding the war , but only if the Iraqi government meets a number of specific benchmarks set by the U.S. for progress in achieving national reconciliation and in prosecuting the war .
The pending appropriations bill includes such benchmarks but permits Bush to continue military operations regardless of whether the benchmarks are met .
Only 30 percent of respondents in the latest poll said they approved of Bush ’s performance as president  near his record low of 28 percent in a Newsweek poll released earlier this month and markedly lower than the roughly 35 percent average of all major national polling this year .
Moreover , 72 percent of respondents said they believe that the country is " seriously off on the wrong track , " the highest percentage ever recorded for that question since it was first posed by a Times / CBS News poll in nearly 25 years ago .

Some computer games show sexualised images of girls
Magazines , television , video games and music videos all have a detrimental effect , a task force from the American Psychological Association reported .
Sexualisation can lead to a lack of confidence with their bodies as well as depression and eating disorders .
Such images also have a negative effect on healthy sexual development in girls , the researchers said .
The task force was set up after mounting " public concern " about the sexualisation of young girls .
EXAMPLES OF SEXUALISATION
Young pop stars dressed as sex objects Dolls aimed at young girls with sexual clothing such as fishnet tights Clothing , such as thongs , for seven to 10 - year - olds Adult models dressed as young girls
Research on the content and effects of television , music videos , music lyrics , magazines , films , video games and the internet was analysed .
Recent advertising campaigns and merchandising of products aimed at girls was also scrutinised .
Sexualisation was defined as occurring when a person 's value comes only from her or his sexual appeal or behaviour , to the exclusion of other characteristics , and when a person is portrayed purely as a sex object .
They gave examples of a trainer advert that featured pop star Christina Aguilera dressed as a schoolgirl with her shirt unbuttoned , licking a lollipop .
According to the research identified by the task force , such images and promotion of girls as sexual objects negatively affects young girls in many ways .
We need to replace all of these sexualised images with ones showing girls in positive settings - ones that show the uniqueness and competence of girls
Dr Eileen Zurbriggen
Task force chair
" The consequences of the sexualisation of girls in media today are very real , " said Dr Eileen Zurbriggen , chair of the group and associate professor of psychology at the University of California , Santa Cruz .
" We have ample evidence to conclude that sexualisation has negative effects in a variety of domains , including cognitive functioning , physical and mental health , and healthy sexual development . "
The task force called on parents , school officials , and health professionals to be alert for the potential impact on girls and young women .
And it advised that schools should teach pupils media literacy skills and should include information on the negative effects of images portraying girls as sex objects in sex education programmes .
Governments also had a responsibility to reduce the use of sexualised images in the media and advertising , they said .
Teenage magazines
Dr Zurbriggen added : " As a society , we need to replace all of these sexualised images with ones showing girls in positive settings - ones that show the uniqueness and competence of girls .
" The goal should be to deliver messages to all adolescents - boys and girls - that lead to healthy sexual development . "
Professor Andrew Hill , professor of medical psychology at the University of Leeds , said it was hard to disagree with any of the reports conclusions .
" If you look at teenage magazines , it 's all about sex .
" We are a visually absorbed society - our views of people are dominated by how they look . "
He added that the use of women as sex objects in the media and advertising was a difficult issue to deal with .
" Only 18 % of children 's television viewing is in their designated viewing time and legislation can't be the answer for everything .
" One of the key things here is social responsibility - advertisers and other media need to be aware that the products they produce and images associated with them have an impact and it's not always a good impact , " he said .
Putting the Pieces Together Marty Lederman James Comey 's testimony on Tuesday ostensibly was about two distinct topics -- ( i ) the remarkable hospital - bed drama in March 2004 and the President 's subsequent lawbreaking ; and ( ii ) the more recent U.S. Attorney / DOJ - politicization scandal .
But there is an important connection -- a juxtaposition , in truth -- between them .
As Justice Stevens sharply remarked at both the beginning and the end of one of his best dissents , " this case has illuminated the character of an institution . "
Ben Wittes nails it :
At least as Comey relates it , this affair is not one of mere bad judgment or over - aggressiveness .
It is a story of profound misconduct on Gonzales 's part that , at least in my judgment , borders on the impeachable .
Put bluntly , faced with a Justice Department determination that the NSA 's program contained prohibitive legal problems , the White House decided to go ahead with it anyway .
In pursuit of this goal , Gonzales did two things that both seem unforgivable :
He tried to get a seriously ill man to unlawfully exercise powers that had been conveyed to another man and to use those powers to approve a program the department deemed unlawful .
Then , when Ashcroft refused , the White House went ahead and authorized the program on its own .
In terms of raw power , the president has the ability to take this step .
But it constitutes a profound affront to the institutional role of the Justice Department as it has developed .
The Justice Department is the part of the government that defines the law for the executive branch .
For the White House counsel to defy its judgment on an important legal question is to put the rawest power ahead of the law .
The must - derided John Ashcroft , on the other hand , showed himself when it counted to be a man of courage and substance whom history will surely treat more kindly than did contemporary commentary .
Few attorneys general get tested as Ashcroft did that night in 2004 .
One can disagree with him about a lot of things and still recognize the fact that ultimately , he passed the hardest test :
From a hospital bed in intensive care , he stood up for the rule of law .
More broadly , the Justice Department seems to have performed admirably across the board -- from the OLC having taken its job seriously , to the willingness on the part of the department brass and Mueller to lose their jobs to defend the department 's ability to determine the law for the executive branch .
Had the story ended with Comey 's victory , it would have been an ugly crisis with a happy ending .
But it did n't end there .
Less than a year later , Gonzales replaced Ashcroft as Comey 's boss .
Within a year of that , none of the four people who had stood up to Gonzales in that hospital room remained in government .
Goldsmith was already gone .
Comey stayed on for a few months and then joined the private sector .
He testified that Philbin , who returned to private practice in 2005 , was " blocked from a promotion , I believed , as a result of this particular matter . "
In the long run , in other words , the bad guys won .
The ranks of people willing to say no to the White House thinned .
And without that strong cadre in the political echelons , the department has suffered terribly .
That is what 's behind the U.S. attorney scandal and the horrid allegations that career appointees were subjected to political litmus tests .

Young adults are moving away from traditional media
Sixteen to 24 year olds are spurning television , radio and newspapers in favour of online services , says the regulator 's study .
The 2006 Ofcom report also found that increasingly households are turning to broadband and digital TV .
And it notes 1.8 million homes are now using their broadband connections for internet telephone calls .
This generation has grown up with new technologies - and it is this generation for whom the uptake is instinctive
Spokesman , Ofcom
At a glance : Ofcom report
The Ofcom report analysed industry and consumer trends in television , radio and telecommunications during 2005 - 6 .
It discovered young adults , whom it has dubbed the " networked generation " , are embracing new technologies much more quickly than the general population .
Sixteen to 24 year olds , it reports , spend nearly three hours on the net each week .
Seventy percent ( compared to 41 % of the general population ) have used some kind of social networking site , such as My Space , and one in five have their own website or blog .
Half of the group owns a games console and / or an MP3 player .
Shifting habits
Ofcom 's research suggests this online lifestyle may have contributed to a fall in television viewing - this age group watch seven hours less television per week than the average viewer .
But when they do watch TV , it found they are turning away from public service broadcasting in favour of digital channels .
The reduced consumption of other media , such as newspapers , magazines and radio , amongst this age - group compared to the general population , has also thought to have been driven by the net .
A spokesman for Ofcom said : " The speed at which consumption habits for this age group is changing is faster than other groups .
QUICK GUIDE
Broadband
" They are leaving the traditional media and moving towards new media .
" This generation has grown up with new technologies - and it is this generation for whom the uptake is instinctive . "
Kay Withers , a research fellow at the Institute of Public Policy Research ( IPPR ) , said : " There have been lots of studies showing the younger generation are shifting away from traditional to new media , but at IPPR we are seeking to understand why this is and what this means .
" We want to find out what it means to turn away from newspapers and public service broadcasting , and to find out the types of news sources they are now favouring .
" This could have a major impact on media regulation , public policy and on the political world too . "
Connected households
The report also found technology adoption is not limited to the young .
From 2004 to 2005 , the number of households with broadband connections increased by 63 % , while a total of 18.3 m homes now have digital television .
Ofcom also said that a number of " converged services " had arrived on the market , such as internet telephony , internet television offerings and television to mobile content .
Mobile phones are also playing an increasingly important role ;
Ofcom found as many households had a mobile phone as had a landline .
But despite increased consumption , the average household spend on telecoms fell by 5 % to £ 76 a month between 2004 and 2005 .
Ofcom chief operating officer Ed Richards said : " Our research reveals dramatic and accelerating changes across all communications industries .
" The sector is being transformed by greater competition , falling prices and the erosion of traditional revenues and audiences . "
The Shaker Design Philosophy
I love this design philosophy of the Shakers … goes for designing anything .
“ Do n’t make something unless it is both necessary and useful ; but if it is both necessary and useful , do n’t hesitate to make it beautiful . ”
The Shaker design philosophy is one of prioritization : their main priority is to be necessary and useful .
Then , once that has been achieved , make something beautiful .
To me this is a great way to explain design , without sacrificing beauty or expression of the designer .
Many times
I ’ve got in trouble when trying to articulate this sentiment , such as my recent post on 5 Principles to Design By , in which I suggest that “ Design is not Art ” .
I tell myself that design is not art so I can focus on the idea that design should be functional above all else , and once that is achieved the designer can imbue it with other properties .
The Shaker philosophy has led to an amazing array of designs .
The Shakers invented , among other things , the circular saw , the washing machine , and the flat broom .
They are also well - known for their simple , durable furniture .
My wife and I have longed to buy Shaker furniture to fill our house , but because it is always made by hand and with solid wood it is relatively expensive .
One nice example is the ladder - back chair , a design which we take for granted nowadays .
An interesting version of this design is the Shaker tilting chair , with ball - and - socket joints on its rear legs so one can lean back in it without breaking the chair legs .
Ward Cunningham , inventor of the wiki , has a page dedicated to Shaker philosophy , which should come as no surprise given the simple utility of the software .
The Shakers themselves were an interesting lot , an extremely religious group started in Manchester , England in 1700s .
They moved ( 9 of them ) to the Watervliet area in New York in 1770s .
The Shakers are very religious , and one of their strict beliefs hinders their growth as a community .
That belief is in celibacy , or simply not having sex .
Because of this their numbers have never been large and the only way that a Shaker community can form or survive is by conversion .
By most accounts , the only remaining community of Shakers in the world is in Sabbathday Lake , Maine .
Even so , their philosophy lives on in countless designs refined over the years .
More on Shakers and their designs :
DrChinese said : 3 . At this point , I assume the publishing was allowed to go forward because the results themselves are reproducible .
I do not doubt that there will be debate on what the results themselves say .
I think the quote from Wheeler ( " . . . for quantum theory to say in one breath ‘ through which slit ’ and in another ‘ through both ’ is logically inconsistent ... " ) can be construed many ways .
I certainly do n't see this experiment as particularly supporting it .
A good reviewer looks at the merits of the experiment itself .
I think the reviewer has been convinced that there must be aninterference pattern and that the light through the two holes isfocused on two different locations .
I 'm convinced as well .
It 'sjust what you expect from classical optics .
I would have likedto see the figure on page 299 earlier .
It nicely addresses thediffraction grating ideas Vanesch and I discussed here : Now is BPC ( Bohr ’s principle of Complementarity ) in conflictwith Classical Optics ?
BPC says that a single photon can only behave either as a waveor as a particle , but not both a the same time .
Classical Opticssays that photons ALWAYS behave as waves , ( until they 'refinally absorbed )
So yes , I think there is conflict indeed .
For me the essential point is that the wave can go anywhere , follows all possible paths , all over the place , while the absorptiononly occurs at one single place .
Now which path was followed by that what caused the absorption ?( that what we call the " particle " )
Why does the remainder of thewave lead NOT to an absorption elsewhere ?
What happens at allwith the remainder of the wave ?
This is the mystery of Unitariy .
BPC wants to remove the wave from all paths that were unlikelyto be followed by that what caused the absorption .
It suggestsa partial remedy for the " Collapse of the wave function " : (1 ) If a photon is split by a beam splitter and detected Left and not Right then BPC says that nothing went Right , neither particle , nor wave .
So we do n’t need to explain what happened to thewave at the Right side .
(2) If a photon is split by a beam splitter and both sides are madeto interfere then BPC says that the photon went both ways ,
So inthis case the wave follows both paths .
Now ,
In case of the experiment under discussion , BPC would , when recognizing the detection at Left , want to remove everythingfrom the other path like in ( 1 )
However , this would also removethe interference and thus the result of the experiment .
So BPC is in conflict with Classical Optics and thus with Bohr ’sother principle : That of Correspondence .
Bohr ’s Principle of Correspondence ( 1923 ) Bohr ’s Principle of Complementarity ( 1927 ) Bohr ’s Principle of Correspondence states that if the light consistout of sufficient numbers of photons we should get the ClassicalOptics result back .
No quantum mechanical interactions took placeother than the final absorption in the detectors .
Both the experiments discussed on this thread produce the resultsthat would be expected from Classical Optics .

OSS Speaker Series : Python for Programmer
Python is a popular very - high - level programming language , with a clean and spare syntax , simple and regular semantics , a large standard library and a wealth of third - party extensions , libraries and tools .
With several production - quality open - source implementations available , many excellent books , and growing acceptance in both industry and academia , Python can play some useful role within a huge variety of software development projects .
Moreover , Python is really easy to learn , particularly ( though not exclusively ) for programmers who are skilled at such languages as Java , C++ and C .
This talk addresses software developers who are experienced in other languages but have had limited or no exposure to Python yet , and offers a rapid overview of the main characteristics of the language , plus a brief synopsis of its main implementations , its standard library , and third - party extension packages .
Python 3000
The next major version of Python , nicknamed Python 3000 ( or more prosaically Python 3.0 ) , has been anticipated for a long time .
For years the author of Python has been collecting and exploring ideas that were too radical for Python 2.x , and it 's time to stop dreaming and start coding .
In this talk he will present the community process that will be used to complete the specification for Python 3000 , as well as some of the major changes to the language and the remaining challenges .
Practical Common Lisp
In the late 1920 's linguists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf hypothesized that the thoughts we can think are largely determined by the language we speak .
In his essay " Beating the Averages " Paul Graham echoed this notion and invented a hypothetical language , Blub , to explain why it is so hard for programmers to appreciate programming language features that are n't present in their own favorite language .
Does the Sapir - Whorf hypothesis hold for computer languages ?
Can you be a great software architect if you only speak Blub ?
Does n't Turing equivalence imply that language choice is just another implementation detail ?
Yes , no , and no says Peter Seibel , language lawyer ( admitted , at various times , to the Perl , Java , and Common Lisp bars ) and author of the award - winning book Practical Common Lisp .
In his talk , Peter will discuss how our choices of programming language influences and shapes our pattern languages and the architectures we can , or are likely to , invent .
He will also discuss whether it 's sufficient to merely broaden your horizons by learning different programming languages or whether you must actually use them .
Debugging Backwards in Time
What if a debugger could allow you to simply step BACKWARDS ?
Instead of all that hassle with guessing where to put breakpoints and the fear of typing " continue " one too many times ...
What if you could simply go backwards to see what went wrong ?
This is the essence of the " Omniscient Debugger " -- it remembers everything that happened during the run of a program , and allows the programmer to " step backwards in time " to see what happened at any point of the program .
All variable values , all objects , all method calls , all exceptions are recorded and the programmer can now look at anything that happened at any time .
Learning to Analyze Sequences
Sequential data - speech , text , genomic sequences - floods our storage servers .
Much useful information in these data is carried by implicit structure : phonemes and prosody in speech , syntactic structure in text , genes and regulatory elements in genomic sequences .
Over the last six years , several of us have been investigating structured linear models , a unified discriminative learning approach to sequence analysis problems .
The lecturer will review the approach and illustrate it with applications to information extraction and gene finding .
Then he will conclude with a summary of other applications and current research questions .
The XHTML video Element Tag
Video is becoming increasingly important content type , and it 's time to make video a first - class citizen on the web .
The element is , along with JavaScript bindings , proposed as a simple solution to encourage browsers to support video natively .
Equally important is the choice of video format to be used with .
The lecturer will argue that the success of the web is based on using open standards , and that video should be no exception .
He will then demo Opera showing Ogg Theora video clips natively .
A demonstration is available here :

A New Way to Look at Networking
Today 's research community congratulates itself for the success of the internet and passionately argues whether circuits or datagrams are the One True Way .
Meanwhile the list of unsolved problems grows .
Security , mobility , ubiquitous computing , wireless , autonomous sensors , content distribution , digital divide , third world infrastructure , etc. , are all poorly served by what 's available from either the research community or the marketplace .
The lecturer will use various strained analogies and contrived examples to argue that network research is moribund because the only thing it knows how to do is fill in the details of a conversation between two applications .
Today as in the 60s problems go unsolved due to our tunnel vision and not because of their intrinsic difficulty .
And now , like then , simply changing our point of view may make many hard things easy .

Computer Versus Common Sense
It 's way past 2001 now , where the heck is HAL ?
For several decades now we 've had high hopes for computers amplifying our mental abilities not just giving us access to relevant stored information , but answering our complex , contextual questions .
Even applications like human - level unrestricted speech understanding continue to dangle close but just out of reach .
What 's been holding AI up ?
The short answer is that while computers make fine idiot savants , they lack common sense : the millions of pieces of general knowledge we all share , and fall back on as needed , to cope with the rough edges of the real world .
The presenter will talk about how that situation is changing , finally , and what the timetable -- and the path -- realistically are on achieving Artificial Intelligence .
Dasher : Information Efficient Text Entry
More on Dasher : Keyboards are inefficient for two reasons : they do not exploit the redundancy in normal language ; and they waste the fine analogue capabilities of the user 's motor system ( fingers and eyes , for example ) .
I describe a system intended to rectify both these inefficiencies .
Dasher is a text - entry system in which a language model plays an integral role , and it 's driven by continuous gestures .
Users can achieve single - finger writing speeds of 35 words per minute and hands - free writing speeds of 25 words per minute .
Dasher is free software , and it works in all languages , and on many platforms .
Dasher is part of Debian , and there 's even a little java version for your web - browser .

The Google Story
Here is what the author of the book has to say about the lecture / talk :
Not since Gutenberg invented the modern printing press more than 500 years ago , making books and scientific tomes affordable and widely available to the masses , has any new invention empowered individuals or transformed access to information as profoundly as Google .
I first became aware of this while covering Google as a beat reporter for The Washington Post .
What galvanized my deep interest in the company was its unconventional initial public offering in August 2004 when the firm thumbed its nose at Wall Street by doing the first and only multi-billion dollar IPO using computers , rather than Wall Street bankers , to allocate its hot shares of stock .
A few months later , in the fall of 2004 , I decided to write the first biography of Google , tracing its short history from the time founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page met at Stanford in 1995 until the present .
In my view , this is the hottest business , media and technology success of our time , with a stock market value of $ 110 billion , more than the combined value of Disney , The Washington Post , The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal , Amazon.com , Ford and General Motors .

Pylons Execution Analysis
Author : Mike Orr Date : 2006 -12-07
Abstract
This article analyzes the code execution in the Pylons ' QuickWiki tutorial .
Indirectly it shows how to build a Python package using egg features .
The analysis is based on Pylons 0.9.3 , Paste 1.0 , setuptools 0.6c3 , and other versions noted in section 2 .
See QuickWiki in action Install and run QuickWiki according to section 2 of the QuickWiki tutorial .
For convenience , here 's how I installed it on Linux with SQLite .
Create a " ~ / pylons " directory and cd into it .
Create " bin " and " lib " subdirectories .
Create a file " setup.cfg " containing : [ easy_install ] install_dir = ~/ pylons / lib script_dir = ~/ pylons / bin zip_ok = 0 ( " zip_ok = 0 " forces packages to be installed as directories rather than zip files , so we can inspect their source code easily . )
Create a file " environ.sh " containing : export PATH=~/ pylons/bin:$ PATH
export LIB=~/ pylons/lib export PYTHONPATH=$LIB
Run " source environ.sh " .
Later when you want to run QuickWiki again , you 'll have to " cd ~ / pylons " and run " source environ.sh " to initialize the shell session .
If you have n't set up easy_install yet , download ez_setup.py and run it as root .
See the Easy Install manual for details .
( We wo n't use the " Custom Install Locations " described in the manual ; our " setup.cfg " does the equivalent .
) Run " easy_install QuickWiki " .
This will install several Python packages according to the following dependency graph ( the dependency relationships may not be 100 % accurate ) : QuickWiki ( 0.1.2 ) Pylons ( 0.9.3 ) Beaker ( 0.6.1 ) FormEncode ( 0.6 ) Myghty ( 1.1 ) MyghtyUtils ( 0.5.2 ) Paste( 1.0 ) PasteDeploy ( 1.0 ) Cheetah 1.0 PasteScript ( 1.0 ) Routes ( 1.5.2 ) simplejson ( 1.4 ) WebHelpers ( 0.2.2 ) SQLAlchemy ( 0.3.1 ) Important A module pylons .
middleware in the " Pylons " egg is located at " ~/ pylons/lib/Pylons-VERSION-pyVERSION.egg/pylons/middleware.py " .
Install SQLite if you do n't already have it .
Run " easy_install pysqlite " ( 2.3.2 ) .
Run " paster make - config QuickWiki quick - wiki.ini " .
This creates quick_wiki.ini in the current directory .
Edit ' quick_wiki.ini '.
Change the " sqlalchemy.dburi " line to : sqlalchemy.dburi = sqlite:////PATH/TO/CURRENT/DIRECTORY/quick_wiki.sqlite
Do n't change the " sqlobject.dburi " line by mistake ; it wo n't be used .
If desired , uncomment the " sqlalchemy.echo " line .
Comment the " set debug = false " line so we get error tracebacks in the browser .
( This is not appropriate for a production system but we 're just testing right now . )
Run " paster setup - app quick - wiki.ini " .
This sets up the database tables required by the application .
Run paster serve quick - wiki.ini .
Point your web browser to " http://localhost:5000 / " and add some wiki pages .
Note the drag - n - drop AJAX feature for deleting pages .
Press ctrl - C on the console when you get bored .
Note
The tutorial recommends " paster serve -- reload quick - wiki.ini " .
This automatically reloads modules when they are modified so you do n't have to restart the server , which is useful in development .
However , I found it to leave threads running after I stopped the server , so I got an " address is already in use " error on port 5000 when I started it again .
This may depend on the OS .
I had to manually find these threads using " lsof - i @ :5000 " and kill the first one .
On these systems it 's easier to skip " - - reload " and just restart the server manually after making changes .
Troubleshooting DeprecationWarning
If you get a DeprecationWarning regarding $ LIB / QuickWiki*.egg/quickwiki/config/middleware.py , modify it like this to reflect recent changes in Pylons : # @@MO : Deleted due to DeprecationWarning #app = pylons.wsgiapp.PylonsApp(config , helpers=quickwiki.lib.helpers ) #g = app.globals # @@MO : Added per DeprecationWarning advice import quickwiki.lib.app_globals as app_globals import quickwiki.lib.helpers app = pylons.wsgiapp.PylonsApp(config , helpers=quickwiki.lib.helpers , g=app_globals .Globals ) # @@MO : End of additions .
Cheetah ParseError
If you get a ParseError from Cheetah , run " easy_install cheetah==1.0 " .
PasteScript 's templates are not compatible with the more recent Cheetah 2.0r c7 .
This probably does not affect which version of Cheetah you can use in your application ( @@MO : check this ) .
Alternate databases note SQLAlchemy is not compatible with object databases such as Durus .
A companion article Using Pylons with Durus will explain how to use Pylons and Durus together .
Application startup ( PasteScript ) Note Substitute your actual Python library directory for $ LIB , and your program directory for $ BIN .
If you followed the checklist above , $ LIB is " ~/ pylons /lib " and $ BIN is " ~/ pylons / bin " .
When you run paster serve -- reload quick_wiki.ini , it runs the " paster " executable .
This program consists of three short lines that will look unfamiliar to those who have n't started using Python eggs : __requires__ = ' PasteScript==1.0 ' import pkg_resources pkg_resources.run_script(' PasteScript==1.0 ' , ' paster ' )
This says to run a script " paster " located in version 1.0 of an egg " PasteScript " .
The actual script location is " $ LIB / PasteScript-1.0-pyVERSION.egg/EGG-INFO/scripts/paster " , but we 'll skip the details of how pkg_resources finds it .
The " paster " script is short too .
It inserts the paste package into sys.path and calls paste.script.command.run ( ) .
I added print statements to the paste.script.command module to to decipher it .
Here 's a simplified description paste.script.command.run ( ) parses the command - line options into a command name " serve " with options [ " -- reload " , " quick - wiki.ini " ] .
It calls get_commands ( ) , which calls paste.script.pluginlib.load_global_commands ( ) ` .
This uses a pkg_resources feature : pkg_resources.iter_entry_points (" paste.global_paster_command " )
This reads a file " $LIB / PasteScript-1.0-pyVERSION/EGG-INFO/entry_points.txt " .
The file is in .ini format and contains among other things : [ paste.global_paster_command ] serve=paste.script.serve:ServeCommand [ Config ] ... other commands like " make - config " , " setup-app " , etc ...
This defines a paster command " serve " in class " ServeCommand " in module " paste.script.serve " .
[ @@MO : What 's the " Config " part for ? ]
The iter function yields a parse object whose .load ( ) method returns the ServeCommand class . command.run ( ) function then calls invoke ( ) , which effectively does : ServeCommand ( [ " -- reload " , " quick - wiki.ini " ] ) .run ( ) .
This in turn calls ServeCommand.command ( ) , which handles daemonizing and other top - level stuff .
Since our command line is short there 's no top - level stuff to do .
It creates ' server ' and ' app ' objects based on the config file , and calls server ( app ) .
Loading the server and application ( PasteDeploy )
This happens during step 3 of the application startup .
We need to find and instantiate the WSGI application and server based on the config file .
The application is our QuickWiki application .
The server is Paste 's built - in multithreaded HTTP server .
A simplified version of the code is : # Inside paste.script.serve module , ServeCommand.command ( ) method .
from paste.deploy.loadwsgi import loadapp , loadserver server = loadserver ( uri=" config:quick - wiki.ini " , name =None , relative_to= " / DIR / CONTAINING /CONFIG/FILE " ) app = loadapp( uri= " config:quick - wiki.ini " , name =None , relative_to= " / DIR / CONTAINING /CONFIG / FILE " ) loadserver ( ) and loadapp ( ) are defined in module paste.deploy.loadwsgi .
The code here is complex and delves into the details of Python eggs and entry points , so we 'll just look at its general behavior .
Both functions see the " config : " URI and read our config file .
Since there is no server name or app name they both default to " main " .
Therefore loadserver ( ) looks for a " [ server : main ] " section in the config file , and loadapp ( ) ` looks for " [ app:main ] " .
Here 's what they find in " quick - wiki.ini " : [ server : main ] use = egg : Paste#http host = 0.0.0.0 port = 5000 [ app:main ] use = egg : QuickWiki sqlalchemy.dburi = sqlite:////..../quick_wiki.sqlite ...
The " use = " line in each section tells which object to load .
The other lines are configuration paramaters for that object , or for plugins that object is expected to load .
Server loading loadserver 's ( ) args are uri=" config.quick-wiki.ini " , name =None .
A " config : " URI means to read a config file .
An server name was not specified so it defaults to " main " .
So loadserver ( ) looks for a section " [ server : main ] " .
The " server " part comes from the loadwsgi._Server.config_prefixes class attribute in $ LIB / PasteDeploy*.egg/paste/deploy/loadwsgi.py ) .
" use = egg : Paste#http " says to load an egg called " Paste " .
loadwsgi._Server.egg_protocols lists two protocols it supports : " server_factory " and " server_runner " .
" paste.server_runner " is an entry point group in the " Paste " egg , and it has a parameter " http " .
The relevant lines in $ LIB / Paste*.egg/EGG-INFO/entry_points.txt are : [ paste.server_runner ] http = paste.httpserver:server_runner
There 's a server_runner ( ) function in the paste.
httpserver module ( $ LIB / Paste*.egg/paste/httpserver.py ) .
We 'll stop here for a moment and look at how the application is loaded .
Application loading loadapp ( ) looks for a section " [ app:main ] " in the config file .
The " app " part comes from the loadwsgi._App.config_prefixes class attribute ( in $ LIB / PasteDeploy*.egg/paste/deploy/loadwsgi.py ) .
" use = egg : QuickWiki " says to find an egg called " Quick Wiki " .
loadwsgi._App.egg_protocols lists " paste.app_factory " as one of the protocols it supports .
" paste.app_factory " is also an entry point group in the egg , as seen in Quick Wiki*.egg/EGG-INFO/entry_points.txt : [ paste.app_factory ] main=quickwiki:make_app [ paste.app_install ] main=paste.script.appinstall:Installer
The line " main=quickwiki:make_app " appears to mean run a function make_app ( ) .
There is such a function at the top level of the quickwiki package , imported from quickwiki.config.middleware ( $ LIB : QuickWiki*.egg/quickwiki/config/middleware.py ) .
Instantiating the application ( QuickWiki ) loadapp ( ) calls quickwiki.make_app( ) , imported from $ LIB / QuickWiki*.egg/quickwiki/config/middleware.py : def make_app( global_conf , ** app_conf ) : config = load_environment( global_conf , app_conf ) config.init_app(global_conf , app_conf , package = " quickwiki " ) app = pylons.wsgiapp.PylonsApp(config , helpers=... , g=... ) app = ConfigMiddleware ( app , ... ) quickwiki.config.environment.load_environment ( ) returns a pylons.config .
Config object containing all our application 's configuration information , including Pylons standard path locations .
See the Config docstring in $ LIB / Pylons*.egg/config.py .
The attributes of interest here are : .global_conf
Dict representing the " [ DEFAULT ] " section of the config file .
. app_conf
Dict representing the " [ app:main ] " section of the config file . config.init_app( ) sets up the application 's logging and error reporting , and sets some variables for Myghty .
It sets config.app_conf [ " package " ] to the ' package ' argument , presumably so the application can remind itself what its own top - level package name is .
The first app assignment creates a Pylons WSGI application , whose .__call__ ( ) method will be called by the WSGI server for each request .
This in turn calls .resolve ( ) to determine the controller ( presumably using Routes to find a class in QuickWiki ) , and .dispatch ( ) to create the response .
Dispatch calls the controller and returns the response .
PylonsApp also sets up the global object ' g ' used by the controller , and manages the session and cache .
The other app assignments wrap the application in successive layers of middleware .
We 'll skip looking at these until we analyze an actual request .
Anatomy of a request
Let 's say you run the demo and choose the " Title List " link .
It shows an index of all pages , with a Javascript feature that allows you to drag undesired links to a " delete box " .
We 'll look at how this page was created in Pylons. server ( app ) is running , called in the ServeCommand.command ( ) method in module paster . serve .
server is actually paste.httpserver.serve( ) , which trivially calls server_runner ( ) in the same module .
The use_threadpool arg defaults to true so the actual server is a WSGIThreadPoolServer , which has the following inheritance : SocketServer .
BaseServer # In SocketServer.py in Python stdlib .
SocketServer.TCPServer BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer # In BaseHTTPServer.py in Python stdlib .
paste.httpserver.SecureHTTPServer # Adds SSL ( HTTPS ) .
paste.httpserver .WSGIServerBase # Adds WSGI .
paste.httpserver .WSGIServer #
Adds multithreading .
paste.httpserver .WSGIThreadPoolServer #
Adds thread pool .
( SSL is not enabled in our example . )
Right now the server is waiting for a request , following this call stack : # In paste.httpserver.serve( ) , calling ' server.serve_forever ( ) ' ThreadPoolMixIn.serve_forever ( ) # Defined in paste.httpserver . -> TCPServer.handle_request ( ) # Called for every request .
-> WSGIServerBase.get_request ( ) -> SecureHTTPServer.get_request ( ) -> self.socket.accept ( )
# Defined in stdlib socket module .
The request comes in and self.socket.accept ( ) returns a new socket for the connection .
TCPServer.handle_request ( ) continues .
It calls ThreadPoolMixIn.process_request ( ) which puts the request in a thread queue : self.thread_pool.put ( lambda : self.process_request_in_thread(request , client_address ) ) # ' request ' is the connection socket .
The thread pool is defined in the ThreadPool class .
It spawns a number of threads which each wait on the queue for a callable to run .
In this case the callable will be a complete Web transaction including sending the HTML page to the client .
Each thread will repeatedly process transactions from the queue until they receive a special value ordering them to exit .
The main thread goes back to listening for other requests , so we 're no longer interested in it .
Thread # 2 pulls the lambda out of the queue and calls it : lambda -> ThreadPoolMixIn.process_request_in_thread ( ) -> BaseServer.finish_request ( ) -> self.RequestHandlerClass( request , client_address , self ) # Instantiates .
The actual class is paste.httpserver .
WSGIHandler ; i.e. , the ' handler ' variable in serve ( ) .
The request handler takes over : SocketServer.BaseRequestHandler.__init__(request , client_address , server ) -> WSGIHandler.handle ( ) -> BaseHTTPRequestHandler.handle ( ) #
In stdlib BaseHTTPServer.py -> BaseHTTPRequestHandler.handle_one_request ()
Reads the command from the socket .
The command is " GET / page / list HTTP / 1.1 " plus several HTTP headers .
BaseHTTPRequestHandler.parse_request( ) parses this into attributes .
command , .path , .request_version , and .headers . ->
BaseHTTPRequestHandler.do_GET ( )
This method is overridden in WSGIHandler , and is actually WSGIHandlerMixin.wsgi_execute ( ) .
POST would be the same .
-> WSGIHandlerMixin.wsgi_setup ()
Creates the .wsgi_environ dict .
The WSGI environment dict is described in PEP 333 , the WSGI specification .
It contains various keys specifying the URL to fetch , query parameters , server info , etc .
All keys required by the CGI specification are present , as are other keys specific to WSGI or to paricular middleware .
The application will calculate a response based on the dict .
The application is wrapped in layers of middleware -- nested function calls -- which modify the dict on the way in and modify the response on the way out .
The request handler calls the application thus : # In WSGIHandlerMixin.wsgi_execute( ) , simplified .
result = app( wsgi_environ_dict , wsgi_start_response ) wsgi_start_response is a callable mandated by the WSGI spec .
The application will call it to specify the HTTP headers .
The return value is an iteration of strings , which when concatenated form the HTML document to send to the browser .
Other MIME types are handled analagously .
The application , as we remember , was returned by quickwiki.config.middleware.make_app ( ) .
It 's wrapped in several layers of middleware , so calling it will execute the middleware in reverse order of how they 're listed in $ LIB / QuickWiki*.egg/config/middleware.py :
The Registry Manager middleware makes certain module globals both thread - local and middleware - local .
Pylons and Myghty depend on certain module globals containing the context of the current request .
( Defined in the paste. registry module . )
ErrorDocuments intercepts any HTTP error status returned by the application ( e.g. , " Page Not Found " , " Internal Server Error " ) and sends another request to the application to get the appropriate error page to display instead .
( Defined in pylons.middleware .)
Cascade lists a series of applications which will be tried on order .
( Defined in paste. cascade . ) :
The first is StaticURLParser ( defined in paste.urlparser .
It tries to return a file under our static directory ( $ LIB / QuickWiki*.egg/quickwiki/public / ) .
For QuickWiki this is used only for the stylesheet .
If the first application returns " Not Found " , the cascader tries the second application , StaticJavascripts ( defined in pylons.middleware ) .
This tries to return a Javascript script in the WebHelpers package ( defined in webhelpers ) .
These include a variety of Javascript tools including a full port of the Ruby on Rails utilties .
See the WebHelpers site for details .
If that returns " Not Found " too , the cascader falls back to the third application , your QuickWiki app .
But there 's still some other middleware wrapped around the app ....
ErrorHandler sends a nice helpful traceback to the browser if the app raises an exception .
It 's active only if " debug " is true in the config file .
( Defined in pylons.middleware .)
httpexceptions ( defined in paste.httpexceptions ) converts HTTP exceptions raised into proper WSGI responses .
User - defined middleware .
If the user added any middleware in make_app ( ) it would be executed here .
ConfigMiddleware ( defined in paste.deploy.config ) makes a paste.config key in the WSGI environ dict that contains the effective values in the config file .
This is a dict containing the merger of the " [ app:main ] " and " [ DEFAULT ] " sections of the config file .
The innermost middleware calls the PylonsApp instance it was initialized with .
Surprise !
PylonsApp is itself middleware .
It calls the pylons.wsgiapp.PylonsBaseWSGIApp instance in its self .app attribute .
PylonsBaseWSGIApp is a middleware too .
Its .__call__ ( ) method does : self.setup_app_env(environ , start_response ) controller = self.resolve( environ , start_response ) response = self.dispatch( controller , environ , start_response ) return response .setup_app_env( ) modifies the environ dict .
. resolve ( ) calculates the controller class using Routes , our package name ( " quickwiki " ) , and a routing map defined in quickwiki.config.routing .
Here 's QuickWiki 's routing map ( simplified ) : map.connect ( 'error/:action/:id ' , controller= ' error ' ) map.connect (':controller/:action /:title ' , controller= ' page ' , action= ' index ' , title= ' FrontPage ' ) map.connect ( ': title ' , controller= ' page ' , action= ' index ' , title= ' FrontPage ' ) map.connect ( '* url ' , controller= ' template ' , action= ' view ' )
The first arg is a URL pattern to match .
" Controller " is a class in a same - name module under quickwiki.controllers .
( Pylons converts the URL to TitleCase and " / " to " . " .)
The action is a method in that class .
The keyword arguments are variables which will be available to the controller .
" : var " means take the variable 's value from the URL .
If the URL is too short to contain that part , the keyword arguments provide defaults .
Routing maps can contain other features not covered here .
. resolve ( ) invokes Routes and gets back a match dict for the requested URL .
The match dict for our URL " / page / list " is : {'action ' : ' list ' , ' controller ' : ' page ' , ' title ' : ' FrontPage '}
Note how it matched the second routing rule , and the title defaulted to the keyword arg .
. resolve ( ) puts the match dict under WSGI environ key " pylons.routes_dict " .
Then it looks for a module quickwiki.controller.page , converting any " / " in the ' controller ' key to " . " .
It imports this module and looks for a class PageController inside it , using pylons.util.class_name_from_module_name( ) to TitleCase the class name to TitleCase and replace any " - " with " _ " ( defined in ) .
Hint Put " print map " in pylons.wsgiapp line 176 ( in PylonsBaseWSGIApp.resolve( ) after " match = config.mapper_dict " to see the routing variables for every request .
. dispatch instantiates the controller class and calls in the WSGI manner .
If the controller does not exist ( .resolve ( ) returned None ) , raise HTTPNotFound .
quickwiki.controllers.page.PageController does not have a ``.__call__ ( ) method so control falls to its grandparent , pylons.controllers .WSGIController .
It looks up the action method .index ( ) defined in PageController and calls it .
The action method may have any number of positional arguments as long as they correspond to variables in the routing rule .
In addition , the c global will contain all variables as attributes .
If an action method name starts with " _ " , it 's private and HTTPNotFound is raised .
If the controller has .__before__ ( ) and / or .__after__ ( ) methods , they are called before and after the action , respectively .
These can perform authorization , lock OS resources , etc .
The action method returns a pylons .
Response object ( imported from paste.wsgiwrappers .
WSGIResponse ) .
We 'll look at action methods more closely in Pylons actions tips .
WSGIController.__call__( ) continues , converting the Response object to an appropriate WSGI return value .
( First it calls the start_response callback to specify the HTTP headers , then it returns an iteration of strings .
The Response object converts unicode to utf - 8 encoded strings , or whatever encoding you 've specified in the config file . )
The stack of middleware calls unwinds , each modifying the return value and headers if desired .
The server receives the final return value .
( We 're way back in paste.httpserver . WSGIHandlerMixin.wsgi_execute ( ) now . )
The outermost middleware has called back to server.start_response( ) , which has saved the status and HTTP headers in .wsgi_curr_headers . .wsgi_execute ( ) then iterates the application 's return value , calling .wsgi_write_chunk( chunk ) for each encoded string yielded .
.wsgi_write_chunk ( ) formats the status and HTTP headers and sends them on the socket if they have n't been sent yet , then sends the chunk .
The convoluted header behavior here is mandated by the WSGI spec. Control returns to BaseHTTPRequestHandler.handle ( ) .
. close_connection is true so this method returns .
The call stack continues unwinding all the way to paste.httpserver.ThreadPoolMixIn.process_request_in_thread( ) .
This calls SocketServer.close_request( ) , which does nothing .
The request lambda finishes and control returns to ThreadPool.worker_thread_callback ( ) .
It waits for another request in the thread queue .
If it receives a special shutdown value , thread # 2 dies .
What 's in the QuickWiki egg ?
The QuickWiki-0.1.2- py2.4.egg contains two subdirectories : quickwiki and EGG - INFO .
quickwiki
This is a Python package , so every directory contains an __init__.py file .
The egg is on sys.path so import quickwiki will access the package .
A Pylons application normally contain one package named after the application , but there 's no reason it can't contain additional packages or top - level modules .
The " setuptools " egg for instance contains a packge setuptools and a module pkg_resources .
QuickWiki contains the standard subpackages of a Pylons application : __init__.py ( module ) Just an import to provide quick_wiki.make_app( ) at the top level .
config
The middleware and routing modules we 've seen above .
environment sets the paths and does Myghty configuration .
controllers Contains controller modules for the application .
These are connected to URLs via the routing map .
docs A place for documentation files .
As " index.txt " explains , write your docs in ReSTructured
Text format and use Pudge to make nice HTML documentation from both the ReST files and your Python docstrings .
i18n gettext translation modules for multilingual applications .
lib Miscellaneous modules .
app_globals initializes the g global -- empty by default .
base contains the BaseController class .
helpers initializes the h global , which by default contains all the features of the webhelpers package plus some multilingual and logging goodies from pylons.util .
models
Your data model .
Typically these are SQLAlchemy or SQLite classes modelling database tables .
public Static files that should be served as - is to the client .
The included " quick.css " is accessed via URL " http://localhost:5000/quick.css " .
Static files override controller actions with the same name .
templates Template modules used by the controllers .
Pylons uses the Myghty template system by default , but it can also be configured for Cheetah or another template language .
tests
A place to put your unit tests .
websetup ( module )
Invoked by " paster setup - app " .
Typically creates database tables and does any other initialization necessary before running the app or the first time .
EGG - INFO Metainformation about the egg , and supplemental files used by the application .
dependency_links.txt @@MO ???
entry_points.txt
Services this egg provides that are of use to other eggs .
QuickWiki 's contains : [ paste.app_factory ] main=quickwiki:make_app [ paste.app_install ] main=paste.script.appinstall:Installer
This tells how to instantiate a QuickWiki application and how to install it .
As we saw above , paste. deploy wants to instantiate an app " main " contained in QuickWiki ( related to the " [ app.main ] " section in our config file " quick - wiki.ini " ) .
It uses pkg_resources to look for an entry point " main " in group " paste.app_factory " in QuickWiki .
This returns quickwiki .
make_app , or at least conceptually it does .
See paste.deploy.loadwsgi for the actual calling code .

In diesem
Text geht es um die Qualität von den Informationen von Binary 24.de , die sich auf den mobilen Handel von binären Optionen beziehen .
Dieser Handel zieht immer mehr Trader an , hat aber auch ein paar Aspekte , die nicht jedem Trader gefallen werden und dass Tradingerlebnis stark beeinflussen können .
Ob das Portal sie ebenfalls nennt oder andere Aspekte unterstreicht erfahren Sie hier .
Auf Binary24 wird das Thema des mobilen Tradings beschrieben .
Es geht zunächst um allgemeine Aspekte , die den mobilen Handel ausmachen .
Dort wird zum Beispiel beschrieben , dass nicht alle Anbieter flächendeckend Apps anbieten .
So haben Blackberry Besitzer zum Beispiel oft das Nachsehen , genauso wie Windows Phone Nutzer .
Aber Nutzer können und das wird im Artikel auch erwähnt , über ihren Browser vom Smartphone oder Tablet die Webseite vom Broker aufrufen und dann sich dort einloggen .
Diese Möglichkeit wird auch viele Nutzer freuen , die noch ein älteres Smartphone besitzen , die mit den schnellen Apps nicht so gut umgehen können oder manchmal sogar gar nicht in der Lage sind , sie korrekt auszuführen .
Im nächsten Absatz wird erklärt , dass ein kleines Display das Tradingerlebnis negativ beeinflussen kann .
Dieser Punkt klingt zunächst banal , ist er aber nicht .
Denn tatsächlich beeinflusst die Größe vom Display das Tradingerlebnis .
Idealerweise versuchen Trader die mobile Webseite oder die App aufzurufen , um ein Gefühl dafür zu bekommen , ob sie mit der Darstellung zurecht kommen .
Dass das Portal diesen Umstand erwähnt ist sehr lobenswert und vor allem für Neulinge wichtig , die keine Erfahrungen mit dem mobilen Handel haben , ihn aber gerne einmal ausprobieren möchten .
Wahrscheinlich wird ihnen dann auch der folgende Punkt nicht geläufig sein .
Die Rede ist von den zeitlichen Verzögerungen die entstehen können , wenn der Trader zum Beispiel über eine langsame Übertragungsgeschwindigkeit verfügt .
In diesem Fall kommt es dazu , dass das Gerät des Traders mehr Zeit benötigt , um die Order zu empfangen .
In dem Moment kann es aber zu einem enormen Kursrutsch kommen , dass sich Trader eventuell gegen den Handel dieser Option entscheiden könnten .
Hinzu kommen mögliche Kosten , die entstehen , wenn der Trader dem mobilen Handel nachgeht .
Bei einigen Providern ist es so , dass eine Extra Nutzung vom Datenvolumen sofort 5 Euro mehr kostet .
Das klingt jetzt erst einmal wenig .
Allerdings geht es beim Trading um so große Datenvolumen , dass es passieren kann , dass ein Anbieter innerhalb von einem
Tag so viel tradet , dass er nur für den zusätzlichen Internet Datenverkehr 25 Euro bezahlen muss .
Dieser
Text hat gezeigt , dass Binary ein paar Aspekte wiedergibt , die sehr wichtig sind , bei der Entscheidungsfindung
aber immer wieder nicht berücksichtigt werden , da sie scheinbar so banal sind , wie die Größe des Displays .
In der Praxis zeigt sich aber , dass sie doch sehr wichtig sind und es eigentlich verwundert , dass diese Faktoren nicht öfters in Ratgeber Texten genannt werden .
Aus diesem Grund kann Ihnen das Portal nur ans Herz gelegt werden .
Dort finden
Sie stichhaltige Informationen und bekommen vielleicht den einen oder anderen Denkanstoß , der Ihnen ein besseres Tradingerlebnis ermöglicht oder Ihnen sogar hilft eine bessere Rendite zu erzielen .

Why wo n't Harry and Nancy be nice to him ?
He is the Commander Guy , after all .
Bush has a clear plan for Iraq , he described it to us today :
" By the way , in the report it said , it is -- the government may have to put in more troops to be able to get to that position .
And that 's what we do .
We put in more troops to get to a position where we can be in some other place .
The question is , who ought to make that decision ?
The Congress or the commanders ?
And as you know , my position is clear -- I 'm the commander guy . "
We 're putting in MORE troops to get to a position where we can be in some other place .
Well why did n't he say so in the first place ?!
We could have saved the lives of 3,300 American soldiers and half a trillion in taxpayer money had the Commander Guy just come out with this brilliant plan for victory when we invaded four years ago .
And by the way , Commander Guy just lied .
He told us several months ago that he was no longer relying on the commander guys and gals on the ground - in the future , Bush told us , he was going to be the decider , not the commanders .
Now when Congress is finally taking away his car keys , suddenly it 's the commanders in Iraq who are running the show .
Uh huh .
He thinks none of us have ever been around 4 year old children before .
Master time with PyGame
A novice games programmer learns he can move a sprite by adding a constant to its position every frame .
For a while he is happy and mocks the master games programmer for having wasted many years learning .
But soon the novice realises his sprites are unpredictable and move at different rates on different machines .
The novice is despondent and visits the master for advice .
" Master .
Why do my sprites not obey my commands ?
They jump when I ask them to slide . "
" Frame rate is like the wolf , it can not be tamed " , replies the master .
The novice returns to his code and a revelation comes to him .
" I must move my sprites with the frame rate ! "
The novice changes his sprite code to move a distance relative to the time since the previous frame , and his sprites become at one with the frame rate .
" I must truly be a master " , thinks the novice .
For a while the novice is happy , and produces many simple games .
But as the novice 's logic gets more complex he is faced with a problem .
" My game updates are tied to the frame rate ! " , thinks the novice .
He realises that his game will run differently on other machines and yearns for the simpler days when he thought frame rate was constant .
Despondent , he visits the master for advice .
" Master .
How can I make my game run predictably on all machines ? "
" Time is not rigid as a tree .
Time is supple , as a reed " , replies the master .
The novice goes back to his code and ponders the master 's advice .
A revelation comes to him , " Game logic can run in it 's own time ! "
With that thought in mind , he separates his game logic from the render code and soon his game logic runs independently of the frame rate .
The novice is humbled and thanks the master for his help .
" Truly , you are a master now " , replies the master .
To become a master you can either meditate in a cave in Tibet or use the GameClock class in the Game Objects library .
GameClock manages game time , which marches on at a perfectly constant frame rate , no matter how many frames you can actually render .
The main advantage of this approach is that the game will run the same on a fast computer , as it does a slow computer , which is extremely useful for recording demos or adding network play .
It also makes the math for moving sprites ( 2D or 3D ) a little simpler , because you can just add constants each frame .
Here 's a snippet from the example project that shows how to separate the render loop in to an update phase and a render phase .
The call to game_clock.update is an iterator that returns the frame count and time for each game logic update .
It will return as many updates as necessary for game time to ' catch up ' with the real time .
# Update phase for frame_count , game_time in game_clock . update ( ) : for ball in balls : ball .
update () # Render phase for ball in balls : ball .
render ( screen )
The update function calculates the position of the sprite at the current update , and the position it will be at the next update .
This is because the render phase will likely occur at some point between game logic updates , and the render position should be adjusted proportionally .
The method get_between_time returns a value between 0 and 1 that you can use to interpolate value between two game logic updates .
For example , if the sprite contains its current position ( self.position ) and its position at the next update ( self.next_position ) , then you could find the render position with the following code ( lerp is a function in gameobjects.util ) .
x , y = lerp ( self .
position , self .
next_position , game_clock . get_between_frame ( ) )
So what is a good rate for the game logic update ?
In my experience 20 logic updates per second is about right for most games .
You can increase this rate if you want finer control , but it is probably not a good idea to go much lower as it will reduce the responsiveness of the game .
An additional advantage of GameClock is that you can control the speed of time with little effort .
If you call game_clock.set_speed ( 0.5 ) , then half as many game logic updates will be issued and the game will run at half speed .
You can also make the game run faster by setting the speed to a value greater than 1.0 .
Alas , you can't set the speed to a negative value , as this would violate the laws of the cosmos .
You can experiment with the game logic update rate and time speed with the GameClock sample code .
You will need PyGame of course , and Game Objects 0.0.2 .
Game Objects can be easy installed with the command : easy_install gameojects .
Here 's a screenshot of the sample code running .
I really must try to write samples that do n't feature shiny spheres !
Specifically ,
MITCHELL : [ The GOP caucus ] ’ll stick until September and then they ’ll leave .
I believe very firmly that they ’re against what he is doing but they feel that General Petraeus has persuaded them that for all intents and purposes , they ca n’t vote a withdrawal before September .
+++ MITCHELL : Petraeus went to the Republican caucus and told them , I will have real progress to you by August .
They told him , if — we ’ll stick with you —
Now , here 's the thing .
WTF is a high - ranking general in charge of the Iraq mess doing giving private briefings to the caucus of one political party ?
If he 's briefing Congress , should n't he be briefing the Armed Services Committee , or the Foreign Relations Committee , or whatever ?
If this report is true , and I emphasize if because of the completely anonymous sourcing , then somebody needs to explain to the good general that he works for the people of the United States , not for the Republican Party .
According to the same source(s ) , the GOP has given the general 5/6s of a Friedman Unit to show " real progress " :
MITCHELL : The Republicans were against the surge but they felt it was fait accompli , and that they were willing to give Petraeus until August .
He told them there will be real progress by August .
They have told him at a caucus meeting as very , very recently , that if there is n’t progress by August — and real progress means not a day of violence and a day of sanity — that they will pull the plug .
No matter how bad the Democrats can be sometimes in terms of ending this mess , the GOP are far worse .

So , how do you go about finding the right person to serve as your executor ?
Here are some suggestions that can help you make the best choice .
Executor Defined
First things first :
What is an executor ?
The executor is the individual you appoint in your will to manage your estate .
This person handles outstanding debts , collects assets , deals with any probate issues , and distributes your estate as per the provisions that you have set forth in your will .
Essentially , the executor acts as your personal representative after you pass .
What Qualities Should an Executor Possess ?
While you may be inclined to choose your first - born child or a younger sibling to serve as your executor , unless these individuals possess certain qualities , they may not be the best person for the job .
An executor should be someone that you trust implicitly .
He or she should also be honest , conscientious , and should work well with others .
Maturity and excellent decision making skills are also important traits that an executor should possess .
In most states , in order for a person to be named an executor , he or she must be at least 19 years of age , and must not have any felony convictions .
Elder law is n’t as complicated to a good lawyer as you may think it actually is .
If you have a friend or family member who possesses all of these qualities , he or she would be a good candidate to consider for your executor .
If you do not know someone who has the qualities to make a competent and trustworthy executor , you might want to consider hiring a professional and experienced estate lawyer to handle the task of being your executor .

Another option is to appoint a friend or loved one to act as your executor , but specify in your will that you would like him or her to hire a lawyer to assist you with certain parts of handling the affairs of your estate .
Who Ca n’t be Named ?
Anyone who is a minor cannot be appointed as the executor of an estate planning long island /
So , while you might like to name your youngest son as your executor , if he is not of legal adult age ( 19 in most states , ) legally , he can not be appointed with the task of an executor .
In many states , a person who has been convicted of a felony is not permitted to serve as an executor .
Also , some states require an executor to reside within your state .
If you are n’t sure what laws apply to assigning an executor , consult with a reputable estate attorney .
Other Factors to Consider
When you ask someone to serve as an executor of your state , you could be asking him or her to commit months , and possibly years , to handling your affairs after you pass .
Additionally , the person who holds this title will have a lot of responsibilities to uphold .
With that said , you want to make sure that you are honest and upfront about the amount of work that may be involved and how much time he or she might have to dedicate to completing the task .
Additionally , though it is often considered a labor of love , you might want to consider compensating your executor .
Considering how much time , energy and work goes into managing an estate , compensation is a great way to say thank you .
You might want to include provisions in your will that state how much you would like to compensate your executor , or include that the individual can pay him - or herself , but put a cap on the amount that the person is allowed to be paid .
Visit your accountant regularly to go through your bookkeeping nyc so you know just how much you can spend on compensating everything that you need to fairly .
If bankruptcy is or could be an issue , we recommend calling Richard Feinsilver .
Choosing the right executor is crucial to ensuring your final wishes are carried out .

In next week 's midterm contests , as in previous elections , discussion of each party 's prospects has focused partly on the so - called ground war and the importance of the grass roots .
But what , exactly , are the grass roots , and why do they matter ?
Put simply , the grass roots are you and me and every other citizen in America .
Living and working in communities across the country , our support drives issues , and our votes put politicians in office .
The Democratic and Republican parties cultivate the grass roots quite differently .
The GOP promotes its causes through naturally occurring community groups of like - minded people , such as conservative churches and pro-business associations .
Democrats , however , often outsource their politics , relying on artificial , virtual networks and professional canvassers to evangelize their message and build their party .
That 's particularly ironic , because many Democrats oppose corporate outsourcing .
There is nothing inherently wrong with their strategy ; it is a successful method of contacting voters and bringing in money .
But the repeated experience of painful losses on Election Day suggests it 's a flawed approach that 's hurting Democrats over the long term .
The Democratic Party and left - leaning political groups rely on outside organizations to hire young people who recruit members , collect funds , and contact constituents through quota - based pay systems .
Since many hires do n't have strong ties to the places where they work , this approach to gaining support and getting out the vote fails to capitalize on existing personal bonds among like - minded Democrats .
These young foot soldiers can burn out easily because they often do n't get to connect with local Democratic institutions , such as labor and environmental groups that have strong roots in the community .
Other Democratic activists , meanwhile , do n't form nourishing relationships with regional or national progressive groups because their own local political network has become so atrophied .
The Republican Party , in contrast , has a strategy that connects its constituents into national political networks , giving them an effective outlet for their collective energy .
The party continues to mobilize actual grass - roots contacts by working through existing local groups of conservative Americans who helped reelect President Bush in 2004 .
Civic groups that connect right - leaning Americans through networks of friends and neighbors have been extremely successful in supporting conservative Supreme Court nominees as well as local and state - level bills to ban gay marriage and cut taxes .
There are some in the Democratic Party who recognize that their reliance on less - personal tactics to rally grass - roots support for their campaigns can be risky .
With his 50 - state strategy , Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean aims to bolster the Democratic Party on the ground in local communities by making sure that every state has local party representation .
Because this strategy diverts party funds away from key elections and swing states , Democratic leaders such as Rep.
Rahm Emanuel of Illinois argue that this investment in the party 's future will lead to short - term losses at the polls .
As a result , the strategy has met resistance .
Progressives on the ground also acknowledge this lack of political community .
In fact , they are so hungry for contact that they have been reaching out to one another over the Internet in droves .
These people make up the " netroots , " the nexus of political activism and social networking sites that boosters say is revolutionizing campaigns and American civic life .
It 's true that online communities do mobilize people across the country , but they are less effective at connecting people where politics truly happen .
As most of us recognize , a friend or neighbor in your community is more likely to mobilize your support than a stranger on the Web .
While the Democrats continue to reach out to large numbers of people , their comparatively rootless grass - roots strategies have significant effects on the young people who represent the future of progressive politics in America , as well as the outcomes of elections at all levels of government .
Without the hard work of developing a strong and sustainable Democratic base , progressive politics will continue to lag .
And Democrats will continue to struggle with their campaigns , which , because of their flawed grass - roots strategy , require more money and labor than their Republican counterparts .
Regardless of progressive gains or losses Nov. 7 , the lopsidedness of grass - roots connections across the political spectrum poses a real challenge to democracy in America .
Let 's be honest :
If you want your politics done right , you have to do it yourself .

Annotations on Graham's ANSI Common Lisp
General Comments
Graham has an excellent Lisp coding style .
His code is maintainable and portable .
Function definitions are short and well - motivated , and , for the most part , variable and function names are clear and helpful .
Exceptions are noted below .
However , there are a few areas where Graham 's coding style should not be considered typical :
Strong preference for if rather than cond , even when using if leads to nested if 's or embedded progn 's .
rather than , even when using leads to nested 's or embedded 's .
Strong distaste for loop , because it is so complex and different from the functional programming style .
Sometimes , however , loop is the clearest simplest way to write something .

Preference for recursion over iteration , even if it might lead to code that causes stack overflows on very long lists .

I 've been living at the Royal Hospital Chelsea for nearly two and a half years .
When my wife died , I carried on for about a year , keeping the house going .
Then I thought , ' What the hell am I doing all this for ? '
We had no children .
So I came down for a four - day visit and eventually decided to move in .
The hardest thing was getting rid of my home .
You 're very limited in what you can bring here , so I had to sell my house and get rid of all the contents .
When I left , all I had was three cases and three cardboard boxes .
I looked at them and thought , ' Crikey , that 's all I 've got after 73 years . '
But then , they 're just items .
I miss my motor car , though .
That 's something else I had to get rid of .
When I came here it was a throwback to my old army days - I did 25 years .
Friends who visit always remark on how fit everyone looks .
I think what does it is routine - if a civilian came in here , it would frighten them to death , but we 're used to this sort of life .
At seven in the morning , a chap goes round , making sure everyone 's OK .
We have all our meals in the Great Hall , and you have to be properly dressed .
Breakfast is the best anywhere - it sets me up for the day .
We live in our own berths in the Long Wards .
They 're only about 11ft 6in by 9ft .
Inside , I 've got a wardrobe , a chest of drawers and a bed .
That 's basically it .
I 'm the sort of person who likes things tidy .
At the moment we have shared bathrooms and toilets , but they 're raising money to make the berths larger , with en suites .
Some old chaps wo n't like the disruption , but it 's something that 's necessary .
For the future they 're looking at having women pensioners here , too .
Quite a few of us have got girlfriends outside and , of course , we all miss female company .
You can keep yourself occupied here .
I 've got an allotment , and I spend a lot of time in our cyber cafe , emailing relatives and friends abroad .
We 've got the club , with a bingo night .
There 's a bowls club .
We 've got our own post office and infirmary .
Really , this is a village .
There are about 300 of us .
And , like a village , there are rumours .
A rumour will start and , before you know it , it 's round the whole hospital .
You rarely hear any arguments .
There 's a hell of a sense of humour here and nobody takes anything too seriously .
Of course , sometimes people die , but nobody is miserable about it .
I 'm not saying they 're joyful , but nobody takes it to heart .
It 's a funny thing .
By the next day , it 's rarely mentioned .
When you start living on your own , you think , ' What if something happened to me ?
Who 'd know ? '
Here , there 's always somebody looking out for you .
That 's what I like about it .
Being here makes me feel secure .
write はページに dirty フラグを立てるだけなので決してユーザープロセスを待たせない って、本当にそうなんでしょうか？（否定しているわけではなく、純粋な疑問です。）
と質問をもらったので、最近追ったことをここでまとめます。かなり長文です、すいません。また、まだまだ不勉強なので間違っているところもあるかもしれません。ツッコミ大歓迎です。
まず、オライリーのカーネル本の 15 章 ページキャッシュ 15.3 汚れたページのディスクへの書き込み から引用。
だそうです。書き込みがプロセスを休止させないのはそうなんだろう。でもなんでそうなのか、が問題ですよね。ということで深追いの時間です。
Linux の書き出し処理のおおまかな仕組み Linux が write ( 2 ) なり何なりでプロセスから書き込み要求を受け取ったあと、どのようにしてそれがブロック型デバイスに反映されるか、ですがざっくりまとめると
ページ(仮想メモリ上の最小単位。カーネル内データ構造)にそのページは汚れてます
= 後でブロック型デバイスに書き出す必要がありますとフラグを立てる。フラグを立てたらすぐプロセスに処理は戻る。
カーネルスレッドの pdflush が定期的に汚れたページを検索して汚れたページとブロック型デバイスと同期を取る というカーネルスレッドが別スレッドで処理する非同期書き込み方式になってます。( ここで言う非同期というのは
AIO API の " 非同 期 " ではないです。 ) 本当にそうなのか、検証してみましょう。
#!/usr /local/bin/perl use strict ; use warnings ; use IO :: File ; use Time :: HiRes qw/ usleep / ; use constant DATA => " 12345678 " x 128 ; my $ io = IO : : File->new ( " /home/naoya/tmp/test.dat " , ' w ' ) or die $ ! ; while ( 1 ) { $ io ->syswrite ( DATA ) ; usleep ( 100 ) ; } という 、0.1 秒毎に特定のファイルにひたすらテキストを追記していくプログラムを実行する。これを実行しつつ、別の端末で vmstat を 1 秒間隔で見てみます。 % vmstat -a 1 procs

です。プロセスが書き込み処理をするたびにブロック型デバイスにデータを書き出すとしたら、ここの値は常に
0 以上になるはずですが、実際には 5 秒に一回だけ要求が発生してるのがわかります。 5秒、というのはカーネルスレッドの pdflush が汚れたページを書き出す間隔です。これは sysctl の vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs で設定されています。 % /sbin/sysctl vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs = 500 確かに5秒になってますね。 ブロック型デバイスとの同期は遅延していて、プロセスから書き込み要求を受け取った段階ではカーネルはページキャッシュに書き込みフラグを立てているだけというのはこれで分かります。ただしこれは比較的システムリソースに余裕があるときの状態で、ディスクへの書き出し処理は pdflush の定期的な処理以外にも発生します。
書き出し処理が発生する条件 書き出し処理が発生する条件を Linux カーネル 2.6 解読室 P.308 の表 17-6 ディスクへの書き出し処理を参考にリストアップしてみます。

以上になります。 ユーザーが明示的に同期を命令しない限り、ブロック型デバイスの書き出しはカーネルスレッドが非同期に行ってるのがわかります。従ってこの辺からも通常の write 時にはカーネルは決してユーザープロセスをブロックしない...という結論になります。

I/ O を待ち合わせる必要があるのはまあ明らかです。その read 処理がどのような流れになっているかは同じくカーネル解読室の
P.298 が分かりやすい。 まずページキャッシュを検索
ページキャッシュがあった場合 そのページキャッシュにデータがちゃんと載ってるか確認
( 同時に同じページにアクセスしてきた他の誰かがデータを読み込み中なのを割けるため。)
載ってなかった場合はほかの誰かが完了するまで 待ち合わせ ページキャッシュのデータをプロセス空間にコピー
ページキャッシュがなかった場合 新規ページキャッシュをアロケート そのページをページキャッシュの管理オブジェクト ( address_space 構造体 ) に追加 ファイルシステムにデータの読み取り命令を発行。 I/O の完了を待ち合わせ る
という流れになっているそうです。つまり、 他の誰かが同じデータを読み取ろうとしてるとき
ページキャッシュに該当データがなかったとき
に待ちが発生します。このときプロセスは休止していて、ハードウェアの読み取りを待っている状態

1.00 とかおかしなことになったりもします。 とにかく read は write と違ってプロセスを待たせます 。
「 書き込み処理」とは / write と read + write は区別すること。 write はプロセスをブロックしな い
read は待ち合わせが必要な場合プロセスをブロックする なわけですが、ここで write とは何かのそもそも論を考えてみます。 ここまでに議論している " write " とは、あくまでカーネルの視点でみた場合の write 。書き出し処理それだけ。一方アプリケーションのレベルで " write " " 書き込み " と言った場合、必ずし も
「
書き込み」だけとは限りません。 例えばファイルの一部を更新する場合。この場合、書き込みは書き込みですが、一度書き込み位置までファイルオフセットを
seek させる必要があるかもしれません。更にこの seek する場所を特定するためにもしかしたら何かしらの検索が必要かもしれません。するとその時 read が発生しますよね。 こういった点に注意。アプリケーション内の書き込み処理、と一言にいってもそれが本当に write だけなのか、それともある程度の read 処理を伴う一連の処理なのかは区別して考える必要があります。
Apache のログ 相当なアクセスのあるウェブサーバーではアクセスログへの書き込みが結構あります。tail -f access_log がまったく目で追えないぐらい速い、というのもざらです
。Apache のログの書き込みって結構すごいけど、別にそれでシステムが重くなったりとかしないよなー、と不思議に思ったことがある方は多いかもしれません。 このアクセスログについて先の視点で考えてみましょう。ファイルの末尾にひたすら追記していくだけで良いので read が発生しない、純粋に write しまくりな状態です。ここで仮に write のたびにディスクと同期しているとしたら大変そうですね。 実際はログが結構な勢いで書き込まれてるウェブサーバーで vmstat を見てみましょう。 % vmstat 1 procs

「 え、でも tail -f すると 、5 秒に一回しかブロックデバイスと同期されないはずなのに、ログは常に流れまくってるよ」と思った方。いえいえ、いままさに tail -f が端末に流している出力はページキャッシュからコピーされたデータです。 カーネルは書き込み要求を受け取ってページ( キャッシュ)をアロケートしてデータをページにコピーして、あとは 別スレッドで動いている pdflush 任せ。ブロック型デバイスからではなく ページキャッシュにコピーされたものから tail -f のプロセスのバッファにコピーされたものがあなたの目に届いている。 ...と、 Apache のログについて考えてみると write はプロセスを待たせない、というのがよくわかります。
ページキャッシュに確保できるメモリ量と書き込みの関係
では、書き込み処理が多いホストでディスクI/O待ちが発生しがちなのはなんででしょうか。たぶん原因はページキャッシュ用のメモリが足りない、というところにあるんじゃないかなと思います
Linux のページキャッシュ - naoyaのはてなダイアリー でも触れたようにディスクの内容をページキャッシュに展開するのに十分なメモリがあれば
I/O wait はほとんど発生しないのは OK 。これを前提に考えていきます。 ページキャッシュに載せるのに十分なメモリがない場合、まずページキャッシュに載ってないページの読み出し時に read が待たされます 。
write が頻繁に起こっている環境でページキャッシュ分のメモリが足りないと、「書き出し処理が発生する条件」で挙がっている background_writeback ( )
を実行するカーネルスレッドが頻繁に起き上がり、5秒に一回の定期書き出し以外でのブロック型デバイスへの書き込み要求が多くなります。
ただでさえディスクに対して read が発生してそこでディスクは忙しいのに、write も頻繁に発生するようになって、ますます read は遅くなっていきます 。
書き込み用にページを確保するために、すでにキャッシュされたページを解放してやらないといけない。
→ ますますディスクに read が。
結果 、I/ O 待ちが多発する。 ということになるかと思います。 また、こういう状況に対処するにはディスクからの read を発生させないようメモリを積めばよいのと同じく、write もメモリを増やせばよいのが分かります。( あとは pdflush 周りの sysctl パラメータをいじるのでもある程度は緩和できるかもしれません。 ) 実際最近、はてなでも write が多くてひーひー言ってたあるホストに十分なメモリを積んだところ、I/O 待ちを無くすことができました。 さて、 また、free の結果はこんな感じなので、メモリに余裕はあるみたいです。 ということですが free の結果では、プロセスに割り当てるためのメモリが足りてるかどうかはわかりますが、ページキャッシュ用にメモリが足りてるかどうかはわかりません。 # free total used free shared buffers cached Mem : 2043756 2011160 32596 0 351016 847776 -/+ buffers / cache : 812368 1231388 Swap : 1052248 を見るにページキャッシュに割り当てられてるメモリは
800 MB強。実際そのサーバーが主な仕事で使っているデータは、合計でどのぐらいのサイズでしょう。おそらく、キューに溜まったメールその他
OS 上で必要なデータのサイズをあわせると 800MB を超えるんではないかなあと思います。外してたらごめん。 あと id :hirose31 さんがコメントしてますが、アプリケーションが SYNC モードでファイルを開いてたり、明示的に fsync( ) してたりするとそこで wait が発生するのは言わずもがな、です 。
write はプロセスを待たせないのをコードで見る 最後にカーネルのコードを実際に追って、write がプロセスを待たせていないというのを見ていきます。ext2 を題材に。 操作対象のファイルオブジェクトにセットするコールバック一覧であるところの file_operations 構造体を見ると、read や write が発行されたときどういう関数が呼ばれるかがすぐわかります。 const struct file_operations ext2_file_operations = { .llseek = generic_file_llseek , .read = do_sync_read , .write = do_sync_write , .aio_read = generic_file_aio_read , .aio_write = generic_file_aio_write , .ioctl = ext2_ioctl , #ifdef CONFIG_COMPAT .compat_ioctl = ext2_compat_ioctl , #endif .mmap = generic_file_mmap , .open = generic_file_open , .release = ext2_release_file , .fsync = ext2_sync_file , .sendfile = generic_file_sendfile , .splice_read = generic_file_splice_read , .splice_write = generic_file_splice_write , } ; と、write のときは do_sync_write ( ) が 呼ばれます。do_sync_write ( ) は filp->f_op->aio_write のラッパ。filp->f_op->aio_write は上記の aio_write = generic_file_aio_write ( ) 。AIO API に使うためのコールバックを実行して、結果を待ち合わせることで同期処理としています。 generic_file_aio_write ( ) の中を見てみます。 ssize_t generic_file_aio_write ( struct kiocb * iocb , const struct iovec * iov , unsigned long nr_segs , loff_t pos ) { struct file * file = iocb -> ki_filp ; struct address_space * mapping = file -> f_mapping ; struct inode * inode = mapping -> host ; ssize_t ret ; BUG_ON ( iocb->ki_pos != pos ) ; mutex_lock ( &inode -> i_mutex ) ; ret = __generic_file_aio_write_nolock ( iocb , iov , nr_segs , &iocb -> ki_pos ) ; mutex_unlock ( &inode -> i_mutex ) ; if ( ret > 0 && ( ( file->f_flags & O_SYNC ) || IS_SYNC ( inode ) ) ) { ssize_t err ; err = sync_page_range ( inode , mapping , pos , ret ) ; if ( err < 0 ) ret = err ; } return ret ; } iノードオブジェクトのロックを獲 得( write ( 2 ) を一度 に1プロセスしか発行できないように )
__generic_file_aio_write_nolock ( ) = 関連するページに PG_dirty フラグを設定する ( とカーネル本に書いてました . )
何かしらの条件で SYNC が明示的に命令されているときのみ sync_page_range ( ) でページとブロック型デバイスを同期する
終わり ということで、明示的に同期命令が加えられているとき意外はブロック型デバイスとページを同期させることはしていないのがわかります。

Software Engineering Stories
Interviewing and Hiring
Tom Van Vleck
Hiring
In over 40 years in the computer field , I 've screened a whole lot of programmers ' resumes , interviewed a lot of people , and hired a bunch .
Nearly half my hires were foreign born and educated ( none had an H - 1B visa ) .
Many of my hires had college degrees , and I did n't hold that against them , but high grades in school , or prestige of the institution , did n't convince me to hire anyone .
The companies I worked at used highly paid experts to screen out inappropriate resumes .
I still examined ten to twenty resumes for every one that I chose for telephone screening .
About half of these were worth interviewing .
About half of the people interviewed got an offer .
One time I was asked to " work the booth " at a Silicon Valley job fair .
That was when I saw the real candidate population , unfiltered .
I stood behind a table and talked briefly to each candidate in a long line .
There were all kinds of nice people .
They deserved to have good jobs .
But most were light years from being able to work in a software company .
One example : a high school shop teacher .
Really pleasant person .
Anybody who can do that job is organized , mature , and able to tolerate BS .
He 'd taken a course in BASIC at a community college and wanted to become a programmer .
Cool , good idea ; but he'd have to learn a huge amount before he could contribute to the role I was filling .
I could meet my deadlines with less cost and risk by hiring somebody else .
I told him he needed more courses and more experience .
The high - tech companies I know about expect new hires to learn on the job .
They want to choose people who'll succeed at this , and lots of people can't .
There is a 10 to 1 range in programming ability ( that 's an old result ) , and there 's another range of 10 to 1 in " performance attributes " like being able to work in teams , making and keeping commitments , communicating clearly and openly , and learning new skills .
Multics Interview Process
At the Honeywell Multics group in the 70s and 80s , as part of a serial interview , we used to say something like , " Let 's take a break from talking to people .
Why do n't you have a seat in this empty office , and write a small program .
Use any language you want to .
The program can do anything you 'd like .
I 'll be back in about 30 minutes , and ask you to explain the program to me . "
Notice that this was n't an unspecified task .
The job was to write a program that was worth discussing , one that would show off the skills of the candidate , within the time given .
For our group , the skill of being able to create new programs and discuss them coherently was the center of the job .
We were then designing and building a new system , much larger than anything we had done before , on new hardware , in a high - level language that was still changing .
Nobody else was writing operating systems in PL / I , so we did n't want to test for specific language knowledge .
Our tools were also unique ; we could n't expect candidates to be able to use them .
The way our process worked was that Multics team members were expected to find a problem , design a solution , code their design , and assure , release , and support their code .
We were looking for people with a combination of focused creativity and the ability to produce high quality code .
Our programmers did n't have people to design for them ; the designers had to code their own designs .
It seemed reasonable , if the job was programming , to ask people how they felt about actually doing some .
And sure , it caused interview stress .
We allowed for that in our evaluation ; but the job was going to be stressful at times too , and we needed people who could enjoy it .
The important thing was not what the candidate wrote , but the account he or she gave of it .
People who asked a lot of questions , what should I write , what language , etc. , were probably not what we wanted ; they needed too much hand holding .
People who only knew assembly code were n't ruled out , if they were high - level thinkers .
People who chose a high - level language and used it for bit twiddling were n't really showing what we were looking for either .
And if candidates came up with an interesting but unfinished program , this would lead the subsequent discussion toward their feelings about finishing and shipping .
The interesting thing was n't whether candidates , say , commented their code or not , it was why they made the choices they did and what they could say about those choices .
We might ask , " Do you think this program has any bugs in it ? " and see what they understood about software engineering .
And you'd be surprised how many people could n't do it .
Could n't write a simple program and talk sensibly about it .
They 'd huff , and bluster , and make excuses , and change the subject , rather than actually write some code .
" Oh , I think of myself as more an architect than a coder . "
( When I interviewed at Honeywell CISL , I was in a funny position , because I had been working on Multics for years on the MIT side .
Even though there was tons of my code already in the system , John Gintell still asked me to write a program .
My reaction was enthusiasm : I chose to write a small sort program , and we talked about whether there were bugs in it , how it performed for different sizes of input , how it could be generalized and whether it should be , and so on .
I enjoyed this part of the interview , though I think my program did have a bug , and when John pointed it out in a kind way , it was stressful .
But I recovered & they did hire me . )
Over the years , we tried different versions of the " programming test . "
The original version was suggested by our leader , Corby , in the 60s .
In later years at CISL , instead of asking for " any program , " we asked the candidate to write a small sort program , or print the first prime number greater than an input argument .
Puzzles
Some companies ask candidates to solve puzzles during an interview .
Microsoft is famous for this : they supposedly ask whether the boat sinks or rises when you throw the rock out , stuff like that .
Other companies hand you a piece of code and ask what it does , or whether there 's a bug in it .
There 's a good website about this .
Hiring Outstanding People
After I left the Multics group and joined Tandem Computers , I took a wonderful three - day course about 1983 , titled " Hiring Outstanding People , " created in - house by Paul Witt .
This course had some real intellectual content : besides the usual mechanics of interviewing , EEO forms , and so on , it was based on the idea of analyzing the job to be done into two areas : the technical skills and knowledge needed to to the job , and the " performance attributes " needed .
For example , some performance attributes were " creativity , " " perseverance and endurance , " and " tolerance of ambiguity . "
Paul provided a list of about 37 attributes , and you could make up your own if you wanted .
The idea was similar to management decision theory : the technical skills were like MUSTs , and we first screened out people who did n't have the objective ability we needed and did n't plan to teach .
The performance attributes were WANTs , and we tried to find the best match we could , recognizing that nobody 's perfect .
To do this second part , we chose the top five or so performance attributes for the job , and for each one , came up with specific examples of how this applied to the job in question .
So , for instance , for a QA job I was trying to fill , I might have
Creativity Find new ways to test products
Present testing results in new ways
Perseverance and endurance Work long hours on test library design Continue even though developers do n't provide help
Behavioral Interviewing
The course also taught us a technique called " Behavioral Interviewing " that helps an interviewer ask questions that produce rich answers .
Using the performance attributes relevant to the job , Paul showed us how to ask questions that would evaluate a candidate relative to those characteristics .
For example , instead of asking , " Can you get along with others ? "
I could ask " Tell me about a time when someone did n't agree with a proposal of yours . "
After the candidate answered , I might follow up with , " Tell me more , " " Then what ? "
" Did you take any action against him ? "
" What did you write to his boss ? "
And so forth .
An interviewer can learn a lot about a candidate quickly with this kind of questioning .
Asking about specific events in the past is useful because it focuses the discussion on actual behavior , not intentions ; one can also ask former colleagues about the events during reference checking .
Incidentally , one thing I learned in Hiring Outstanding People was that the kind of " programming test " that Honeywell CISL used is risky .
A candidate that did n't get hired might sue .
And the only kind of " test " that the courts say you can give is one that is both objective and job - related , and has been qualified by academic studies .. something like the old IBM programming aptitude test .
( Well , I think this is dumb , but the HR people were very definite about it , so I did n't give programming tests when I was hiring at Tandem . )
Experience at Tandem
Tying the questions to the performance attributes helps ensure job - related questions that can be justified .
In practice , I concentrated on skill and knowledge questions during my phone screens .
If the candidate looked promising , I would decide during the phone call whether to interview .
If I decided to bring a candidate in , the team had a group discussion ahead of time and divided up areas of questioning : some interviewers would take one or two performance attributes , others would concentrate on selling the company , and so on .
One rule of thumb at Tandem was stated by VP Jerry Held : " hire better than yourself . "
This rule made sense in a dynamic , growing company environment where people had lots of opportunities .
After the interview , I tried to debrief the interviewers right away , either in person or via mail .
If the candidate looked good at that point , then I did reference checking , talking to former co-workers and asking similar behavioral questions .
One thing I learned , the hard way , was that if I had the slightest doubt about a candidate , not to hire .
Dave Mackie at Tandem stated an even stronger rule , known as the " Mackie Test . "
He suggested the manager ask , when deciding whether or not to hire , " If I make an offer , and this person turns the job down , will I be disappointed ? "
And if the answer is no , then do n't offer .
As time went on at Tandem , my group began to get tired of the process : we were spending a lot of time interviewing people , and it was disappointing if an interviewer talked to somebody , gave a positive report , and then found that the person was n't hired , or gave a negative report and found the person did get hired .
So I began to beef up my phone screening , and to trust my own evaluation more : I would meet the candidate informally , say for lunch , and decide whether to hire .
If I decided yes , I 'd bring the candidate in for half a day to meet the senior team members and management , and unless one of them disagreed strongly with me , I 'd make an offer .
Recent Research
In the 90s , some social scientists studied interviewing , to see if behavioral interviewing really worked .
They had interviewers write down their initial impressions of people and then go through an interview process , and then write another assessment .
Some interviewers were trained in behavioral interviewing and some were n't .
What they found was unexpected : almost all of the time , people did n't change their assessment from their initial impression , no matter what interviewing technique they used .
As described in the May 29 , 2000 issue of The New Yorker by Malcolm Gladwell in " The New - Boy Network : What Do Job Interviews Really Tell Us ? " , researchers at Harvard and the University of Toledo found that people size up strangers in just a few seconds , and rarely change their opinions after that .
If " it 's all over in 30 seconds , " then spending a lot of time interviewing people and stressing them is n't contributing to the decision process , though it may have other purposes within the team .
In more recent jobs , I 've tried to streamline the hiring process by using this observation .
Analyzing the job and knowing what I want is still important .
Checking on objective skills and checking references is still necessary .
But the interviewing process itself can be speeded up , perhaps by having the candidate meet people for shorter interviews .

Several surgipedians have gathered in an operation theater .
On the table lies an unconscious man whos left leg looks dark .
Surgipedian # 1 grabs a sheet prepared by the patient 's doctor that details the problem .
Surgipedian # 1 : " Whoa , he 's been lying here for 26 hours , we sure got a backlog again .
It also says on this that he has a ' claudication ' and a ' chronic venous insufficiency ' in the left leg " , looks at right leg , " and we are asked to do a ' leg segmental arterial doppler ultrasound exam ' .
Whatever that is .
His leg looks pretty good to me " .
Surgipedian # 2 : " You looked at the wrong leg .
It says the left one " .
Surgipedian # 1 : " I looked at the left and it's looking totally normal ! "
Surgipedian # 2 : " The left from his point of view !
Do you know where your left leg is ? "
Surgipedian # 3 : " No need for shouting , # 2 , please remember Surgipedia guideline ' Assume Good Faith ' .

Surgipedian # 2 : " I was only trying to be constructive , too ! "
Surgipedian # 3 : " Well , let 's just get to back to this guy . "
Surgipedian # 1 , feeling securely at the helm again : " I remember something I read once on a website about heart diseases ; when your arms or legs turn dark , you got a heart problem " .
Surgipedian # 3 : " Yup , you are right .
It 's something about the veins in the heart being clogged up . "
Surgipedian # 2 , feeling outdone : " I think it 's something about having not enough oxygen in your blood ! "
Surgipedian # 1 : " Can you cite a source for that ? "
Surgipedian # 2 : " My aunt Thelma had something like that and I wrote a paper about it for my biology class at school ! "
Surgipedian # 3 : " Please remember Surgipedia guideline : No Original Research !
Let 's get back to the man 's heart problem !
What should we do ? "
Surgipedian # 1 : " I think you need to cut open his ribs and give him a heart massage or clean the veins or something " .
Surgipedian # 3 : " Sounds reasonable .
After all , when you get a massage to your back , the blood there flows better as well .
I just wrote an article about it " .
Surgipedian # 2 : " Heh , that is original research , too ! "
Surgipedian # 3 : " Several surgipedians agreed on that article to be correct .
Are you trying to be a nuisance or do you want to do that man some good ? "
Surgipedian # 2 : " Of course ! "
Surgipedian # 2 : " Then please stay constructive !
How do we cut the man 's ribs ? "
Surgipedian # 1 : " You need a saw or something . "
Surgipedian # 3 : " A saw ?
Surgeons use scalpels when they operate .
I think you just need to cut a hole and poke your fingers through " .
Without further ado , he grabs a scalpel and cuts a hole approximately where the heart is and sticks two fingers through .
Surgipedian # 3 : " I ca n't reach the heart , my fingers are not long enough ! "
Surgipedian # 2 : " Then do that thing with the veins ! "
Surgipedian # 3 : " How do you do that ? "
Surgipedian # 2 " Well , my aunt Thelma finally had something they call a bypass and they cut open the veins , I think " .
Surgipedian # 3 : " But that is orig ... , well let 's try it .
But I will have to push in the scalpel pretty deep to reach the heart .
Shall we do it ? "
Surgipedian # 1 , # 2 : " Support " .
Surgipedian # 3 remembers Surgipedia guideline " Be Bold ! " , grabs the scalpel in his fist and swings his arm in preparation of a deep push into the hole , but at that moment a surgeon comes by .
Surgeon : " Stop !
What in the world are you doing ? "
Surgipedian # 3 : The man has a problem in his leg and we are going to cut his heart veins open " .
Surgeon : " What ?
All I see is a man with vascular problem in his leg and another that wields a scalpel like a knife .
Are you aware that pushing a scalpel into someone 's heart will kill that person ? "
Surgipedian # 1 : " We have decided by majority that this is the proper thing to do .
Besides , can you prove that pushing a scalpel into someones heart is deadly ? "
Surgeon : " You decided by MAJORITY ?
Are you all nuts ? "
Surgipedian # 2 feels that there is finally someone besides him to put down : " Please , no personal attacks ! "
Surgeon : " I will fucking personal attack you if you endanger someones life ! "
Surgipedian # 3 : " We need to call an admin ! "
Surgeon : " Alright , do that , but put that scalpel down ! "
An admin comes by .
Admin : " I have heard that a guest is violating Surgipedia rules " .
Surgeon : " I am a surgeon and these people are about to kill this man by pushing a knife into his heart ! "

A giant manta ray , measuring more than 1.8 m ( 6ft ) wide , has become the first of its kind to be born in captivity , scientists have claimed .
The baby , a female , was born on Saturday in a huge fish tank at the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium , Japan .
Footage of the birth shows the youngster unfolding like a carpet from her mother before spreading her fins and swimming around .
News of the new manta has generated huge interest in Japan and its birth , which was recorded by the aquarium , was broadcast nationwide by TV channel NHK on Sunday .
Officials say the birth will provide an invaluable opportunity for researchers to study the little - known species .
Aquarium spokesman , Minoru Toda , said : " My heart was heavy at first because I thought it had been still - born , but we were so relieved when she finally started swimming around .
Now we have to make sure the baby grows in good health . "
Giant manta rays , the world 's largest species of ray , can grow up to 7.6 m ( 25 ft ) in diameter and feed on plankton and small fish throughout the world 's tropical oceans .
Scientists believe they have evolved from other bottom - feeding species and have adapted to become filter feeders in the open ocean , allowing them to grow much bigger .
The mantas are most commonly black on their backs and white underneath .
Their distinctive diamond shape and pectoral fins allow them to glide through the water .
Keepers at the aquarium have admitted they will now have to rely on intuition to care for the new baby , as knowledge surrounding its development is so limited .
The mother manta , which was brought to the aquarium in 1998 after being caught in a fishing net about 1,000 miles southwest of Tokyo , was pregnant for 374 days .
She was successfully mated with a male manta at the aquarium on June 8 2006 .
Previously , the successful breeding of the species in captivity has proved difficult due to a combination of factors .
Paul Hale , curator of the London Aquarium , said : " Improved water quality , capturing techniques and bigger aquariums have all combined to create a better chance of breeding success .
" Capturing mantas while keeping their stress levels to a minimum is very tricky .
It 's now done by first using nets and then hoisting the manta into a large holding vessel on a ship .
" Other factors have been the improved technology of water filtration systems to create a more comfortable environment , as well as the building of aquariums which are actually big enough to keep mantas in .
As far as I 'm aware this is a world first . "
Noriyasu Suzuki , an official at the Izu - Mito Sea Paradise commercial aqua zoo in western Japan , also believes that this is the first birth in captivity .
" I 've never heard of any other case before , " he said .
" Aquariums that raise manta rays are rare to begin with because they get so big . "
It should be pretty obvious , but a lot of people forget this important first step : your product should n’t suck .
Otherwise you are wasting your time .
For smart people the product should be at least good , better yet — great .
It should be deep and flexible .
When you plan to implement a feature , do n’t just cover use - cases that you ’ve managed to come up with ; make it flexible so if a smart person thought of a new scenario , it will still be covered .
But do n’t make it everything for all people .
The product should be focused and simple enough so that the development converges and you can spend time polishing and perfecting it .
Assuming you have a product you feel proud about , how do you market it to smart people ?
Let ’s first consider a few intrinsic properties that make your product more attractive to smart people .
Make it open .
Make your product as open as you possibly can , the ideal being open - source .
Publish protocols and provide SDKs .
Allow smart people to use your product in ways you have n’t thought of .
Another important thing is to make your support system open as well .
This will allow prospective customers to see what kind of problems others are having with your product and how you handle them .
Facilitate test - driving .
Make it as easy as possible to try your product .
That means no crippled evaluation versions or long online registration forms .
The reality is that most of today ’s products suck , and that ’s what a smart person will assume about your product until proven otherwise .
The ideal is a direct link to the package : just install using your platform ’s native method and you are all set .
Now we can move to the marketing part .
Do n’t deliver – allow discovery .
Do n’t force information on smart people .
Instead publish it in relevant places and allow smart people to find it when they need a product like yours .
This approach has an advantage of also covering search engines .
When you do the right thing everything falls into place .
Do n’t hype .
The information you provide should be useful .
Present honest differentiation of your product compared to alternatives .
Do n’t use meaningless terms like fast , scalable , reliable , or easy to use unless it is clear ( e.g. , a well know fact or from your competitor ’s website ) that the alternatives are slow , do not scale , unreliable or hard to use .
Things like open source and cross-platform are good differentiators if you are competing against proprietary products that work only on Windows .
Scrap online advertising .
Online advertising has discredited itself to the point that most smart people automatically block or ignore ads .
Do n’t bash competition , especially on their turf .
It is your word versus theirs .
Bashing competition on their own turf ( forums , mailing lists , etc. ) is especially ill - advised because you are telling people who are already invested in your competitor ’s product that they ’ve made a mistake .
Prove your product is great .
The only way you can do this is with real customer case studies and testimonials .
Do n’t just list your customer names .
Tell how they use your product and how it helped them solve their problems .
The best testimonials are the ones that have extra credibility of a voluntary post on a mailing list or a forum .
Prove you are the best .
You need to have a great reputation besides a great product .
Publishing quality articles that share your knowledge and wisdom .
This will position you as an expert in the field .
But do n’t try to make it a “ big ad ” for your product .
Instead concentrate on how the overall technology will help smart people , whether they choose your product or your competitor’s .
Charts and graphs are some of the most efficient ways of displaying a lot of data in a very easy to understand way .
Charts and graphs like statistics can be manipulated to push a certain message , and I can not guarantee that all of these graphs adhere to the highest in ethical standards , but taken together they paint an interesting picture of modern life .

If you ’re bored at your next family party or are looking to light up a late night party with friends you should try installing RMagick on your Mac .
It ’s so rewarding when you finally go trough it 6 hours later , exhausted , hungry and with a sense of relief that make you feel like you could fly even after eating at Schwartz .
So here ’s a little help to get the party started with installing RMagick on Mac OS X from source .
To setup this stuff at StandoutJobs , my starting point was the Hivelogic tutorial .
Everyone seem to have the same error : Bus error .
After a couple hours banging my head against our StandoutWalls ™
I ended up bleeding from the ears and with this reviewed script :
curl - O http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/\
freetype/freetype-2.1.10.tar.gz tar xzvf freetype-2.1.10.tar.gz cd freetype-2.1.10 ./ configure -- prefix= /usr / local make sudo make install cd .. curl - O http://superb-west.dl.sourceforge.net/\
sourceforge/libpng/libpng-1.2.10.tar.bz2 bzip2 -dc libpng-1.2.10.tar.bz2 | tar xv cd libpng - 1.2.10 ./ configure -- prefix= /usr / local make sudo make install cd .. curl - O ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz tar xzvf jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz cd jpeg - 6 b ln -s `which glibtool` ./ libtool export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.4 ./ configure -- enable - shared -- prefix= / usr / local make sudo make install cd .. curl - O ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/libtiff/tiff-3.8.2.tar.gz tar xzvf tiff - 3.8.2.tar.gz cd tiff - 3.8.2 ./ configure -- prefix= /usr / local make sudo make install cd ..
Now this part was missing from the original tutorial , ghostscript fonts are needed , get the package from http://sourceforge.net/projects/gs-fonts/
and
tar vzxf ghostscript - fonts - std - 8.11.tar.gz sudo mv fonts / /usr/local/ share/ghostscript/fonts/
Another missing was the oh - so - obvious (! ) exporting of the variables : CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS , summed up here for your own pleasure :
curl - O http://easynews.dl.sourceforge.net/\
sourceforge/imagemagick/ImageMagick-6.3.0-0.tar.gz tar xzvf ImageMagick -6.3.0-0.tar.gz cd ImageMagick - 6.3.0 export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local / include export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib ./configure --prefix=/usr/local \ --disable-static --with- modules --without-perl \ --without-magick-plus-plus --with-quantum-depth=8 \ --with-gs-font-dir=/usr/local / share / ghostscript/fonts make sudo make install cd ..
Now cross your fingers , get your rabit paw , make a little prayer and
sudo gem install RMagick
You ’re done ( or back to first step ) !

Design student Olivia Ong ´07 hugs two garments , treated with metallic nanoparticles through a collaboration with fiber scientists Juan Hinestroza and Hong Dong , that she designed as part of her fashion line , " Glitterati . "
Credit : Cornell University
Fashion designers and fiber scientists at Cornell have taken " functional clothing " to a whole new level .
They have designed a garment that can prevent colds and flu and never needs washing , and another that destroys harmful gases and protects the wearer from smog and air pollution .
The two - toned gold dress and metallic denim jacket , featured at the April 21 Cornell Design League fashion show , contain cotton fabrics coated with nanoparticles that give them functional qualities never before seen in the fashion world .
Designed by Olivia Ong '07 in the College of Human Ecology 's Department of Fiber Science and Apparel Design , the garments were infused with their unusual qualities by fiber science assistant professor Juan Hinestroza and his postdoctoral researcher Hong Dong .
Apparel design assistant professor Van Dyke Lewis launched the collaboration by introducing Ong to Hinestroza several months ago .
" We think this is one of the first times that nanotechnology has entered the fashion world , " Hinestroza said .
He noted one drawback may be the garments ' price : one square yard of nano - treated cotton would cost about $ 10,000 .
Ong 's dress and jacket , part of her original fashion line called " Glitterati , " look innocently hip .
But closer inspection -- with a microscope , that is -- shows an army of electrostatically charged nanoparticles creating a protective shield around the cotton fibers in the top part of the dress , and the sleeves , hood and pockets of the jacket .
" It 's something really moving toward the future , and really advanced , " said Ong , who graduates in December and aspires to design school .
" I thought this could potentially be what fashion is moving toward . "
Dong explained that the fabrics were created by dipping them in solutions containing nanoparticles synthesized in Hinestroza 's lab .
The resultant colors are not the product of dyes , but rather , reflections of manipulation of particle size or arrangement .
The upper portion of the dress contains cotton coated with silver nanoparticles .
Dong first created positively charged cotton fibers using ammonium - and epoxy - based reactions , inducing positive ionization .
The silver particles , about 10 - 20 nanometers across ( a nanometer is one - billionth of a meter ) were synthesized in citric acid , which prevented nanoparticle agglomeration .
Dipping the positively charged cotton into the negatively charged silver nanoparticle solution resulted in the particles clinging to the cotton fibers .
Silver possesses natural antibacterial qualities that are strengthened at the nanoscale , thus giving Ong 's dress the ability to deactivate many harmful bacteria and viruses .
The silver infusion also reduces the need to wash the garment , since it destroys bacteria , and the small size of the particles prevents soiling and stains .
The denim jacket includes a hood , sleeves and pockets with soft , gray tweed cotton embedded with palladium nanoparticles , about 5 - 10 nanometers in length .
To create the material , Dong placed negatively charged palladium crystals onto positively charged cotton fibers .
Ong , though strictly a designer , was drawn especially to the science behind creating the anti-smog jacket .
" I thought it would be cool if [ wearers ] could wipe their hands on their sleeves or pockets , " Ong said .
Ong incorporated the resultant cotton fiber into a jacket with the ability to oxidize smog .
Such properties would be useful for someone with allergies , or for protecting themselves from harmful gases in the contaminated air , such as in a crowded or polluted city .

SSL encryption helps beat ISP traffic shaping !
Giganews recently announced the deployment of Encrypted Usenet Access .
This service enables Giganews customers to transfer all authentication , header , and article data over an SSL encrypted connection .
The obvious benefits of this service are increased security , anonymity , and privacy ; however , there seems to be one more ... Securing your connection with SSL typically slows down your download speeds .
The reason for this is that it takes a little bit of extra time and CPU power to encrypt and decrypt the data on each end .
This extra latency in turn decreases your throughput rate ; however , many of Giganews ' customers are actually reportingdownload speeds .
How can this be ?
Through Giganews ' newsgroups and support lists we have seen that many ISPs have implemented traffic shaping measures over the last year to curb usage on their networks .
This is typically done at the protocol or port level .
For example , if your ISP wanted to curb your newsgroup usage , they could say that any traffic being transferred over the NNTP protocol on port 119 cannot exceed 500 kilobits per second per customer .
In the past the best work around for this problem was switching to port 80 ( typically used for HTTP ) , but if your ISP is filtering on the protocol level ( all NNTP traffic for example ) switching to port 80 would not do you any good .
Your ISP might be looking for NNTP commands and limit your connection when it sees them .
This is where SSL comes in .
Because SSL is encrypting the authentication , header , article , and protocol data passed between your computer and Giganews any protocol - based filtering measures will be ineffective .
The speed difference can be very dramatic .
Many Giganews customers have already commented that downloading over SSL has made a huge improvement in their Usenet performance .
If you 've recently experienced slow download speeds with any NNTP based downloading ( Giganews or other ) which you suspect is being caused by ISP traffic shaping , try out our new encrypted Usenet service to see if you can get around it .
If you 're a new customer , you can try out our 3 day free trial .
If you 're already an existing Giganews customer , log on to your control panel and select " Manage Service " for special offers just for you .
We 're glad so many of our customers are seeing this additional benefit to our SSL service , and we 're looking forward to offering even more advanced tools to improve your Giganews experience .
If you have any other tips for avoiding troublesome traffic shaping , leave us a comment !

NEW YORK , March 20 ( Reuters Life ! ) - Harry Potter is working his magic on the publishing industry .
File photo shows Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling applauding while watching a performance by Romanian children in Bucharest January 26 , 2006 .
The record - breaking 12 million copies of the first U.S. printing of " Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows " will be printed mostly on paper from well managed forests , the publisher announced .

The record - breaking 12 million copies of the first U.S. printing of “ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ” will be printed mostly on paper from well managed forests , the publisher announced .
The publication of the seventh and final book in the popular series by British author J.K. Rowling will require nearly 22 million pounds of paper .
But publisher Scholastic Corp. SCHL.O , in collaboration with the Rainforest Alliance , said it will make sure 65 percent of the 16,700 tons of paper used to publish the book will be on Forest Stewardship Council - certified paper , which comes from forests that are socially and environmentally managed .
This is the largest purchase of FSC - certified paper to be used in a single printing to date .
“ It ’s a really big step for the publishing industry to have a book this size and this number , this sheer volume of pages and print to be able to be on FSC - certified paper , ” said Kyle Good , vice president of corporate communications for Scholastic .
Scholastic has used recycled paper for its books in the past , but Good insists that “ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ” presents a particularly big challenge for the publisher because of the sheer number of books that need to be published .
She added that sixty - five percent of the book will be printed on FSC - certified paper is quite an accomplishment .
“ Other publishers do n’t have a million print run of a single book .
So getting enough paper to print 12 million copies of a single book at the same time -- it is very hard to procure that amount . ”
A senior manager at Rainforest Alliance , which worked with Scholastic to obtain the vast amounts of FSC - certified paper , said that the environmentally - conscious forestry industry has grown quickly in the last two years .
“ One of the things that ’s really rather notable about this is that in the fairly tight time frames that ( Scholastic ) worked in to identify who could get them what paper , they were able to find significant amounts in the marketplace , ” said Liza Murphy , Rainforest Alliance senior manager of marketing development in sustainable forestry .
“ And what that speaks to is over the last two years there ’s been a tremendous increase in FSC - certified forests , and as a result we ’re seeing product move through the supply chains in abundant amounts , ” she added .
20040619 CMcC : A late night on Tcl Chatroom , some wild ideas , here 's one :
What if Python had a new additional parser which made it look like Tcl ?
I envisage it as follows :
a line of input is broken up into elements , as per the Endekalogue .
the 0th element of the resulting list is resolved as an object , or the name of an object the resolved object is inspected for a .__tcl__ method which is then called with the entire line as arguments .
if there is no .__tcl__ method , the 1st element is treated as a method on the 0th object , and invoked on the object with the usual Python calling convention .
the default .__tcl__ method calls the object with args 1..n with the usual Tcl calling convention .
There are assumed to be a bunch of objects inheriting from a TclCommand class , e.g. if foreach while set ( etc etc )
Add uplevel to Python and voila - you have something which looks ( very nearly ) like Tcl , but is running over Python .
I really think this is feasible .
It could give you Tcl script level compatibility in Python , I think .
Let the games begin :)
Interesting idea .
Note that there are also some deeper differences to mull over , such as copy - on - write ( side - effect - less changes to lists ) , and the event model .
- jcw
I believe Python gives you an ability to inspect the refcount on a list , if not it would be easy to do .
Then the set of commands where this would matter include set lset lappend and a few others .
They need to inspect refcount and copy before writing .
Python has a complete event driven framework as a library , I believe you could integrate that to preserve the event driven model .
As a thought experiment , it raises the question what is tcl ? in a new context .
One could rename every command in the language , or change all of their conventions ( say : ' proc ' using mandatory indenting to indicate block nesting , IF expr lt.gt.eq - FORTRAN with line numbers . )
One could add GOTO to the language ( with difficulty , admittedly ) and turn it into BASIC
One could certainly remove the event model .
One could implement list operations as mutable ... would the result still be tcl , or not ?
When would the result stop being tcl ?
parsetcl makes special cases of the following commands : if , while , for , foreach , catch , proc ... are these the only places where tcl 's usual syntax is upset ... the only places where an uplevel would be needed to implement ?
Are these the core syntactic commands ?
Lars H :
The commands currently recognised by parsetcl are by no means the complete set , but merely those most common commands with script arguments that could be handled with a minimal amount of code ( switch is missing since it would require a list - from - string parser ) .
One of the beautiful things about Tcl is that one can create new control structures ( see e.g. returneval and breakeval on the return page ) , so any reasonably generic mechanism for cross-referencing
Tcl code would have to work from a database of commands that can be extended with the non-standard control structures that the code uses .
Passing code as data is an important part of Tcl .
These are some of the issues that RS 's a little language experiments raise ... is tcl a language , or a way of implementing a language + a toolkit ?
-- CMcC - RS : I 'd say Tcl is just both - " The chameleon language " ...
Tcl gives me so much freedom as no other language has before .
Another thing this thought experiment suggests is that tcl has a metasyntax , in that it would seem to be possible to actually embed many languages at a tcl syntactic level without using the tcl core at all .
I leave PERL as an exercise for the demented .
Scott Nichols
It 's Defiantly possible .
Developers have done similar things for Java JACL .
The company I currently work for is using JACL with JavaServer pages .
I guess the idea was it would be easier for someone to learn Tcl than JavaServer pages .
CMcC I just wrote a stand - alone lexer for Tcl in http://sharedtech.dyndns.org/~colin/tclparser.tar.gz
- handles the Endekalogue , generates a tree ( could do anything - call Python , as detailed above , for example . )

b5 media recently announced a partnership with Glam Media , regarding a bunch of blogs aimed at women .
The press release left us a bit unsatisfied , though , so b5 media CEO Jeremy Wright went on record for this 901 am exclusive .
You recently announced a partnership with the Glam Network , which says that select blogs will join their network .
How does this work for b5 and the bloggers in terms of ownership and revenue share ?
To be fair , the wording of the press release , and the way Glam has operated in the past has probably created a bit of confusion .
Whatâ€™s really going on here is simply a partnership .
They sell our ads and get to resyndicate our content on their network , and we get better ad sales than we can currently do while providing some promotional space for their network in return .
Itâ€™s a real win-win and basically a no - brainer all around .
Just over 25 of our blogs now make more money than they did last week and their content gets pushed to a wider audience at the same time .
This isnâ€™t like weâ€™re selling the blogs , giving up any control , passing things off , etc .
So , to answer your last question , content ownership doesnâ€™t change ( bloggers own their content ) and the revenue share doesnâ€™t change as a result of this ( though , very soon , weâ€™ll have an announcement on a new blogger pay structure , anyways , heh ) .
Overall itâ€™s a simple relationship , and one that benefits both parties .
They sell ads and sell them really well , while providing some more exposure for our bloggers .
We get them more revenue by virtue of having a greater reach , and provide exposure for their network .
What does Glam put in here , besides their enormous reach ?
Or maybe thatâ€™s it ?
The point of this deal for us was revenue .
I honestly believe b5 has done a pretty kick - ass job at bringing on great writers who write fantastic content .
These days they produce somewhere between 150-300 posts per day .
Since we launched a year and a bit ago , we really have focused on creating valuable content â€ “ and effectively figuring that if you have enough traffic itâ€™s hard not to make money with it .
Now that our costs have increased , though ( staff , servers , new pay structure ) , revenue needs to increase as well .
So over the next year youâ€™ll definitely see more deals which help us generate more revenue â€ “ basically for doing what weâ€™ve always done : great content , written by great writers , for great niches .
Iâ€™m sure people are interested to know how this deal came to be .
Who initiated it ?
Glam had kicked off the original advertising / content relationship about 6 months ago with eBeautyDaily .
At the time , Glam was almost exclusively a fashion and beauty network .
Which really meant that only a half dozen or so of our blogs were a potential fit for them .
A few months ago they started branching out into anything women were interested in .
When that change happened , they pushed for a larger relationship .
We haggled over the details and came to an agreement during ad : tech in NYC in November .
Since then itâ€™s taken some time for us to redesign those sites , but now that we have weâ€™re rockin and rolling .
So there was actually a deal with Glam prior to this partnership , to work from ?
Yeah , they were already selling eBeauty Dailyâ€™s ads .
This is largely an extension of that â€ “ branching out into other channels , selling more ad units per page , higher rates , greater exposure , etc .
Itâ€™s simply a natural evolution .
Thatâ€™s not to say it isnâ€™t an important deal for us , itâ€™s just that itâ€™s not like weâ€™ve turned over all operations of the blogs to Glam or anything .
Theyâ€™re selling ads and providing more exposure , and weâ€™re increasing their revenues and providing them with content .
Today Glam , what will it be tomorrow ?
Are you pursuing content partnerships in other niches ?
Weâ€ ™re aggressively pursuing quite a few partnerships .
FeedBurner was one of our first , Glam is a great second partnership , and weâ€™ll see whatâ€™s next .
The truth is that I feel a pretty heavy responsibility to help our bloggers find the largest audience they can , so weâ€ ™re being pretty damned aggressive in finding new partners that can either bring greater visibility to the blogs , the content or the writers themselves .
We ’d like to thank Jeremy for doing this interview .
Be sure to have a lookout for a more in - depth one on the Glam deal and b5 media in general over at Bloggertalks in the near future .

Not everyone was celebrating the passage of the Iraq spending bill on Friday .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , told Truthdig it ’s “ a disaster for the American people . ”
The presidential candidate went on to explain his dissatisfaction with his party : “ It ’s the same kind of thinking that led us into Iraq — that we did n’t have any alternatives . ”
( running time : about 12 mins / 11.2 MB )
Transcript :
James Harris :
This is Truthdig on the phone , Dennis Kucinich , representative from the state of Ohio since 1996 .
Today we have the honor of talking to you just after the bill that passed on the House floor , a bill that will require President Bush to oppose benchmarks for progress on the Iraqi government and link them to the continued presence of American combat troops .
Dennis , is this bill a victory for Democrats ?
Dennis Kucinich : It ’s a disaster for the American people .
The Democrats should have been voting — or come up with a plan to get out of Iraq .
Not one that ’s going to keep us there a year or two .
It ’s the same kind of thinking that led us into Iraq — that we did n’t have any alternatives .
It ’s the same thing that caused the Democrats to construct a plan that will keep us there at least for a year , and saying , well , we do n’t have any other alternatives .
I can tell you something , we could have come up with a plan that would have called for the troops to come home in the next few months .
But we did n’t do that , so I , no one can tell me it ’s a time for celebration .
It ’s a disaster .
Harris :
What should we do instead , Dennis ?
Kucinich :
We should be listening to what the American people had to say last October , and that is taking steps to immediately end the war .
And that means to set in motion a plan to end the occupation , close the bases , bring the troops home using money that ’s already in the pipeline to do so .
At the same time there ’s a parallel process of bringing in international security and peacekeeping forces to stabilize Iraq .
And we can get that help once we end the occupation .
Then you have to have a number of other steps that are taken .
Most people are n’t aware that this bill that Congress passed sets the stage for the privatization of Iraq ’s oil , oil industry .
To have the Democratic Party involved in something like that is outrageous .
Furthermore , we should be pushing for the stabilization of Iraq ’s food and energy crisis .
There ’s no talk about that .
Basically we ’re blaming Iraq for the disaster that the United States and this administration visited upon them .
We ’re telling them , either they ’re going to get their house in order or we ’re going to leave .
Well , you know what , this approach is wrongheaded and the Democrats should have known better and they should have done better .
Harris : Nancy Pelosi , I think she ’s partying right now .
She feels like she ’s done a good job .
I ’m going to say , Dennis , that I think she has done a good job if you follow the diplomatic line of things .
She could n’t go in with guns blazing and saying “ get those troops out . ”
These benchmarks do mean something .
Kucinich :
Why could n’t she have said : “ This war must end ” ?
Congress has the power to cut off funds .
Congress has the power to limit the funds .
Congress could have taken a new direction .
Let ’s face it , Democrats are expected to do that .
…
We need to go in a new direction .
And that direction is out .
And the fact that we gave the president money today to keep the war going through the end of his term constitutes a sellout of the interests of the American people .
And a continuation of the war for another year at least , possibly two , and this is just wrong .
Just totally wrong .
Josh Scheer : Now with the president , he said he ’s going to veto this .
And he said this is an act of political theater .
And this bill will go nowhere .
How is this going to effect the funding ?
Is he going to get that , or is he going to try to line - item it ?
Kucinich : First of all , the Democrats were too quick to compromise .
For the president to call it political theater shows the contempt he has for Congress .
And Congress has a responsibility to challenge this administration ’s conduct of the war ; they did n’t do it .
They gave the president a license to continue to prosecute the war , and the president said , look , I ’m not going along with any restrictions you want to put on me .
He does n’t intend to .
He intends to keep this war going .
And when you consider that 218 Democrats or 216 Democrats voted for this bill and you match that to the 212 Republicans , or , excuse me , 208 — I believe it was 210 Republicans that voted against it — the president has enough support in the Congress to keep the war going .
That ’s pretty clear .
What about what the American people think ?
Is n’t this supposed to be representative government ?
Do you think that support for the war has really grown ?
Not by a long shot has it grown .
What ’s happened is that support for the war is being tolerated inside the Congress .
This is upside down .
If the Democrats had told the American people in October 2006 , “ Vote Democrat , we ’ll keep the war going till the end of Bush ’s term ; vote Democrat , we ’ll privatize Iraq ’s oil ; vote Democrat , we ’ll give the president enough money to attack Iran if he so chooses , ” the American people would have never voted Democrat .
But guess what , they did vote Democrat , and the Democrats have turned around and handed the president a license to keep that war going , and that ’s not even enough for him .
Because he does n’t want any restrictions placed on him , and the fact of the matter is even if they put restrictions on him he would n’t follow them anyhow .
Scheer : Now , what about the speaker , because she comes from probably one of the most liberal districts in the country , in San Francisco .
She got fiery right before she became the speaker .
What ’s her responsibility ?
Why did she tone it down ?
Why is she compromising with the president ?
Kucinich : Speaker Pelosi has her own problem ; I ’m talking about the entire Democratic caucus here .
I ’m saying that Democrats should have stood for getting out of Iraq immediately , and we did n’t .
And the war is going to go on .
The bottom line out of all this is that the president got money to keep the war going .
He ’ll veto it , and it ’ll come back to Congress to come up with a plan that will be even weaker .
We should have come out very strong ; we knew he was going to veto it anyhow .
We should have come out strong and indicated that the Democrats stand for truly getting out of Iraq .
We did n’t show that by this bill .
You could say , “ Well , we reached a timeline ” ; that does n’t mean a thing .
People say , well , constitutionally it means everything .
If it means everything then why did n’t we set a timeline of 90 days .
Why a year , why a year and a half ?
We just have to put an end to this nonsense .
We ’ve got to get out of Iraq .
This war is destroying the aspirations of people , for housing , healthcare , education .
It ’s ruining America ’s reputation in the world .
It ’s destabilizing the region .
The president ’s rattling the sabers against Iran , he can use money in this bill to attack Iran .
They took out a provision in this bill that would have caused him to have to come back to Congress .
It will privatize the oil of Iraq .
They call this a victory ?
For whom ?
Harris : Dennis , I ’ve been listening to you since probably 2003 when you really started to come on strong in the election .
You have n’t wavered on your position about Iraq .
You ’ve always felt that we need to walk in and take the troops out .
I think that you ’re quite honest when you say that Democrats did n’t follow through on their promise to get us out of Iraq .
Will there really be a change in policy in the way that Democrats are trying to tear down this Republican house ?
Kucinich :
We have to move past partisanship here .
You know , there was a lot of talk about voting with the team today .
About Democratic unity .
For what ?
For war ?
Are you kidding ?
I mean , how about unity for peace ?
How about unity to challenge unilateralism ?
How about unity for healthcare , for education , for jobs ?
You know , because all those aspirations are directly affected to the degree that we continue to spend more money for war .
Do n’t forget , we ’re talking about at least a hundred billion dollars .
All this money going for war .
It just has to stop .
We are at a turning point in this country ’s history .
Either we ’re going to make a real commitment to peace and to diplomacy and international cooperation , or we ’re going to descend into some lower circle of Dante ’s Inferno where we have nothing but destruction and where we have all hope lost .
We have to take a new direction , and that ’s what I stand for .
I do n’t like having to vote against a majority of the people I serve with in the Congress , but I have to tell you something : I could n’t see any other place to be today .
And you have to remember that I proposed an alternative which is still viable .
And it ’s HR 1234 , and it ’s the plan to end the Iraq war , and it ’s more necessary now than ever .
And when the president vetoes the bill , as he will , I ’m going to go back to my colleagues and insist that this bill , HR 1234 , is the only way to end the war .
And maybe that will be the time that they see the necessity of standing for peace .
Harris :
Where can we read about HR 1234 ?
Kucinich :
Go to my website at kucinich.us , OK ?
Scheer : Great , thank you , Dennis .
The president seems a little bit lost .
I do n’t know if impeachment , I do n’t know about any of these options .
How about you ?
I just want to have a discussion about this .
It seems the president has lost his mind .
And it seems like the Congress is going any way they feel .
It seems like they ’re going in the direction the president is going .
And you know , even if you do n’t like Dennis or Ron Paul or somebody who ’s saying end the war — John Edwards — it ’s interesting , what are the people supposed to do ?
I do n’t live in San Francisco ; neither of us [ Scheer and Harris ] live there .
But you [ addressing James Harris ] live [ in the district of Rep. ]
Barbara Lee , who ’s pretty liberal ; Nancy Pelosi ’s in San Francisco :
Is she serving her constituency ?
Are you supposed to vote these people out just to let them know ?
I mean should Pelosi be voted out ?
Harris : I do n’t think Pelosi should be voted out .
I think she has approached the body politic and honored it in the way that it has traditionally been honored .
I mean you do n’t go into a political house , in my mind , and throw up your arms and demand that that man step down , unless you ’re willing to legislate and go through that process .
You want him impeached ?
I say you file the necessary paperwork and impeach the guy .
But I do n’t think there ’s really room for , at least in 2007 , anger on the Senate floor .
I think they have to set the example .
Scheer : Except for Jim Webb .
Who ’s honest .
Harris : Except for Jim Webb .
Scheer :
It just seems there ’s a lack of honesty .
The president seems to be in a bubble , and that ’s my only point .
I ’m not for just going crazy and being angry .
You talk about angry , the fact is they do represent people — the people of the country are angry and they ’re supposed to represent those people .
So you know , you do n’t have to be angry .
I ’m not screaming over the mike , you ’re not screaming over the mike .
People on TV are not screaming over the mike .
There should be a way and it does n’t seem like there ’s a way .
I ’m going to vote :
You know , if a Republican candidate or a libertarian candidate comes out and says end the war and Hillary Clinton does n’t , I ’ll vote for a Republican candidate .
Harris :
You talk about Bush being in the bubble , you remember after Hurricane Katrina his main aide said we had to rush DVDs to this guy so that he would watch the fallout .
He was n’t watching the news .
We know he does n’t read the newspaper .
He is in a bubble and I think influenced by the Lord , as he says ; I think he feels like he ’s doing the right thing , and I think even though Dennis was very unhappy about the Democratic legislation I think Bush is pissed off finally .
I think this legislation at the very least has changed the course and the mind of Bush and he knows he has a fight coming .
So I ’m happy about that .
I understand Dennis ’ argument that there should be more , and that promises were made by the Democratic Party when they won the election .
Scheer : Yeah , promises that are n’t kept .
Harris :
Yes , promises that are not kept .
Well , we ’ll keep it there .
Please keep digging .
And do check out Dennis Kucinich ’s bill HR 1234 .
Give it a Google .
For Josh Scheer and our guest today , Dennis Kucinich , this is James Harris and this is Truthdig .
Sy Hersh joined Wolf on CNN this morning to talk about his new piece in The New Yorker : " How Antonio Taguba , who investigated the Abu Ghraib scandal , became one of its casualties . "
It 's another important story that Sy has brought to our attention .
The lies that were told about the Abu Ghraid scandal are staggering as this WH implemented torture into its playbook and the soul of America .

HERSH : Very simply that the notion , as they told Congress , that our leader , Rumsfeld , Donald Rumsfeld , the secretary of defense and his aides , they all went and testified in May after the stories about Abu Ghraib became public that " Oh , my god , we just did n't know about it until -- we did n't realize how serious it was " is simply not true .
The fact is that , within a few days of the incident first getting reported internally , which was in January of ' 04 , the back channel was flying .
There were messages going .
And the back channel showed very clearly the documents – the actual cables show that Rumsfeld and his aides and Wolfowitz and his aides and the director of the Joint staff , all these senior people at the Pentagon were getting very detailed -- they did n't see the photographs ; they were getting verbal accounts of the photographs that made it very clear .
It does n't pay to do a thorough investigation for this White House as Major Gen.
Taguba found out , but what about Bush 's role in all of this ?
Whether the President was told about Abu Ghraib in January ( when e-mails informed the Pentagon of the seriousness of the abuses and of the existence of photographs ) or in March ( when Taguba filed his report ) , Bush made no known effort to forcefully address the treatment of prisoners before the scandal became public , or to reëvaluate the training of military police and interrogators , or the practices of the task forces that he had authorized .
Instead , Bush acquiesced in the prosecution of a few lower - level soldiers .
The President ’s failure to act decisively resonated through the military chain of command : aggressive prosecution of crimes against detainees was not conducive to a successful career .
( full transcript via CNN below the fold )
BLITZER : Welcome back to " Late Edition . "
I 'm Wolf Blitzer in
Washington .
The Abu Ghraib prison scandal in Iraq was a serious blow to the
reputation of the United States .
Top U.S. military officials insisted
that until the photos of Iraqi prisoners became public in 2004 , they
were unaware of the seriousness of the scandal .
But an article by investigative journalist Seymour Hersh in the
new issue of The New Yorker Magazine about the Abu Ghraib
investigation contradicts that claim , and has a lot more new
information .
Seymour Hersh is joining us here on " Late Edition . "
Sy , thanks very much for coming in .
Give us the immediate
headline that pops out , in your mind , based on all the reporting , all
the new information that you collected in this article .
HERSH : Very simply that the notion , as they told Congress , that
our leader , Rumsfeld , Donald Rumsfeld , the secretary of defense and
his aides , they all went and testified in May after the stories about
Abu Ghraib became public that " Oh , my god , we just did n't know about
it until -- we did n't realize how serious it was " is simply not true .
The fact is that , within a few days of the incident first
getting reported internally , which was in January of ' 04 , the back
channel was flying .
There were messages going .
And the back channel showed very clearly the documents -- the
actual cables show that Rumsfeld and his aides and Wolfowitz and his
aides and the director of the Joint staff , all these senior people at
the Pentagon were getting very detailed -- they did n't see the
photographs ; they were getting verbal accounts of the photographs that
made it very clear .
It was taken very seriously , within days , from the top to bottom
of the government .
BLITZER : And there 's a quote that you have from Major General
Antonio Taguba , who was in charge of the investigation , a two - star
U.S. Army general , highly respected .
He was brought in early on to investigate .
Then , on May 6 , 2004 ,
he's at a meeting with Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz , all the top brass at the
Pentagon .
And he 's told you , in an interview , on the record with you ,
in this new article .
He said this .
" I described the naked detainee lying on the wet
floor , handcuffed , with an interrogator shoving things up his rectum
and said , ' That 's not abuse .
That 's torture . '
There was quiet . "
Now , that 's what he said , according to himself on May 6 .
Here 's what Rumsfeld said the next day , on May 7 , when he was
testifying before the House Armed Services Committee .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
DONALD RUMSFELD , FMR .
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE :
It breaks our hearts
that , in fact , someone did n't say , wait , look , this is terrible ; we
need to do something to manage -- the legal part of it was proceeding
along fine .
What was n't proceeding along fine is the fact that the president
did n't know and you did n't know and I did n't know .
And as a result ,
somebody just sent a secret report to the press , and there they are .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
BLITZER : All right .
So you want to comment on what you 've
learned , based on your reporting ?
HERSH : What he 's talking about is Taguba did a report that ,
probably , he finished in late February , early March of '04 .
BLITZER : Because he was brought in , in January ?
HERSH : He 's out there -- he 's in Kuwait .
He 's a two - star
general involved in the war , highly , as you say -- I found nobody that
said anything adverse .
He 's a highly respected officer .
It 's just randomness .
They needed a senior officer to
investigate ; you 're it , buddy .
He goes and does it .
And right away ,
he feels the heat because -- I do n't know what made him so special .
Maybe there was the fact that he was born in the Philippines and he
had to work his way up to two - star , which is a tough thing .
He 's not
a big guy .
He had to show many different ways how competent he was .
But he just resolved to tell it straight .
And it was a tough
story .
And he wrote about systematic abuse and torture .
And he was
discouraged , from the very beginning , to go all the way with the
report .
But he kept on doing it .
His report was filed , as I say , probably March 1 .
It was not
even put out or promulgated .
I got a copy of it , not from him -- I
only met him a year ago .
I got a copy of it and published it in the
New Yorker in late April of '04 .
And Rummy , of course -- Rumsfeld , instead of focusing on what
Taguba reported and fixing it , his first reaction is , why did somebody
leak it ?
It 's , sort of , ridiculous .
The fact of the matter is , everybody
at the top , by the middle of January , knew .
The only question I
raised , at the end of the article -- and I 'm sure you 'll ask me about
this in a minute -- is what did the president know , when .
BLITZER : Well , we 're going to get to that in a minute , but here
is what Taguba is quote by you in the article as saying .
" There was
no doubt in my mind that this stuff -- the explicit images , the
photographs -- was gravitating upward .
It was standard operating
procedure to assume that this had to go higher .
The president had to
be aware of this . "
That 's his assumption .
He does n't know it , for sure .
The
president says he did n't know about it ; he did n't see these pictures
until he saw them on television .
HERSH : It 's not a question of seeing the pictures .
Once they
had the back channel e-mails describing everything , from the field ,
guys were saying , hey , boss , let me tell you what 's going on .
It was very serious stuff .
The messages were all high priority .
And they go to Rumsfeld 's military aide , who is now a four - star
general running NATO , General Craddock .
And the question is , Rumsfeld acknowledged , sort of , in and out
-- it was unclear in his testimony exactly when he told the president ,
but certainly , by March , he 's talking to the president quite a bit
about this .
BLITZER : This was before your article ?
HERSH : Oh , my God , two months .
Is it possible -- you know , the
question you have to ask about the president is this .
No matter when
he learned , and certainly he learned before it became public , and no
matter how detailed it was , is there any evidence that the president
of the United States said to Rumsfeld , what 's going on there , Don ?
Let 's get an investigation going .
Did he do anything ?
Did he ask for a -- did he want to have the
generals come in and talk to him about it ?
Did he want to change the rules ?
Did he want to improve the
conditions ?
BLITZER : And what 's the answer ?
HERSH : Nada .
He did nothing .
And you know what it meant ?
Inside the chain of command , the military , you get a bad case
like this ; it 's all known inside ; nobody at the top says another word
to you .
Everybody understands one thing : this is not a way to get
ahead in a career , to start being very tough ...
BLITZER : Here 's the White House response .
We asked the White
House for a response to your article .
" The president addressed this
fully .
He first saw the pictures on TV and he was upset by them .
He
called for the investigation to go forward .
He found the actions
abhorrent and urged the Defense Department to get to the bottom of the
matter .
HERSH : It 's not when they saw the photographs .
It 's when they
learned how serious it was .
They were told in memos what the
photographs showed .
They showed this .
They showed that .
And you know , something else I wrote about -- they showed other ,
more sexual abuse than we knew , the sodomy of women prisoners by
American soldiers , a father and a son forced to do acts together .
There was more stuff that 's been made public .
And you did n't need a photograph if you get a verbal description
of it .
And it 's quite explicit .
It 's reprinted in the New Yorker
article .
They knew very quickly this was bad .
BLITZER : One of the most disturbing parts of the article is the
way General Taguba , after he filed his report , was treated by the U.S .
military , by the U.S. army , effectively forced out .
At one point , I believe you wrote this -- basically , he was told
to get out .
HERSH : What happened was , he was in Doha , working as a two - star
general involved ...
BLITZER : In Qatar ?
HERSH : Yes , in Qatar , involved in the war .
And he was supposed
to go -- his assignment was to be , in June , to go to the third Army
headquarters .
Whether he was going to be a three - star general or not ,
he was certainly highly respected and very well regarded .
Suddenly , he 's told , in April , you 're going back to the Pentagon ,
being assigned to Reserve Affairs .
And you 're going to be -- he was
told by , actually , a very senior general , they 're going to watch you
there .
His career was effectively shunted .
And there 's a scene --
there 's a horrible scene I described , in the locker room , here , a few
months after he does his report .
He 's exercising and he 's getting dressed .
And there is Rumsfeld
with Larry DiRita , at that time the spokesman .
And he says hello to
the secretary .
He says , hello , General .
And then DiRita says , it was
a bad day in the press about Abu Ghraib , or something .
DiRita says to him , look what you started , General ; you see what
you did ?
Taguba said to me , it 's as if I 'm the problem now .
BLITZER : We got a reaction from Larry DiRita to that element .
He said , " General Taguba managed a difficult assignment to the best of
his abilities .
I never heard the secretary express any view other
than that about General Taguba 's work .
General Taguba 's assertions to
the contrary are unfair and wrong . "
Sy Hersh , we 've got to leave it right there , unfortunately .
Strong article , as usual , in The New Yorker Magazine .
Thanks for
coming in .
HERSH : Glad to be here .
But how do the fashionable decide what the next big thing is ?
Or perhaps more to the point : how does the fashion industry convey to their consumers what they should be wearing ?
How does the industry “ anchor ” the consumers in this season ’s fashions ?
This is where copying comes in .
If all the designers are showing baby doll dresses in the spring of 2006 , then there ’s a good chance that is what everybody will be wearing by the summer of 2006 .
Mr. Raustiala and Mr. Sprigman argue that the lack of intellectual property protection actually promotes the functioning of the industry .
If the extension of copyright to fashion prevented clothes manufacturers from copying each other , the industry would be ceding a major role to the lawyers and become much less creative .
We ’d see the same thing year after year .
In other words , women ’s fashion would look much more like men ’s fashions — boring , boring , boring .
Since I have the same fashion sense that most economists have — that is , none whatsoever — I cannot attest to the accuracy of the law professors ’ description of the fashion industry .
But it is consistent with other examples of what happens when there is no intellectual property protection .
The United States did not protect copyrights of foreign authors until 1891 , since it was just too tempting to ride free on the production of those great 19th - century British authors .
Clipper ships used to carry copies of Charles Dickens ’s latest book to America , where it was quickly rushed into print by dozens of printers and sold for next to nothing .
Critics complained that these hastily produced books were poorly printed and cheaply manufactured .
That may have been bad for books , but it is not such a big deal for that cheap , but fashionable hoodie sweatshirt your teenage son bought a few months ago , since he is n’t going to wear it next season anyway .
The United States started recognizing international copyright in 1891 partly to protect American writers from cheap foreign competition like the Dickens volumes .
This was almost certainly the right thing to do , particularly since copyrights held by Americans received reciprocal recognition abroad .
But not every industry necessarily benefits from strong intellectual property protection .
In some cases , it appears that lack of protection can lead to a more vibrant and dynamic industry .
Global Warming Not the End of the World as We Know It
How bad is climate change really ?
Are catastrophic floods and terrible droughts headed our way ?
Despite widespread fears of a greenhouse hell , the latest computer simulations are delivering far less dramatic predictions about tomorrow 's climate .
The times , they are a changin ’  and the signs are all around us .
The American people are sick unto death of the Iraq war , and this growing dissatisfaction with American foreign policy spans the political spectrum : it is n’t just the Left that is singing “ we ai n’t marchin ’ anymore , ” it ’s moderates and even conservatives .
The recantation of Walter “ Freedom Fries ” Jones was the harbinger of a mounting trend , and as disaster piles on fresh disaster in the killing fields of Mesopotamia , the conservative case for the war gets harder to make  and more prominent figures on the Right are dissenting from the Bush - neocon orthodoxy .
Conservative dissent on the war question has been present from the very beginning : Pat Buchanan has been a vocal critic of the War Party since Gulf War I .
The American Conservative magazine , which Buchanan co-founded with Taki Theodoracopulos and Scott McConnell , was launched to give voice to those on the Right who reject the neoconservative “ liberationism ” of the Bush administration as a “ Jacobin ” invention , as Claes Ryn , a prominent conservative professor , so trenchantly put it .
Others have since joined Buchanan , Ryn , and the other conservatives and libertarians who were denounced as “ unpatriotic ” by David “ Axis of Evil ” Frum , the neocon enforcer of political correctness , in the pages of National Review  when he announced that he and all good little movement ( neo ) conservatives would henceforth “ turn our backs ” on those perfectly awful “ unpatriotic conservatives . ”
That this now means Frum must turn his back on the founder of National Review is an irony worth contemplating .
William F. Buckley Jr. has recently argued that the war is a “ failure , ” along with the policy that spawned it , and that it is time for conservatives to reconsider their blind support .
Without quite saying it , Buckley ’s chief concern seems to be that the GOP ship will go down with the neocons who have hijacked it , and this political consideration is precisely what motivated a group of Republican congressmen to troop to the White House the other day and bluntly declare they ’d had just about enough .
As even some of the neocons , such as Francis Fukuyama  who famously proclaimed the “ end of history ”  abjure their errors and the rats jump ship , “ movement ” conservatives are following suit .
Back before the war started , Cliff Kincaid , a conservative activist and writer associated with Accuracy in Media ( AIM ) , a longtime mainstay of “ movement ” conservatism , penned a piece entitled “ Antiwar Conservatives ? ” that questioned the existence of such an exotic species .
Like the unicorn and the sphinx , this creature , he averred , was only talked about yet never seen , and he specifically took me to task for allying with the “ far Left ” in a united front against the war .
Right after the invasion was launched , I appeared with him on MSNBC to debate the war : the country , I said , was against the invasion , and an increasing number of fairly conservative Republicans  such as Ron Paul  were speaking out against it .
For his part , Kincaid wondered aloud how in touch with the national zeitgeist it was possible to be out in San Francisco .
Now that most of the rest of the nation is aligned with my fellow San Franciscans , however , Kincaid has done a turnaround : he not only acknowledges the existence of antiwar conservatives , but has also become one of their most eloquent defenders against the know - nothings of the neoconized GOP .
The neocons are in a tizzy about the heresy of Ron Paul at the South Carolina Republican presidential debates , when he dared state the obvious : that al - Qaeda is “ over here ” because we are “ over there . ”
Rudy Giuliani ’s Mussolini -esque eruption and Paul ’s defiant - yet - reasonable refusal to recant has become the fulcrum of the right wing ’s agony over an issue that could sink the GOP , marginalize conservatives , and give us President Hillary Clinton .
Kincaid wisely recognizes that the neocon response to Paul ’s speaking truth to power is intellectually dishonest .
What ’s even more heartening , however , is Kincaid ’s anger over the attempted smearing of Rep.
Paul :
“ In a desperate attempt to make Rudy Giuliani out to be the hero of Tuesday night ’s debate , Fox News is continuing to attack Texas Congressman Ron Paul for something he did not say .
In the latest installment of this campaign , John Gibson of Fox News says that Paul ‘ suggested that the U.S. actually had a hand in the [ 9/11 ] terrorist attacks . ’
No , what he said was that U.S. foreign policy was a reason why Osama bin Laden attacked America .
This is a fact .
“ Gibson ’s comment shows how Fox News has been eager to slant the news in favor of Giuliani , who claimed in his famous response to Paul that the congressman had said that the U.S. ‘ invited ’ the 9/11 attacks .
That was false , too . ”
The outright lie that Paul is part of the “ 9/11 Truth ” movement , which holds that the U.S. government itself pulled off the biggest terrorist attack in American history , is the latest edition of the smear - Ron-Paul campaign that has taken off since the showdown with America ’s Mafioso Mayor .
The canard that Paul justifies terrorism is eagerly spread by the smarmy Gibson and the ridiculous Michelle Malkin , a cocoa Coulterite who , like the original white - bread version , makes an art out of self - caricature .
Even after the complete falsehood of her charge against Paul was pointed out , and acknowledged by her , Malkin still did her best to wriggle out of it by trying to weave a very tenuous connection between Paul and the Truthers .
The woman has zero integrity and even less credibility , but the smear campaign rolls on .
As Kincaid put it :
“ Ron Paul is being viciously attacked over this issue because some people do n’t want to consider the implications , which Paul is honest enough from his perspective to spell out .
These implications are that the U.S. should withdraw from the region , supposedly to spare the U.S. from any further attacks .
That is the Ron Paul approach , and he claims it is what President Reagan would do .
It may be naïve to some , but he cites Reagan ’s withdrawal of U.S. troops from Lebanon after 241 of them were murdered in a suicide bombing .
He thinks no good can come from U.S. involvement in such an irrational part of the world . ”
Kincaid probably does n’t agree with Paul ’s analysis in its entirety , but he is honest enough to call a foul when he sees it .
Chances are he is fairly typical of conservative activists in the GOP , not the bought - and - sold “ leadership ” but the rank - and - file , and therein lies a golden opportunity for Paul  and the antiwar movement .
Rudy , for his part , continues to display his utter ignorance and determination to demagogue his way to the White House by touting his confrontation with Paul .
Speaking in New York with Sen. John McCain , he claimed that the six Albanians recently busted for plotting to attack Fort Dix and kill American soldiers proves that he , not Paul , is right about Why They Hate Us : “ Why [ did they want to kill our soldiers ] ? ” he asked his audience , according to Stephen Spruiell of National Review .
“ Because we had some attacks on Iraq in the 1990s ?
I do n’t think so . ”
Think again , Rudy : according to news accounts of the case , one of the defendants , Eljvir Duka , was recorded as saying , “ In the end , when it comes to defending your religion , when someone attacks your religion , your way of life , then you go jihad . ”
This sounds very much like the same litany of complaints that OBL and his gang have used to recruit an ever - growing army of terrorists to their banner : America ’s war on Iraq , they say , is part of its general war on Islam itself .
Furthermore , there is every indication that most if not all of the Fort Dix terrorists were trained by the Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA ) , which was aided by the U.S. in its fight against the Serbs  and for whose sake we initiated a bombing campaign that ended in the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the fall of Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic .
Here the parallels with al - Qaeda  nurtured in the bosom of the U.S. - funded - and - supported Afghan insurgency against the Soviets in the 1980s  are even clearer .
Once again , “ blowback ” has blown back in our faces .
We armed these guys , we trained them , we funded and encouraged them in waging yet another war of “ liberation ”  and today we are fending them off as they try to blow up military installations in the U.S.
Now there ’s gratitude for you !
Although Spruiell does n’t agree with Paul ’s conclusions , he is clearly appalled by the blatant disregard for logic and plain old common sense displayed by Paul ’s enemies in the GOP :
“ Excuse this interruption of presidential politics for a quick moment with a reality check :
What ’s the big deal with admitting that our pre-invasion policies toward Iraq  the sanctions , the no-fly zones , the bases to protect Saudi Arabia from Saddam ’s lunatic aggression  were used to justify mass slaughter in Osama bin Laden ’s various fatwas against America ?
That does n’t make him right .
It just identifies one dynamic at work in the evil worldview of a madman . ”
A reality check is precisely what the neocons who control the Republican political machine fear the most .
That ’s because they do n’t acknowledge any version of reality other than their own , and they ca n’t afford to , either  or else the whole fabric of their elaborate fantasy of the U.S. as the noble “ liberator ” of Iraq will start to come apart at the seams .
As journalist Ron Suskind recounted a discussion with a top White House official :
“ The aide said that guys like me were ‘ in what we call the reality - based community , ’ which he defined as people who ‘ believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality . ’
I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism .
He cut me off .
‘ That ’s not the way the world really works anymore , ’ he continued .
‘ We ’re an empire now , and when we act , we create our own reality .
And while you ’re studying that reality  judiciously , as you will  we ’ll act again , creating other new realities , which you can study too , and that ’s how things will sort out .
We ’re history ’s actors and you , all of you , will be left to just study what we do . ' ”
Up until now , the GOP has been living in a bubble , along with the president , denying that we were losing , and that we got ourselves into an awful mess : the “ good news , ” they claimed , was n’t being reported , on account of the media ’s alleged “ antiwar bias . ”
That , at least , is what Kincaid seemed to sincerely believe when we debated on MSNBC two years ago .
Today , however , he seems ready to acknowledge that there is a problem and that the fault is n’t to be found with the media , or with someone like Ron Paul who dares to say that the emperor has no clothes , but with his fellow conservatives .
This is progress , and Paul ’s candidacy is the catalyst .
Of course , Ron has a lot of obstacles to overcome , not the least of which is the liberal bias of “ mainstream ” media  yes , Cliff , I agree with you on that one !
Anyone who votes against government programs as a matter of high principle and who insists on taking the letter of the Constitution seriously , as Rep .
Paul consistently does , is going to have to endure much from skeptical journalists  such as CNN ’s John King Sunday , who , during an interview with Paul , scoffed at his low poll numbers .
Of course , the polls do n’t mean much six months before the first primary .
It is foolish to write off Paul ’s potential appeal at this stage  especially to New Hampshire voters , who will set the tone for the race .
Remember , Pat Buchanan took New Hampshire in 1992 , and Rep. Paul has a lot in common with the Buchanan Brigades , who may turn out in full pitchfork mode for the conservative - libertarian congressman from Texas .
The smug assurances from both establishment liberals and the folks over at Fox News that Paul is a meaningless blip in the online polls  supposedly “ manipulated ” by Paul ’s online Machiavellis  could be very short - lived .
No , online polls are n’t an accurate measure of a candidate ’s popular support  but they do measure something , and that is the degree of support among his or her followers .
And this can translate into a measure of future support , given the candidate ’s ability to attract attention and build on this enthusiastic base .
Rudy ’s rudeness has backfired .
In response to the effort to paint Paul as a Republican John Walker Lindh who must be waterboarded until he confesses all , Ron has attracted some prominent defenders : Bill Maher , Andrew Sullivan , and others who might not agree with all of Paul ’s message but who are nevertheless outraged at this brazen attempt to intimidate him and drive him out of the GOP .
Six months from now , as the war gets even worse and the “ surge ” has n’t amounted to a hill of beans , what Paul is saying will be the emerging conventional wisdom , so much so that even the Republican leadership will have to acknowledge it .
Provided he continues to do well in fundraising , Paul ’s poll numbers could spiral rapidly upward as the Iraqi occupation and the sock - puppet “ government ” of Iraq plunges downward into oblivion .
Which brings to mind a famous saying of Gandhi’s :
“ First they ignore you , then they ridicule you , then they fight you , then you win . ”
They do n’t dare ignore him , and ridicule is n’t working : now they ’re engaging him , but it is already too late for that .
In raising the issue of our failed foreign policy in the very arena that the War Party has always counted as its exclusive domain , Ron Paul has already won .
The neocons may be able to retain control of the GOP until November ’ 08 , but Iraq really is their Waterloo .
The blame for the coming defeat of the GOP will fall squarely on their shoulders  and then it wo n’t be Ron Paul who will be driven out of the party .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
Check out my joint appearance with Jerusalem Post columnist Michael Freund on Jewcy.com , debating the question “ Should we bomb Iran ? ”
The fun starts here
If you were reading someone else ’s code you would want it to be commented , so … comment your code .
When I was in undergrad it seemed that all the professors were really anal about programming assignments being super commented .
We always had to give each function a huge comment block header that described in detail what the function was all about , including sections on preconditions , postconditions and side effects .
We were also expected to litter the code with single line comments to explain everything , I mean absolutely everything .
All of my assignments ended up having more comments than actual code .
I starting thinking that this is how code is supposed to be .
Then I got my first job as a programmer , it was just a summer job while I was still in school .
It was a small team of four , with me being the newbie .
My first task involved writing a few simple classes .
So , I did how I was taught , I wrote the code along with reams and reams of comments .
When the lead developer saw all my comments he got upset .
I was shocked , is n’t that how it ’s supposed to be done ?
He said all those comments were a big pain because if he wanted to change the code he would have to update the comments as well or else they would go out of sync .
He said that my comments actually harmed maintainability .
So I asked him ; do n’t you think comments make code easier to understand ?
His reply ; that you should write code that is so clean and readable that it does n’t even need any comments to be understood .
This shook me to the core ( a bit melodramatic I know ) .
Up until this point I was convinced that for code to be readable and maintainable it must be verbosely commented .
So I started writing code without comments just like the other developers .
The code was clean and well formatted with descriptive variable and method names .
Still , there were times when I had to read the other developers code and it was n’t immediately clear to me what the code was all about .
Even though the code was clean it still took time to dig through it to figure out what was really going on .
Some comments would have helped .
Then I realized what was really going on .
The lead developer had designed everything himself and had done the majority of the coding , he was also overseeing everyone else ’s code contributions , that ’s why he had no trouble understanding everything .
The rest of us did n’t have that luxury .
Clean code is something ever programmer should strive for , but sometimes the only way to relay the true intent of the programmer is to put a little snippet of natural language inline with the code itself .
I believe that the thoughts in a programmer ’s head that exist while writing the code are just as important as the code itself .
At a previous job I would always stop coding about a half hour before leaving for the day so that I could comment all the code I had written that day .
At my current job I just write comments as I code .
The point is you have to write comments when your understanding of the code is still fresh in your mind .
If you come back to write comments weeks after writing the code you will already have forgotten many of the details .
It bothers me when I have to dig through someone else ’s code and there are absolutely no comments .
No comments means there was n’t any consideration that someone else would need to one day read that code .
I believe a good programmer should be perpetually aware as they are writing code that someday , somewhere , someone else will be reading that code , someone else will need to understand how that code works .
A good programmer should strive to write understandable code .
Not commenting your code is like pissing on a toilet seat in a public washroom , the next guy who comes in is going to have to deal with that .
This leads to the golden rule of comments : I ’m not going saying anything about exactly how you should comment your code or how you should document your programs .
I ’m not talking about using javadoc or doxygen … use whatever you like .
I ’m not saying there should be reams of comments .
If the code is truly simple enough that it does n’t need comments then that ’s a judgment call to be made .
The only guideline I have is that code should be understandable .
Its just common programmer courtesy to try to make code understandable .
Comments ?
An earthquake on Tuesday near Taiwan caused widespread disruption to telephone and Internet networks .
The quake affected an area of the sea bottom with a lot of undersea cables that broke , and since there is only a limited number of cable repair ships , it will take at least weeks to fish them up and splice them .
China and Korea were heavily affected , with most of their connectivity to the rest of the world cut off .
Not surprisingly , this meant that the rest of the world got a lot less spam , too .
Neither country is the haven for overt spammers that it used to be , but both have large broadband networks with vast numbers of virus controlled zombie computers .
One large network in North America saw their mail from Korea drop by 90 % and from China by 99 % .
Since the mail sent from those countries to the US is typically 99 % spam and 1 % legitimate mail , the earthquake 's effect on e-mail was , to a first approximation , to get rid of a lot of spam .
Brett Glass , a journalist who runs a small rural ISP in Wyoming , noted that if the affected countries dealt more effectively with their spam , they might not well have needed all of the capacity they 'd lost .
China and Korea are not alone in sending 99 % spam ; I see many countries in Europe , South America , and elsewhere in Asia that are just as bad .
It would be nice if this were a wakeup call to networks to deal with parasitic usage , but I 'm not holding my breath .

Did you know that Benjamin Franklin never said “ A penny saved is a penny earned ? ”
As popular as the saying is , it does n’t really make sense ( or its meaning is not as clear as it could be ) .
Here ’s what Franklin actually said :
“ A penny saved is twopence dear . ”
Translated , if you save your money you can double it ( or a penny saved is two pennies earned ) .
Ahhh… sound investment advice !
So maybe Ben can help you out in other business matters , even when it comes to marketing on the Internet .
Here are seven wise things that Benjamin Franklin had to say that you can apply in today ’s interactive marketing environment :
1 . “ Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing . ”
The key to online marketing is content , and the ability to write well provides any professional or business owner with an unfair advantage over others , both in terms of social media audiences and with search engines .
Video and podcasting are also ways to effectively communicate , as long as you have something compelling to say .
On the other hand , simply doing or providing something remarkable allows other media - empowered people to do the writing and spread the word for you .
Either way , the lightening - fast viral nature of the Internet allows for unprecedented exposure — but only if you offer truly unique value .
2 . “ Tell me and I forget .
Teach me and I remember .
Involve me and I learn . ”
The days of telling people what you have to offer are mostly over , and without a doubt dead as a doornail online .
Educational marketing via valuable content is the rule of the web , and social media has given us the ability to fully heed Franklin ’s prescient advice .
Educational marketing has morphed into conversational marketing , and the nimble and responsive business will see great advantages by involving prospects and existing customers in a dialogue that is beneficial to everyone involved .
You lose control of the message ( as if control was ever anything other than an illusion ) , but anyone who thinks you can talk “ at ” people online and succeed is deluded .
3 . “ An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest . ”
Benjamin Franklin was a true Renaissance man , and as a polymath accomplished much in the fields of business , politics and science .
In these days of hyper - specialization , it ’s ironic that the broader your knowledge base , the better your odds of not only providing remarkable products and service , but also of devising innovative ways to reach out to your target audience .
Another quote from Franklin illustrates the importance of constant learning : “ If a man empties his purse into his head , no one can take it from him . ”
Invest constantly in keeping up with the latest online marketing developments and techniques , but more importantly , broaden your general knowledge base so as to have more ammunition to drawn upon when faced with new challenges .
4 . “ Drive thy business or it will drive thee . ”
The price of success can be truly expensive .
You work your tail off to develop business through innovative online marketing techniques , only to be buried with work and growing pains when you succeed .
And what ’s the first thing you slack off on when you get busy ?
That ’s right , the production of the very content that got you the business in the first place .
In the very short term , you wo n’t feel it , but if you ’re trying to grow a real business and avoid the feat or famine cycles that are inherent when engaging in marketing only when hungry , the content should never stop .
If you ’re looking to grow , make sure you bring on people that can do the things you should n’t be .
You might be surprised to find that your marketing is the last thing you should hand over to someone else .
5 . “ Energy and persistence conquer all things . ”
One of the most dangerous things about marketing online is the allure of the possibilities .
Yes , it ’s entirely possible that you can write something that spreads like wildfire across the ‘ net .
And yes , it ’s possible that your every prospective customer could find you and jump on board .
The problem is that ’s not likely to just happen .
The truth is , marketing your business online is much like anything else — you work at it consistently and get better as you go along .
As Wood Allen said , “ 90 % of success is showing up , ” and luck come to those who work hard .
6 . “ Any fool can criticize , condemn , and complain and most fools do . ”
I think one of the toughest things for successful offline business people to deal with online is the wide - open nature of social media communication .
Everyone has an opinion , whether qualified or not , and the least qualified are shockingly eager to share .
Plus , there are always the naysayers who will take the time to complain that what you offer or say cannot possibly work for them , regardless of any evidence to the contrary .
The people who succeed in attracting attention online , and converting that attention into cash , are those who take action , try things out , observe , and try again .
The Internet is a medium that allows for unprecedented levels of tracking , testing , and low - cost experimentation , so idle opinions and complaints are even less warranted than at any other time in history .
7 . “ Glass , china , and reputation are easily cracked , and never well mended . ”
Reputation has been paramount to business success since well before horse - and - buggy days , and now news of bad business will spread faster than any other message you might want to communicate .
If you ’re tempted to put one over on people in the interest of short - term gain , you ’d better be ready to close up shop and go do something else .
This does not mean that you should try to please everyone .
Quite to the contrary , you have to fanatically please the people that matter to your business goals , and never sacrifice their interests to please those that ultimately do n’t matter .
Also , be wary of the inevitably opportunity for flame wars and stepping into unrelated controversy .
You ’re not going to change anyone ’s mind , and they ’re not going to change yours , so why bother ?
Stick to speaking to people who want to listen , and concentrate on speaking well .

QuickTime worm uses MySpace to spread
Security researchers warned over the weekend that a QuickTime worm written in Javascript had started to spread among MySpace users .
The worm , dubbed JS / Quickspace .
A by antivirus firm F - Secure and JS .
QSpace by security firm Symantec , uses an cross - site scripting flaw in MySpace to execute a Javascript program embedded in a blank QuickTime movie file .
The worm redirects the user to a phishing page made to look like MySpace 's login page .
" The case looked like simple MySpace phishing , but it was n't obvious to us how the profiles were modified , " Mikko Hyppönen , chief research officer for F - Secure , stated on the company 's research blog .
" After investigating a bit further , it seems that we have a MySpace worm on our hands , using a malicious Quicktime MOV file to spread . "
MySpace users that give their credentials to the phishing site may find their account used for a spam attack that links to a pornographic movie site .
Movies viewed on that site could result in Zango adware being installed on a victim 's system , according to SpywareGuide.com .
The attack comes as security experts are increasingly warning about the dangers of sites that host user - created content .
In particular , features of movie files that allow certain types of scripting have become a popular way to launch malicious software attacks .
Web worms that use cross -site scripting flaws on sites such as MySpace are increasingly a worry .
MySpace could not immediately be reached for comment on the attack .

Accounts at 50 banks are in danger of being plundered
Security firm Sunbelt Software said it stumbled across a US - based server storing megabytes of data stolen from compromised computers while researching spyware infections .
The server held passwords for online accounts from 50 banks , Ebay and Paypal logins , hundreds of credit card numbers and reams of personal data .
The FBI has reportedly now started investigating the ring of ID thieves .
Hidden data
The bug that has stolen all the data is thought to be a variant of a family of trojans known as Dumaru or Nibu that exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft 's Internet Explorer browser .
The trojan , a malicious piece of code , automatically downloaded itself on computers when people visited sites harbouring the program .
The way the data is laid out , the quality of it , it 's very easy to go through and use it for nefarious purposes
Eric Sites , Sunbelt Software
What made this bug so effective was its ability to grab text stored on the clipboard and by Internet Explorer , said Eric Sites , vice president of research and development at Sunbelt Software .
Microsoft 's browser has a feature , called AutoComplete , that automatically populates boxes on web forms where people typically fill in names , addresses , e-mail addresses , credit card numbers and other biographical details .
The feature is supposed to make filling in forms on websites less of a chore .
In this case , said Mr Sites , it helped the ID thieves get hold of enormously valuable data .
Typically a keylogger produces a file containing an unbroken string of characters , said Mr Sites .
" It 's usually very hard to take that and do anything with it , " he told the BBC News website .
By contrast , AutoComplete data is already labelled and sorted because the browser has to know where to put each item .
" The way the data is laid out , the quality of it , it 's very easy to go through and use it for nefarious purposes , " he said .
" This is about getting money and stealing . "
Megabytes of data
The BBC News website was shown the server and some of the files containing personal data that it was storing .
Each file was full of login names , e-mail addresses , credit card details and everything needed to steal someone 's identity or simply empty their bank account .
Analysis of information in the files revealed login details for online services at 50 banks as well as user details for many Ebay and Paypal accounts .
One bank account had more than $ 380,000 in it .
Sunbelt has contacted some of the people identified in the files to warn them that they have fallen victim to the bug .
Banks , credit card firms , Ebay and Paypal have been told about compromised accounts .
The server at the centre of the ID theft ring had many multi-megabyte sized files on it , said Mr Sites .
The server , which was based in the US , was regularly cleaned out by the thieves who created the trojan .
Infected machines sent files back hourly or when the logs of data they were collecting had reached a certain size .
Browser danger
Mr Sites said that , so far , the trojan had been found on porn sites and websites offering cracks for pirated software .
But , he said , the trojan was likely to be on many other websites as it had managed to infect so many users .
Sunbelt believes the trojan has been circulating for about three weeks and in that time has probably infected thousands of victims .
The vulnerability it exploits means that all a user has to do to fall victim is to visit the wrong site .
" Type in a web link and your machine is infected , " said Mr Sites .
" You do not have to click on anything , the website forces the installation . "
Many victims may have no idea that they have been infected .
" This version of the trojan was very successful , " he said .
" It was very small , hard to detect , the file had a very innocuous name and did not cause any problems to the machine .
The size and sophistication of the ID theft ring led anti-virus and security companies to quickly produce tools that can spot if a machine has been compromised by the server and clean up infected machines .
The trojan was tricky to spot because the files being sent back to the server were disguised as data traffic generated by a user 's browser .
The US - based security company has alerted the FBI to the online scam and it is reportedly investigating the matter .

Gonzales testimony contradicts White House , revealing Bush ' conversation ' over US attorney firings Michael Roston
Published : Thursday May 10 , 2007 Print This Email This Weeks after the White House ruled out the involvement of President George W. Bush in any discussions on the firing of 8 US Attorneys , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said on Thursday morning that the President had discussed the matter with advisers in an October 2006 meeting .
" I 've now been made aware of the fact that there was a conversation with the President that basically mentioned the same thing in October of 2006 , " the Attorney General said while answering a question from Rep. Bobby Scott ( D - VA ) .
" The same thing " referred to voter fraud cases in three US Attorneys ' districts , which Gonzales earlier acknowledged had been raised by Karl Rove in a meeting " sometime in the Fall of 2006 . "
Gonzales ' statement varied from remarks by White House spokespersons that the President had not been involved in any discussions of firing US Attorneys .
" I have said on the record for several weeks now that there is no indication that the President knew about any of the ongoing discussions over the two years , nor did he see a list or a plan before it was carried out , " said White House Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino on March 27 , 2007 .
Furthermore , in a March 21 press briefing , White House Press Secretary Tony Snow had been asked about a Nov. 15 , 2006 e-mail from former Gonzales chief of staff D. Kyle Sampson to former White House Counsel Harriet Miers asking " Who will determine whether this requires the President 's attention ? "
Snow was then asked " did the President have to sign off on this ? " referring to the firing of the Attorneys , to which he responded , " The President has no recollection of this ever being raised with him . "
A reporter later clarified , " Just to follow , did you say , again for the record , that the President has no recollection of ever being asked about any of this ? "
Snow answered , " Yes , the removal  yes , that is correct . "
RAW STORY was awaiting a reply from the White House at press time on whether or not they agreed that Gonzales ' remark contradicted earlier White House statements .
An aide to Rep. Linda Sanchez ( D - CA ) , one of the Judiciary Committee members who is leading the investigation of the firings of the Attorneys , said Gonzales ' remark prompted a need for further inquiry .
" You can be sure that the Committee will look for more information on this meeting and any other interactions the White House had with DoJ on the firings , " the aide told RAW STORY in an e-mail Thursday afternoon .
While the White House had not commented to RAW STORY , a March 13 press conference with White House Counselor Dan Bartlett made note of the October discussion between Gonzales and Bush .
" Over the course of several years we have received complaints about U.S. attorneys , particularly when it comes to election fraud cases -- not just New Mexico , but also Wisconsin and Pennsylvania ... in a conversation he had with the Attorney General in October of 2006 , in which , in a wide - ranging conversation on a lot of different issues , this briefly came up and the President said , I 've been hearing about this election fraud matters from members of Congress , want to make sure you 're on top of that , as well , " Bartlett told reporters .
But he insisted that the firing of US Attorneys was not discussed .
" There was no directive given , as far as telling him to fire anybody or anything like that .
That would be under the prerogative of the Justice Department to take a look at those issues , as they obviously were doing , " he said .
However , Gonzales ' remarks seemed to put the October discussion in a new light .
The Attorney General linked a question about the White House seeking the firing of US Attorneys with the Bush conversation that Bartlett insisted had no ' directive ' for firings .
Rep. Scott had asked the Attorney General if the White House sought the removal of any Attorneys .
" Did the White House ask you to seek the removal of any US Attorney ? " the Virginia Democrat asked .
" I have recollection of Mr. Rove raising concerns about prosecutors and voter fraud cases in three districts , " Gonzales answered .
He then brought up the October 2006 conversation with the President as another instance in which ' the same thing ' had been discussed .

It 's not much , but it is an honest days work .
When white Americans were asked in a new study to pick a dollar amount they would have to be paid to live the rest of their lives as a black person , most requested less than $ 10,000 .
A minor thing .
In contrast , study participants said they would have to be paid about $ 1 million to give up television for the rest of their lives .
This would seem to state that white people do n't think being black is such a big deal in 2007 .
Not the case at all , says Philip Mazzocco , co-author of a new study study and assistant professor of psychology at Ohio State University 's Mansfield campus .
Instead , he says the results suggest most white Americans do n't truly comprehend the persisting racial disparities in our country .
“ The costs of being black in our society are very well documented , ” Mazzocco said .
“ Blacks have significantly lower income and wealth , higher levels of poverty , and even shorter life spans , among many other disparities , compared to whites . ”
Mazzocco seems to be saying this is either something fundamental to black people or that bigotry is so pervasive black families cannot escape it .
Yet , if either is the case , how can his study be valid ?
What is the margin of error if the white people taking the test are so prejudiced against blacks that they would intentionally oppress them yet will still lie on an an anonymous survey about it ?
“ When whites say they would need $ 1 million to give up TV , but less than $ 10,000 to become black , that suggests they do n't really understand the extent to which African Americans , as a group , are disadvantaged , ” Mazzocco said .
Or it may be that white people see blacks , Asians , Latinos , Europeans and everyone else who are n't native to this country doing just fine , depending on their individual natures , goals and drive - the very definition of equality .
Is there more racism in America if you want to find it ?
There may be .
9 out of 10 white Americans reject proposals to give reparations to the descendants of slaves , said study co-author Mahzarin Banaji , the Cabot Professor of Social Ethics at Harvard University .
“ Our data suggest that such resistance is not because white Americans are mean and uncaring , morally bankrupt , or ethically flawed , ” Banaji said .
“ White Americans suffer from a glaring ignorance about what it means to live as a black American . ”
Note that those are the only choices - morally bankrupt , mean or ignorant .
It may be that the people taking the survey know history and math better than Banaji .
There were tens of thousands of black people who owned slaves in the pre-Emancipation south and even more that were not slaves at all .
How does society separate their descendants from everyone else ?
What about the white people whose ancestors fought for the Union ?
Why do people who never owned slaves or whose ancestors fought to free them have to pay just because they have the wrong skin color ?
Let 's see if we can find their justification for that statement together .
In their survey , 958 whites of different ages and from different parts of the country were asked variations of the same question : “ How much should you be paid to continue to live the rest of your life as a black person ? ”
In some cases , the participants were told to imagine they were actually black , but had always passed for white .
The imagined race change required no physical transformation , just a change in public status .
In one study , whites were told to imagine that they were about to be born as a random white person in America , but they were being offered a cash gift to be born as a random black person .
Once again , white participants requested relatively small sums to make a life - long change in their race .
It was only after they were told about the income difference of blacks in America - the racial wealth correlation / causation that caused the researchers to go down this road - that whites requested significantly higher amounts than those in the previous studies , about $ 500,000 .
Yet the income difference between blacks and whites is only $ 150,000 , so clearly the money was not the only hint the researchers were giving about being a minority in America .
Finally , some participants were asked to imagine they were born into the fictional country of Atria , and were born either into the “ majority ” or “ minority ” population .
They were given a list of the disadvantages that the minority population faced in Atria ( which were identical to the real disadvantages faced by blacks in America ) .
In this case , white participants in the study said they should be paid an average of $ 1 million to be born as a minority member in Atria .
The missing factor in that last scenario is " America . "
When the racial income disparities are painted as unchanging fact , the answers are what the researchers want .
People would need to be compensated less to be a minority in America than they would need to be a minority in " Atria " , precisely because in Atria they assume their income and potential is limited by their minority status - while in America they know it is not .
Again , that sounds like equality .
The gist of this is not about equality , it is about paying reparations to descendants of slaves - money , not freedom .
According to the conclusion of the surveyors , if you do n't agree to pay reparations to black people , that 's proof of the very bias the researchers wanted to establish yet could n't find by asking the questions on race and getting low dollar values as compensation .
So you can't win , even if you are n't racist , have never been a racist , moved here after 1865 or generally have white skin .
Race relations have taken huge strides in the last 60 years .
To anyone not in the advocacy business , this survey would be a ringing endorsement of the terrific achievements resulting from the many who worked , suffered and sacrificed to have the equality we all enjoy today .
It 's time to stop manipulating data in the name of racial politics and get on with being one nation for all .
Mazzocco 's study appears in the current issue of Harvard 's Du Bois Review , a new publication started in 2007 by the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research .
KANSAS CITY , Missouri ( Reuters ) - A federal grand jury has indicted a now - defunct Islamic charity and five men for illegally transferring funds to Iraq and stealing U.S. government grant money , prosecutors said on Wednesday .
A 33 - count indictment unsealed on Wednesday charges the Islamic American Relief Agency , or IARA , headquartered in Columbia , Mo. , and charity officers and associates with a range of crimes related to money transfers to Iraq .
The Islamic charitable organization , formerly known as the Islamic African Relief Agency - USA , was formed in 1985 and closed in October 2004 after the U.S. Treasury Department said it was a global terrorist organization .
According to the U.S. Attorney ’s Office for the Western District of Missouri , the group is accused of transferring more than $ 1.4 million to Iraq from March 1991 to May 2003 in violation of laws imposing sanctions on Iraq .
Those sanctions were lifted in May 2003 following the U.S. invasion and the ouster of the Ba’ath party and the end of the regime of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein .
Prosecutors said the charity also misused grant money obtained through agreements with the U.S. Agency for International Development that was designated for relief projects in Mali , Africa .
Five officials of the charity are charged with several counts of money laundering as well as falsely representing the charity ’s activities and filing misleading tax forms .
Prosecutors also said Wednesday that “ a person acting on behalf of IARA ” falsely claimed that Ziyad Khaleel , a publicly identified associate and procurement agent of Osama bin Laden , had never worked for IARA when in fact , the indictment says , Khaleel had been an employee of IARA .
The officials charged are Mubarak Hamed , 50 , the former executive director of the charity , Abdel Azim El - Siddiq , 50 , an IARA vice president , Ali Mohamed Bagegni , 53 , a charity board member , Ahmad Mustafa , 54 , an IARA fund raiser , and Khalid Al - Sudanee , 55 , a Middle East coordinator .
Neither Al - Sudanee nor El - Siddiq have yet been arrested , though the other three defendants have been , according to Don Ledford , a spokesman for the prosecutor ’s office .

After crude oil costs , gasoline taxes are the second largest contributor to the price paid at the pump .
Together Federal and State excise taxes on fuel account for an average cost of approximately 62 cents per gallon .
That 's a combined tax of about 20 % per gallon of gas .
The federal tax per gallon is 18.4 cents per gallon ,

WASHINGTON , June 19  Lawmakers say they plan to dig deeper into the Bush administration ’s use of bill - signing statements as ways to circumvent Congressional intent .
In a limited examination of the administration ’s practice of reserving the authority to interpret legislation , the Government Accountability Office determined that in 6 out of 19 cases it studied , the administration did not follow the law as written after President Bush expressed reservations about some legislative directives .
By using signing statements , the president has reserved the right not to enforce any laws he thinks violate the Constitution or national security , or that impair foreign relations .
The accountability office , a watchdog agency , in a report issued Monday , did not pass judgment on whether the agencies were responding to the signing statements or whether the president had the constitutional authority not to comply .
But Congressional officials said Tuesday that the findings were alarming since the administration had apparently not complied with the law in 30 percent of the cases scrutinized .
“ Federal law is not some buffet line where the president can pick parts of some laws to follow and others to reject , ” said Senator Robert C. Byrd , Democrat of West Virginia and chairman of the Appropriations Committee , one of two senior lawmakers who sought the review .
Hippos are the last of a mammal group that thrived for 40 million years
Biologists have argued over the relationship between hippos and whales for a period of almost 200 years .
The findings come from an analysis of features in different animal groups carried out by a US - French team .
Their report is published in the science journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Jean - Renaud Boisserie , Michel Brunet and Fabrice Lehoreau found that the semi-aquatic ancestor of whales and hippos split into two groups : cetaceans and the anthracotheres .
Cetaceans eventually spurned land , lost their legs and became fully aquatic .
Flourishing group
The pig - like anthracotheres , flourished over 40 million years and died out less than 2.5 million years ago .
They left only one descendent : the hippopotamus .
The study places whales firmly within the cloven - hoofed group of mammals known as Artiodactyla , which includes cows , pigs , sheep , antelopes , camels and giraffes .
The similarities may not be immediately obvious
But then genetic analyses indicated that hippos had more in common with cetaceans , the group to which whales and dolphins belong .
" If you look at the general shape of the [ hippo ] it could be related to horses , as the ancient Greeks thought , or pigs , as modern scientists thought , while molecular phylogeny shows a close relationship with whales , " Dr Boisserie explained .
" But cetaceans - whales , porpoises and dolphins - do n't look anything like hippos .
There is a 40 - million - year gap between fossils of early cetaceans and early hippos . "
" Cetaceans are artiodactyls , but very derived artiodactyls . "
EVERY morning millions of Americans confront the latest trend in commodities markets at their kitchen table .
According to the United States Department of Agriculture , rising prices for crops — dubbed “ agflation ” — has begun to drive up the cost of breakfast .
The price of orange juice has risen by a quarter over the past year , eggs by a fifth and milk by roughly 5 % .
Breakfast - cereal makers , such as Kellogg 's and General Mills , have also raised their prices .
Underpinning these rises is a sharp increase in the prices of grains such as corn ( maize ) and wheat , both of which recently hit ten - year highs .
Analysts are beginning to ask , as they have of oil and metals , whether higher prices are here to stay .
On the face of it , that is an odd question .
After all , if the world runs short of corn or wheat , farmers can simply grow more , weather permitting .
That is exactly what they have been doing .
In the coming year , the International Grains Council , an industry group , estimates that global production of grains will reach a record of 1,660 m tonnes , well above last year 's figure of 1,569 m .
But demand for grain is growing even faster .
The council reckons it will reach 1,680 m tonnes this year .
In three of the past four years , demand has exceeded supply .
The culprit is the growing use of grains to make biofuels , such as ethanol .
Most grains are used as food either for people or for livestock .
But the increase in human consumption has been slowing for decades as population growth moderates .
Demand for animal feed , meanwhile , has grown steadily , as more people in booming countries such as China grow rich enough to afford meat .
Demand for biofuel feedstocks , by contrast , is soaring .
The amount of corn used to make ethanol in America has tripled since 2000 ; ethanol distilleries now consume a fifth of the country 's corn crop .
And America is only one of 41 countries where governments are encouraging the use of biofuels to reduce oil consumption .
As a result , demand for grains has accelerated .
During the 1990s , when oil was cheap and biofuels unheard of , demand grew by 1.2 % a year , according to Goldman Sachs .
But in recent years , it has increased by 1.4 % , and over the next decade , Goldman projects , it will rise by 1.9 % annually .
Farmers are struggling to keep up .
The Economist Intelligence Unit , a sister company of The Economist , projects that demand for corn , at least , will continue to exceed supply until at least 2009 .
Moreover , even to produce as much corn as they are now , farmers are growing less soya and wheat , and so pushing up the prices of those crops too .
With all the main grains to feed poultry and livestock becoming more expensive , the cost of meat and eggs is rising , and so it goes on .
When demand was growing more slowly , farmers could meet it through gradual improvements in their yields .
But to cope with today 's boom , yields will have to rise much faster , or farmers will have to bring more land into production .
Both are possible .
Greater adoption of genetically modified strains of corn and wheat , for example , could improve yields .
But they are expensive and politically controversial .
There is also quite a bit of fallow land to be sowed , especially in developing agricultural powers such as Brazil and Ukraine .
But those countries are far from the biggest markets and their idle land tends to be found in areas with poor transport links .
A strong price signal will be needed to overcome such obstacles and induce extra supplies .
But even if new land is planted , argues Jeffrey Currie of Goldman Sachs , it will not necessarily reduce the cost of grains .
Since high oil prices and generous government subsidies ensure that biofuels are profitable , any extra grain will be used to make more of the stuff .
That will not dent the oil price , since the volumes remain tiny compared with global oil consumption .
Instead , the price of biofuels has risen to that of petrol , and the price of corn and crude oil , the main feedstocks for the two , have converged ( see chart ) .
For grain prices to fall , Mr Currie argues , either governments must pull the plug on biofuels programmes , or the oil price must fall .
Neither seems very likely in the near future .
This week America 's Congress is debating whether to double its targets for biofuel production .
At the same time , the oil price rose to its highest level in ten months , thanks to a strike and other disruptions in Nigeria .
The chaos in the Niger delta , it turns out , has a surprising amount to do with the price of eggs .
When Wal - Mart Stores Inc. informed record labels it was looking for CDs to include in a promotion of Jewish music last year , executives at Naxos of America Inc. leapt at the chance to get some of their ethnic recordings onto the shelves of the big - box retailer .
But within months of shipping thousands of CDs to Wal - Mart , the classical music distributor 's loading docks were swamped with unsold copies of " Klezmer Concertos & Encores " and " Great Songs of the Yiddish Stage . "
Since they had n't sold quickly enough to meet the retailing ...
Imagine you could treat cancer by taking a pill , then directing a laser light toward the location of the tumor .
The growth would dissolve with no chemotherapy , and no harm to healthy tissue .
It might sound futuristic , but a select number of cancer patients already benefit from the method , called photodynamic therapy .
An upgrade for the procedure could save thousands more cancer patients from the horrors of chemotherapy .
" It 's an approach that I really like , " said Karen Brewer , a professor of chemistry at Virginia Tech and lead author of the research on Tuesday at the American Chemical Society annual conference in Chicago .
" We stand to make a really major improvement , instead of trying to treat one new kind of tumor or make the patient a little less sick . "
Although chemotherapy has improved over the past decade , the treatment still damages healthy tissue and causes other unpleasant side effects like nausea and a weakened immune system .
The researchers hope their work will spare patients from chemo 's ravages and even the surgery usually necessary to remove a tumor .
" Rather than using a scalpel , you 're using light and a molecule that then reacts with the cells , " said William Phelps , scientific program director at the American Cancer Society .
The new treatment , however , still needs to be tested head to head with the current version of photodynamic therapy , Phelps said .
The technique starts with a compound called a photosensitizer , a type of molecule that latches itself onto a tumor and when exposed to focused light excites oxygen , destroying the tumor cells .
The treatment 's reliance on oxygen , however , has been a limitation because smaller , newer tumors do n't contain any .
The new technology gets around the problem by killing the tumor with " supramolecules " – large molecular assemblies that act as anti-cancer fighting forces .
The supramolecules deliver the drug directly to the tumor 's DNA – a process known as DNA cleavage .
Once the drug ( the set of supramolecules ) is ingested ( or in the case of skin cancer , applied as a cream ) , a light ( usually from fiber optics or a laser ) focused on the site of the tumor activates the DNA cleavage .
" This has a distinct virtue of being able to get the tumor before it 's generated its own blood supply , " said Brian Storrie , a professor of physiology and biophysics at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences .
But what if a tumor is inside the body , such as on the liver or other internal organs ?
As anyone who has played with a red laser pointer knows , red light can permeate human tissue .
So red or infrared light can reach some , but not all , tumors .
" Research is certainly underway to work on better light delivery methods , " Brewer said .
Brewer has performed tests using her technique on raw DNA , cell cultures and E - coli .
She and her will begin tests on horses " any day now , " because horse skin cancer is remarkably similar to human skin cancer .
Comment on this story .

[ UPDATE ( Dec. 2011 ) : I wrote the post below a few years ago .
SafeMedia ’s website and product offerings have changed since then .
Please do n’t interpret this post as a commentary on SafeMedia ’s current products . ]
Peter Eckersley at EFF wrote recently about a new network - filtering company called SafeMedia that claims it can block all copyrighted material in a network .
We ’ve seen companies like this before and they tend to have the warning signs of security snake oil .
But SafeMedia was new so I decided to look at their website .
My reaction was : what a brilliant parody !
The biggest clue is that the company ’s detection product is called Clouseau – named for a detective who is not only spectacularly incompetent but also fictional .
The next clue is the outlandish technical claims .
Here ’s an example :
Pirates are smart and innovative , and so is Clouseau .
Our technology is dynamic , sees through all multi-layered encryptions , adaptively analyzes network patterns and constantly updates itself .
Packet examinations are noninvasive and infallible .
There are no false positives .
Sees through all encryption ?
Even our best intelligence agencies do n’t make that claim .
Perhaps that ’s because the intelligence agencies know about provably unbreakable encryption .
Wait a minute , you may be saying .
Perhaps SafeMedia was just making the usual exaggeration , implying that they can stop all bad traffic when what they really mean is that they can stop the most common , obvious kinds of bad traffic .
Good guess – that ’s the usual fallback position for companies like this – but SafeMedia does n’t shrink from the most outlandish claims of infallibility :
What if illegal P2P no longer worked ?
What if , no matter how intelligent , devious , or well - funded an Internet pirate was , they absolutely could not transmit copyrighted material via P2P ?
SafeMedia ’s goal was to create the technology that would achieve exactly this .
And we succeeded .
Employing our new technology , Clouseau and Windows +
Transport Control , makes illegal P2P transmission of copyrighted material impossible .
IMPOSSIBLE .
Not difficult and not improbable .
IMPOSSIBLE !
The next clue that SafeMedia is a parody is the site ’s blatant rent - seeking .
There ’s even a special page for lawmakers that starts with over - the - top rhetoric about P2P ( “ America is at war here at home within our own borders .
And we are taking casualties .
Women , men , and children . ” ) and ends by asking the U.S. government to act as SafeMedia ’s marketing department :
We need the Congress to pass legislation appropriating funds for installing the technology on every Federally - supported computer network in the country , most importantly in educational institutions ( schools , colleges , universities , libraries ) … .
We need the Department of Commerce to promote using the technology in all American businesses big and small , and to push for its international adoption .
We need the Department of Education to insure that every educational institution in the USA , private and public , primary and secondary , college and university , is obeying the law .
You now have the right weapons .
Let ’s end the war !
Add up all this , plus the overdesigned home page that makes maddening fingers - on - a - blackboard noises when you mouse over its main menu area , and the verdict is clear : this is a parody .
Yet SafeMedia appears to be real .
The CEO appears to be a real guy who has done a few e-commerce startups .
The site has more detailed help - wanted ads than any parodist would bother with .
According to the Internet Archive , the site has been around for a while .
And most convincingly of all , an expensive DC law firm has registered as a lobbyist for SafeMedia .
So SafeMedia really exists and company management thought it a good idea to set up a parody - simulating website and name their product Clouseau .
What an entertaining world we live in .
( Thanks to Peter Eckersley for sharing the results of his un-Clouseau - ish investigation of SafeMedia ’s existence . )
A largely personal blog with much silliness , Tales of the Babe & Me and of Susan the Wonderchild , lots of cat photos , and other miscellaneous stories and observations .
This post is something I was actually asked to write .
I ’ve been asked for “ career advice ” a few times lately ; I guess having been a contractor for ten years now does imply that I may actually know a thing or two about working successfully as a contractor .
The following is what I see as some common sense guidelines both for permanent employees considering moving to contracting and contractors who want to continue contracting successfully .
The first thing to consider is what are the biggest differences between permanent and contract work ?
That ’s easy .
There are two big ones : no job security and you ( usually ) get to say a considerably bigger number when people ask you how much you earn .
There ’s much more to it than this but those are the big two that you ’re likely to be balancing when considering the leap into contracting .
How much money will convince you to give up job security ?
For me this is a no - brainer as I do n’t believe there is any real job security any more , particularly in IT .
Other people do n’t share this view and value permanent employment more highly .
To state the obvious : contracting is not for the risk averse .
The dollars alone are not enough of a motivator for me and although it sounds tempting , only the most soul - less individuals can be fulfilled in their work by money alone for more than a few years .
I personally like the control aspect ( you never would have guessed that about me , would you ? )
Properly managed , the contracting lifestyle gives you considerably more control over your career and finances .
If you ’re going to pursue contracting for more than about a year I ca n’t recommend strongly enough that you look into setting up your own company and contracting through this entity .
It can cost a few thousand dollars to set up a company properly , depending where you live ( and make it a company , NOT a trust or anything else shifty ! )
Get a trustworthy accountant to set things up for you .
A lot of people balk at paying out the money to set up and the ongoing money to organise taxes etc but it ’s money well spent .
This is an investment and you will get it returned multiple times over every year in tax savings if you do it properly .
Properly .
Legally .
It is simply not worth the risk of screwing the tax department .
Bite the bullet and go legit .
A good accountant will save you tens of thousands while keeping everything legal and above board .
Day to day , you ’re going to have to deal with three sorts of people as a contractor : employment agencies , employers and co-workers .
How you relate to each of these groups is vitally important to your viability as a contractor and your emotional well - being generally .
Dealing with agencies :
If you ’re working in a place where the IT job market is n’t controlled by employment agencies count your blessings .
In Sydney and Melbourne about 80 % of all jobs and 95 % of contract jobs are placed through agencies .
You do n’t absolutely have to go through them but your choices are limited .
Personally I think they ’re a waste of time .
The only thing I can think of that justifies their existence is HR departments who do n’t want to do their jobs .
If a company has an HR department they should n’t use agencies and if a company uses agencies they should have an HR department .
It ’s unnecessary double - handling .
Or maybe I ’m crazy .
So assume you have to deal with agencies .
Be nice to them .
Most of them are decent people ( I object to the role , not the person ) and you need them to get contracts .
Always be professional in your dealings with agencies ; this gives the good ones the confidence to represent you well and it avoids giving the bad ones an excuse to screw you .
Having said that , do n’t let agencies dictate terms to you .
Agencies should provide guidance on rates and conditions ( too many of them provide no guidance at all ) but they should n’t control your life .
Make sure you understand the job market so you understand what is realistic for your skill set and experience and never let yourself become dependent on a single agency .
Do n’t enter into an “ exclusive representation ” agreement with an agency unless you ’re on their payroll , i.e. they pay you whether or not you are working for an outside employer .
Many agencies push this , they say things like it looks too unprofessional if you are going through multiple agencies looking for work .
This is a complete lie .
Over the years I have given my resume to dozens of agencies and never once had an employer even comment on this , let alone pass negative judgement .
Any agency who pushes too heavily on this front is untrustworthy in my opinion and should be avoided .
Employers go for the best applicant .
Period .
Agencies go for whoever will get them a commission .
Period .
Dealing with employers :
Rightly or wrongly , employers expect more from a contractor than from an equivalent permanent employee .
It ’s a simple equation for them : they pay you more so they want more from you .
It ’s important that you ’re absolutely clear about an employer ’s expectations ahead of time .
You do n’t want any nasty surprises down the track .
At the interview stage get explicit answers regarding expectations on hours to be worked , output and responsibility .
Asking these questions in a way that comes across as professional rather than seeming like you ’re trying to get out of work is more art than science , but it ’s an important skill to master .
If you ’re a contractor , you will be going to a lot of job interviews so you will get plenty of practice .
The politics of your role in the workplace can be as important ( or even more important ) than your output .
One of the joys of being a contractor is that the learning curve for all aspects of a role are sharply accelerated .
If you are permanent , often your first 3 months is taken up with “ learning the ropes ” .
Many contracts only last that long from beginning to end so you have to squeeze in learning the environment , technology , methodolgies , politics and the actual work you are delivering in the time most people take to simply get used to their new job .
Again , if you ca n’t deal with stress , contracting is not for you .
The key is communication .
Communicate early and often .
Feed back to your employer what you understand your role to be , give regular status updates and ask for corrections if you have misunderstood anything .
Dealing with co-workers : Guess what ?
Permanent staff know you get paid more than them .
And it pisses them off .
Co-workers will fall somewhere on a spectrum between not caring at all what you are paid and being obsessed with and unreasonable about your rates despite the fact it ’s none of their business .
You ca n’t control how people feel about contractors , you can only control your response to them .
One thing you should never do is discuss your pay rate .
Seriously , nothing good can come of this .
Co-workers will ask you .
Come up with your own diplomatic version of “ I do n’t like to discuss that . ”
Anyone who presses the matter is essentially a jerk and you should n’t feel compelled to respond to them .
If you feel compelled to respond , I recommend keeping it abstract rather than mentioning the exact amount you earn .
Point out that a direct dollar comparison is n’t valid because of the different nature of permanent vs contract work .
The following analysis I use is reasonably accurate .
It ’s based on Australian conditions so it wo n’t be directly applicable to all other countries , I know some places have more annual leave and some have less .
Imagine the contract rate is double the permanent rate in dollar terms ( this is n’t always the case , but it is sometimes and this is often the figure permanents throw at me ) .
Permanents get four weeks annual leave , about 10 public holidays and 5 - 10 paid sick days each year .
If a contractor is n’t at work they are n’t getting paid .
So if a contractor is making $ 100 K a year and a permanent is making $ 50 K , the permanent co-worker only has to work for 10 months to get their salary so already they ’ve picked up 20 % on the contractor .
On top of that , the contractor has to handle their own taxes , insurance and superannuation which all adds up .
The margin most contractors have over their permanent counterparts is much closer to 20 - 25 % in real terms and that ’s simply the premium for giving up the security of permanent employment .
At the end of the day , if you are dealing with a difficult co-worker who really wants to make an issue of your pay rate , put it to them this way : if they are so sure contracting is such a great deal , why are n’t they out there contracting themselves ?
Put up or shut up .
Not that I recommend saying something that negative to a co-worker .
For most people , enjoying contract work means staying on the right side of co-workers is more important than impressing employers .
So try to steer conversations away from your pay rate .
Whatever you do , do n’t be like one contract programmer I worked with who coded a little income calculator that showed in real time how much he was earning each minute he was there .
And then he had it on his desktop where everyone could see it .
I think they found his body face down in a ditch somewhere .
So that ’s my overview of rules for contractors .
In subsequent posts I will be cover the rules ( in my humble opinion ) each of the three groups above should follow when dealing with contractors .
In the meantime , I welcome any comments or questions raised by these points .

IBM ’s Power6 push began this week with a tweak to AIX support .
In a letter to customers , IBM vowed to support future updates to AIX 5.3 for an additional two years .
This appears to be IBM ’s Power6 concession , since the vendor , according to our sources , will announce Power6 systems this month and ship them in the middle of the year but wo n’t have AIX 5.4 available for months .
Normally , IBM would like to have a new major release of AIX ready for its new processors and have customers upgrade accordingly .
No such luck .

Tim Tasane had been a firefighter for 28 years
Horrified colleagues looked on as Tim Tasane , 46 , became engulfed in flames in the rear yard at Northallerton fire station in North Yorkshire .
He had spoken to one of his sons just moments before he took his life , mentioning mounting debts .
Coroner Michael Oakley recorded a verdict that Mr Tasane killed himself .
Fire control officer Debra Pheasant was on duty shortly before midnight on 9 January when she heard noises coming from the back yard .
When she went to investigate she discovered her colleague on fire .
I did n't realise who it was at the time , I knew it was a fireman
Colleague Debra Pheasant
She said : " There was a man on fire at the window in front of me .
" Firefighters were putting water onto Tim .
I shouted out ' what are you doing ? '
I could n't take in what was happening .
I thought it was an exercise .
I wondered ' where is everybody ? '.
I did n't realise who it was at the time , I knew it was a fireman . "
Mr Tasane , who had been a firefighter for 28 years , had three sons and a daughter and lived in Northallerton .
One of his sons , Ben , who serves in the Army , told the inquest how his father broke down in tears one day as he dropped him off at the railway station before a deployment to Iraq .
He told the hearing : " He did not seem himself at all .
" I have been to Iraq before , he 'd seen me go off before .
He was never like this before , he started sobbing and crying .
" I said to my mother , just watch him . "
Ben said he spoke to his father on the phone several times before his death and he seemed more like his normal self .
However , about 15 minutes before he took his life he spoke to his father again and he mentioned some of his problems .
" He said he was going to go away and I was to look after the others .
I rang him back and he said he had mounting debts and the house was going to be repossessed . "
A typed note , which was not read out to the court , was found among his possessions .

In my last post , I showed how you can use byte - code manipulation and Generics to achieve a modicum of functional programming in Java without overly cumbersome syntax .
However , it still feels a little clunky .
But how about in Groovy ?
Groovy 's support for real closure syntax turns out to make functional programming , er , Groovy !
I wo n't bother writing up the basics , since they have already been done elsewhere , such as Functional Programming in Groovy
What I will do is show how to build a classic data structure used in functional programming , , using Groovy .
And then I 'll show a classic application of functional streams : a stream of the Sieve of Eratosthenes , in one line of code .
A stream is a collection , like a list , only that it does n't necessarily produce its contents until needed , and it may in fact , be infinitely large .
It bears some resemblance to streams used in I/O , such as InputStream in Java .
For example , one could create a stream of integers , by implementing a class IntegerInputStream whose read ( ) method returns the integers in montonically increasing order .
But our streams wo n't subclass InputStream , ours will be a sort of linked - list .
First , we 'll create a new data structure , LazyList which represents a pair of values : a concrete value ' car ' , and a closure ' cdr ' which returns another LazyList .
Notice that the getCdr ( ) function does n't return the cdr field , it returns the result of executing the closure .
Next we 'll need a way of constructing a new LazyList , so we add the following method to class LazyList This factory method just uses the LazyList constructor ( for now ) .
And finally , we need a method for grabbing some values out of the list .
We 're not done yet , but we 're already capable of defining our first infinite stream .
The first line says that the integers starting from N , is the result of constructing a list consisting of the element N and the integers starting from N+1 .
Note that the recursive call to integers ( n+1 ) is inside a closure .
Groovy is an eager language , and all function parameters are evaluated before calling the function .
Without the closure , this would result in an infinite loop and overflow the stack .
The second line says that the natural numbers are the integers starting from 1 .
The third line says to take the first 10 elements from the natural numbers , iterate over the result , printing them out .
Yeah , you could do that easily with [ 1..10 ] . each { print " $it
" } .
So let 's move on .
What if we want to filter an infinite LazyList ?
We can do that too , with the following method added to LazyList .
Which says that to filter a LazyList with closure predicate ' pred ' , we call pred ( ) on the first element of the list , and if true , we construct a new list using this element , and a closure which will invoke filter on the rest of the elements of the list .
Otherwise , we recursively call filter until we find an element that satisfies the predicate .
Now we can define the even numbers ...
One of the classic examples used to demonstrate the power of streams is the Sieve of Eratosthenes , which is to define a stream whose successive list of values are the prime numbers .
This can in fact be done in a single line of code using LazyList : although that is kinda ugly , but formatted this wayis easier to read .
If you read the Wikipedia link above , you 'll see that the sieve takes a list , whose first element is prime , and returns a new list , with this first element , followed by a sieve of another list with all multiplies of the prime number filtered out .
Now we can print the first hundred prime numbers : or the first 100 fibonacci numbersAnd with just two other magic functionswe can even print out the first 10 twin primes :
First , do n't expect this code to run fast .
It generates alot of garbage lazylists , uses recursion , and it also recalculates values .
The first problem probably can't be fixed , the second problem can be fixed by rewriting the LazyList functions to be tail - recursive and then hacking Groovy to make sure it optimizes tail - recursion .
The final problem ( recalcuation ) can be fixed with memoization .
Recall the cons ( ) function which appears to do nothing but invoke the LazyList constructor ?
Let 's introduce a new function : and modify consso that now the Closure passed to cons ( ) is only executed once .
Subsequent values are returned from the cached value .
Of course , this only helps performance if the closure block is computationally expensive to evaluate .
Otherwise , the overhead of creating the memoization closure probably incurs even worse penalties .
That 's it for today 's hack .
Practical ?
Maybe not .
Groovy ?
Yes .
If you want to use these techniques and run them more efficiently on the JVM , you may want to look at some of the Scheme / Lisp dialects available for Java .

It looks as if someone tried to give a zebra a respray .
. . then ran out of white paint halfway through the job .
But in reality there is no artificial colouring on display here .
This amazing but natural coat belongs to Eclyse the zorse .
Her father is a zebra , while her mother is a horse .
And she 's walking proof of how a child inherits genes from both parents .
Scroll down for more
For while most zebra-horse crossbreeds sport stripes across their entire body , Eclyse only has two such patches , on its face and rear .
The one - year - old zorse was the accidental product of a holiday romance when her mother , Eclipse , was taken from her German safari park home to a ranch in Italy for a brief spell .
There she was able to roam freely with other horses and a number of zebras , including one called Ulysses who took a fancy to her .
When Eclipse returned home , she surprised her keepers by giving birth to the baby zorse whose mixed markings betray her colourful parentage .
The foal was promptly given a name that is in itself a hybrid , of her parents ' names .
Now she 's become a major attraction at a safari park at Schloss Holte Stukenbrock , near the German border with Holland , where she has her own enclosure .
Udo Richter , spokesman for the park , said , " You can tell she is a mix just by looking at her .
But in temperament she can also exhibit characteristics from each parent .
" She is usually relatively tame like a horse but occasionally shows the fiery temperament of a zebra , leaping around like one . "
Horses and zebras are often crossbred in Africa and are used as trekking animals on Mount Kenya .
[ Haskell - cafe ]
One question ...
Hello yourself !-) >
Two days ago I have found Haskell in Internet .
It sounds very nice . >
I have read some articles , few examples , ... yes it sounds nice .
you need to try it as well .
haskell.org has information , tutorials , interactive implementations ( and to answer the likely follow - on question : you will usually need an editor and a Haskell implementation side by side ; edit your program in the editor , load the program into the implementation to play with ) , .. >
Now my problem is connected with the " non-update " object feature . >
I can't write " variable " instead object because - from the meaning of the word > ( variable ) - it has the possibility to CHANGE its value . >
Yes that my problem :-( a common ( mis - ) interpretation of " variable " .
a variable is a representation of something that may not be constant , so far we are in agreement .
but the updateable variables you are referring to are a special case of variables , those representing storage locations , the _contents_ of which may be changed .
it may be useful to think of variables as named placeholders for things , that is , you either have the named placeholder , or you have the thing itself .
the process of replacing those placeholders with the things they stand for is called variable substitution .
update programming is all about communicating with some external store of boxes ( or objects ) , and updateable variables stand for references to such boxes ( or identities of objects ) .
your program is a sequence of updates of the contents of those boxes - while the variables keep refering to the same locations / references / object identities !
executing an update program modifies the external store by performing the prescribed updates , step by step .
functional programming is all about replacing programs with programs , and variables are simply named placeholders in such programs .
your program is a description of a problem , which may contain variables .
evaluating a functional program modifies the program , replacing program parts by other program parts ( and possibly variables by things ) , step by step .
the aim of update programming is to transform a store whose contents describe a problem into a store whose contents describe a solution .
the aim of functional programming is to transform a program which describes a problem into a program which describes a solution .
non-declarative languages support very little functional programming ( although that is changing ; -) , so programmers mostly focus on update programming .
Haskell supports both functional programming and update programming , and programmers are encouraged to solve the major part of their problems through functional programming , resorting to update programming only where necessary .
and no , I have n't forgotten your problem ;-) if you want to reap the full benefits of learning functional programming , you need to adapt your way of thinking about programming to the additional flexibility that Haskell provides you with , and think of transforming programs into programs , rather than transforming stores into stores .
variables now stand for parts of the programs that you can fill in , not for parts of the store that you can change .
in update programming , you need box variables , because the program does n't change , only the contents of the store change .
in functional programming , the whole program is transformed during evaluation - most of the time , no need for an external store because everything is variable . >
Let 's assume that I 've got to write the application that > should works as follows : > >
1 . At the beginning the user should write her / his name ( for instance as the > application parameter ) . >
2 . Let 's assume that the application has many various functions defined > inside , and - after printing each of the outputs - the name has to be > printout .
> >
How should I think " properly " in Haskell to get described action ?
Haskell implementations interleave the two phases of functional program evaluation and update program execution ( the latter most commonly being input / output ) .
in particular , the value of " Main.main " is expected to evaluate to an update program , the first step of which is then executed , feeding the result of that first step back into the functional evaluation phase , and so on and so on .. you describe an application which requires a dialogue between program and user , so you need for your program to produce such a dialogue as the value of main .
in fact , dialogue descriptions can be created and composed just like other functional values : main = do name <- get Name let output = various name putStrLn output getName = do putStr " your name , please ? " getLine various name = " hello , " ++ name + + " ( that 's " ++ show ( length name ) + + " letters ) " note how the value of main is a dialogue , composed of an input phase involving i/o , a computation phase involving no i/o , and an output phase involving i/o again .
note also how " various " is the name of a placeholder variable standing for a specific function , and how " name " is the name of a placeholder variable standing for the user input .
if you call " various " multiple times , or if you run " main " multiple times , the same name in the same dialogue and the same function will stand for different inputs , so the value of the variable named " name " will vary .
but all of this talk only because you asked about how to think about actions and variables in Haskell - as others have pointed out , the alternative is to dive right in , and to wait for the implications to become clear later , after a ( possibly extended ) while of practice .
hope this helps , claus
Do n't work out on an empty stomach .
Eating a carbohydrate - rich snack - bagels , muffins , cereals , pasta or potatoes are ideal - two to three hours before you exercise allows time for digestion and tops up your body 's stores of glycogen , the fuel for physical activity .
Remember that high - calorie or fatty meals take longer to leave the stomach and may predispose you to a stitch or gastro - intestinal discomfort .
Do include some protein - rich foods such as eggs and dairy in your daily diet .
A recent study at the University of Illinois found athletes who did so were faster , stronger and leaner .
Professor Donald Layman , who headed the study , said there was " an interactive effect " when protein and exercise were combined .
Protein foods contain a high level of the amino acid leucine , which stimulates muscle synthesis and recovery .
Do n't restrict porridge to breakfast .
It is the perfect pre-workout snack , say sport physiologists at Loughborough university .
Because it has a low glycaemic index when made with water , porridge provides a longer - lasting energy boost for athletes than a hi-tech isotonic sports drink .
Do n't neglect your iron intake .
More than a third of UK women do n't get their daily iron requirement ( 14.8 mg ) from the best food sources such as red meat , chicken and eggs and this makes getting fit harder work .
A study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that women given a six - week course of iron supplements saw improvements of up to 200 % in their fitness and felt less breathless than those who took a placebo .
Do eat unsweetened tinned peaches .
Remarkably , a study at Nottingham university in which athletes were given either a high GI breakfast such as white bread with jam or a low GI meal of tinned peaches and muesli and then asked to perform a 60 - minute run three hours later found the peaches group performed much better .

Bush has near ' tractor accident ' in visit to Illinois factory
Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday January 31 , 2007 Print This Email This Update : Another media account indicates that key White House adviser Karl Rove asked if the president could drive the tractor , warning that the president does n't drive often .
More details are below .
The White House announced its visit to a Caterpillar factory in East Peoria , Illinois , yesterday , where President George W. Bush advanced his case for expanding free trade negotiations .
But it did n't detail the President 's clumsy driving of a giant D - 10 tractor that sent the White House press corps and presidential staff scrambling , as reported at a Newsweek blog .
At " The Gaggle , " Newsweek reporter Holly Bailey writes that the president clambered into the driver 's seat of Caterpillar 's giant D10 tractor .
" I would suggest moving back ... I 'm about to crank this sucker up , " she reports him saying .
But as White House staff started to move the press corps back , the situation became more chaotic .
Bailey writes that " the tractor lurched forward " and White House staff " too were forced to scramble for safety .
" Get out of the way ! " a news photographer yelled .
" I think he might run us over ! " "
Bush chuckled about the incident , and referenced driving the tractor during his speech , saying " I 'm impressed by a culture of excellence and accomplishment that is the spirit of Caterpillar .
I also appreciate the chance to drive a D10 .
If you 've never driven a D10 -- ( laughter ) -- it 's a cool experience .
( Laughter ) , " according to the White House website .
Bailey looked less fondly upon Bush 's test drive of the D - 10 .
" Yeah , almost as much fun as seeing your life flash before your eyes , " she wrote in response to the president 's remark about his " cool experience . "
Update : A Copley News Service report in the Register - Mail , a paper in Galesburg , IL , indicates that White House adviser Karl Rove asked Caterpillar executives to give the president a photo opportunity in the tractor .
" Rove chatted briefly with Caterpillar executives about whether Bush would drive one of the tractors , " writes Copley 's Molly Parker .
" Rove reminded them Bush does n't do much driving on his own these days and asked if Caterpillar 's insurance was up to date , " she added .

This is a truly gripping 20 minute speech which seeks to put all the wrong doings of education right by cultivating our children ’s creativity rather than killing it .
Sir Ken Robinson , knighted by the Queen in 2003 for achievements in creativity , education and the arts , is an English gentleman with a charming wit and repartee that has an amazing vision to harvest creativity and create an amazing future for the world .
He believes that CREATIVITY is as important as LITERACY and should be treated with the same status .
Ken Robinson , who lived in Stratford Upon Avon the home of Shakespeare for many years , begins by demonstrating the amazing creativity of children with numerous funny quips .
He shares a story of a 6 year old little girl who pays no attention in class except when she can draw .
The Teacher asks what she is drawing and she claims to be drawing God :
The teacher asks : “ BUT nobody knows what God looks like ”
The girl replies “ They will do in a minute ”
This quip literally illustrates how children have no limits to their levels of creativity .
Most kids are fearless and are never ever frightened to make mistakes .
This leads to out of this world creativity .
HOWEVER , our current education systems worldwide are making children lose this capacity to be creative .
You will literally be glued to the screen in this riveting 20 minute video
After you have viewed this clip I invite you to just imagine how much wonderful change we could bring to this world if we truly embraced these teachings !
I ’m sure you ’ll agree that Ken delivers a highly entertaining , and profoundly moving case for creating an education system that nurtures creativity , rather than undermining it .
Picasso once said :
All children are born artists , the problem is remaining an artist as we grow up .
This is the problem that Ken outlines quite brilliantly in his speech .
We do n’t grow into creativity , We grow out of it .
In fact Ken argues we are educated out of creativity .
Before the Iraq invasion , President Bush did not say , " I think that there is a 60 percent chance that Saddam has an active WMD program . "
Al Gore does not say , " I think there is a 2 percent chance that if we do nothing there will be an environmental catastrophe that will end life as we know it . "
Instead , they speak in the language of certainty .
I assume that as political leaders they know a lot better than I do how to speak to the general population .
So I infer that , relative to me , the public has a bias toward certainty .
Another piece of evidence of that is an anecdote I cite about my ( former ) doctor .
Several years ago , he said I needed a test .
I did some research and some Bayes ’
Theorem calculations , and I faxed him a note saying that I did not think the test was worth it .
He became irate .
I think that one reason that our health care system works the way it does is that it does not occur to anyone to say , " OK , I can live with that level of uncertainty . "
Instead , we must have the MRI , or the CT scan , or whatever .
Even , as in my case , when the patient is willing to live with uncertainty , the doctor has a problem with it .
Another way that bias toward certainty shows up is in the way we handle disagreement .
People do n’t say that there were differences within the intelligence community about the probability distribution for Saddam having WMD .
They say that Bush manipulated the intelligence .
And they are right , in the sense that he tried to make it sound certain .
My point is that what comes naturally to a lot of people on this blog–thinking in Bayesian terms–is in fact very unnatural in general .
It seems as though outside of the realm of sport betting , people do n’t like to think in terms of chance .
Maybe there are realms where even those of us who are more Bayesian than most are victims of bias toward certainty .

I wrote this post back in January 2006 at The Unrepentant Individual .
I ’ve got a post I want to write in a day or two about blogging in general , but this post will lay the groundwork .
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
Since the American Revolution , and particularly in the past 100 years , we ’ve seen a ceaseless growth of the scope and size of government .
In discussions with other LLP ’ers , I often find that there is a latent air of futility .
Many of my fellow libertarian bloggers see our role as a brake on that growth , rather than see the possibility of reversing it .
To some extent , I understand where they ’re coming from .
To affect a change that will reduce the scope of government will demand the support of a large swath of the voting public .
This is a tall order , as much of the public has become hooked on the bread and circuses doled out by our federal government .
In addition , it will require convincing legislators that bold action is required to keep their power .
Our current system rewards politicians who spout meaningless platitudes , while actively punishing those who pursue bold action .
In short , it will require that all of our culture as has been developed over the last hundred years be completely upended .
Those who feel they ’re fighting a rear - guard action , I understand .
But I do n’t think it ’s a futile endeavor .
Perhaps I ’m still young , dumb , and full of– bravado , but I think real change is possible .
I see a fundamental change already occurring in our culture .
This fundamental change is one that will wholly transform culture in this country in a way more widely felt than the invention of the television .
In addition , it will be a change which empowers individuals , rather than turns them into mindless drones , as the television accomplished .
The internet , my friends , is the answer .
I ’ve made the point before , but since the time radio and television took over American media dominance from the newspaper , we have seen a slow– but steady– consolidation of media power .
This consolidation has ensured that to have a voice in the national political debate , you needed money .
Lots and lots of money .
Large amounts of money have their own way of accumulating , whether it be in corporations , special - interest groups , or political parties .
But when the only voices in the debate are those of the powerful , citizens have only one recourse– our votes .
Despite what you might hear from P. Diddy , your vote does n’t carry as much weight as the voices of the powerful .
The powerful care about only one thing : continuing their power .
When Eric and I both discussed Michael Crichton ’s State of Fear , we discussed the idea that inducing fear is a very simple way to control the populace , and that control perpetuates the powerful ’s grasp on society .
Fear can only be defeated by information .
In a world where media and the control of information is dominated by the powerful , the foxes guards the henhouse .
The powerful are the ones perpetuating a state of fear , and have no desire to allow the spread of information that may damage their position .
But the consolidation of the media has been breached .
The playing field has been leveled .
No longer does it take millions of dollars to get a message out to the public .
The internet in general , and blogging in particular , will restore the flow of information that the current media inhibits .
It has created a whole new forum , and widely expanded the popular media .
At the same time , it has already had some effect on the legacy media , as we ’ve seen in the Rathergate mess .
The effect of the internet on our culture has barely been felt .
But the internet has barely seen 10 years as a mainstream communications medium , and is still in a stage of infancy .
Yet , we are already seeing its power .
Blogs , also still in their infancy , have acheived enough prominence that the major media are paying attention , and in several cases , blogs have changed the debate .
Some have claimed , and a case can be made , that George W. Bush would not have been reelected without bloggers shaping the debate .
The internet is a medium with little or no cost of entry .
It requires nothing more than a will and a message to get your voice out there .
Of course , unlike the current television media , finding people to listen to that voice is not easy .
On the bright side , however , compelling information has a way of ensuring that it is heard .
The terms “ meme ” and “ blog - swarm ” express just how quickly and widely information can stretch their legs .
Last year , when I was ( I still am , of course ! ) a small - time blogger , I started a meme , and checked back on it every month or so using technorati .
The meme was going strong for months , finding its way to corners of the blogosphere that I would never have known to exist .
And blog - swarms are feared by those in power .
A couple of bloggers uncovering problems with documents ignited a blog - swarm which destroyed the credibility of Dan Rather and seriously injured that of CBS .
It eventually grew large enough to force the major media outlets to cover the story .
Heretofore unexplored , of course , is how the growth of the internet and blogs as a medium will affect liberty .
Here , it comes down to a matter of core beliefs .
I ’ve always believed that those who are conditioned to follow , will follow .
Those who are conditioned to make up their own mind , will make up their own mind .
This is all about changing people ’s conditioning .
As I said initially , this is a tall order , because years of television have given our nation the wrong conditioning .
But the internet empowers people .
Those of us who are trying to make our voices heard can do so .
Those in the world who are looking for information outside that provided by the major media outlets can find it .
When individuals become empowered , it is contagious .
What do we need to do to restore lost liberty and return to smaller government ?
We need to empower people and let them see– for themselves – that they do n’t need government to provide for them .
They need to see that by controlling the reality of the world around them , that they can do so much more efficiently than the government .
They ’re already getting this on their own ; all they need are guides to find their way .
In the run-up to the American Revolution , people were n’t striking out against England because they “ all of a sudden ” started believing in independence .
The world was changing , and the old power structures were no longer viable .
Our Founding
Fathers were guides along the path , setting up a nation which they believed was suited to the new environment .
Our world is changing , and the old power structures are no longer viable .
Whether or not your or my view of how the new structures should fit are correct , what we are doing is not futile .
I honestly believe that liberty is not dead , and that big government can be defeated , and will do all that is in my power to achieve that end .

Birth of a Package
In the center of the Hive , in the depths of its darkness , there is a bee .
She is 1.759218604415e+13 , but for short we will call her E13 , and as we begin to listen to the hive , she is resting because she has just hatched .
Bees are born adults , and she will not sleep again for six weeks .
Then she will sleep forever .
It is warm in the center of the hive , and she is just becoming used to the pulse and hum when the top of the world is peeled away , and light floods in around her .
The alarm scent fills the air but it is masked with the scent of smoke , which grips her instinct driven mind with fear .
A million generations of bees before her have honored the fire smell as the harbinger of death , and she rushes to feed in case the colony must take flight and abandon its home .
Suddenly the comb upon which she rests is raised from the hive and bright light blinds her .
Her wings are not yet hardened , she can not fly .
She can only cling to the comb with all her might , but the comb is shaking .
One leg slips loose , and another , and then she is falling away from hive and home .
She bounces on something metal and comes to rest in a steadily growing pile of disoriented bees .
Legs wave everywhere , wings buzz furiously , and here the smell of anger and alarm is thick , but for E13 it different .
It is the smell of fear .
As quickly as the terror began it stops as the flood of bees from above slows and then halts .
With a swirl and thud and a chorus of unhappy wing beats her prison is carried away and stacked .
She can not see this though , trapped under a pile of angry bees .
In this new place the air is quieter , and the beat of wings and tone of the air is that of ten thousand sisters anxious to return home .
The attackers are not present , but still the bees are restrained by the screens on the sides .
The oldest press against the wire , probing for a way home .
E13 , however , is too young to know what to do .
Then she smells something new .
From above her a bee is sending a new signal , one she knows without having ever smelled it before .
Gather , it says .
It compels her to grasp the bee above her and cling .
As the minutes pass others cling to her , and others to them , until the bees have formed a pulsing core in the wooden box that is their prison .
The eldest bees continue to crawl the screens searching for salvation .
E13 is not so old .
Bees are guided and bound to the scent of their queen , but she had so little time to know the queen .
Among the smells of alarm and gather , a new scent is drifting , and the moment it strikes E13 it changes her .
It is the queen scent .
Trapped in a tiny wooden cage , separate from her sisters is a queen bee .
She is not the queen from E13 ’s hive , but E13 is lost without the scent of her queen .
Any queen .
E13 works her way forward into the ball of bees until she can touch the screen separating her from this different queen .
She extends her proboscis through the mesh , touching the new queen , picking up from her a jolt of this scent , and in a flash it is done .
This queen is now the queen .
Her queen .
Others do not agree .
They grasp the screen , biting at it , scratching it with their mandibles , flexing their stingers .
This is not the queen , they say .
If you put voice to the warring chemicals , it would be an argument , a vicious war of words and deeds .
“ Not the queen , ” says their chemical memories .
These bees had lived in the broodnest and seen the queen , touched her as she passed .
The smell of the old queen is not present though , and in the chemical silence , the new queen asserts , “ There is a queen .
I am the queen . ”
The bees do not agree at first , but the longer they listen to her , the less they can remember which was the voice of their queen .
Some approach and feed her , sharing nectar they stashed before the shaking .
As these bees feed others the scent of the queen passes along , whispered mouth to mouth , “ There is a queen .
This is her scent . ”
It will be days before the process is complete , but in the center of a box , at the heart of a bundle of bees , E13 has borne witness to the birth of a new colony .
The View from the House Bees are colony organisms , meaning that the living being is really the sum total of the hive occupants , much like a living city .
New colonies can be formed by taking pieces from existing ones , but the process is not gentle .
In this case , it 's like picking up a bus load of people , shaking them until their organs fall out , and then bundling the resultant mess in with a nice fresh heart and waiting for a person to emerge .
Packages ( the term for the aforementioned buzzing box o' bees ) are literally shaken together , by putting a metal funnel above a package box , grabbing a frame from a hive , and shaking the bees off of it , and down the funnel .
They sound like M&M 's as they go down .
The secret to making this work is that before the bees were shaken in , a queen was placed carefully in a queen cage , hanging inside the package box .
Once the box weighs the right amount ( usually 3 pounds ) , the funnel is removed , a feeder can is put in , and the package is carried off to stack somewhere in a back room or dock .
During the shaking , alarm pheromones flood the air , a scent like rotten bananas which incites bees to sting and whips them into a frenzy , but for little good .
Alarm !
Alarm , screams the voice of the hives , amid the confusion of the shake .
In the tiny box instinctual terror reigns as they are bounced about , the alarm scent mixing with the scent of crushed bees .
Bees are driven to defend their home , and return to their queen .
Each and every queen smells different , and the bees of a hive know their queen , because it is like knowing themselves .
She may be their mother , or not , but the reigning queen is imprinted upon their chemical memory like the North Star .
The Queen , The Hive , demands instinct , and they shuffle from edge to edge on the screen , pressed in among thousands of others , but they cannot reach their hive , and in this quiet dock where the packages are stocked , the scent of home is far away .
The field bees that were caught in the shake are older , more stubborn , their " memories " go back further , and they continue to press against the screen of the package , but in the center , something is changing .
The younger bees , nurse bees and house bees are more impressionable .
Their short lives have been spent in the heart of the broodnest , where the scent , the voice of the queen is everywhere , so strong that it is like she is thundering , I am the Queen .
The Queen is here .
All is well .
In this package , that familiar chemical voice has fallen silent .
In its absence , they are lost .
Then , the bees nearest the queen , the youngest bees , catch a new scent , mixed with the terror and alarm .
It is the pheromone of the new queen in the package , and while it stands out as not quite right , they are calmed .
A single bee lifts its abdomen and begins to beat its wings , releasing a new scent , that smells of lemon grass .
This is the gathering scent , a whisper at first that says
We are here .
Gather .
Other bees catch the scent , and pass it on , and now the whisper is spoken aloud , Gather , and louder yet , GATHER as the cluster forms about the new queen .
In this area where the packages are stocked , the scent is everywhere , and the bees , each in their own private disaster , gather together .
The mind of the colony , formed by consensus and communicated by chemicals coalesces .
It is not yet unified , but it is present .
The colony is estranged from itself , split from those who remember the " voice " of the old queen , and those too young to know differently .
Even among the nurse bees , they are divided , at times driven to tend to this queen among them , at times driven to tear her apart , but as the hours go by , another shift occures .
Their chemical memories are not forever , and in the confines of the package , as instinct demands Find your Queen , the only answer is the ever present repletion by existence of the new queen : I am the queen .
All will be well .
If there are no other voices to challenge hers , it will be .
Their North Star has been eclipsed for so long they can no longer remember what it looked like , but in their communal darkness , they see a new light .
The oldest of the field bees , the foragers , may never agree .
They may never fully join the new colony , drifting to some other hive , or dying in the cold , but when the colony speaks now , the voice is clear and united .
United though they are , tough times await this new package .
When they arrive at their new home they will be sprayed with sugar water ( sometimes submerged ! ) , and then unceremoniously dumped into their new home .
In the darkness of the new hive , this saga will play out again , but at a lighting pace , the colony quickly sorting itself , verifying that the queen is present , and then gathering .
For a day they hang , organizing .
And then the colony begins its life .
Foragers forage .
House bees clean .
Nurse bees draw comb .
And the queen ?
She is present , walking among her workforce .
As she passes , the bees that attend her pass her scent , one to another , until it fills the colony , giving purpose to them , driving the colony to exist , the hive mind to decide .
The Queen is here .
All is well , says the scent .
In time , that is true .
Hive , Sweet Hive
So , now that you have a bee ’s eye view of the process , let ’s move on to actually getting the bees into their box .
This probably wo n’t hurt a bit .
Step 0 : Things you want to have handy …
Bee Prepared : I know , you ca n’t wait to get to the part where there are bees flying everywhere , crawling all over you , and the air is filled with buzzing , but we are n’t quite ready yet .
Before you start , make sure you have the following supplies ready to go .
A hive of some sort .
Langstroth , Top Bar , a custom design , whatever .
It should already be assembled and in place wherever it goes .
If you are going to paint it , it should already be painted and dry .
A box of bees ( package ) .
A veil , bee suit with veil , or veil with jacket .
Keeping the bees out of your ears and eyes is a good idea .
Also , if you do n’t have a bee suit , do not forget to tape down / Velcro closed your pant legs .
There ’s going to be a lot of confused bees soon , and confused bees crawl .
Your dark pant leg will look quite inviting , and the results will be humorous to you .
In a few years .
Assuming you are not allergic .
Gloves ?
That ’s up to you .
If it makes you calmer , go for it .
Do n’t have a pair ?
Use a pair of rubber dish gloves .
Yes , the bees can still sting you through it .
It ’s more about how you feel than whether or not it ’s really useful .
A hive tool , or screwdriver with narrow edge .
A few mini marshmallows .
A spray bottle with sugar water in it .
You want it more on the spray end of the spectrum than the pressure washer side of things .
A paperback book , or small piece of plywood ( by small , I mean about 5x8 ) A large rock or brick for the hive top .
What is missing from this list ?
A smoker .
Except it ’s not missing , it ’s just not needed .
While you might be eager to light it up old smoky and do your impression of a dragon , leave the smoker in the shed .
Smoke calms bees by making them drink honey and masking the alarm pheromone .
If you have n’t noticed , take a good , long look at the package .
See any honey in there ?
No ?
Well , another thing smoke does is make them go down in the frames .
Take another look at that package .
See any frames there ?
No ?
Well , another thing smoke does is upset the bees , when they ca n’t gorge on honey , and they have no place to hide .
With no frames , and no honey , the only thing that smoke will do is add to their paranoia level .
You ’ll get plenty of chances to use the smoker through the months ahead , I promise .
Step 1 : So , I have this box …
You already have a box , one without bees .
We call that box a hive , because it ’s where the bees will live .
You probably already have , will have , or are considering having a box with bees .
Unless that box is a hive itself , the bees simply do n’t have room in their tiny package to grow .
The key question here is , how do we get the bees out of their box , and into yours ?
Let ’s start with the package :
Here they are , in all their packaged glory .
You want them out .
They want them out .
First , you need to get ready .
Those bees have probably been in the package for a few days .
The feeding can ( which you cannot see in this picture ) , is behind the wooden strip in the center , covered in hungry bees .
That ’s the first thing to address .
Those bees are probably hungry .
If you do n’t feed me for a few days , I get pretty grouchy .
The bees are n’t too much different .
Mix up some sugar and water , put it in a clean spray bottle , and spray the screen .
Older books ( and some older beekeepers ) recommend brushing the syrup onto the screen .
To see why I think that ’s a bad idea , tilt the package over slightly , and look down at the screen .
See all those feet and tongues sticking through ?
Do n’t brush those off .
Spray them .
When you spray the screen , the sugar water beads on it and you do n’t see tongues extending out to take it , they ’ve had enough .
Full bees are happy bees .
Take a moment and smell the package , because you wo n’t get another chance to do this for a while .
No , this is n’t one of those weird shows where you are going to gag .
If the bees are fanning ( and they probably are ) , they will smell slightly of lemon grass .
It ’s a good smell , the gather smell .
Remember it .
If you need to store the package until you can hive them , do so some place dark and quiet but not hot .
If you are wondering whether or not they like it better in the dark , listen to them in the dark .
Now , flip on the light and listen again .
See ?
Now that you ’ve given them several good drinks of syrup and they are back in the dark , they ’ll be ok if you ca n’t hive them today / tonight .
Just remember , if you took a road trip in a Volkswagen bus with several thousand friends , you would probably want to stretch your legs on arrival .
Do n’t make them wait too long , ok ?
Step 2 : Open Sesame …
Get ready to open the box .
Not that box , the other box .
Do all this right by the hive .
Do not disassemble the package across the yard from the hive , then attempt to ferry the pieces back and forth .
You ’ll leave a trail of confused bees behind , and spend the afternoon chasing them around to try and put them back in the hive .
Take a moment to put everything close to the hive .
You ’ll be glad you did , and speaking of hives , here ’s one with the top cover removed .
As nice and orderly as the hive above is , it ’s time to take it apart .
You are going to need room to put some bees into this box , along with a queen ( safely enclosed in her cage ) .
Remove three of the frames , and stack them to the side .
I ’m using foundation starter strips , but if your frames are plastic , black , have full sheets of foundation , or just plain do n’t look like mine , do n’t panic .
The bees do n’t mind .
If you read somewhere else that you should remove four frames , or five , again , this is not a problem .
Remove three , then look at the space .
If you feel like you need more room , take out another one .
Bee Aware :
You are about to get up close and personal with your bees .
A key element of learning to relax around your bees is to have confidence in your equipment .
With that in mind , it is …
Equipment check time –
At this point take a moment to make sure your equipment is ready to go .
Do you have a veil ?
Is it on ?
Are your pant legs tied , taped , or strapped closed ?
Good .
Standing between you and your bees is a metal can .
We ’ve got nothing personal against the can because it ’s what kept the bees in the package while they came here , and it ’s what fed them on the way , but now it ’s got to go .
How do you open the package ?
Look at the top :
If your package does n’t have the can showing on one side , it has a thin slat of wood stapled to it covering the can .
Pry it off with the hive tool , and now your package looks like mine .
You want me to do what ?
Remember that the package is an artificial swarm .
The scent of the queen , or queen pheromone , is what is inspiring them to gather together around her .
Normally that ’s a good thing .
Right now we need them out of the box , and currently there are a few thousand of her lady friends in the way .
Our goal is to remove the queen cage so it can be hung in the hive .
The queen cage has a thin strip of metal attached to it that fits through the slot by the can .
That thin piece of wire will bend and slide along the slot toward the opening where the can is until you can lift out the queen .
Bee Careful : Do not bend the wire yet .
If you do not hold onto it , the queen cage can slip down into the package , and you will get the joy of reaching into the ball of bees to retrieve her .
Besides , the can is still in the way .
Step 3 : You Can Can Can too… ( well , you could if that can was n’t in the way ) Bee Aware : Now , it probably wo n’t do much good to assure you of this , but the bees you are about to let out are in all likelihood not angry .
They are , however , lost , confused , and mildly agitated .
Angry bees bounce off of your veil and sting your clothes .
Confused bees buzz around in circles , eventually landing on the package , the hive , or you .
Take a breath .
Take several .
Relax .
Now , about those bees :
Start with a few more squirts of sugar water on the cluster .
These are bees , not fish , but if they are slightly wet , they ’ll fly less .
When you remove the can , the hole it is filling will be open .
When the hole is open , some bees will fly out .
Do not panic .
Even if they fly near you , do not panic .
Even if they land on you , do not panic .
We now return to the regularly scheduled package installation .
The bad news is :
You have a mass of wet , sticky , homeless bees .
The good news is :
Things can only get better .
Take a close look at that can again .
Sometimes the can is loose in the package – to test , gently turn the package on its side and try to slide the can out half an inch or so .
Do not turn the package upside down to slip the can out , or a glob of bees might fall out with it .
That would n’t be horrible for the bees but it might disturb you .
If the can is loose you can skip the part where we play with sharp pointy objects .
If that disappoints you feel free to pretend that the can is stuck , because as even cave men knew , Pointy Sharp things can be fun .
Most likely , the can is stuck .
Take your hive tool , and look at the edge of the can .
You can pry at the edge of the can to lift it up .
Work away at the edge of the wood until you feel the hive tool to catch on the can rim .
If the can rim is down too far , use the hive tool as a miniature pick to dig into the wood and notch it enough to grab that rim .
Now you can lift it ever so slightly .
Lay the package on the side if you need to , but be gentle .
Work the hive tool around so that the flat of the blade is under the can rim , and you can get leverage to start that can out .
Now , grab the can and slowly , softly , edge it further out .
The point here is not to remove the can entirely yet , but if that happens , do n’t panic .
Do not pull hard on the can , unless you are prepared for the can to shoot out .
Worse yet , if that happens , you might drop the package .
So do n’t , ok ?
If you look closely , you can see why the can was hard to remove .
There are tiny bits of wax drawn on the edge .
The moment has finally come to kick that can .
Bee Aware :
When you do this , the hole will be open .
Some bees will come out .
Do not panic .
Have that paperback / small piece of plywood handy .
If you are at ease with bees flying around you can skip the part about covering the hole , but if you are slightly nervous , keep that board handy .
Keep in mind , however , that the goal here is not to keep the bees all in the box .
If a few get out , or even more than a few , that is no cause for concern .
Since you have some work to do with the queen cage next it might be easier on you if there are a few fewer flying friends .
Take the can out and slide the paperback or wood over the hole gently .
Step 4 : Like a carnival game , designed by Satan … Remember that piece of metal that holds the queen cage ?
It ’s time to use that .
Pick up the box with one hand on each end if the hole is n’t covered , or one hand over the piece of wood and one on the end if it is .
When you pick it up , watch to make sure you do not grab any bees that might be clinging to the outside of the box or screen .
Firmly whack the box on the ground .
Your goal is not to squish bees , or smash the box , or anything like that .
The bees are clustered about the queen cage , and you want to knock most of them off .
They will buzz .
They will sound unhappy .
If someone smacked you upside the head , you ’d be slightly unhappy as well .
Take the metal strip , bend it up so that it can slide along the slot , and slide it toward whatever you are using to cover the hole .
Sometimes the person who cut the slot for the queen cage was having a bad day , and you ’ll get to turn the tab or angle it to continue sliding out .
Think of it like a carnival game .
If you did n’t block the hole , just slide it on out .
If you did , uncover it , and lift out the cage .
A bunch of bees will come with the queen cage .
Recover the hole , if you are going to , and turn your attention to the queen .
I like to set the queen cage on top of the package and get ready for the next step .
Take a moment to observe any bees on the screen .
Are they extending their tongues to feed her ?
Or jerking back and forth , biting at the cage ?
That will tell you if the queen is accepted by the package yet .
Usually , the bees on the cage will leave on their own , letting you work in peace .
If not , just do n’t squash one and you ’ll be fine .
Step 5 : Your throne awaits , Your Majesty … .
Now we have to get the queen cage ready and into position .
You can see the queen in the cage , and it ’s a good idea to take a look at her .
If she ’s dead , better to find out right now .
If she is dead , you need another queen , so put the can back in the package , put the package some place safe , get back in the car and go get one .
You need a way to hang the queen cage in the hive .
See the metal tongue by which you lifted the cage from the package ?
Bend it to make an L shaped hook wide enough to hang from a frame .
Next , look at your cage .
Some queen cages come with candy at one end which the bees chew through , releasing the queen .
The time it takes them to chew through gives them time to accept the queen .
This candy is usually covered with a cork to keep the queen in until the package is hived .
Some cages , however , do not have candy they have only a cork .
Step 6 : Marshmallow to the rescue
No cork means no slow release .
If you package has been together for days that ’s not a big deal .
In that case this queen is the only one they ’ve got , and they ’ll accept her ( unless there ’s an unmarked queen loose in the package , which happens from time to time ) .
Some people advocate directly releasing the queen .
I do n’t , because I paid a lot of money for her and patience is a good idea at this point .
If your cage has candy it probably has a cork covering the candy .
If so pull that out .
If you pulled the wrong end and there ’s a set of eyes staring at you , do n’t worry , proceed ahead as though you never had a candy plug .
For those in the “ Just a cork ” club , we ’ll make a plug to slow them down .
Get one of the marshmallows you brought with you .
Wait for the queen to go to the other end of the cage ( and she will , if you are patient ) .
Remove the cork and stuff a marshmallow into the cage .
Step 7 : Just hanging around …
Hang the queen cage by the “ L ” from a frame – if there are no attendants , the candy should go down .
If there are attendants , try to get the cage at an angle so that a dead attendant does not block in the queen .
Bee Careful :
If you are using foundation , and your cage , like this one , has only one screened side , make certain that that side is available to the workers .
Otherwise , your queen could starve .
She ’s quite co-dependent on the workers .
I like to adjust the cage until it hangs so that I can put the frames back together , but just about any way you put it in will work as long as the bees can get to their queen to feed her , and the candy to eat it .
Step 8 : Shake , rattle and roll
The queen cage is hung in the hive .
The frames are removed .
The can has been kicked .
The only thing left to do is to boot a few thousand bees into their new home .
Before you do that , look at the edge of the screen .
See all the bees on the outside ?
Those are the confused bees that came out when I opened the package .
If they were angry , they ’d be on me , bumping me , and probably stinging .
In a moment , you will be dumping several thousand of them into their new home , so there will be a great many more confused bees .
Stay calm .
Bees are aggressive when they ’ve got something to fight for .
These bees have nothing .
They are miserable , cold , wet , sticky , and have been bounced around , but at this point all they ’d really like is a nice home and some peace and quiet .
Bee Aware :
If you thought there were a lot of bees flying around before , get ready for the real deal .
A quick tug and adjust on the veil can make this all go much smoother .
With that in mind , it is …
Equipment check time , Round two – Do you have a veil ?
Is it on ?
Are your pant legs tied , taped , or strapped closed ?
How do we get the bees out ?
We remove whatever is covering the hole in the package ( if we covered it ) , turn the package over , and dump them into the box .
If they do n’t come out we shake it .
We tilt it to get more out .
We continue shaking until most of the bees are out of the package and into the hive .
Here we go : Step 9 : Last call
That one picture represents a lot of shaking .
The package is now mostly empty .
Tilt the box up against the entrance to let the stubborn , stupid , or straggler bees have a chance to get with the program .
That ’s nice , is n’t it ?
They can walk right out of the package and into the hive .
Step 10 : Framed , I tell you Take the frames you set to the side earlier and put them gently into place .
If you move slowly the bees will get out of the way .
Some bees are dumb and get killed .
Cry for them later , because you ’ve got more to do right now .
Step 11 : Closing Time
With all the frames in , slide your cover into place .
If you have an inner cover put it on first , using it as a bee dozer .
The cover will slowly pushing the bees out of the way ( usually off the front of the hive ) .
If you are using a migratory cover ( I am ) just do it with the cover .
Put a rock on the lid .
Gather up your tools and take a quick peek at the front of the hive .
Odds are you have bees in front fanning .
Their tails are in the air , their wings are spread and beating , and their abdomens pulse .
If you lean over and sniff , you may catch a trace of the gather scent .
This is excellent , as they are releasing a chemical scent that will motivate the stragglers to join the party .
Do not pick up Hitchhikers , next 200 yards
Go back to the house and have a helper look for bees on your back , legs , etc .
Be careful if you are pulling off your hood / veil – this is the top of my jacket hood after the hiving , right where I normally grab it to pull it off .
There were about five more .
While those bees are n’t angry , if you squish one it is likely you will regret it .
While you are at it , if you taped down your pant legs carefully check to see if a misguided bee has attempted to burrow into your cuff .
I carried three of them back to the house with me , and one stung me on the stomach while I talked with my wife .
How ’s that for gratitude ?
Patience , Grasshopper Congratulations – you have hived a package .
Leave it alone for a week to get things rolling , then come back ready to learn .
A week is a killer , is n’t it ?
If you want to know how things are going watch the front of the hive – when you see pollen coming in , it ’s a good sign .
Bees bring in pollen to feed brood , and you want lots and lots of brood ( but that ’s for next time ) .
