The three strikes and you 're out plan to disconnect filesharers from the net , proposed by UK business secretary Lord Mandelson , has encountered criticism from ISPs and digital rights groups alike , but fails to tackle the central issues .
The ISPs justly complain that they are being made to shoulder the weight and the cost of enforcing a law that is beyond the remit of their service .
If copyright law is unclear about the rights of individuals to copy or give away articles that are in their rightful possession , how can an ISP be asked to arbitrate on the rights and wrongs of content over which it has no control ?
An ISP provides a telephonic connection to the internet and access down the wires to billions of web pages , but can not and should not control the content of those pages , or access to them .
The central issue is copyright and the ownership of ideas .
Paradoxes of ownership and authorship of innovative and creative work lie at the heart of the debate about " intellectual property rights " - a debate which is a vital part of the culture that has evolved around the internet , and the gadgets with which we work , rest and play .

Marina Sabatier is believed to have been killed last month
The parents of a French eight - year - old girl whose body was found encased in concrete have been held on suspicion of manslaughter , official sources say .
The girl , Marina Sabatier , was discovered at her father 's workplace in Le Mans , south - west of Paris .
On Wednesday the parents told police the girl had been kidnapped .
Prosecutors say they believe Marina died after being beaten last month , and that the body was kept in a freezer before being covered in concrete .
Prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation against both parents on suspicion of manslaughter , violence against a minor , and wasting police time .
On Wednesday the father told officers that Marina had been taken from his car , which he had parked to buy food at a McDonalds ' restaurant near Le Mans .
Prosecutors say that after the body was found on Friday , the couple confessed to police that they had maltreated Marina - who had Down 's Syndrome - but insisted that she had died of natural causes .
They told investigators that they had found her body in their basement in early August and , in a panic , had hidden it in a freezer .
Later the father is said to have placed the body in a container at his workplace , and filled it with concrete .
The couple concocted the abduction story as school authorities were bound to ask questions at the start of the term , police said .
They could face life imprisonment if convicted .
They have four other children , who have been placed into care by social services .

It is twilight time on Saturn .
Shadows lengthened to stretch thousands of miles across the planet ’s famous rings this summer as they slowly tilted edge - on to the Sun , which they do every 15 years , casting into sharp relief every bump and wiggle and warp in the buttery and wafer - thin bands that are the solar system ’s most popular scenic attraction .
From her metaphorical perch on the bridge of the Cassini spacecraft , which has been orbiting Saturn for five years , Carolyn Porco , who heads the camera team , is ecstatic about the view .
“ It ’s another one of those things that make you pinch yourself and say , ‘ Boy am I lucky to be around now , ’ ” Dr. Porco said .
“ For the first time in 400 years , we ’re seeing Saturn ’s rings in three dimensions . ”
On Monday , Dr. Porco and the Cassini team released a grand view of the rings in all their shadowed glory , including clumps , spikes , undulations and waves two and a half miles high on the edge of one ring .
“ We always knew it would be good ; instead , it ’s been extraordinary , ” Dr. Porco said of the cascade of results that have placed her in a spotlight to which she has become increasingly accustomed .
“ I feel I ’m on a great human adventure , ” she said .
Alain Robert held by Malaysian police after bare - handed 1,500 ft climb with no safety equipment

The climber known as the French Spiderman has been arrested after scaling the 88 - storey Petronas twin towers in Malaysia .
Alain Robert , 47 , reached the top of the 452 - metre ( 1,483ft ) building at 7.30 am local time and unfurled a Malaysian flag .
Robert , who suffers from vertigo after two severe falls in 1982 , slipped past security to begin his climb of one of the tallest buildings in the world two hours earlier .
He climbed bare - handed and with no ropes .
He was confronted by security guards as he descended the building and was detained at Dang Wangi police station in central Kuala Lumpur .
The station 's chief officer told reporters that police were anxious to find out how Robert got into the country .
The BBC reported that the climber could be charged with trespass after failing to obtain a permit for the stunt .
It was the Frenchman 's third attempt at climbing the Petronas towers , having been thwarted in 1997 and 2007 .
He has made a career out of scaling some of the tallest structures in the world , including the Eiffel tower , One Canada Square in Canary Wharf and the Empire State building .
During the G20 summit in London this year he climbed to the ninth floor of the Lloyd 's building in London and unfurled a 30 - metre banner declaring there were 100 months to save the planet .
In December 2004 he climbed the world 's tallest building , Taipei 101 , in Taiwan 's capital .
The state Bureau of Labor and Industries has ordered Michael Ruppert , publisher of From the Wilderness magazine , and his company to pay a $ 125,000 for mental and emotional suffering and $ 2,713 in lost wages to a former employee for workplace harassment and retaliation .
The bureau said that amid a continuing pattern of harassment that began shortly after Lindsay Gerken was hired by From the Wilderness Inc. , formerly based in Ashland , Ruppert came to Gerken 's office door " wearing only his underwear and a smile . "
When Gerken declined Rupert 's explicit invitation to engage in a sexual relationship , the bureau said , she was terminated the following week .
" BOLI will not allow employers to ignore fundamental protections for workers rights , " said Brad Avakian , the state labor commissioner .
" Sexual harassment of this magnitude is a brazen violation of the law . "
At the time the harassment and retaliation occurred , Lindsay Gerken was 25 years old and just beginning her professional career , the bureau said .
It said Michael Ruppert was in his mid-50s and a celebrity investigative journalist in the literary community surrounding " peak oil " and sustainability .

After playing the piece of **** game that was Uncharted 1 my expectations for this game were very low , thankfully i was wrong and Uncharted 2 After playing the piece of **** game that was Uncharted 1 my expectations for this game were very low , thankfully i was wrong and Uncharted 2 is not only a huge , HUGE , HUGE !!!
improvement over the last game , but it's also one of the best adventure games i have ever played .
STORY : You start hanging on a train , you avoid death and then it goes into a flashback .
After getting enormous treasure at the end of Uncharted 1 , Nathan is just minding his own business when suddenly an old friend of his called Flynn offers Nathan a new " job " which consists of getting a treasure of Marco Polo in a museum with the help of a girl called Chloe .
Eventually they do just that and find a treasure map that leads to Shambhala and the Cintamani stone , but after hearing this Flynn betrays Nathan and makes it so Nathan gets captured .
Sully and Chloe get Nathan out of prison and now it 's a race to see who gets the stone first .
This story has a much more Indiana Jones type of feel and i love for that .
PRESENTATION : Graphics are greatly improved with more colors , better models , physics , textures , lighting effects , animations and shaders , but the eyes look weird and sometimes the human models look like they 're made with plastic , but aside from that there 's i have nothing to complain about .
Same goes for the music , since it 's more memorable than last time and it fits the situation perfectly .
The game runs at 720 p and 30 fps , but with this level of detail ... i feel is justified ( unlike the first game ) .
Overall a great presentation and if i had to nitpick about it ... well i did found 3 glitches in my 10 hour playthrough ... that 's it .
GAMEPLAY : Uncharted 2 not only fixes every problem i had with the first game in this aspect , but it also adds some new stuff to make this a far better game .
First of all the parkour system has been improved .
Now you can move in a 3D environment while climbing , rather than just pushing X a few times to get from point A to point B on a wall .
You can climb by hanging on the roofs and you can shoot while ... well ... climbing .
You can also switch from from side to side by pressing X and you can drop down to hang on another things .
The parkour system is more interesting and fun this time around thanks to all this improvements .
Aiming is a lot more precise and less loose .
The cover mechanic is a lot more well done , you can switch from place to place immediately while covering by pressing O while holding the analog stick and if you sneak up on a enemy , you can silently take them out with the square button .
And if you do that you can steal from them a bunch weapons like some guns or grenades , that now have their own button ( or trigger if you consider is on L2 ) , which makes them a lot more convenient to use and if you press the trigger by error , just push up on the D - pad to cancel it .
Melee combat is a lot faster , but still very simple .
You just mash the Square button until they die and if they attack you you can press Triangle to dodge and counterattack ...umm ... that sounds familiar ... Batman Arkham Asylum anyone ?.
Nah but to be fair both titles did came out the same year , but Batman did came out 2 months earlier .
If you defeat some enemies with the melee combat they will give their items , like riot shields or whatever .
There 's a lot of weapons in this game and surprisingly i found myself switching from weapon to weapon ( especially at the later part of the game ) .
Checkpoints are really abundant and fair .
The quick time events are still here and they are used just like in God of War , to solve puzzles , push this , see this , see that , etc .
The game has some awesome set pieces that get you so pumped and it 's just ... ugh so epic .
And the puzzles are still easy , but more creative .
The game has incredible variety , sometimes you do puzzles , sometimes you shoot with cover , sometimes you shoot without cover , or while carrying someone , or shooting while climbing , or shooting solo , or shooting with 2 - 4 panthers , or running away while shooting or other times without shooting , really the differences in kind are all over the place .
The partners this time get a lot more attention this time .
And do n't worry the AI works very well and heck they can even kill enemies .
Sometimes you need them to get over that or drop something to go up , and it 's really useful and fun .
The only negative thing i can say is that there 's a lack of bosses in this game , but i will say that this game final boss is a lot better compared to the mindless and boring quick time event boss we got last time .
I do n't know if i made it clear at this point , but Uncharted 2 is an incredible game .
While the first game was just a big disappointment , this ... this is what you call a great sequel and a great game overall and with improved mechanics like parkour , melee and shooting , great graphics , music , variety , more colors and just being outright fun .
Uncharted 2 gets a 10/10 a must have for the PS3 and if the frame rate and resolution really bothers you , play it on PS4 .

If you love wine , it 's a very good year .
Not only is the vintage coming out of California expected to be excellent , but prices have collapsed .
You can get good wine for cheap .
" This , I think , is a major correction that 's happened , " says Richard Sanford of Alma Rosa Winery & Vineyards .
His grapevines are tucked in the Santa Rita Hills of Santa Ynez , the central coast region made famous in the film " Sideways " .
Sanford planted his first vineyard 40 years ago .
He 'd come back from Vietnam and decided to do something a little more uplifting .
Sanford studied the topography up and down California and decided that the Santa Rita hills , a range that moves west to east instead of north to south , might provide the best equivalent to Burgundy , France .
It took a while to get people to believe him , especially investors .
But these days , Pinot Noir from the area commands a high price .
Or it did .
Now the world is swimming in wine as people are trading down , or just not buying at all , and higher priced wines are gathering dust unless they go on sale .
" I think we 're going to see a lot more Two Buck Chucks hitting the market , " says John Krska of Krska Vineyard and Winery Management .
" We have some winemakers who 've skipped a whole vintage , and that 's to get their warehouses caught up to sell wine . "
For example , Krska says high - quality Chardonnay grapes usually sell for $ 2,700 to $ 3,500 a ton .
But this year , low - to - mid quality Chardonnay grapes in other parts of the state can be had for only $ 200 a ton .
" If the wineries up north can't sell that , they 're paying for tank space and the refrigeration , it 's gone for a buck a gallon , " to Trader Joe's .
Krska says he 's been able to sell all of the grapes under his management this year , but he 's a concerned about next year .
" I think it 's the economic woes in the background , saying ' Do we make more wine , or do we not make more ? ' "
Even the region 's vaunted Pinot Noir may come under pressure in the next few years as some already - planted vineyards start to produce a crop .
Still , there 's nothing as romantic for wine lovers as being in the vineyard during harvest ( said by someone who does n't do the harvesting ) .
I have the privilege of visiting here often , as my sister - in - law , Chris Jones , has a vineyard here with her husband , John , called Faith Vineyard .
In fact , that 's where I 'm reporting live from today .
For those of you who 've always dreamed of owning a vineyard , Chris and John actually made the dream come true .
John is a 747 Captain for United Airlines ( his day job ) , while Chris is a writer .
A dozen years ago , during the last real estate bust in California , they bought land in Los Olivos , down the road from Michael Jackson 's Neverland estate .
They planted seven acres of Sangiovese and Sauvignon Blanc .
Turns out it 's a lot harder than it looks .
John tweetsabout his battles against the VA , the " Vertebrate Alliance " , rodents and birds and coyotes who insist on making a feed trough out of the vineyard .
Chris has taken photographs and written about what it 's really like in the vineyard , in a book called " One Vintage " .
Yes , I know , I 'm plugging my sister - in - law 's book , but what I love about " One Vintage " is how much it teaches me about winemaking , about how the grapes develop , as Chris also discovers that the cycle in the vineyard mirrors life .
This year , it 's not so rosy in the rosé .
Chris and John , like many other growers , fear their wine investment will end up in the ... red.
CalPERS , the nation 's largest public employee pension plan , has invested $ 200 million over the last few years in two vineyards in Santa Ynez .
Those investments have lost money .
Richard Sanford has seen many booms and busts in the wine business , but this time , he says " we 're competing on a world stage with wine . "
Sanford says the wine business is very capital - intensive , and investors have to learn that it takes years to see a return .
New money is hard to come by these days .
" A lot of people are finding that there 's is n't a lot of capital available , " he says .
" I do n't think there are new operations starting out these days . "
Sanford feels lucky .
Sales at his winery this year are ahead of 2008 .
" I think that quality will always shine through . "
We spoke while sipping his new Pinot Noir , which he and tasting room manager Chris Burroughs were trying to describe .
" Hazelnuts ? " Sanford suggested .
" Brambly , " was Borroughs ' take .
" That 's so good , " was the best I could come up with .
" I think that 's the best term of all , " Sanford laughed .

Objective - C remains an impediment for many programmers coming to the Mac or iPhone platforms — few programmers have ever experienced it before learning Cocoa , forcing two learning curves at once for new Cocoa developers .
How did Apple end up with such a weird language ?
And for a company known to replace CPU architectures and their entire operating system , why does Apple persist with Objective -C ?
The answer lies in the methods .
Virtual methods
Most compiled , object - oriented languages ( like C++ , Java and C♯ ) adhere closely to the object - oriented approaches first introduced in Simula 67 — in particular the concept of virtual methods and how they enable methods to be overridden .
Origins in Algol :
In much the same way that Objective - C is often called a " pure superset " of C , Simula 67 was a " pure superset " of Algol 60 .
While Fortran is sometimes remembered as the first high - level language to gain popularity ( and disdain ) , Algol 60 was the first programming language to actually resemble a modern language as it contained the for , if / else , while ( of sorts ) , and other procedural contructs that are expected now in programming languages .
While Algol was rarely used past the 1970's , Pascal and its descendants closely resemble Algol in syntax .
In a compiled language , a regular function ( non-overrideable ) ends up as a basic memory address .
When the function is invoked , the CPU jumps to the memory address .
Simula 67 introduced virtual method tables to adapt this for object - orientation .
Instead of basic memory addresses , methods are compiled to row numbers in a table .
To get the memory address , the method table is retrieved from the class of the object and the CPU jumps to the address at the specified row .
Since different objects have different classes , they will have different addresses in their method tables , hereby allowing sublcasses to have different implementations of methods ( method overrides ) to their base classes .
Message passing
While virtual method tables do introduce a level of indirection that allows method behavior to change from object to object , the offsets into the table and hence the tables themselves all need to be created at compile - time .
History of message passing :
As with object - orientation itself , message passing was inspired by Simula 67 but Simula 's message passing ( called " Simulation " ) was n't for method invocations — it was instead used for discrete event simulation ( mostly queueing and list processing ) .
Smalltalk expanded upon this idea by using message passing for method invocation .
Smalltalk subsequently inspired the Actor Model ( used in distributed processing ) and remote procedure calls ( RPC ) .
Originally , Smalltalk messages were conceived to have a large amount of metadata ( more like the full headers on an email ) but eventually , this was simplified down to an approach syntactically similar to Objective - C's current implementation ( minus square brackets ) .
Message passing presents an alternative way of solving the method dispatch problem .
Instead of the virtual method 's compile - time offsets and tables which do n't consult the object ( except for its type ) , message passing sends a unique message identifier to the object itself and the object determines at runtime what action to take .
Message passing approaches may still have a virtual method table ( " vtable " ) in the class ' representation but this structure is not known at compile time — it is handled entirely at runtime — and instances of the class have the opportunity to take different actions in response to the message that are unrelated to the content of the table .
There are two important differences here :
Runtime resolution — so the connection between message identifier and action can be changed at runtime .
Involvement of the object itself , not just its class .
On a technical level , the difference between a virtual method table and passing a message identifier is relatively minor ( since both are really table lookups and both are actually performed at runtime ) .
The difference ends up being conceptual :
Virtual method table languages generally make it hard or impossible to change the virtual method table contents or pointers at runtime .
Type safety is essential in a virtual method table language since the compiler may alter table lookups based on type , particularly in cases of multiple inheritance .
In message passing systems , type safety is irrelevant to method invocation .
Why this matters
The short answer is that this dynamic message handling in Objective - C makes it much easier to work within a large framework that you did n't create because you can examine , patch and modify elements of that framework on the fly .
The most common situation where this is likely to occur is when dealing with an application framework .
The biggest reason for this is that you can add or change methods on existing objects , without needing to subclass them , while they are running .
Approaches for this include categories , method swizzling and isa-swizzling .
This makes the following situations possible :
You want to add a convenience method to someone else 's object ( a quick search of my own posts reveals that about a dozens of my own posts involve adding convenience methods to Cocoa classes , e.g. Safely fetching an NSManagedObject by URI ) .
You want to change the behavior of a class you did n't ( and can 't ) allocate because it is created by someone else ( this is how Key - Value Observing is implemented in Cocoa ) .
You want to treat objects generically and handle potential differences with runtime introspection .
You want to substitute an object of a completely different class to the expected class ( this is used in Cocoa by NSProxy to turn a regular object into a distributed object ) .
These points may seem somewhat mild but they are central to maximizing code reuse when working within someone else 's framework : if you need existing code to work differently , you do n't need to reimplement the whole class and you do n't need to change how it is allocated .
Languages using virtual method tables can adopt some of these ideas ( like the boost : : any class or C♯ 4.0 's dynamic member lookup ) but these features have additional restrictions and do n't apply to all objects , meaning that they can't be used on purely arbitrary objects ( such as those you do n't control or did n't create ) and so do n't help when interacting with someone else 's framework .
Simply put : dynamic message passing instead of virtual method invocations makes Objective - C a much better language for working with a large library or framework that someone has written .
The tradeoff
The downside to dynamic message invocation is that it is only as fast as virtual method invocation when the message lookup is cached , otherwise it is invariably slower .
Also , in keeping with the philosophy of a purely dynamic messaging system , Objective - C does not use templates or template metaprogramming and does not have non-dynamic ( i.e. non-virtual ) methods .
This means that Objective - C methods will miss out on the compiler optimizations possible when employing these techniques .
Also , since modern programming in C++ is substantially focussed on these features , it can difficult to adapt programs using these ideas to Objective -C .
Theoretically , Objective - C could implement these features but they are in opposition to the underlying concepts of flexibility and dynamic behavior in Objective - C — and would shut - down all advantages from the previous section if they were used .
Conclusion
It 's not a coincidence that I write an Objective - C/ Cocoa blog , I 'm obviously an advocate of Objective - C and Cocoa .
In my opinion , Objective - C is the best language for programming situations where you must make extensive use of a framework written by someone else ( particularly an application framework ) .
The success of Objective - C in this situation is due to the combination of :
speed and precision ( from its compiled C roots )
dynamic flexibility ( due to using message passing for method invocations )
To frame this conclusion , I 'll state that I 've written major projects using C/ WIN32 , C++/ PowerPlant , C++/MFC , and Java / Swing / AWT .
I 've also dabbled in smaller projects using C♯ /. Net .
In all of these cases I have found the application frameworks to be less flexible and less reusable because they lack the dynamic modifiability of Objective - C .
As I 've stated , I do view Objective - C's strength in the area of application frameworks as a niche ( albeit a very large niche ) .
If I were writing a compiler , OS kernel , or a low - level / high - performance library , then I would use C++ ( I would n't use pure C because I 'd miss my abstractions ) — but these are situations where metaprogramming , greater inlining and faster method invocations would trump flexibility concerns .
Of course , if you have a project that needs to satisfy all these criteria : then there 's always Objective - C++.

By Salena Zito - September 20 , 2009
Two political dangers have emerged in recent months for Democrats , Republicans , and the media that covers both .
Those are the dismissal of protests by all three , and the crude overuse of the race card .
It ’s disturbing that Washington really does n't “ get ” the rest of the country that is beyond their bubble , says Villanova University political scientist Lara Brown .
Last Saturday ’s “ Tea Party ” protest , spreading out across Capitol Hill , received little to no coverage ; most news organizations wildly underreported the crowd ’s size .
Later , former president Jimmy Carter said racism is behind the rhetoric of President Obama ’s critics ; New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd opined similarly .
Here is the problem with that :
Pull out the race card , and the conversation ends .
It does the president no good when anyone who disagrees with him is accused of racism ; it simply builds a resentment that he did not foster .
Besides , most protests of and disagreements over policy have nothing to do with race – and to say that only dilutes real racism .
“ When it comes to race , it is unfortunate that the Democrats are seeing everything through this analytical lens , ” Brown said .
“ It undermines those instances in which racism and discrimination are truly important factors and are harming minorities . ”
Bill Kalin of Portage , Ind. , president of Union Local 6103 , attended last week ’s AFL - CIO convention in Pittsburgh .
He dismissed as ridiculous most of the media depictions of Tea Party protesters .
“ No one should make fun of people that demonstrate , or call them names , ” he said .
Since Democrats took power , the country has moved quickly from one pole to another in its opinions of the president and his party .
A similar phenomenon occurred following George W. Bush ’s 2004 re-election by a decisive majority ; by October 2005 , his approval ratings had fallen substantially .
“ Obama has and is suffering a similar political trajectory to Bush in 2005 , ” Villanova ’s Brown said .
Obama and fellow Democrats in Congress read way too much into their victories in 2006 and 2008 .
They believed that a majority of the country was voting for them , instead of voting against Bush and the Republicans .
A huge emotional attachment is lost when you vote against , rather than for , someone .
The Dems came out swinging in January , with massive legislative reforms and policy demands that had been blocked in the previous eight years .
They passed some of those without noticing that , since February , the tide has slowly been turning against them , starting with widespread unhappiness with the stimulus package .
When the public saw how the stimulus was crafted and passed , and air began leaking from the Obama balloon .
Much of that deflation involves independent voters who thought Obama would at least try to live up to his promises of a different kind of Washington ( less partisanship , more dialogue , less corruption and special - interest influence ) .
“ It is no surprise to me how quickly the public , especially disaffected Dems and independents , have turned , ” Brown said .
“ They learned from Bush and the Republicans that if you give politicians the benefit of the doubt , they will take advantage of that good will . ”
Main Street keeps trying to send a message to the political class with their presidential votes , and the political class keeps reading these votes as affirmations rather than negations .
People voted against Democrats in 2004 and against Republicans in 2008 – not for the other party .
Politicians ’ inability to read those votes correctly may be symptomatic of our narcissistic age , in which everyone thinks everything is about them but no one is accountable for anything , according to Brown .
The Tea Party phenomenon has moved Americans to mobilize and protest as never before , which makes you wonder why the media and elected officials downplay it so much .
As for racism , the majority of the electorate is white , and a majority of it voted for Obama – and people are now demonstrating because they think our country is going off a cliff , not because our president is black .
As one Democrat strategist said : “ I remember seeing a bumper sticker when I was in college in the ’60s that said , ‘ The majority is not silent – the government is deaf . ’
Well , that could not be more true today . ”
No wonder Thomas Jefferson once said he was all for revolutions every so often .
( CNN ) --
A year after beating breast cancer , Peter Criss , a founding member of the rock band KISS , calls himself " the luckiest man in the planet . "
Peter Criss , now 63 , said getting medical treatment early at the first sign of trouble saved his life .
While some men feel embarrassed because of " this macho crap , " Criss said surviving breast cancer -- yes , men get it , too -- was actually a blessing .
He was treated before the tumor could spread and said he 's speaking about male breast cancer now -- during National Breast Cancer Awareness month -- to raise the profile of this rare disease .
Criss , who played drums for KISS and was known as " Catman , " offered this advice to men who spot lumps in their breast : " Do n't sit around playing Mr. Tough Guy .
Do n't say ' It 's going to go away . '
It might not and you might not see life anymore and how beautiful that is . "
The 63 - year - old musician is now cancer free .
Like many others , Criss was n't aware men could get breast cancer .
" Even though we do n't think of men as having breasts , they have breast tissue and are susceptible to getting breast cancer , " said Dr. Sharon Giordano , an associate professor of medicine in the department of breast medical oncology at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston .
She is not involved in Criss ' care .
" All men have some residual degree of breast tissue behind the nipples .
It may be very small , but just like any part of the body can get cancer , that part of the body can get cancer , " she said .
Male cases are rarer than female breast cancer , making up less than 1 percent of total cases .
According to the National Cancer Institute , in 2009 an estimated 192,370 women in the United States are expected to receive a diagnosis of breast cancer and about 40,170 are expected to die of the disease .
Among men , there will be an estimated 1,910 new cases and 440 deaths .
" So many people must die from this , " Criss said .
" Somebody has to step up to the plate and say something to get them aware of how dangerous this is .
Lots of men die :
They wait , they do n't go in , they put it off . "
Watch Criss ' interview . »
Criss joins a small group of men who have spoken publicly about having breast cancer .
Several years ago , Richard Roundtree , the actor who played the title role in the 1970s " Shaft " films , revealed he had breast cancer .
Experts say men tend to get a diagnosis at a later stage than women , because they do n't believe they can get breast cancer , and do n't get routine mammograms or breast exams .
Take the quiz on breast cancer . »
Breast cancer is " actually easier to find in men for obvious reasons .
They develop an asymmetrical lump in their breast , " said Dr. Stanley Waintraub , co-chief of The John Theurer Cancer Center 's division of breast oncology at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey .
Men may ignore symptoms , such as lumps , pain in the breast or discharge from the nipples .
" A man has to know , if he has enlarged breasts , a lump , a discharge , just because he 's a man , he is not immune to breast cancer , " Waintraub said .
When Criss spotted a painful lump in his left breast after a workout in 2007 , he did n't wait .
" I go to the gym ; I 've been drumming since I was a kid .
So I 'm very aware of my body , " he said .
" So when this happened I said , ' Jesus , what 's this thing ? ' "
After consulting with his wife , who was battling a different type of cancer at the time , he sought medical attention .
Criss had surgery in February 2008 to remove what the doctors thought was a harmless nodule .
Later , he learned the nodule was actually breast cancer .
" I flipped out .
I just could n't believe it .
It 's a nightmare , " he recalled .
" I was angry at everything .
I could n't believe I had this .
I was a really angry guy for a long time . "
Doctors removed the cancer in a March 2008 surgery .
Because the cancer had been caught early , Criss did not need breast reconstruction or chemotherapy .
The operation left no scars , so his doctor joked that Criss could still take his shirt off to play the drums .
Criss responded with a laugh , " I 'm in my 60s .
Those days are over . "
Criss sang lead vocal and co-wrote one of KISS ' most famous songs , " Beth . "
He left the band in 1980 .
He rejoined the band for a reunion tour in the mid-1990s and stayed on , eventually leaving again in 2004 .
He still plays the drums , and has started working on a record and an autobiography .
For men , " because of the lack of awareness , it can be stigmatizing to feel like they have a female disease when they 're a man , " Giordano said .
In the sea of pink ribbons , men who have breast cancer may feel isolated .
To build a network among them , the John W. Nick Foundation started connecting male breast cancer survivors in 1996 .
" They talk with one another , " said the founder , Nancy Nick , whose father died of the disease .
" It 's the greatest thing for healing .
They learn they 're not alone .
Second , they learn about protocol and treatment .
They can compare their treatments and the care their doctor is giving them . "
Criss credits his wife and his Catholic faith for pulling him through the difficult times .
Every year , he gets a mammogram ; he had his checkup two weeks ago .
" I left smiling like a Cheshire cat .
Now , I 'm coming around , I 'm just so grateful , " he said .
The causes of breast cancer remain unknown .
But like women , men 's risk of breast cancer increases if they inherit BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations .
Criss said he learned that breast cancer ran in his family , so he called his sisters , nieces , daughter and even his brother about possible risks .
" It 's just important -- just go get checked out , " said Criss .
" It 's not like you 're going to lose your manhood . "

It can be a long road to recovery for some of the victims of ukuthwalwa
By Pumza Fihlani
BBC News , Lusikisiki
At the age of 14 , Nolizwi Sinama set off from her aunt 's home to a neighbouring village .
She thought she had been sent on a routine chore .
In fact , she was on her way to be married to a 42 - year - old man .
Her aunt and brother had arranged the marriage , taking three cows as a bride price , or ilobolo as it is known in South Africa .
Three years later , Ms Sinama says the experience left her feeling worthless .
" They stole my innocence and my childhood , " she says .
Her husband forced her to sleep with him , and she became pregnant a month after she was abducted .
I think that men are evil
Nangamso Gezana
" I begged them to not to take me .
I told them I wanted to continue with my studies that I was n't ready to be a wife but they would n't let me go , " she says .
" They told me that I did n't have a say in the matter - one of them said all the arrangements were made with my family 's consent . "
Ms Sinama says she told her aunt that her husband forced her into having sex , but was told that a failed marriage would disgrace the family .
She finally fled after discovering her husband was HIV positive .
Ms Sinama , like numerous other girls in South Africa 's Eastern Cape Province , was a victim of ukuthwalwa - a cultural practice among people from the Xhosa ethnic group to abduct girls for marriage .
Prince Xhanti Sigcawu , a member of the Xhosa royal family , defends the custom .
" Ukuthwalwa like all our other customs was and remains an important part of who we are as people , " he says .
AFRICA HAVE YOUR SAY
It is an abuse for a girl below the age of 18 to get married Adenrele in Ibadan , Nigeria " There is nothing wrong with the practice when it is done in the right way - which is when the girl is at the right age and the parents are involved and agree . "
But girls as young as 11 years old are being forced into marriage , and calls are growing for the practice to be banned .
' Like a slave '
Ms Sinama and her two - year - old son are now being cared for by the Palmerton Children 's Care Centre , near Lusikisiki , 200 km south of Durban .
I knew that if I stayed I would get sick and die
Nolizwi Sinama
The centre used to be solely for orphans and abused children but opened its doors to abduction victims after pleas from various communities .
Twelve of the 100 children at the centre are recent victims of abduction .
They have been living at centre since early this year .
Nangamso Gezana , 15 , says she was abducted in May in Lusikisiki and taken to Rustenburg , where she and her new husband lived in shack for one month .
" I do n't know how many times I thought of killing myself , " she says .
" I was like a slave , cooking and cleaning for a man I did not even want .
A man who did bad things to me and would not stop even when I cried .
" I think that men are evil . "
Both Ms Sinama and Ms Gezana escaped their abductors with the help of the Palmerton centre and the police .
" One of my teachers got word that I had been abducted , she contacted me while I was in Rustenburg and asked me if I wanted to come back home , " says Ms Gezana .
Communities where the practice is rife protect each other
Mzukisi Fatyela
Eastern Cape police " She contacted the centre ; they made arrangements for the Eastern Cape police to fetch me up at a police station in Rustenburg .
" The man I married had gone to work , I left without any of my clothes .
I have not seen that him since that day . "
Ms Sinama says she knew she had to leave when she learned that her husband was suffering from HIV .
" I saw his medical certificate in the house , it was written HIV positive .
I knew that if I stayed I would get sick and die , " she says .
Police 's problem
The custom remains strong in some areas , but it divides opinion .
Although Xhosa royals defend it , Chief Pathekile Holomisa , of the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa , says the practice should be discouraged .
" It has been corrupted by greed for material purposes .
It has no place in today 's society , " he says .
Asanda Masina , of the Palmerton centre , says the practice is still strong in rural areas .
" The mindset has not changed - people do not see anything wrong with abducting girls , " she says .
Despite efforts by government , police and child welfare organisations , she says ukuthwalwa is still condoned as a necessary part of a woman 's life by some traditional societies .
Which is a problem for the police .
Supt Mzukisi Fatyela of the Eastern Cape force says detection of such crimes is difficult .
" Communities where the practice is rife protect each other , so it is not easy to make arrests , " he says .

Bernie “ The Bruiser ” Madoff got into a prison - yard tussle with a fellow inmate over — of all things — the stock market , eyewitnesses told The Post .
And , by inmates ’ accounts , the 71 - year - old Ponzi schemer came out the winner .
Madoff , serving 150 years at the Butner , NC , federal prison , was heard last week getting into a heated debate over the state of the market with another senior - citizen jailbird .
The shouting match got so heated that the inmate pushed Madoff , who shoved back harder with both hands , causing his attacker to stumble .
As the attacker tried to stand up straight , Madoff hovered over him red-faced and glaring , eyewitnesses said .
The stunned attacker went chicken and took off — allowing Madoff to collect some “ cred ” among his fellow prisoners .
“ I did n’t think Bernie had it in him .
He got the best of him ; he was really aggressive , and the other guy was in shock that he fought back , ” an inmate said .
The shoving match occurred near a ball field at the lockup in front of about 20 inmates during a rare time when prison guards were n’t watching .
An inmate said the two got lucky because if guards had seen the fight , Madoff and his pushing partner “ would have went in the ‘ hole , ’ ” solitary confinement .
The next day , Madoff and his attacker , described by inmates as a white male over 60 years old , made up and were spotted hanging out together .
Prisoners interviewed by The Post said this was the first known physical altercation at the slammer for Madoff — who paid a consultant for a crash course in prison culture and survival tips before he was locked up .

Getting 3D TVs like Sony ’s Bravia 3d is one side of adding new dimension to your movies .
But the real deal is to go witht the games .
A firmware update will bring stereoscopic display support to the PS3 in 2010 .
3D just seems to make more sense in a video game than for a movie , and the whole problem of finding content to deliver in the format has already been solved : a software update for the PS3 sometime in 2010 will enable it to provide a 3D viewing experience to “ all ” existing games on the system .
We ’re sure there will be some exceptions , but it sounds very promising .
The console itself pumps out a quite regular signal over HDMI , which the TV syncs up with your 3D glasses .
A 200Hz TV , for instance , alternates 1080 p frames , with 100 Hz for each eye .
Of course , you ’ll need a brand new TV , but at least it wo n’t be restricted to just Sony televisions .
Start saving those pennies !
The good news is that you wo n’t need a Sony 3D Bravia to enjoy it .
Any 3D TV will work , .
Engadget has been playing with it at IFA and they say the experience is great .

High School .
Four of the most important years of your life .
But it is n't always dances and keg parties and sucking face in your parents ' mini-van .
Sometimes it 's ugly and hard and complicated .
As complicated as a conspiracy to overthrow the president .
There 's something rotten at St. Donovan 's High and sophomore newspaper reporter Bobby Funke is on it like pink rubber bands on your little sister 's braces .
When senior hottie Francesca Facchini solicits Funke 's help tracking down a set of stolen SATs , Funke uncovers a story dirtier than the lunch lady 's mustache .
After he fingers the school president ( figuratively ) for the crime , Funke becomes one of the most popular kids at St. Donovan 's High .
No longer known simply as the freshman who was once tied to a giant snowman penis , Funke wins the respect of everyone from the Desert - Storm - hero - turned - educator Principal Kirkpatrick to the kid that farts on him in Spanish class .

DIY electric vehicles are cool in a very geeky way
I am all for hybrid vehicles , they are a great way to reduce emission and our need for oil .
You may think that the only way to get a hybrid is to buy a Prius or something similar from one of the major automakers .
You would be wrong , there is a robust DIY community that build their own hybrid and electric vehicles like the xr3 plug - in hybrid and the eD electric DeLorean .
Back to the Future jokes aside , the DeLorean was one of those cars that I wanted so badly when I was a kid .
What ’s not to like about a stainless steel body and gull wing doors , aside from not being able to get in the car in cramped parking spaces that is .
Tom Neiland and Dave Delman took a DeLorean and turned the machine into an electric vehicle on their own with 910 pounds of deep cycle lead batteries inside .
The car is powered by a WarP 9 DC motor that is liquid cooled with a 2000 amp .
Total power production is 200 hp and the car can hit 85 mph with range of up to 40 miles .
The project cost the pair a total of $ 18,000 .
If you want something , a bit more refined and with a hybrid drive train , you can opt to build your own xr3 plug - in hybrid from plans .
The three - wheel vehicle is powered by a diesel engine and batteries able to push the 1480 - pound car to 80 mph and get 225 miles per gallon .
The kit is said to be buildable by anyone with common building skills .
The car looks pretty cool too and rather reminds me of a DeLorean in a way .

At least 157 people were killed when Guinean troops opened fire on opposition protesters on Monday , a human rights group says .
But the country 's interior ministry has told the BBC that a total of 57 people have died in the protests .
Human rights groups say they have had reports of soldiers bayoneting people and women being stripped and raped in the streets during the protest .
Junta head Capt Moussa Dadis Camara denied knowledge of sexual assaults .
But he admitted that some of his security forces had lost control .
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said France was suspending military ties with Guinea after the " savage and bloody " crackdown on opposition protesters , French news agency AFP reported .
Out of control About 50,000 people were protesting over rumours that Capt Camara intends to run for president in an election scheduled for next January .
ANALYSIS Paul Melly , Africa analyst
This reminds us that the army which took power in December is in fact the same army that underpinned the Lansana Conte regime and the same army that was involved in the very bloody repression of protests in January and February of 2007 .
Capt Moussa Dadis Camara promised he would n't stand in any election in 2009 but by putting the election back to 2010 he has , as it were , got out of that promise .
Cellou Dalein Diallo and Sidya
Toure represent potentially the greatest threat to any candidacy by Dadis Camara should Guinea be allowed a free election .
Both originated as prime ministers attempting to carry through reforms under the old regime ; both found their reform programmes derailed .
Guinea is naturally quite wealthy .
It 's not easy to just force down a regime through external pressure .
The Conte regime survived years of the suspension of European aid without ever caving in to the EU 's demands for political reform .
But soldiers moved in to quell the rally using tear gas and baton charges and firing live ammunition into the crowds .
The Guinean Organisation for Defence of Human Rights put the toll at 157 people killed and more than 1,200 wounded .
But the interior ministry told the BBC that a total of 57 people died during the violence .
The ministry source admitted that some soldiers had fired live rounds into the crowd , but said that only four people had died from gunshot wounds .
The others , the ministry said , were trampled to death .
The opposition has accused the army of taking away some bodies to hide the scale of the violence .
Human rights groups said there were widespread reports of rape .
" The military is going into districts , looting goods and raping women , " Mamadi Kaba , the head of the Guinean branch of the African Encounter for the Defence of Human Rights ( RADDHO ) , told AFP .
" We have similar reports from several sources , including police sources and some close to the military , " said Mr Kaba , from his office in Dakar , Senegal .
An eyewitness told Human Rights Watch : " I saw several women stripped and then put inside the military trucks and taken away .
I do n't know what happened to them . "
" They were raping women publicly , " opposition activist Mouctar Diallon said in an interview with French radio station RFI .
Guinean human rights activist Souleymane Bah told Reuters news agency that people trying to escape from the shooting were " caught and finished off with bayonets " .
A doctor at a government hospital in Conakry said his wards looked like " a butchery " .
Threat of sanctions
The BBC's Alhassan Sillah , in Conakry , says Capt Camara acknowledged that " uncontrollable soldiers " were responsible .
CAPT MOUSSA DADIS CAMARA Seized power in December 2008 as a little known army captain Promised democracy , but now shows signs of holding onto power Increasingly erratic behaviour and public humiliation of officials
Guinea 's erratic military ruler Guinea under Camara : Story so far Eyewitness : ' Bodies were falling '
He told local radio stations that it was difficult to control the soldiers when there was tension in the country .
The military strongman also said he was " immensely saddened " by the deaths .
Opposition leader Sidya Toure , who was arrested during the protests , told our correspondent that after his release he had returned home to find his home completely looted .
Mr Toure said he had witnessed women being sexually attacked with gun butts and added : " I do n't know whether I 'm on earth or in hell " .
There has been worldwide condemnation of the violence .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged the Guinean authorities to exercise maximum restraint , while the West African regional body Ecowas is reported to be pursuing sanctions against the military regime .
The African Union has now expressed grave concern over the latest violence , condemning the " indiscriminate firing on unarmed civilians " .
According to Africa analyst Paul Melly , the AU declared sanctions against the leading figures of the regime earlier this month in an attempt to dissuade Capt Camara running for president .
He said following the military 's capture of power after the death of long - time ruler Lansana Conte , it was hoped Guinea 's human rights record would improve .
" We were already getting signs that this would n't in fact happen , but now we 've seen a repetition of the army 's traditional resort to violence when facing protest , " he told the BBC's Network Africa programme .
The military takeover initially had some popular support , but in recent weeks there have been several anti-government protests .
Guinean officials and former aides of Capt Camara have been accused of corruption and links to the drugs trade , including the son of former President Lansana Conte , who was shown confessing on TV to smuggling cocaine .
Guinea expert Gilles Yabi told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme that the rally was " only the beginning " of demonstrations and counter - demonstrations that can be expected in the next few months .
Should Capt Camara stand for president , he said , it would be a violation of the tacit agreement between military and civil forces which has kept him in power .
And it would mark a perpetuation of the kind of rule that Guinea has seen for the past decade - which the military had promised to sweep away .

Pizza Recipe : Recipes for Pizzas
Welcome to my Pizza Recipe website .
Let 's get cooking !!
Over the years I 've enjoyed eating pizza and now my favorite pastime is making them .
I 've collected many pizza recipes and brought them together for this website .
The website comes in 4 parts : pizza dough , pizza sauce , pizza toppings and a part where I talk about other related topics such as pizza stones and the history of pizza .
Some of you might be wondering what the benefits of homemade pizzas are in these times when you can order pizza online .
These are the 3 main benefits of homemade pizza ( in my opinion ) :
Making pizza is fun !
Home made pizzas are healthy , the ones from your local pizza delivery are not .
You can adapt any pizza recipe to your own taste .
OK , now lets get started .
I recommend starting at the pizza dough section , then moving on to the pizza sauce section before finally taking a stroll into the pizza topping area .

a chat with Matt Serra , Matt Serra interiew , Ultimate Fighter , Serra Academies
Interviews Home / Sports Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
I was fortunate enough to talk with the former world champion Ultimate Fighting Championship fighter Matt “ The Terror ” Serra .
Not your typical post - fight interview , we cover a host of topics .
Matt talks about how he started the Serra Academies and his feelings on being a teacher / coach .
He clues us in on what is was like to star in the Ultimate Fighter series .
We also discussed his long - awaited rematch with Matt Hughes that ended in a very close decision .
Serra gives a round - by - round breakdown of his assessment of the fight and his personal opinion of Hughes .
Bullz - Eye : Is Matt there ?
Matt Serra : Yeah , this is Matt .
BE : Hey Matt .
This is Mike Furci from Bullz - Eye.com .
How ’s everything going ?
MS : Everything is going great , everything is going great .
After the fight , I ’m spending some time with my family ; I ’m getting back in my schools .
It ’s going great .
BE : Oh , that ’s awesome .
I heard the Serra Academies are doing well .
MS : Yeah , I ca n’t complain .
I have two schools here on Long Island .
If anybody wanted to check them out it is mattserra.net .
I tell you , you know I have a lot of students and they are all -- it ’s a good atmosphere , I have a great time training and it ’s a good time .
That ’s where you ’ll catch me after all my fights .
BE : Oh I bet .
MS : I ’m there , I ’m teaching and having a great time .
BE : Doing what you love to do .
MS : Yeah man , when I ’m not fighting I am just teaching guys how to armlock and reverse , sit-ups , triangle chokes .
It ’s all good .
BE : Right .
Can you give us a little history behind the start of the Serra Academies and a little bit about their growth over the last few years ?
On his first fight : " It ’s a little nerve - wracking because it ’s the big show , the bright lights , the people telling you that you ’re on in three , two , one .
Then there are cameras in your face and you see the big screens .
It ’s brightly lit in that octagon and you ’re not used to that .
It ’s such a stage to be on that it can get a little overwhelming . "
MS : Yeah , well I opened up my first school with my UFC winnings .
After my first two UFC fights , I used that money to open up a storefront in East Meadow , my hometown .
I had that for just about a year when I opened up my other school , which is around 20 minutes away .
That ’s in Suffolk County , in Huntington .
BE : Wow .
MS : Yeah , so I have two academies and they are going great .
That must have been like seven years ago .
They ’re going great .
BE : I know you offer all kinds of classes there .
You ’ve got things for kids and adults , and different disciplines of martial arts .
MS : Yeah .
We pride ourselves on Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu .
But we also teach Muay Thai , we have wrestling classes there , we have a Judo class .
We teach the full spectrum of the mixed marital arts , you know .
It ’s a great program .
We ’ve got kids from eight years old -- seven or eight years old -- and then guys up until guys in their 50s .
It ’s a great place and a good attitude .
People check their egos at the door -- it ’s one of those schools .
BE : Right .
That ’s excellent .
I do n’t think the average person realizes how much training a Mixed Martial Arts ( MMA ) fighter performs to be on a level such as yourself .
Can you give our readers what a typical week ’s training schedule would be like for you , leading up for a fight ?
MS : Yeah , well usually I will start with a morning run .
But besides that , I break it down into two hard training sessions a day .
It depends on the day .
One day could be conditioning , plyometrics and calisthenics during the morning .
And then in the evening I could be doing my sparring .
Or , on another day , I could be doing my sparring in the morning and then in the evening I could be doing my wrestling and Jiu-Jitsu .
So basically , I break it down into two -- besides my run , I have two training sessions a day .
They go anywhere from an hour to two hours , depending on how hard it is going to be .
We space it out in the afternoon .
We space out the workouts , that way I get to recover a little bit in the afternoon .
I can fuel up and get ready for the next training session .
BE : Recovery is such an important part of success in athletics .
When fighting in the UFC I ’m sure there are many aspects outside of training that influence a person ’s ability in the ring .
What was it like for you when you fought in the UFC for the first time ?
MS : For the first time , again it ’s a little nerve - wracking because it ’s the big show , the bright lights , the people telling you that you ’re on in three , two , one .
Then there are cameras in your face and you see the big screens .
It ’s brightly lit in that octagon and you ’re not used to that .
It ’s such a stage to be on that it can get a little overwhelming , you know .
I was really excited to be there and I had an awesome fight with Shonie Carter , which I enjoyed very much until the very end .
That ’s when I got caught with that spinning back fist .
BE : It was a good fight though .
MS : And it was my first war .
It was the first time I ever had to battle .
I used to just take guys down .
I had around like eight fights before that , but all locals .
It was against guys that I kind of out - classed , I took them down and just smoked them , you know .
It was just Jiu-Jitsu .
So when I had to fight a veteran like Shonie Carter , I actually had to showcase a lot of my Jiu-Jitsu skills .
Up until that point , I believe it ’s the first time anybody had ever seen an omaplata in the UFC .
As a matter of fact I know it is .
So I attempted an uma plata , I did a lot of techniques which was the first time somebody strung them together like that in the UFC and it was UFC 31 .
There was Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in there before hand , but I just do n’t think such an aggressive style was in there before .
I ’m proud of that .
It ’s almost like a pioneer in a way .
BE : Yeah , absolutely , absolutely .
MS : So even though I did n’t win that fight , I did get the rematch years later on the comeback , but that ’s a whole other story .
BE : Now I know in the Hughes fight , you looked to be in great condition .
That was an excellent fight by the way .
I know that some stated in the pre-UFC 98 articles , a couple of writers thought that stamina towards the end of some of your fights tended to be a weakness for you .
They even stated a few times that it may even determine the outcome of the Hughes fight .
Were you aware of these articles and what are your thoughts on that assessment ?
MS : Not a ton of fights .
I would say the Karo fight I got tired in , early .
That ’s the fight I got tired the most .
I feel I could have been in better shape for the Montreal one , but I was n’t gassed .
BE : Right .
MS : I was n’t in the shape that I was in for this fight , I ’ll say that .
I was really in fantastic shape for this last one .
I trained very hard , did a lot of Muay Thai .
I felt that I was just in really -- I could have fought him all night .
I felt really good .
BE : Yeah .
Well regarding your rematch with Hughes , I do think it was a close fight Matt .
But both of you , like you said , looked great , and neither of you seemed gassed at all during the fight .
However , you got the real knockdown and you continually pushed the pace , which I believe is a trademark of your style of fighting .
I really respect that .
Even on your back , you were continuously on the attack .
I would like to give you just a few thoughts on each round , and then I would like to hear your opinions on your performance , as well as on Matt Hughes .
MS : Okay .
BE : Obviously , which I think anyone would admit , you decisively won the first round .
You knocked him down .
He scored a takedown but you showed really good composure and worked your way out of it .
I thought that that round you really showed your skills , both offensively and defensively .
I thought it was just outstanding .
How did you feel about the first round ?
MS : You know , I felt that I had him hurt .
A lot of people make it a big deal about the head butt .
I see where my head , we collided but he got knocked down with a punch .
" The one thing about having experience , you can make corrections in the fight .
You do n’t have to watch the tape afterwards . "
BE : Yes he did .
MS : It was a legal punch .
It was n’t like on the top of his head .
It was to the side of his head but it was a legal punch .
I was facing him and the punch is what really floored him .
BE : Yeah , I thought that was pretty obvious .
MS : Yeah , you see it in the replays .
After the punch knocked him down and I was on him , he did a good job of recovering up against the cage .
Like I got away -- I ’ve been spending the last three months getting pushed up against the cage .
I really felt in this fight that I fought Hughes before because that ’s how really smart my training camp was .
I fought a ton of wrestlers .
I had a ton of guys that had big ground knowledge and they were built like Hughes .
They were anywhere from 195 to 220 and just guys that were just animals , so I was used to being pushed and smushed .
I was used to all of the positions that Hughes does , that ’s why I looked so comfortable there .
I had been spending the last three months there .
But I got away from the cage .
He got me sleeping in the clinch where I got taken down .
He did his homework .
It was actually the same take down that Shonie Carter used , a knee block , on “ The Ultimate Fighter ” Season 4 , to take me down at the end of that round .
So I should have been a little more aware of that .
But , just like with that Shonie Carter fight the second time , I did make the correction by the third round , taking it away .
So I did n’t let him step on me and I learned my lesson in the first round .
As far as him taking my back , I did not mind it at all .
Even without gloves , I ’m very difficult to choke from behind .
I ’m good at escaping and getting on top .
I was very confident that as long as we were belly - up ; I did n’t want to be belly - down , because that ’s when he could just unload on you .
As long as I was belly - up , I was very confident that I was going to end up either on top , in his guard or just escape .
I ’m pretty good from the back so I had no problem with that .
You could even tell by my face , I was n’t freaking out or nothing .
BE : No , you definitely were composed .
I thought you did a great job , excellent job .
MS : Thank you .
When that round ended I knew , I was like oh man , there are no surprises here .
He had me in the worst position possible and I just got out without a scratch .
I felt like I was going to get him .
BE : Now the second round was a little lackluster , I guess you could say .
I ’ll give it to Hughes because he had a lot of control , but nothing really happened .
He really did no damage to you at all , I do n’t think .
But you were the one in the fight ; you may think differently .
MS : No , I felt that nothing landed to me , nothing to write home about .
I feel that he felt that if he would give me a little space , I ’m either out , latched on to something or off my feet .
So he was playing very tight and I could n’t let him pass my guard , that ’s the main thing .
I could not get lazy with that .
At the same time , you know in hindsight I will look at it and be like man , maybe I should have been more active , looking to get out .
But a guy who is very good at playing on top in Jiu- Jitsu or just a good top game in general , they ’ll play off your movements .
You ’re trying to make space , you ’re kicking away , that will open them up to pass , to achieve a better position .
So I had to obviously survive down there and not give him -- you know , he ’s very good at certain things on top .
You see the way he Kimora ’s Joe Riggs ; the way he works guys over from half guard .
So I know the things that I had to watch out for and I took them all away from him .
But at the same time , he was playing so tight where I did n’t feel the need to get reckless .
I ’m like all right , he ’s doing absolutely nothing here , they actually should stand us up .
I was n’t taking anything .
Defensively , I had everything set .
I ’m like all right , he ’s not going to pass , he ’s not really going to inflict damage .
He ’s either going to have to take a chance or get off or do something .
I mean is he going to just sit here ?
BE : Yeah , we were watching that fight wondering why they did n’t stand you guys up .
MS : The difference is this , in my opinion , not to jump rounds but you saw him on top of me .
Now the second I got on top of him in the third round , I tried to finish it .
I did n’t want to take his head off .
That might have given him space to get back up , which I was looking for a Kimora .
Again , you ’ve got to go for it .
In 30 seconds I landed more strikes than he did the whole fight .
But anyway , that ’s skipping rounds .
The second round , even when they stood us up with 12 seconds left I still tried to take his head off .
BE : Now the beginning of the third round , I thought you would be ahead in points because the first round I thought was very decisive .
Second round I figured they would give it to Hughes because he had control , which I ’m not sure how I feel about that aspect of scoring .
Hughes had the first takedown in round three but again , you defended very well and totally neutralized his efforts .
You also threw him down and landed a few punches in the final minutes , which I really thought that was going to put you over the top and win that round .
MS : I felt the same way but I made a correction also .
The one thing about having experience , you can make corrections in the fight .
You do n’t have to watch the tape afterwards .
I knew I had to defend the takedown hard enough where if he does put me down and reach with my back against the floor , I ’ve got to start tying him up .
So the second my back hit the floor , I already had him neutralized for an omaplata .
So I had his arm locked up , he knows -- he was just holding my far leg because he knows if there is any space , I ’m putting him in that shoulder lock .
That ’s fact .
I pull that off all the time in training .
So he ’s a smart guy on top .
He knows he ca n’t go nuts because I ’ll take that arm off .
When he finally got out of the one side , then I went back to closed guard and boom , I locked him up on the other side .
So he could n’t do damage at all down there .
So he puts me against the fence .
The second he tried to try and pass my guard , to open up and look to get a superior position , I threw him in the triangle .
So I was always keeping him more defensive , even on top .
BE : Exactly .
That leads into another question I was going to ask you too .
Back to the second round ; I would love to have an opinion from someone on your level about this .
Do you think too much weight is placed on top control ?
Especially when the person on the bottom , such as yourself in that round , is doing so much .
You ’re being offensive as well as being outstandingly defensive .
And yes I understand they get the points for taking you down , but it just does n’t seem like there is no weight given to the guy who is on his back , who is really totally neutralizing everything .
MS : If he took me down and landed any punches that had any outcome at all , I would say all right he worked me over some .
I honestly can tell you there was nothing more than glancing blows in that round , I mean nothing .
Third round I do n’t think he hit me at all but the second round was nothing .
I mean I was fine .
BE : Yeah , I agree .
It ’s almost like it was a tactic to get on top and be overly cautious .
Which it ’s kind of like the whole Sugar Ray Duran thing , where you dance around and you ’re not throwing any punches or pursuing .
I think they should score the ground game a little differently .
MS : Listen , every round ended with me attacking him .
I mean you look before the fight , I do n’t want to get into any kind of mudslinging because I put that at the end .
But if you look at the stuff beforehand , where he was going to have his way , anything he wants to do he ’ll do .
It ’ll be one - sided ; I ’m not top 20 or anything like that .
I think there ’s a lot of things we proved wrong with that , you know what I mean ?
That fight was so close that , hey man , if I ’m top 20 then that means you ’re 19 because that ’s how close it was .
BE : Yeah , absolutely .
MS : But at the same time , the second the fight ended he told me that ’s a close one , definitely close he said .
I told him no matter what the decision comes down we ’ll leave , we ’ll end it .
I think he seemed pleased with that .
I mean I ’ll leave it at what it was .
I would love a rematch .
I think that would be fun .
I thought it was a fun fight .
I felt that his style was good versus mine .
Now I know that I tried to end it , I tried to take him out .
I know that I tried to fight the good fight , you know what I mean ?
BE : Yeah , well I think you did what a lot of guys expect of Matt Serra , and that is to go in and work .
You ’re not lying around , you ’re not frickin’ just trying to control people .
I mean you are out there to really finish that fight and work your ass off .
As far as future fights are concerned , is there anybody you have your sights on ?
MS : You know what man , I just turned 35 ; I feel great .
I mean I came off of a fight right there where I probably never felt better , as far as endurance - wise and training .
I just felt great in that fight so I ’ve definitely got legs .
I just want to see what makes sense to me .
Again , I ’m not one of those guys “ oh , I have to fight now . ” I mean I ’m doing well .
I ’m not saying how I ’m doing financially but at the same time I ’ve got a few businesses , I ’ve got a young family here .
I mean I ’ve got things on my agenda .
Of course I ’m not retired , I want to fight more .
I ’ve always had the attitude where I ’ll fight anybody .
Now you look at my career , at the roster of guys that I fought , man I ’m just so privileged that I got to fight guys that are the who ’s who of the UFC .
Whether it ’s B.J. , G.S.P. twice , Matt Hughes , Karo , Shonie , Ivan Menjivar , Jeff Curran .
I ’m mean we ’ve got so many tough , tough guys that I fought and I feel so privileged to know that I had all those experiences under my belt .
BE : That fight with Karo was excellent .
I would love to see that again .
MS : That ’s the one where I ’m gassed in the first round .
But that one got to display , if anything , some heart and maybe some escapes .
I had to show some nice escapes .
The Jiu -Jitsu actually saved my butt in that one .
But at the same time man , I ’m looking for more fights that really excite the people , excite me and that ’s why I ’m doing it .
When I fight with Matt Hughes , I ’ll tell you right now , I enjoyed everything about it .
The preparation for it , even the stuff between us .
I just felt it was building up to something nice .
I ’m glad the fight got Fight of the Night .
It actually lived up to it , you know what I mean ?
BE : Oh definitely .
No disappointments .
Now going back a couple of years to “ The Ultimate Fighter 4 , ” what did you like most about being involved in that ?
MS : I ’ll tell you I liked everything about it .
When I got the call for that , you know I thought I had missed the boat with that whole TV thing because they were getting guys that wanted to be in the UFC and I already was in the UFC .
So when they had that comeback show coming out , I said to myself man , the exposure I can get for my schools , for my name , for everything to put me on the map ; worst case scenario I fight and lose , but have a typical showing , it will be good to me .
I know I ’ll get good exposure because I know I ’m not going to have a bad showing as long as I ’m in shape and whatnot .
So I put everything in to training for that .
I just had the attitude like , look man , you ’re going to get exposure either way .
It ended up working better than I ever could have imagined because I ended up winning the show .
Then I got the title shot that shocked a lot of people , which was awesome .
Then that led to everything else .
So all I ’ve got to say is thank God for Spike Television ; it changed my life .
BE : Absolutely .
Is there anything about it that you liked the least ?
Anything that rubbed you the wrong way ?
MS : I mean being away for six weeks , I ’ll tell you right now that just added more to it .
It ’s almost like a boot camp , you know .
I ’m close still with a lot of the guys I was in there with .
I made life - long friends .
I mean Pete Sell has always been my guy , my buddy .
But besides him , there are guys like Patrick Côté , Din Thomas , Chris Lytle , I still talk to these guys on a regular .
BE : Oh that ’s cool .
MS : These guys , you feel like you went through a boot camp with them .
BE : Yeah .
MS : So it ’s cool .
BE : How ’s your experience been with team Xyience ?
MS : Xyience is going awesome .
I enjoy the products ; I love the energy drinks .
I drink their protein drink in the morning , you know their protein meal .
I ’m a big fan of Xyience and I ’m glad I ’m working with them .
BE : Yeah , I ’ve actually had the opportunity recently to try a few of the energy drinks and they are really good .
MS : The energy drinks taste like a diet soda .
They are delicious and they do n’t have anything in them .
I ’m a big fan of those .
BE : So where do you see Matt Serra in five years ?
MS : Man , in five years who knows if I ’ll still be fighting .
That would be interesting .
You never know .
I might be like Rocky , I might still have some stuff in the basement .
Besides that I definitely have a future just coaching future champions .
I ’ve got some kids that will be carrying the torch for me eventually .
My schools will be up and running .
I will be banging out seminars .
I ’ll be still living the dream five years from now .
BE : You run your MMA camp out of your school .
Is this correct ?
MS : Yeah , I ’m in alliance with Ray Longo .
We have the Serra / Long fight team .
We do all of the hard core sparring down there .
The guys come to me for Jiu - Jitsu and it ’s all good .
BE : Right .
Well Matt , I really , really appreciate you taking the time man .
MS : No problem .
Good timing too because I ’ve got to jump .
Make sure you throw in mattserra.net
BE : Oh absolutely .
MS : Now you ’ve got my number so if you want something in the future just give me a call .
BE : All right .
Hey , you have a great day buddy .
All right .
Good talking to you .
[ This post was first published in October of 2007 . ]
Several weeks ago , as part of its much lauded “ Dove Campaign for Real Beauty , ” Unilever released “ Onslaught , ” a video ( above ) examining disturbing images of women in beauty - industry advertising .
The video ends with this admonition to parents : “ Talk to your daughter before the beauty industry does . ”
It ’s a powerful video with a disturbing collection of images .
The situation of our daughters — and , by the way , our sons — seems both overwhelming and diabolical .
Read the comments about the film on the Dove website discussion board , and you can feel the love and gratitude that viewers , particularly mothers , feel toward Dove for this film .
Skimming the first ten comments , one finds these reviews and remarks :
“ This is a POWERFUL little film for sure ” ; ” I love the message behind the Dove movies / ads ” ; “ I applaud Dove once again ” ; ” I think this film is wonderful ! ” ; “ I applaud Dove for launching their campaign of what beauty really is ” ; “ Kudos to DOVE for taking a stand ” ; “ My reaction to ‘ Onslaught ’ is that I want to cry ” ; and “ Thank you for launching this campaign as it is way overdue . ”
There ’s a problem that is easily lost when one contemplates the impressive production that “ Onslaught ” represents and the possibility that at least some corporations just may be our friends — the kind of friend who cares about our kids and who we can trust to help teach our children the valuable messages about what “ real beauty ” is and about the traps and dangers of our shared environment .
No , there are actually several problems .
To begin with , although Dove claims to “ provide [ ] a refreshingly real alternative for women who recognise that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes , ” even the Dove models seem to fit quite comfortably within a slightly expanded perimeter of conventional conceptions of beauty .
The young girls , for instance , who represent “ our children ” in the film “ Onslaught ” are exceptionally attractive children even by commercially influenced cultural standards .
The same is true for the models in the Real Beauty campaign — yes , there is variety , but the variety is measured in small deviations around an average that is itself only a tiny enlargement of the single standard of beauty given to us by those other beauty products .
In other words , Dove ’s claim that beauty comes in “ all shapes and sizes ” seems to mean that beauty comes in “ a few more shapes and sizes — particularly if the women are laughing and playing together in their underwear . ”
What is the implicit message to those girls and women who do n’t measure up to even the “ lowered ” Dove standard ?
And what is the message of these particular images — where groups of young women reveal their “ inner beauty ” by standing in their underwear touching , rubbing , and giggling ?
There may be another even more troubling feature of these ads .
Telling parents to “ talk to [ their ] daughters before the beauty industry does , ” is equivalent to telling parents to teach their children how to float in thin air before gravity gets to them .
The beauty industry “ talks ” to our children either directly or indirectly at virtually every waking moment , and , I suspect , during many of our children ’s dreams .
If you do n’t agree , just watch “ Onslaught ” again .
Those images set the beauty standard not simply for the young girls who strive to slim down and measure up , but also of their friends and families and society at large .
Those cultural expectations and pressures enmesh our children even when the ads and posters are briefly out of sight .
Parents fortunate enough to have the time , energy , and resources to “ talk to their children ” meaningfully and consistently about “ real beauty ” might be able to hold their children up against the force of gravity for a brief spell .
Eventually , though , the “ onslaught ” of commercial images and messages will take its toll .
After all , the barrage is incessant , multidirectional , and credible .
Existing beauty standards matter in the lives of those who do , and those who do not , meet them .
A parent ’s words are among the least frequent , least credible , and least relevant words that their adolescent children will hear , particularly when it comes to questions of beauty and social acceptance among their peers .
In fact , by even focusing on the problematic standards of beauty that their children face , parents risk underscoring and strengthening the power of that standard .
The “ Onslaught ” video may itself have that effect by bringing into relief the current unforgiving and unrealizable standard of beauty that now dominates our culture .
Thus , while the “ Onslaught ” video urges parents to “ talk to your daughters , ” it probably should add “ but do n’t show them this video ” which all - too - clearly highlights the undernourished and oversexualized prototypes of “ beauty . ”
A parent ’s task is made that much more difficult by the fact that commercial marketing is not simply teaching our children about the importance and meaning of “ beauty , ” it is also pitting parents and kids against one another — from encouraging children to “ nag ” for more stuff to undermining the credibility and authority of parental limits or advice .
( For fascinating and detailed accounts of the consumerist kidnapping , you can read Susan Linn ’s Consuming Kids or Juliet Schor ’s Born to Buy — if time permits , both are worth reading .
For an excellent website covering these topics , visit the Campaign for a Commercial - Free Childhood . )
Do not misunderstand : I accept that some parents may be able to make some difference — or , as a parent of three , I hope that is true .
My point is that parents are competing against a force that is far larger than any one of us , a force not of our choosing .
As Cornel West and Sylvia Ann Hewlett have written :
[ S ] imply heaping blame on overburdened moms and dads will not solve our problems .
Modern - day mothers and fathers , like those before them , struggle to put children at the center of their lives .
But major impediments and obstacles stand in their way , undermining their most valiant efforts .
From early in the morning till late at night , America ’s parents are battered by all kinds of pressures , most of which are not of their making .
It seems peculiar , therefore , that Dove would offer a film demonstrating the ubiquitous attack of the beauty industry that ends with the suggestion to parents that they are the ones to make a difference by simply talking to their kids .
If the industry is the problem , it strikes me as odd that the parents are supposed to be the solution .
“ Peculiar ? ” “ Odd ? ” Maybe the word “ suspicious ” is a better fit .
Telling parents to talk to their children is not unusual as a public relations strategy .
For instance , Philip Morris , among other companies , has long been pushing that message in its “ public service ” ads , particularly since the industry began to face a real threat of tort liability in the 1990s .
The message seems public - spirited , but most industry analysts believe that Philip Morris is delivering , not a public - service message to parents , but a responsibility - shifting message to the public : kids smoke because of uninvolved or irresponsible parents , not because of anything that Philip Morris has done .
( For a discussion of how the fast food industry has engaged in similar attribution - shifting tactics , you can link to an article by Situationist contributors Adam Benforado , David Yosifon , and me by clicking here . )
To add to my suspicions , many of the comments on the Dove website indicate that those who watch the video are concluding that the problem created by the beauty industry should be solved by parents — as if the industry conduct is immutable and the key variable to protecting our children is the presence or absence of good parenting .
Here is a sample of comments — again , from the first ten on the Dove website discussion page :
“ I do NOT condone the way a lot of families allow their children to become obese ” ; “ [ S ] hame on their parents for letting this affect their child ” ; “ The media is not totally to blame ” ; “ I do believe that it is the job of the parent to their daughters .
I have read articles describing girls at 16 and younger getting plastic surgery and breast augmentation .
What ’s wrong with those parents ? ? ” ; “ it all starts in the home and with the kind of role model a mother is to her daughter ” ; and “ I do agree that it is up to parents to educate children about what is right and what is wrong . ”
If Dove were attempting to shift responsibility to parents for the “ beauty ” preoccupation of adolescent girls , it seems to be working .
But , still , why would Dove do that ?
One plausible answer is that they would n’t .
Dove is selling soap , not tobacco .
Any suspicions that one might have about the Philip Morris campaign do not translate easily to the message of the “ Onslaught ” video .
To be sure , Dove may be criticizing the rest of the beauty industry and its standards to maximize its own profits ; expressing concern ( genuine or not ) about our children might be a saavy route to getting our dollars .
Selling “ real beauty ” instead of “ commercialized beauty ” seems a brilliant strategy for distinguishing Dove products form those of its competitors and for attracting that group of consumers who fancy themselves beautiful , but who want to reject the standards of “ unreal beauty ” set by those other beauty product ads .
The returns indicate that this plus - sized marketing strategy has been immensely profitable .
But that sort of profit - seeking does not seem particularly nefarious .
As one commenter on the Dove website puts it :
“ Good for Dove to tackle the ‘ real beauty ’ of women .
As a former , public relations professional it ’s hard for me not to be cynical of the company ’s dollar - driven agenda , but I ’m moved by the campaign and hopeful that others will follow suit in responsible social marketing . ”
If it ’s profitable for Dove to push meekly against the tide of commercial messages , more power to them , right ?
Philip Morris , in contrast , is attempting to shift blame that otherwise would be placed on them through law suits , legislation , and regulation or through reduced consumption by an angry public .
Dove does not face those potential costs or public relations problems , so why would they want to shift responsibility from the beauty industry toward parents ?
The second plausible answer is more troubling .
Dove is not , as most people seem to imagine , a company devoted to helping parents and their children in their battles against the polluting and quasi- pornographic images and messages of commercialized beauty products .
Dove is not a person , and Dove is not a friend .
Dove is a brand — one member of a “ family ” of brands owned by the company Unilever .
If Dove were a person , then , Unilever would be its parent .
And , in light of that relationship , the question is , not whether Dove would have an incentive to shift responsibility to parents for the practices of the beauty industry , but whether Unilever would .
Is Unilever acting responsibly by doing its part to stem the “ onslaught ” ?
If not , is it possible that that is because Unilever has the same sort of incentive that Big Tobacco has for shifting responsibility to others for the consequence of their own culpable conduct ?
When one gives some thought to that question , the “ real beauty ” campaign begins to look a little ugly .
Unilever , as a company , seems uninterested in expanding our conceptions of beauty , much less in helping parents confront the problem of beauty - industry marketing .
Unilever is not part of the solution ; in fact , Unilever — one of the largest manufacturers of cosmetics , skin lighteners , diet products , and the like — may be one of the worst offenders .
A previous Situationist post has already detailed some of the ways that Unilever helps to set and reinforce harmful beauty standards with its products and marketing .
( See “ Shades of Fairness and the Marketing of Prejudice . ” )
But there is more to say . . . or show .
In fact , the cascade of objectifying images in the “ Onslaught ” video seem surprisingly tame when compared to some of the actual ads for other Uniliver products .
Consider , for example the following two ads for Lynx body spray , a male deodorant that seems to promise more than just deodorizing ( indeed , the product slogan is “ Spray More. Get More ” ) :
According to the Dove website , “ The Dove Campaign for Real Beauty is a global effort that is intended to serve as a starting point for societal change and act as a catalyst for widening the definition and discussion of beauty . ”
Apparently Unilever has a different global vision .
To learn more about the global “ Lynx Effect , ” check out this ad :
Unilever ’s other body spray , Axe , is no better , as the following videos illustrate :
What are those ads if not an onslaught ?
The Dove website explains that “ the media and advertising set an unrealistic standard of beauty that most women can’t ever achieve . ”
Elsewhere , the website describes the pressure on young women this way :
“ The comparisons are non -stop , especially among girls who see rich , beautiful young women in the media and want to be just like them .
Dissatisfaction with body image increases as girls move into adolescence , according to a 2000 study by the Girl Scout Research Institute .
Although 75 percent of 8 - and 9 - year - old girls in the study said they like their looks , only 56 percent of those ages 12 and 13 did .
And of the 33 percent of girls ages 14 - 17 who said they ’re too fat , two - thirds were dieting .
Ninety percent of eating disorders are diagnosed in girls . ”
Ummm .
Good point .
But if the problem is sexualized stereotypes and unhealthy body types , then why is Dove telling parents to “ talk to their kids before the beauty industry does ” ?
Should n’t Dove be talking to its parent about not talking to our kids ?
Why would we applaud the arsonist when he passes out pamphlets on how to fight fires ?
Why buy mousetraps from the same person who dumped rodents into our basement ?
Should we not judge Dr. Jekyll in part by the sins Mr. Hyde ?
If Dove cares about “ real beauty , ” it should start at home .
If Unilever does n’t care about “ real beauty ” it should stop getting rich off the illusion that it does .
And if the beauty industry is the source of the onslaught , then Unilever , through Dove advertising , should not be permitted to blame the victims for its own contribution to that attack .

Situationist friend and legal scholar Tamara R. Piety has recently written an outstanding law review article that , among other things , discusses and further develops some of the themes highlighted in this post .
Her article , titled “ Onslaught : Commercial Speech and Gender Inequality , ” is forthcoming in Case Western Law Review ( 2009 ) .
The abstract is as follows .
* * *
Utilizing Dove ’s infamous “ Onslaught ” viral ad , this Article explores the ways in which commercial speech constructs images of and attitudes toward women that interfere with full equality for women .
Advertising and marketing contribute to creating a social reality in which it is taken for granted that women must spend a great deal of time on appearance and that appearance is of critical importance to life success .
As is typical for much advertising , it does this by stimulating anxiety .
Such anxiety contributes to low self - esteem , lowered ambitions and stereotype threat reactions , as well as to biased reactions on the part of others .
Harms such as these are often justified on the basis of the right of the speaker to participate in public debate or in the public ’s right to receive advertising “ information . ”
The Dove ad itself , however , illustrates the problem in locating a “ speaker ” for commercial speech and raises questions about the nature of the “ information ” provided by advertising .
Because commercial speech lacks an author with moral interests and because it only has informational value when it is true , this Article presents an argument that women ’s interest in equality and freedom from harm should outweigh the commercial interests of the speakers , at least to the extent that commercial speech be denied any First Amendment protection beyond that already extended to truthful speech .

Advertisement A series of gun and bomb attacks on security forces in Pakistan has killed about 40 people .
In Lahore , police and militants fought gun battles at a federal security building and two police academies that left at least 26 people dead .
A suicide car bomb at a police station in the north - western town of Kohat left 11 dead , while another car bomb in the nearby city of Peshawar killed a child .
More than 150 have died in Pakistan in militant attacks in the past two weeks .
AT THE SCENE Orla Guerin , BBC News , Lahore
At a hospital , a constable injured in the attack at Manawan police academy told us he was on a break when the gunfire started .
He did n't know he had been hit until he took cover behind a wall .
Despite his injured arm , he says he 'll continue to serve his country .
He would n't say if the government should pursue the Taliban .
People in Lahore have told us everyone is scared .
These strikes seem to say to security forces " the more you come after us , the more we 'll go after you " .
Later , US President Barack Obama signed into law a $ 7.5 bn ( £ 4.6 bn ) civilian aid package for Pakistan .
Thursday 's attacks come ahead of an expected military offensive against the Pakistani Taliban in their South Waziristan stronghold on the Afghan border .
The worst of the violence was in Lahore , Pakistan 's second - largest city .
Ten gunmen , some of them teenagers , died in attacks on three police centres in the Punjab province capital .
Seven people - including police and attackers - were killed as gunmen stormed the FIA building in Lahore .
An FIA building nearby was targeted in a deadly suicide attack in March last year .
At Lahore 's Manawan police training academy , three attackers are said to have blown themselves up .
Eight other people died .
They were not here to live - they were here to die

The same academy was targeted in a deadly attack in March this year .
A third team scaled a wall at a police commando training centre near the airport at Bedian and reportedly began shooting and tossing grenades .
Police say the situation is now under control at all three facilities .
The government has reacted by transferring responsibility for security in the capital Islamabad from the police to a paramilitary force , the Rangers .
" They were not here to live .
They were here to die , " Sajjad Bhutta , a senior government official , told AP news agency .
" Each time they were injured , they blew themselves up .
" They were well trained to the extent they could jump over the walls and shoot well . "
In Kohat , a suicide bomber rammed his car into the wall of the police station compound .
The Peshawar car bomb went off outside a housing complex for government employees , reportedly killing a six - year - old boy .
Finger of blame Interior Minister Rehman Malik said : " The enemy has started a guerrilla war , " reports AP .
" The whole nation should be united against these handful of terrorists , and God willing we will defeat them . "
Eyewitness : Lahore attacks
Why attack Lahore ?
The BBC's Aleem Maqbool in Islamabad says that although no group has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks the finger of blame will point towards the Taliban .
Separately , a US drone aircraft fired two missiles at a house in North Waziristan , killing five Taliban militants , Pakistani officials said .
Nuclear - armed Pakistan is under US pressure to flush out militants as President Obama considers sending more troops to neighbouring Afghanistan .
Lahore , the centre of Pakistan 's cultural life , was long spared the brunt of unrest , but has seen a string of deadly attacks throughout 2009 .
In one of the most notable incidents , in March , gunmen attacked the visiting Sri Lankan cricket team , killing six policemen .

The last time many American fans saw Jens Voigt on television , he was sliding along the road on his face , unconscious .
Many of those fans in St. Louis saw a much healthier Voigt take the start of the Tour of Missouri Monday , and gave him big cheers .
Voigt said he did n’t know what to expect in his return , but that it definitely felt good to be racing in the states .
“ Without blowing my own trumpet , it looks like I ’m really popular [ here ] , ” he said .
In Missouri , Voigt said he ’s just looking to rebuild fitness and help his teammates , such as Gustav Larsson who could do well in the time trial , and JJ Haedo , who took second on stage 1 .
“ I told the guys , look , this is my first race back .
I ’m not going to lead out the sprint yet , ” he said .
“ First of all , I do n’t have the punch power .
But second , I ’m just trying to gain some confidence back into the bike , myself and into my riding skills . ”
The Tour crash was the first in 10 years that forced Voigt to abandon .
“ I have of course had plenty of crashes , but I never had a race that ended in a hospital . ”
As to whether the crash shook his confidence , the 37 - year - old said he tries not to think about it .
“ If I start to think , ‘ maybe I should n’t go back on the bike , ’ then I ’m really lost .
And you know , I ’ve got a house and five kids to feed , so I ’ve got no choice ! ”
Voigt said his kids picked him up at the airport in Berlin five days after the Tour crash .
“ When they picked me up , my boys said , ‘ daddy , you ’re such a hero . ’
I asked why .
‘ Because you ’re like number two on YouTube downloads . ’
I ’m like , are you crazy ?
I would rather be healthy and be last in downloads , ” he said .
“ The girls were a little more concerned . ”
Advertising men once used it to try to increase sales of popcorn , and Formula One teams have been accused of indulging in it to sell cigarettes .
But it turns out that subliminal messaging – flashing an image or words on a screen for a fraction of a second – works best if it leaves the viewer in a state of fear .
An experiment by British researchers has found that even though subliminal messages are shown so briefly that the human eye cannot consciously read them , the brain is particularly good at picking up on the emotional meaning of a word if it is negative .
Scientists at University College London believe the results of the study , in which participants correctly identified when a subliminally transmitted word had negative connotations more than seven times out of 10 , shows that humans are programmed at a sub-conscious level to respond to any stimulus that contains a potential threat .

Volunteers were shown a series of positive , negative and neutral words , such as " cheerful " , " despair " or " box " , for as little as 17 milliseconds – far too quick for the mind to perceive conventionally – and asked to decide whether or not each word had an emotional value .
Where the volunteers correctly identified a word as emotional – for example " flower " , " peace " , " agony " or " murder " – they were more efficient at picking out those with a negative meaning .
In one test , where participants were shown each word for just 33 milliseconds , negative words were correctly spotted 77 per cent of the time , as opposed to 59 per cent for positive terms .
Subliminal messaging has long been a controversial area , with psychologists pondering whether the mind can be influenced by imperceptible stimuli .
The idea was attractive to advertisers , who famously tried to increase sales of fizzy drinks and popcorn to a 1950s cinema audience by projecting the words " Drink Coca - Cola " and " Hungry ? Eat popcorn " on to the screen for a fraction of a second .
The claimed results – that Coke sales rose by 58 per cent and popcorn by 18 per cent – were later found to have been fabricated , and a repeat experiment by scientists found no effect on sales at all .
Professor Nilli Lavie , who led the UCL team , said the latest study had provided the first unambiguous proof that people can process emotional information from subliminal images .
" We have demonstrated conclusively that people are much more attuned to negative words , " she said .
" Clearly , there are evolutionary advantages to responding rapidly to emotional information .
We can't wait for our consciousness to kick in if we see someone running towards us with a knife or if we drive under rainy or foggy weather conditions and see a sign warning ' danger ' . "
Although subliminal advertising is banned in Britain and elsewhere , the insertion of single - frame images has featured in mainstream media from a 1943 Daffy Duck cartoon which flashed the words " Buy Bonds " to the 1980s comedy The Young Ones .
The researchers believe their study , which may point to a sub-conscious " fast link " between primitive parts of the brain and those associated with decision making , has implications for the use of subliminal messaging in marketing .
Professor Lavie said : " Negative words may have a more rapid impact .
' Kill your speed ' should be more noticeable than ' Slow down ' .
More controversially , highlighting a competitor 's negative qualities may work on a subliminal level much more effectively than shouting about your own selling points . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Amtrak would lose its federal subsidies if it does n't put a system in place by early next year to check and track firearms so that passengers can legally put the weapons in their checked baggage , the Senate voted Wednesday .
One senator says the measure " is going to put a severe burden " on Amtrak .
The measure , an amendment to the transportation and housing appropriations bill , passed 68 - 30 .
The House version of the bill , passed in July , does not include the provision , so further steps would be needed for it to reach President Obama 's desk .
Amtrak 's current policy prohibits passengers from carrying " any type of gun , firearm , ammunition , explosives or weapon " in carry - on or checked baggage .
Amtrak spokesman Steve Kulm said firearms had been allowed in checked baggage before the September 11 attacks .
However , despite the policy change , the company has no uniform system of screening for firearms , Amtrak Chairman Thomas Carper noted in a letter to Sens.
Patty Murray and Christopher Bond decrying Wednesday 's congressional mandate .
They are the top Democrat and Republican , respectively , on the Appropriations Committee 's transportation subcommittee .
" Unlike the airline industry , Amtrak has no system in place for a uniform system of screening for weapons , " Carper wrote .
The railroad has no secure loading areas , and trains make multiple stops , he said .
Employees also would need intensive training .
Further , he said , the National Railroad Passenger Corp . ( Amtrak ) has neither the money nor the time to meet the Senate 's timetable to put such a system in place .
Carper warned that if Amtrak were to lose federal funds , it would result in the " cessation of all Amtrak service nationwide . "
According to its
Web site , Amtrak has in place " a range of behind - the - scenes and front - line security measures " that include random passenger and carry - on baggage screening ; checked baggage screening ; K - 9 units ; onboard security checks ; and identification checks .
" As part of our security strategy , randomly selected passengers and their baggage , handbags , backpacks or other personal items may be screened or inspected , " it says .
" Passengers failing to consent to security procedures will be denied access to trains and refused carriage , and a refund will be offered . "
The gun measure was sponsored by Sen. Roger Wicker , R- Mississippi .
He introduced the same legislation in August as part of the budget resolution , and it was approved with bipartisan support , but the provision was removed during final House - Senate negotiations .
" Under current practices , all of the American domestic airlines permit firearms in their checked luggage .
Other American passenger railroads also allow checked firearms , " Wicker said on the Senate floor Wednesday .
" Only the federally subsidized Amtrak prohibits law - abiding American citizens from exercising their Second Amendment rights in checked baggage , " he said .
Murray opposed the legislation .
" In order to receive any federal funding under this amendment , Amtrak would have six months to build a process for checking and tracking firearms , " she said .
" It would have to find the manpower necessary to screen and guard firearms , and it would have to purchase the equipment necessary .
Now there is nothing in the underlying appropriations to pay for any of that .
So this amendment is going to put a severe burden on them and if they do not comply , Amtrak will shut down . "
The measure lays out the following guidelines :
• Before checking the bag or boarding the train , the passenger must declare that the firearm or pistol is in his or her bag and is unloaded .
• The firearm or pistol must be carried in a hard - sided container .
• The hard - sided container must be locked , and only the passenger has the combination or key .
CNN 's Evan Glass contributed to this report .

One of the allegations made repeatedly by climate change deniers is that they are being censored .
There 's just one problem with this claim : they have yet to produce a single valid example .
On the other hand , there are hundreds of examples of direct attempts to censor climate scientists .
Most were the work of the Bush administration .
In 2007 the Union of Concerned Scientists collated 435 instances of political interference in the work of climate researchers in the US .
Scientists working for the government were pressured by officials to remove the words " climate change " and " global warming " from their publications ; their reports were edited to change the meaning of their findings , others never saw the light of day .
Scientists at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and the US Fish and Wildlife Service were forbidden to speak to the media ; James Hansen at Nasa was told by public relations officials that there would be " dire consequences " if he continued to call for big cuts in greenhouse gases .
Philip Cooney , a senior White House aide who previously worked at the American Petroleum Institute , admitted to Congress that he had made hundreds of changes to government reports about climate change on behalf of the Bush government .
Among other changes , he had struck out evidence that glaciers were retreating and inserted phrases suggesting that there was serious scientific doubt about global warming .
In the UK , both Viscount Monckton and Martin Durkin , the director of Channel 4's The Great Global Warming Swindle , have threatened to sue people who have criticised the claims they 've made about the science .
Where , on the other hand , is a single verifiable instance of a climate denier being silenced by the authorities ?
They have yet to produce one .
But it suits them to cry wolf .
They love to imagine that they are important enough to censor .
The claim chimes with their paranoid invocation of a great conspiracy – involving most of the world 's scientists , most of the world 's governments , most of the world 's media and a few hundred million others – to suppress the truth about global warming .
Now we have another marvellous instance of this hypocrisy .
Anthony Watts spends much of his time maligning climate scientists and environmentalists on his blog Wattsupwiththat .
But while he can dole it out , he can't take it .
As Kevin Grandia of desmogblog shows ,
Watts has just used US copyright laws to take down a YouTube video which exposes his claims .
Grandia has since reposted the video ( see above ) so you can see for yourself what all the fuss is about .
It is not clear how his copyright was infringed by the video , but the US laws have been widely used by other people to block material that they do n't like .
Websites are obliged to remove any video which is subject to a takedown request , and they can put it back up only if they win an appeal .
I charge Watts with the accusation he unjustly levels at other people : this looks to me like an attempt to silence his critics .

One in 20 women has NEVER had sex sober as they lack body confidence
Millions of women drink alcohol before having sex because they lack confidence in their bodies , a study has found .
Almost half of those questioned said they preferred sex while under the influence of alcohol because it helped them to lose their inhibitions and be more adventurous .
Researchers , who surveyed 3,000 women aged between 18 and 50 , found the average woman has slept with eight men , but was drunk with at least five of them .
On two of these occasions they could n't even remember the man 's name the next day .
Sobering thought :
Three quarters of women claim they feel more able to let their hair down and go wild with a few drinks inside them
Dutch courage :
One in six admitted they ' did n't have the confidence ' to sleep with someone when they were sober
Three quarters of women claimed they felt more able to let their hair down and go wild after a few drinks .
Four out of ten have ' always ' been a bit tipsy when they have slept with a partner for the first time .
But astonishingly 48.5 per cent said they preferred sex while under the influence .
The study also found that 75 per cent of women said they liked to drink before getting into bed with their husband or boyfriend .
Some 6 per cent of women have never had sex while sober .
More than half of women polled claimed drinking with a prospective partner was ' part of the dating process ' so they were bound to be a bit drunk when they had sex .
It was also revealed 14 per cent of women in a relationship can't face sleeping with their partner unless they had a couple of glasses of wine beforehand .
Kathryn Lakeland of Femfresh , which carried out the study , said the results showed how women are severely lacking in confidence .
She added : ' The fact alcohol plays an integral role in their love lives shows that women are looking for a boost in self - esteem when it comes to their bedroom antics .
' Whilst many women claim they only drink before sex because it is part of the dating process , a large percentage will actually refuse to get between the sheets without a bit of Dutch courage .
' But in doing so many women will be losing self control and this is when drunken one night stands are more likely to occur . '
Editors of a new US book on the controversy over cartoons caricaturing Muslims and the Prophet Mohammed have triggered a storm by deciding not to reprint the 12 sketches for fear of new violence .
" The Cartoons That Shook the World , " due out in November by Yale University Press , examines the reaction of the Muslim world to the 2005 publication of the cartoons by the Danish newspaper Jyllands - Posten .
Author Jytte Klausen , a Danish - born professor of politics at Brandeis University in Waltham , Massachusetts , reluctantly agreed to cut the cartoons from the book .
" I am sad personally because I feel it is a loss to the book to be published without the illustrations .
It is also sad that we have a circumstance where an academic press feels compelled to go ahead and remove these illustrations , " Klausen told AFP in a telephone interview .
Other images of Mohammed were also removed , including a 19th century Gustave Dore print illustrating a passage from Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy of Mohammed in hell .
“ Every day , in every way , we are getting meta and meta , ” the philosopher John Wisdom used to say , venturing a cultural counterpart to Émile Coué ’s famous mantra of self - improvement .
So it makes sense that in the aftermath of the Simpson trial the focus of attention has been swiftly displaced from the verdict to the reaction to the verdict , and then to the reaction to the reaction to the verdict , and , finally , to the reaction to the reaction to the reaction to the verdict — which is to say , black indignation at white anger at black jubilation at Simpson ’s acquittal .
It ’s a spiral made possible by the relay circuit of race .
Only in America .
Illustration by Daniel Zender
An American historian I know registers a widespread sense of bathos when he says , “ Who would have imagined that the Simpson trial would be like the Kennedy assassination — that you ’d remember where you were when the verdict was announced ? ”
But everyone does , of course .
The eminent sociologist William Julius Wilson was in the red-carpet lounge of a United Airlines terminal , the only black in a crowd of white travellers , and found himself as stunned and disturbed as they were .
Wynton Marsalis , on tour with his band in California , recalls that “ everybody was acting like they were above watching it , but then when it got to be ten o’clock — zoom , we said , ‘ Put the verdict on ! ’ ” Spike Lee was with Jackie Robinson ’s widow , Rachel , rummaging through a trunk filled with her husband ’s belongings , in preparation for a bio -pic he ’s making on the athlete .
Jamaica Kincaid was sitting in her car in the parking lot of her local grocery store in Vermont , listening to the proceedings on National Public Radio , and she did n’t pull out until after they were over .
I was teaching a literature seminar at Harvard from twelve to two , and watched the verdict with the class on a television set in the seminar room .
That ’s where I first saw the sort of racialized response that itself would fill television screens for the next few days : the white students looked aghast , and the black students cheered .
“ Maybe you should remind the students that this is a case about two people who were brutally slain , and not an occasion to celebrate , ” my teaching assistant , a white woman , whispered to me .
The two weeks spanning the O. J. Simpson verdict and Louis Farrakhan ’s Million Man March on Washington were a good time for connoisseurs of racial paranoia .
As blacks exulted at Simpson ’s acquittal , horrified whites had a fleeting sense that this race thing was knottier than they ’d ever supposed — that , when all the pieties were cleared away , blacks really were strangers in their midst .
( The unspoken sentiment : And I thought I knew these people . )
There was the faintest tincture of the Southern slaveowner ’s disquiet in the aftermath of the bloody slave revolt led by Nat Turner — when the gentleman farmer was left to wonder which of his smiling , servile retainers would have slit his throat if the rebellion had spread as was intended , like fire on parched thatch .
In the day or so following the verdict , young urban professionals took note of a slight froideur between themselves and their nannies and babysitters — the awkwardness of an unbroached subject .
Rita Dove , who recently completed a term as the United States Poet Laureate , and who believes that Simpson was guilty , found it “ appalling that white people were so outraged — more appalling than the decision as to whether he was guilty or not . ”
Of course , it ’s possible to overstate the tensions .
Marsalis invokes the example of team sports , saying , “ You want your side to win , whatever the side is going to be .
And the thing is , we ’re still at a point in our national history where we look at each other as sides . ”
The matter of side - taking cuts deep .
An old cartoon depicts a woman who has taken her errant daughter to see a child psychiatrist .
“ And when we were watching ‘ The Wizard of Oz , ’ ” the distraught mother is explaining , “ she was rooting for the wicked witch ! ”
What many whites experienced was the bewildering sense that an entire population had been rooting for the wrong side .
“ This case is a classic example of what I call interstitial spaces , ” says Judge A. Leon Higginbotham , who recently retired from the federal Court of Appeals , and who last month received the Presidential Medal of Freedom .
“ The jury system is predicated on the idea that different people can view the same evidence and reach diametrically opposed conclusions . ”
But the observation brings little solace .
If we disagree about something so basic , how can we find agreement about far thornier matters ?
For white observers , what ’s even scarier than the idea that black Americans were plumping for the villain , which is a misprision of value , is the idea that black Americans did n’t recognize him as the villain , which is a misprision of fact .
How can conversation begin when we disagree about reality ?
To put it at its harshest , for many whites a sincere belief in Simpson ’s innocence looks less like the culture of protest than like the culture of psychosis .
Perhaps you did n’t know that Liz Claiborne appeared on “ Oprah ” not long ago and said that she did n’t design her clothes for black women — that their hips were too wide .
Perhaps you did n’t know that the soft drink Tropical Fantasy is manufactured by the Ku Klux Klan and contains a special ingredient designed to sterilize black men .
( A warning flyer distributed in Harlem a few years ago claimed that these findings were vouchsafed on the television program “ 20/20 . ” )
Perhaps you did n’t know that the Ku Klux Klan has a similar arrangement with Church ’s Fried Chicken — or is it Popeye’s ?
Perhaps you did n’t know these things , but a good many black Americans think they do , and will discuss them with the same intentness they bring to speculations about the “ shadowy figure ” in a Brentwood driveway .
Never mind that Liz Claiborne has never appeared on “ Oprah , ” that the beleaguered Brooklyn company that makes Tropical Fantasy has gone as far as to make available an F.D.A. assay of its ingredients , and that those fried - chicken franchises pose a threat mainly to black folks ’ arteries .
The folklorist Patricia A. Turner , who has collected dozens of such tales in an invaluable 1993 study of rumor in African - American culture , “ I Heard It Through the Grapevine , ” points out the patterns to be found here : that these stories encode regnant anxieties , that they take root under particular conditions and play particular social roles , that the currency of rumor flourishes where “ official ” news has proved untrustworthy .
Certainly the Fuhrman tapes might have been scripted to confirm the old saw that paranoids , too , have enemies .
If you wonder why blacks seem particularly susceptible to rumors and conspiracy theories , you might look at a history in which the official story was a poor guide to anything that mattered much , and in which rumor sometimes verged on the truth .
Heard the one about the L.A. cop who hated interracial couples , fantasized about making a bonfire of black bodies , and boasted of planting evidence ?
How about the one about the federal government ’s forty - year study of how untreated syphilis affects black men ?
For that matter , have you ever read through some of the F.B.I. ’s COINTELPRO files ?
( “ There is but one way out for you , ” an F.B.I. scribe wrote to Martin Luther King , Jr. , in 1964 , thoughtfully urging on him the advantages of suicide .
“ You better take it before your filthy , abnormal , fraudulent self is bared to the nation . ” )
People arrive at an understanding of themselves and the world through narratives — narratives purveyed by schoolteachers , newscasters , “ authorities , ” and all the other authors of our common sense .
Counternarratives are , in turn , the means by which groups contest that dominant reality and the fretwork of assumptions that supports it .
Sometimes delusion lies that way ; sometimes not .
There ’s a sense in which much of black history is simply counternarrative that has been documented and legitimatized , by slow , hard - won scholarship .
The “ shadowy figures ” of American history have long been our own ancestors , both free and enslaved .
In any case , fealty to counternarratives is an index to alienation , not to skin color : witness Representative Helen Chenoweth , of Idaho , and her devoted constituents .
With all the appositeness of allegory , the copies of “ The Protocols of the Elders of Zion ” sold by black venders in New York — who are supplied with them by Lushena Books , a black - nationalist book wholesaler — were published by the white supremacist Angriff Press , in Hollywood .
Paranoia knows no color or coast .
Finally though , it ’s misleading to view counternarrative as another pathology of disenfranchisement .
If the M.I.A. myth , say , is rooted among a largely working - class constituency , there are many myths — one of them known as Reaganism — that hold considerable appeal among the privileged classes .
“ So many white brothers and sisters are living in a state of denial in terms of how deep white supremacy is seated in their culture and society , ” the scholar and social critic Cornel West says .
“ Now we recognize that in a fundamental sense we really do live in different worlds . ”
In that respect , the reaction to the Simpson verdict has been something of an education .
The novelist Ishmael Reed talks of “ wealthy white male commentators who live in a world where the police do n’t lie , do n’t plant evidence — and drug dealers give you unlimited credit . ”
He adds , “ Nicole , you know , also dated Mafia hit men . ”
“ I think he ’s innocent , I really do , ” West says .
“ I do think it was linked to some drug subculture of violence .
It looks as if both O.J. and Nicole had some connection to drug activity .
And the killings themselves were classic examples of that drug culture of violence .
It could have to do with money owed — it could have to do with a number of things .
And I think that O.J. was quite aware of and fearful of this . ”
On this theory , Simpson may have appeared at the crime scene as a witness .
“ I think that he had a sense that it was coming down , both on him and on her , and Brother Ron Goldman just happened to be there , ” West conjectures .
“ But there ’s a possibility also that O.J. could have been there , gone over and tried to see what was going on , saw that he could n’t help , split , and just ran away .
He might have said , ‘ I ca n’t stop this thing , and they are coming at me to do the same thing . ’
He may have actually run for his life . ”
To believe that Simpson is innocent is to believe that a terrible injustice has been averted , and this is precisely what many black Americans , including many prominent ones , do believe .
Thus the soprano Jessye Norman is angry over what she sees as the decision of the media to prejudge Simpson rather than “ educate the public as to how we could possibly look at things a bit differently . ”
She says she wishes that the real culprit “ would stand up and say , ‘ I did this and I am sorry I caused so much trouble . ’ ” And while she is sensitive to the issue of spousal abuse , she is skeptical about the way it was enlisted by the prosecution : “ You have to stop getting into how they were at home , because there are not a lot of relationships that could be put on television that we would think , O.K. , that ’s a good one .
I mean , just stop pretending that this is the case . ”
Then , too , she asks , “ Is n’t it interesting to you that this Faye Resnick person was staying with Nicole Brown Simpson and that she happened to have left on the eighth of June ?
Does that tell you that maybe there ’s some awful coincidence here ? ”
The widespread theory about murderous drug dealers Norman finds “ perfectly plausible , knowing what drugs do , ” and she adds , “ People are punished for being bad . ”
There ’s a sense in which all such accounts can be considered counternarratives , or fragments of them — subaltern knowledge , if you like .
They dispute the tenets of official culture ; they do not receive the imprimatur of editorialists or of network broadcasters ; they are not seriously entertained on “ MacNeil / Lehrer . ”
And when they do surface they are given consideration primarily for their ethnographic value .
An official culture treats their claims as it does those of millenarian cultists in Texas , or Marxist deconstructionists in the academy : as things to be diagnosed , deciphered , given meaning — that is , another meaning .
Black folk say they believe Simpson is innocent , and then the white gatekeepers of a media culture cajolingly explain what black folk really mean when they say it , offering the explanation from the highest of motives : because the alternative is a population that , by their lights , is not merely counter - normative but crazy .
Black folk may mean anything at all ; just not what they say they mean .
Yet you need nothing so grand as an epistemic rupture to explain why different people weigh the evidence of authority differently .
In the words of the cunning Republican campaign slogan , “ Who do you trust ? ”
It ’s a commonplace that white folks trust the police and black folks do n’t .
Whites recognize this in the abstract , but they ’re continually surprised at the depth of black wariness .
They should n’t be .
Norman Podhoretz ’s soul - searching 1963 essay , “ My Negro Problem , and Ours ” — one of the frankest accounts we have of liberalism and race resentment — tells of a Brooklyn boyhood spent under the shadow of carefree , cruel Negro assailants , and of the author ’s residual unease when he passes groups of blacks in his Upper West Side neighborhood .
And yet , he notes in a crucial passage , “ I know now , as I did not know when I was a child , that power is on my side , that the police are working for me and not for them . ”
That ordinary , unremarkable comfort — the feeling that “ the police are working for me ” — continues to elude blacks , even many successful blacks .
Thelma Golden , the curator of the Whitney ’s “ Black Male ” show , points out that on the very day the verdict was announced a black man in Harlem was killed by the police under disputed circumstances .
As older blacks like to repeat , “ When white folks say ‘ justice , ’ they mean ‘ just us . ’ ”
Blacks — in particular , black men — swap their experiences of police encounters like war stories , and there are few who do n’t have more than one story to tell .
“ These stories have a ring of cliché about them , ” Erroll McDonald , Pantheon ’s executive editor and one of the few prominent blacks in publishing , says , “ but , as we all know about clichés , they ’re almost always true . ”
McDonald tells of renting a Jaguar in New Orleans and being stopped by the police — simply “ to show cause why I should n’t be deemed a problematic Negro in a possibly stolen car . ”
Wynton Marsalis says , “ Shit , the police slapped me upside the head when I was in high school .
I was n’t Wynton Marsalis then .
I was just another nigger standing out somewhere on the street whose head could be slapped and did get slapped . ”
The crime novelist Walter Mosley recalls , “ When I was a kid in Los Angeles , they used to stop me all the time , beat on me , follow me around , tell me that I was stealing things . ”
Nor does William Julius Wilson — who has a son- in - law on the Chicago police force ( “ You could n’t find a nicer , more dedicated guy ” ) — wonder why he was stopped near a small New England town by a policeman who wanted to know what he was doing in those parts .
There ’s a moving violation that many African - Americans know as D.W.B. : Driving While Black .
So we all have our stories .
In 1968 , when I was eighteen , a man who knew me was elected mayor of my West Virginia county , in an upset victory .
A few weeks into his term , he passed on something he thought I should know : the county police had made a list of people to be arrested in the event of a serious civil disturbance , and my name was on it .
Years of conditioning will tell .
Wynton Marsalis says , “ My worst fear is to have to go before the criminal - justice system . ”
Absurdly enough , it ’s mine , too .
Another barrier to interracial comprehension is talk of the “ race card ” — a phrase that itself infuriates many blacks .
Judge Higginbotham , who pronounces himself “ not uncomfortable at all ” with the verdict , is uncomfortable indeed with charges that Johnnie Cochran played the race card .
“ This whole point is one hundred per cent inaccurate , ” Higginbotham says .
“ If you knew that the most important witness had a history of racism and hostility against black people , that should have been a relevant factor of inquiry even if the jury had been all white .
If the defendant had been Jewish and the police officer had a long history of expressed anti-Semitism and having planted evidence against innocent persons who were Jewish , I ca n’t believe that anyone would have been saying that defense counsel was playing the anti-Semitism card . ”
Angela Davis finds the very metaphor to be a problem .
“ Race is not a card , ” she says firmly .
“ The whole case was pervaded with issues of race . ”
Those who share her view were especially outraged at Robert Shapiro ’s famous post - trial rebuke to Cochran — for not only playing the race card but dealing it “ from the bottom of the deck . ”
Ishmael Reed , who is writing a book about the case , regards Shapiro ’s remarks as sheer opportunism : “ He wants to keep his Beverly Hills clients — a perfectly commercial reason . ”
In Judge Higginbotham ’s view , “ Johnnie Cochran established that he was as effective as any lawyer in America , and though whites can tolerate black excellence in singing , dancing , and dunking , there ’s always been a certain level of discomfort among many whites when you have a one - on - one challenge in terms of intellectual competition .
If Edward Bennett Williams , who was one of the most able lawyers in the country , had raised the same issues , half of the complaints would not exist . ”
By the same token , the display of black prowess in the courtroom was heartening for many black viewers .
Cornel
West says , “ I think part of the problem is that Shapiro — and this is true of certain white brothers — has a profound fear of black - male charisma .
And this is true not only in the law but across the professional world .
You see , you have so many talented white brothers who deserve to be in the limelight .
But one of the reasons they are not in the limelight is that they are not charismatic .
And here comes a black person who ’s highly talented but also charismatic and therefore able to command center stage .
So you get a very real visceral kind of jealousy that has to do with sexual competition as well as professional competition . ”
Erroll McDonald touches upon another aspect of sexual tension when he says , “ The so - called race card has always been the joker .
And the joker is the history of sexual racial politics in this country .
People forget the singularity of this issue — people forget that less than a century ago black men were routinely lynched for merely glancing at white women or for having been thought to have glanced at a white woman . ”
He adds , with mordant irony , “ Now we ’ve come to a point in our history where a black man could , potentially , have murdered a white woman and thrown in a white man to boot — and got off .
So the country has become far more complex in its discussion of race . ”
This is , as he appreciates , a less than perfectly consoling thought .
“ But he ’s coming for me , ” a woman muses in Toni Morrison ’s 1994 novel , “ Jazz , ” shortly before she is murdered by a jealous ex-lover .
“ Maybe tomorrow he ’ll find me .
Maybe tonight . ”
Morrison , it happens , is less interested in the grand passions of love and requital than she is in the curious texture of communal amnesty .
In the event , the woman ’s death goes unavenged ; the man who killed her is forgiven even by her friends and relatives .
Neighbors feel that the man fell victim to her wiles , that he did n’t understand “ how she liked to push people , men . ”
Or , as one of them says of her , “ live the life ; pay the price . ”
Even the woman — who refuses to name the culprit as she bleeds to death — seems to accede to the view that she brought it on herself .
It ’s an odd and disturbing theme , and one with something of a history in black popular culture .
An R. & B. hit from 1960 , “ There ’s Something on Your Mind , ” relates the anguish of a man who is driven to kill by his lover ’s infidelity .
The chorus alternates with spoken narrative , which informs us that his first victim is the friend with whom she was unfaithful .
But then :
Just as you make it up in your mind to forgive her , here come another one of your best friends through the door .
This really makes you blow your top , and you go right ahead and shoot her .
And realizing what you ’ve done , you say : “ Baby , please , speak to me .
Forgive me .
I ’m sorry . ”
“ We are a forgiving people , ” Anita Hill tells me , and she laughs , a little uneasily .
We ’re talking about the support for O. J. Simpson in the black community ; at least , I think we are .
A black woman told the Times last week , “ He has been punished enough . ”
But forgiveness is not all .
There is also an element in this of outlaw culture : the tendency — which unites our lumpenproles with our postmodern ironists — to celebrate transgression for its own sake .
Spike Lee , who was surprised but “ was n’t happy ” at the verdict ( “ I would have bet money that he was going to the slammer ” ) , reached a similar conclusion : “ A lot of black folks said , ‘ Man , O.J. is bad , you know .
This is the first brother in the history of the world who got away with the murder of white folks , and a blond , blue - eyed woman at that . ’ ”
But then there is the folk wisdom on the question of why Nicole Brown Simpson had to die — the theodicy of the streets .
For nothing could be further from the outlaw ethic than the simple and widely shared certainty that , as Jessye Norman says , people are punished for doing wrong .
And compounding the sentiment is Morrison ’s subject — the culturally vexed status of the so - called crime of passion , or what some took to be one , anyway .
You play , you pay : it ’s an attitude that exists on the streets , but not only on the streets , and one that somehow attaches to Nicole , rather than to her ex-husband .
Many counternarratives revolve around her putative misbehavior .
The black feminist Bell Hooks notes with dismay that what many people took to be a “ narrative of a crime of passion ” had as its victim “ a woman that many people , white and black , felt was like a whore .
Precisely by being a sexually promiscuous woman , by being a woman who used drugs , by being a white woman with a black man , she had already fallen from grace in many people ’s eyes — there was no way to redeem her . ”
Ishmael Reed , for one , has no interest in redeeming her .
“ To paint O. J. Simpson as a beast , they had to depict her as a saint , ” he complains .
“ Apparently , she had a violent temper .
She slapped her Jamaican maid .
I ’m wondering , the feminists who are giving Simpson such a hard time — do they approve of white women slapping maids ? ”
Of course , the popular trial of Nicole Brown Simpson — one conducted off camera , in whispers — has further occluded anything recognizable as sexual politics .
When Anita Hill heard that O. J. Simpson was going to be part of the Million Man March on Washington , she felt it was entirely in keeping with the occasion : a trial in which she believed that matters of gender had been “ bracketed ” was going to be succeeded by a march from which women were excluded .
And , while Minister Louis Farrakhan had told black men that October 16th was to serve as a “ day of atonement ” for their sins , the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman was obviously not among the sins he had in mind .
Bell Hooks argues , “ Both O.J. ’s case and the Million Man March confirm that , while white men are trying to be sensitive and pretending they ’re the new man , black men are saying that patriarchy must be upheld at all costs , even if women must die . ”
She sees the march as a congenial arena for Simpson in symbolic terms : “ I think he ’d like to strut his stuff , as the patriarch .
He is the dick that stayed hard longer . ”
( “ The surprising thing is that you wo n’t see Clarence Thomas going on that march , ” Anita Hill remarks of another icon of patriarchy . )
Farrakhan himself prefers metaphors of military mobilization , but the exclusionary politics of the event has clearly distracted from its ostensible message of solidarity .
“ First of all , I would n’t go to no war and leave half the army home , ” says Amiri Baraka , the radical poet and playwright who achieved international renown in the sixties as the leading spokesman for the Black Arts movement .
“ Logistically , that does n’t make sense . ”
He notes that Martin Luther King ’s 1963 March on Washington was “ much more inclusive , ” and sees Farrakhan ’s regression as “ an absolute duplication of what ’s happening in the country , ” from Robert Bly on : the sacralization of masculinity .
Something like that dynamic is what many white feminists saw on display in the Simpson verdict ; but it ’s among women that the racial divide is especially salient .
The black legal scholar and activist Patricia Williams says she was “ stunned by the intensely personal resentment of some of my white women friends in particular . ”
Stunned but , on reflection , not mystified .
“ This is Greek drama , ” she declares .
“ Two of the most hotly contended aspects of our lives are violence among human beings who happen to be police officers and violence among human beings who happen to be husbands , spouses , lovers . ”
Meanwhile , our attention has been fixated on the rhetorical violence between human beings who happen to disagree about the outcome of the O. J. Simpson trial .
It ’s a cliché to speak of the Simpson trial as a soap opera — as entertainment , as theatre — but it ’s also true , and in ways that are worth exploring further .
For one thing , the trial provides a fitting rejoinder to those who claim that we live in an utterly fragmented culture , bereft of the common narratives that bind a people together .
True , Parson Weems has given way to Dan Rather , but public narrative persists .
Nor has it escaped notice that the biggest televised legal contests of the last half decade have involved race matters : Anita Hill and Rodney King .
So there you have it : the Simpson trial — black entertainment television at its finest .
Ralph Ellison ’s hopeful insistence on the Negro ’s centrality to American culture finds , at last , a certain tawdry confirmation .
“ The media generated in people a feeling of being spectators at a show , ” the novelist John Edgar Wideman says .
“ And at the end of a show you applaud .
You are happy for the good guy .
There is that sense of primal identification and closure . ”
Yet it ’s a fallacy of “ cultural literacy ” to equate shared narratives with shared meanings .
The fact that American TV shows are rebroadcast across the globe causes many people to wring their hands over the menace of cultural imperialism ; seldom do they bother to inquire about the meanings that different people bring to and draw from these shows .
When they do make inquiries , the results are often surprising .
One researcher talked to Israeli Arabs who had just watched an episode of “ Dallas ” — an episode in which Sue Ellen takes her baby , leaves her husband , J.R. , and moves in with her ex-lover and his father .
The Arab viewers placed their own construction on the episode : they were all convinced that Sue Ellen had moved in with her own father — something that by their mores at least made sense .
A similar thing happened in America this year : the communal experience afforded by a public narrative ( and what narrative more public ? ) was splintered by the politics of interpretation .
As far as the writer Maya Angelou is concerned , the Simpson trial was an exercise in minstrelsy .
“ Minstrel shows caricatured every aspect of the black man ’s life , beginning with his sexuality , ” she says .
“ They portrayed the black man as devoid of all sensibilities and sensitivities .
They minimized and diminished the possibility of familial love .
And that is what the trial is about .
Not just the prosecution but everybody seemed to want to show him as other than a normal human being .
Nobody let us just see a man . ”
But there is , of course , little consensus about what genre would best accommodate the material .
Walter Mosley says , “ The story plays to large themes , so I ’m sure somebody will write about it .
But I do n’t think it ’s a mystery .
I think it ’s much more like a novel by Zola . ”
What a writer might make of the material is one thing ; what the audience has made of it is another .
“ Simpson is a B - movie star and people were watching this like a B movie , ” Patricia Williams says .
“ And this is not the American B - movie ending . ”
Or was it ?
“ From my perspective as an attorney , this trial was much more like a movie than a trial , ” Kathleen Cleaver , who was once the Black Panthers ’ Minister for Communication and is now a professor of law at Emory , says .
“ It had the budget of a movie , it had the casting of a movie , it had the tension of a movie , and the happy ending of a movie . ”
Spike Lee , speaking professionally , is dubious about the trial ’s cinematic possibilities : “ I do n’t care who makes this movie , it is never going to equal what people have seen in their living rooms and houses for eight or nine months . ”
Or is it grand opera ?
Jessye Norman considers : “ Well , it certainly has all the ingredients .
I mean , somebody meets somebody and somebody gets angry with somebody and somebody dies . ”
She laughs .
“ It sounds like the ‘ Ring ’ cycle of Wagner — it really does . ”
“ This story has been told any number of times , ” Angelou says .
“ The first thing I thought about was Eugene O’Neill ’s ‘ All God ’s Chillun . ’ ” Then she considers how the event might be retrieved by an African - American literary tradition .
“ I think a great writer would have to approach it , ” she tells me pensively .
“ James Baldwin could have done it .
And Toni Morrison could do it . ”
“ Maya Angelou could do it , ” I say .

Video of captive soldier Gilad Shalit to be released shortly : After 1,195 days in captivity the Shalit family gets a sign of life in the form of a video .
After holding consultiations after watching the video , the family announced it has decided to allow the Prime Minister 's Office to release it to the public .
The family 's media advisor Tami Shinkman said as the family watched the video , " This is a difficult moment ... the family is strong and reserved as usual . "
Around 1:30 pm , Brigadier - General Avi Zamir , head of the military 's Human Resources Branch , arrived at the Shalit family home with the video of their son Gilad , as filmed recently by his captors in the Gaza Strip .
The family requested to watch the video in private .

Palestinian news agency , Maan , reported that Gilad Shalit read sections from the Gaza - based " Falasteen " newspaper from September 14 on his video transferred to Israel is exchange for the release of female Palestinian prisoners .
Maan also reported that the video showed Gilad Shalit standing on his feet for a few seconds in order to prove that he is in good health .
According to the report , the soldier is shown dressed in an IDF uniform with a yellow background behind him .
The news agency Palestine Today reported that Shalit appeared on the video reading a recent news item in Arabic from one of the Palestinian newspaper , according to Palestinian sources in the know .
A source that watched the video said a clean - shaven Shalit can be seen talking to the camera , and that he looks healthy and sounds coherent .
The source said it was clear that his captors had prepared him for the video and went to great lengths to make sure he looks well and healthy .
Defense Minister Barak said to Noam Shalit , " This focuses our need to bring Gilad home quickly . "
Earlier , as Shalit 's father Noam arrived at the family home , he was asked by reports if the son would allow the video 's content to be made public .
In response he said , " We will watch it , consider it and decide later . "
Shalit 's parents , Noam and Aviva , are in their family home together with head of the campaign for Shalit , Shimshon Liebman , Omer Gur - Lavi and other friends .
Their other son , Yoel , also joined them .
Their daughter , Hadas , is on the IDF base where she is serving and is not slated to arrive .
The police stationed officers in the area in order to direct traffic near the house .
The Shalit family tried to keep expectations low and to project an air of business as usual .
Noam Shalit even went grocery shopping Friday morning for the upcoming Sukkot holiday .
At 9:30 am Nahshon Unit vehicles left the Hadarim prison to the Ofer and Shikma detention facilities carrying the 19 female Palestinian prisoners slated to be released in exchange for a sign of life from captive solider Gilad Shalit .
Eighteen of the female Palestinian prisoners were released at Bitunia Checkpoint .
They crossed into Palestinian territory where they were received by their families .
Another female Palestinian prisoner included in the videotape deal was released into the Gaza Strip after being transported to Erez crossing in a UN convoy .
WASHINGTON  Fissures are developing among policy makers at the Federal Reserve as they debate how and when to start raising the benchmark interest rate from its current level just above zero .
With Fed officials forecasting that unemployment will average 9.8 percent in 2010 , nobody appears to be arguing that monetary policy should be tightened anytime soon .
The central bank ’s official mantra continues to be that the overnight federal funds rate will remain “ exceptionally low ” for “ an extended period . ”
But Fed officials have hinted at new disagreement in recent weeks .
The arguments go beyond the traditional split between hawks , who worry that easy money will stoke inflation , and doves , who contend that unemployment is the top problem .
The more devilish debates are about how fast to act once the decision has been made , and how to carry it out .
Beyond raising the overnight federal funds rate , the Fed also has to unwind $ 2 trillion in special programs that prop up paralyzed banks and credit markets .
GOP presidential musing is turning toward Governor Mitch Daniels of Indiana .
Given the C Street affiliation of two now - former contenders , Senator John Ensign and G
overnor Mark Sanford , I thought it worth a google to check Daniels out .
Is he a C Streeter ?
I do n’t know .
Is he confused about First Amendment freedoms and his role as a public servant ?
Unquestionably .
Keynoting the 2009 Indiana Leadership Prayer Breakfast — a spin-off of the Family ’s annual National Prayer Breakfast — Daniels proclaimed his commitment to representing nonbelievers as much as believers .
He even says he loves infidels .
But he sure does n’t have to like them .
Here ’s an excerpt from his speech , on the official Indiana state website :
You see , cruelty and selfishness is always at the end of the atheists ’ road .
People of faith , sinners that we are , err and sometimes horribly .
But it does n’t flow from the logic of what we believe .
Once one concludes that we are all just accidental protoplasm , that there is no higher authority to which we ought to be obedient , then only the self matters , only power over others matters .
C.S. Lewis wrote , “ When all that says ‘ it is good ’ has been debunked , what says ‘ I want ’ remains . ”
Within the world of the far left , individuals have no value .
Only the state matters .
That is why the modern American statist devalues individual achievement and wealth .
If , as in the socialist world of Marx , Engels , and Adolf Hitler ( yes , Hitler , as I will explain later ) , God does not exist and humans have no souls , then the state determines the value of a human life .
This philosophy leads to an ominous conclusion .
In my never - ending quest to understand the statist mind , I have attempted to use the principles of objective observation , or phenomenology , to analyze their intentions based on their behavior .
Statists , it appears , have two proclivities :
One , they are perpetually unhappy and dissatisfied with the current political and social environment , no matter what it happens to be .
Two , they are viscerally angry at whoever stands in their way to the next level of progressive utopia .
They do not tolerate alternate points of view .
An objective individual might classify this behavior as classic immaturity .
But there is much more darkness to the statist soul than mere boorish behavior .
The seemingly endless downward spiral into Dante 's seventh level of socialist utopia was made into a movie back in 1968 , aptly titled " Wild in the Streets " .
It was a pretty cheesy flick , but one particular scene left a lasting impression on me .
This was where the radical leftist youths who took control of the government sent the old folks off to national concentration camps and forced them to drink from water coolers filled with Kool - Aid laced with LSD .
For some reason , this image keeps popping into my head whenever I hear about ObamaCare .
At the end of the movie , there is a foreshadowing that an even younger and more radical regime is about to overthrow the radical leftists in power .
On and on it goes , with Dante 's infernal utopia never quite achieved .
Concessions to the fantastic demands of statists lead to more dissatisfaction and anger , and increasingly fantastic demands .
This is similar to the strategy of the radical Islamists living in Western countries .
In fact , you can phenomenologically observe many attitude similarities between the statist and Islamist .
Intolerance of divergent opinions , hatred toward " non-believers " , the obsession to dominate and control every aspect of others ' lives , and a dogmatic attitude guided by emotion rather than logic , are some examples .
Of course , Islamists are just statists with a state religion .
To the Islamist , the end game for the Infidel is conversion or death .
The statist philosophy , whether Islamic or otherwise , appears to condone and even embrace the concept of eliminating the members of the opposition by murdering them .
While the left projects hatred , racism , and evil on the conservative end of the spectrum , it is they who actually exhibit these attributes .
As New York University professor George Watson states in his book , " The Lost Literature of Socialism " :
But it was the issue of race , above all , that for half a century has prevented National Socialism ( the Nazi party ) from being seen as socialist .
The assumption that socialism was never racist can now be seen as a misunderstanding .
The proletariat may have no fatherland , as Lenin said .
But there were still , in Marx view , races that would have to be exterminated .
That is a view he published in January - February 1849 in an article by Engels called " The Hungarian Struggle " in Marx journal the Neue Rheinische Zeitung , and the point was recalled by socialists down to the rise of Hitler .
It is now becoming possible to believe that Auschwitz was socialist - inspired .
The Marxist theory of history required and demanded genocide for reasons implicit in its claim that feudalism , which in advanced nations was already giving place to capitalism , must in turn be superseded by socialism .
Entire races would be left behind after a workers ' revolution , feudal remnants in a socialist age ; and since they could not advance two steps at a time , they would have to be killed .
They were racial trash , as Engels called them , and fit only for the dung - heap of history .
Watson continues :
Socialism offered a blank check to violence , and its license to kill included genocide .
In 1933 , in a preface to On the Rocks , for example , Bernard Shaw publicly welcomed the exterminatory which , to his profound satisfaction , the Soviet Union had already adopted .
Socialists could now take pride in a state that had at last found the courage to act , though some still felt that such action should be kept a secret .
In 1932 Beatrice Webb remarked at a tea-party what " very bad stage management " it had been to allow a party of British visitors in the Ukraine to see cattle - trucks full of starving " enemies of the state " at a local station .
But after all , nothing like this could happen in America , right ?
Obama 's building up of ACORN community organizers and the AmeriCorps civilian army with billions of dollars from the Stimulus could n't be used against its own citizens , could it ?
His statement that " We 've got to have a civilian national security force that 's just as powerful , just as strong , just as well - funded ( as the military ) " does n't scare you , does it ?
Read the following transcript from the testimony of Larry Grathwohl , an FBI informant who infiltrated a 1970 meeting conducted by Obama 's close friend ( and probable ghost - writer ) William Ayers and included the leadership of the socialist Weather Underground .
I brought up the subject of what 's going to happen after we take over the government .
You know , we become responsible for administrating , you know , 250 million people .
And there was no answer .
No one had given any thought to economics .
How are you going to clothe and feed these people ?
The only thing that I could get was that they expected that the Cubans , the North Vietnamese , the Chinese and the Russians would all want to occupy different portions of the United States .
They also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they called the counter - revolution .
And they felt that this counter - revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education in the Southwest where we would take all of the people who needed to be re‑educated into the new way of thinking and teach them how things were going to be .
I asked , " Well , what is going to happen to those people that we can't re‑educate , that are die - hard capitalists ? "
And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated and when I pursued this further , they estimated that they'd have to eliminate 25 million people in these re‑education centers .
And when I say eliminate , I mean kill 25 million people .
I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people , most of whom have graduate degrees from Columbia and other well - known educational centers and hear them figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people and they were dead serious .
The end game of the left is the abortion and eugenic elimination of the " undesirables " , the euthanasia of the old and infirm , and the genocide of those who disagree .
Its objective is the purity of socialist thought .
And it is pure evil .
For most users , iTunes does a great job of handling all of the details of managing your media library for you , allowing you to manage your content through iTunes itself and not having to worry too much about the underlying files and folders that make up your iTunes library .
Unfortunately , this user - friendly approach has one serious limitation :
When it comes time to move your iTunes library , it can often be a bit of a challenge to figure out exactly what pieces you need to move and how to go about doing this .
Many iTunes users start out with a basic iTunes library and use the default settings to store all of their media content on their primary internal hard drive .
However , as you add new content over time , particularly with the additional video content now supported by iTunes , you may soon find that your library threatens to take over your computer .
Another common scenario many users find themselves in is what to do when they upgrade to a new computer .
Your iTunes library has been working just fine on your old computer , but you ’re left with the question of how to get it over to the new machine so that everything works the way it ’s supposed to .
Neither of these situations are at all uncommon , and fortunately it ’s really not all that difficult to relocate your iTunes library to another hard drive or move it to a whole new computer once you understand the basics of how iTunes manages your media content and the options available to you .
This tutorial is intended for both the average and slightly advanced iTunes user and will provide the necessary information that you need to know about transferring your iTunes library onto an external hard drive , a secondary internal hard drive , or a whole new computer .
How iTunes Manages Media Content
Before we delve into the steps of actually moving your media content , it ’s important to explain in some detail exactly how iTunes handles the management of your media files under the hood , what your options are for relocating these files , and the various pitfalls that you might encounter in this process .
The first and most important point is that iTunes is designed to handle all of the details of the underlying file system for you .
By design , the user manages their content through iTunes , and ideally you never need to even look at the underlying file system , much less worry about moving files around .
In this scenario , iTunes can even handle the relocation of your media content for you , making the entire process quite seamless .
This may not match every user ’s style of media management , but it ’s very important to understand how this affects the process of moving your media files to a new location .
The most important point to keep in mind is that once a media file is listed in the iTunes library , it is referenced from iTunes by the specific location ( i.e. full pathname ) of where this file is located .
Therefore , if you move a file , iTunes will almost certainly lose track of that file , and the result will be a broken link in your iTunes library .
This means that you cannot simply move your files manually to a new location and expect iTunes to find them after you ’ve moved them , as it will still expect to find those files in their original locations .
This one point alone has caused many users a great deal of grief , since repairing this situation can often be a tedious process of either manually adjusting the paths to hundreds of files or manually putting those files back into their original locations so that iTunes can find them again .
Fortunately , if you understand this and use iTunes and its related tools the way they were designed , you can ensure a smooth migration of your iTunes library to an external hard drive or even a completely new computer with minimal problems .
iTunes : The Database versus the Content
Another important point to understand :
There are really two components that we are concerned about in this process , and these are somewhat distinct from each other in terms of where and how they are stored .
The iTunes Library Database contains the actual index of your media content .
This database itself is a file named “ iTunes Library.itl ” with several other supporting files stored alongside it .
By default this is stored under a sub - folder named “ iTunes ” in your personal “ Music ” folder ( this is named “ My Music ” on Windows XP and simply “ Music ” on Windows Vista / 7 and Mac OS X ) .
This path cannot be changed in your iTunes preferences , and in fact could not be easily changed at all prior to iTunes 7 .
How to change this path is discussed a bit later in this article .
The iTunes Media Folder contains your actual media content .
By default this is a sub - folder under the iTunes Library Database folder , but can be changed to any location you prefer via your iTunes Advanced Preferences .
Note that prior to iTunes 9 , this folder was called the “ iTunes Music ” folder although despite the name it still just about every other type of media content managed by iTunes as well .
In iTunes 9 this was renamed “ iTunes Media ” to acknowledge that more than just music gets stored here and the subfolder structure was also reorganized accordingly , with Music placed in a subfolder alongside other content types such as Movies , TV Shows and Podcasts .
Note that if you ’ve upgraded an existing library from a version of iTunes prior to iTunes 9 this folder will still be called “ iTunes Music ” and organized the original way unless you ’ve specifically asked iTunes to convert it to the new iTunes Media organization .
Prior to iTunes 9 , click - wheel iPod Games and iOS applications were a special case .
These were stored in sub-folders relative to the iTunes database location , specifically in folders named “ iPod Games ” and “ Mobile Applications , ” respectively .
Relocating your iTunes Music folder did not change the location of these items .
In iTunes 9 and later , these folders are now stored in the iTunes Media folder along with your other media content .
Generally , when trying to optimize disk usage , the iTunes Media Folder is what most users will want to move , as it contains the bulk of your library .
By comparison , the iTunes Library Database is much smaller and is usually best left in its default location .
Standby to Prepare to Move : Checking your Preferences
Now that you ’re armed with a basic understanding of how iTunes stores its media content , and knowing that you cannot simply move files around and expect your iTunes library to be able to find these files , it ’s important to look at how your library is currently setup in order to understand what your options are .
The first step to this process is to review your storage settings under your iTunes Advanced preferences , which can be found by selecting Preferences from the Edit menu ( Windows ) or iTunes menu ( Mac ) , and then selecting the Advanced tab :
The first option , “ iTunes Media folder location ” indicates where your iTunes media content is stored by default .
Remember that this only includes the media content and not the library database itself .
Whether all of your content is located in this folder is going to depend upon the next two settings found on this screen :
Keep iTunes Media folder organized determines whether tracks in your iTunes Media folder are automatically organized based on the track information found within each file .
With this option enabled , iTunes will move and rename files within the iTunes Media folder as necessary into sub-folders by media type , with music organized in an ARTIST \ALBUM subfolder structure and each file named by its track name from the iTunes library .
If this option is disabled , then files within the iTunes Media folder will be left with whatever name and sub - folder they were placed in when you first imported them , regardless of changes to the tag information within iTunes itself .
Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library determines whether files that you add to your library are automatically copied into the music folder , or left in their original location .
When you import new content with this option disabled , iTunes simply “ references ” the file from wherever you ’re importing it , rather than making a copy of it in your iTunes Media folder .
Tracks copied into the iTunes Media Folder effectively become “ Managed ” files ; iTunes will manage the location and naming of these files ( subject to the “ Keep organized ” setting above ) .
On the other hand , files that are not copied into the iTunes Media folder are “ Referenced ” files ; iTunes stores a full path to the file , but does not take any further action with those files in terms of organizing , renaming or moving them .
In fact , iTunes will not even offer to delete an underlying “ referenced ” media file when you remove it from your iTunes library .
Basically if a file is not in the iTunes Media folder then iTunes considers that file to be outside of its control and does nothing more than point to it .
Note that content purchased from the iTunes Store or ripped from CD is always stored in the iTunes Media folder — iTunes is actually creating new files in this case so it has to have somewhere to put them by default .
Therefore , this setting only affects existing files from your computer that are added to the iTunes library using the File , Add to Library option or by dragging - and - dropping them into iTunes from another folder .
So why is all of this important ?
How you have configured these options is going to determine how much flexibility you have when moving your iTunes media content elsewhere .
In a default configuration where all of your media files live within the iTunes Media folder location ( “ Managed ” files ) , and have been organized by iTunes , the process of moving your library may be considerably smoother than for a user who has a bunch of “ referenced ” tracks living in various locations and possibly even on different drives .
While iTunes can move your files to a new location in either scenario , the only way to move a library that consists of referenced files is to actually convert them to an entirely managed library in the process .
Users who have built their own file - system organization for their media content and want to preserve that layout will find the process of moving their content to be much more challenging without creating a whole new iTunes library and reimporting it .
The New iTunes Media Organization
With iTunes 9 , Apple made some changes to how media files are actually organized within iTunes .
When iTunes was first released several years ago , music content was pretty much all it supported , and iTunes was designed with this in mind when it came to organizing your content .
The top - level set of folders in your iTunes Music folder represented artist names from your music collection , with albums listed beneath each artist , and a few other special folders for things like Compilations .
This was fine back when it was only about the music , but over time new media types gradually appeared in iTunes , including audiobooks , podcasts , movies , TV shows , and now even iOS applications .
Despite this , iTunes stubbornly held on to its old style of organization , pigeonholing things like Movies and TV Shows into their own separate folders alongside the artist names for your music .
Further , items such as iOS apps and Click Wheel iPod Games were left out of this folder entirely , stored instead within the main iTunes folder , rather than the iTunes Music folder .
As of iTunes 9 non-music content is no longer treated as a second - class citizen in your iTunes library , and media content is now organized in a more balanced fashion .
The old terminology of “ iTunes Music folder ” has been more appropriately replaced with “ iTunes Media folder ” and when you start a new library iTunes 9 will organize your media content into appropriate top - level folders by media type .
Further , the Mobile Applications folder for iOS applications and the iPod Games folder for Click Wheel iPod Games now form part of the iTunes Media folder as well , instead of being stored separately with the iTunes library database .
If you ’re starting a brand new library with iTunes 9 or later , this will simply be the folder layout that iTunes uses from the start .
However , if you ’re coming from a previous version of iTunes , the old music folder style of organization will be left in place .
This is done primarily to preserve backward compatibility , since you may have third - party applications that read your iTunes Music folder and expect to find your tracks organized in a certain way .
Fortunately , you can easily update to the new iTunes 9 Media Folder layout right from within iTunes itself .
To do this , simply select File , Library , Organize Library from the iTunes menu , and you ’ll be presented with a dialog box with the option to either consolidate your files or reorganize your files .
We ’ll be discussing the “ Consolidate Files ” option later , but for now you can just upgrade to the media folder organization by simply checking the second option and clicking OK .
iTunes will quickly go through your library and move all of your existing files around into the new layout .
Note that only managed files that were originally stored in the iTunes Music folder will be moved — anything referenced from outside of the iTunes Music folder will be left where it is .
If your “ iTunes Music ” folder was in the default location under your main iTunes folder , then it will also be renamed to “ iTunes Media ” in the process .
On the other hand , if you had previously set your “ iTunes Music ” folder to another location the name will remain the same as it was before .
Note :
After you upgrade to the new organizational structure , you may find that you still have Artist folders located at the top folder level .
These are most likely files that were in your iTunes music folder but not actually listed in your iTunes database , often as a result of deleting tracks from iTunes but not deleting the actual files .
iTunes can only reorganize the files that it knows about , so any stray files left lying around will be left exactly where they originally were .
It ’s obviously a good idea to double - check these files with your iTunes library , but once you ’ve confirmed that they are in fact orphans , it ’s perfectly safe to delete these folders .
We definitely recommend upgrading to the new iTunes Media folder organization unless you have a very specific reason not to .
The new layout will be much easier to work with , and most importantly your Mobile Applications and iPod Games will also be stored in the Media folder , making it even simpler to move and backup these items along with the rest of your iTunes media .
Moving your Content to a New Computer
If you ’re simply looking to move your iTunes library to an entirely new computer , the process is actually quite a bit simpler than relocating the content , provided certain conditions are met :
You are moving your iTunes library between two computers using the same operating system and iTunes version ; and You plan to store the iTunes library database and content in the same relative locations on the new computer
If this is the case , then transferring your iTunes library to a new computer is quite simple : Just copy the entire iTunes folder and all sub- folders from your Music folder on your old computer to the corresponding folder on the new computer .
If you have changed your iTunes Media Folder location from the default , simply make sure you copy that to the corresponding location on the new computer as well .
In other words , if you have your iTunes Media folder set to D : \Music then you must copy it to D : \Music on the new computer — remember that iTunes stores the full path to each music file in your library , so your music files must be in the same place on the new computer in order for iTunes to find them .
Note that if you ’re using referenced files — those stored outside of your iTunes Media folder — you can copy these to the new computer as well ; simply ensure that they are copied to the same relative locations on the new computer as they were stored in on the old one so that iTunes will be able to find them .
You ’ve probably read about issues with synchronizing your iPod or iOS device to a new computer .
This is not a problem when you ’re moving your entire library , however , since iTunes associates your device with the library database rather than the physical machine .
This means that once you ’ve copied your iTunes library database over to your new computer , you can continue syncing your iPod or iOS device to it in the same way as you did previously — iTunes wo n’t even notice the difference .
To actually copy the files between computers you can use any file transfer method you normally would for any other type of data , including an external hard drive or USB memory key , a home network between the two computers , or by burning your iTunes data to CDs or DVDs .
Note :
If you have previously run iTunes on the new computer at all , even if you have n’t done anything with it , chances are that there will already be an “ iTunes ” folder present .
Unless you ’ve already started using iTunes on the new computer and adding content to it , you can safely overwrite this folder as it simply represents the empty database that iTunes initially creates .
Generally , minor differences in operating system versions will not be an impediment to moving your iTunes library directly over to a new computer , nor will moving to a later version of the same operating system ( e.g. Windows XP to Windows Vista or OS X Snow Leopard to OS X Lion ) .
Likewise , you can transfer your library to a computer with a newer version of iTunes than the one on your original computer without any problems —
iTunes will simply upgrade the database when you start it up on the new computer .
Note that your iTunes preferences are machine - specific , and you will need to go through and re-configure these the first time you run iTunes after copying your library over to the new computer .
You can locate the preference file itself on the original computer and copy this over , however this is not recommended as there are frequently machine - specific settings in these preference files that may not translate properly onto the new computer .
If you have any content purchased from the iTunes Store , you will need to re-authorize the new computer for your iTunes Store account .
Computer authorization is machine - specific .
You should also make sure you DE - authorize your old computer if you no longer plan to use it with iTunes .
If you plan on putting your iTunes Media folder in a different location on the new computer you will want to read on for the process of relocating the iTunes Media folder itself .
Whether you choose to do this before transferring your library to your new computer or afterwards largely depends on your specific situation .
For example , if your media folder has been stored on a drive on your original computer that does not exist on the new computer , you will need to consolidate your library before moving it to the new computer .
Similarly , if you plan to keep your iTunes library on an external hard drive , it makes more sense to consolidate the media folder onto that external drive from your original computer and then just copy the iTunes library database over to the new machine and let it pick up the media from the external drive .
Moving your iTunes library to a different operating system is also possible , and we will discuss that later on this article .
Moving Your Content to a New Hard Drive : The Wrong Way
A very common mistake made by many users is to simply try and move their entire iTunes Media folder to a new location and update the iTunes Media folder path in iTunes ’ preferences .
In some cases this may work , but in reality you will risk iTunes losing track of some or all of your media files in the process .
The reason for this is that iTunes stores the entire full path to each music file in its library database .
If you move that file somewhere else , then iTunes wo n’t be able to find it , and the result will be a broken link to that file , shown as an exclamation mark in iTunes immediately to the left of the track listing :
If you try to select a track with a broken link , iTunes will notify you that it cannot find the file , and provide an opportunity to locate it yourself :
Selecting “ Locate ” will allow you to browse for the file , and iTunes will link the current entry to that specific file .
This can be a viable solution for a few broken links , but you can imagine that this could become very tedious if you had hundreds or even thousands of files in this state .
Should you find yourself in this situation , the simplest solution is usually just to move your iTunes Media folder back to its original location .
iTunes still has the complete path to each file in its database , so if you put the actual files back , it should have no problem finding them again .
Users who have a completely “ Managed ” library configuration may be able to get away with simply moving their media folder and updating the path , however it is still not the recommended solution unless you are absolutely certain that your library is fully managed and organized in the way that iTunes expects it to be .
The reason this method will work in a fully managed library is because iTunes will look for any missing tracks in their default location under the iTunes Media folder path before deciding that the links are broken .
So , if your tracks are organized in the way that iTunes expects to see them , then it will be able to find them in the new location .
However the problem is that it is not uncommon for users with large libraries to have a few referenced files or files with non-standard names due to changes to iTunes preference settings or even inconsistent behaviour with older versions of iTunes .
The “ Consolidate Library ” feature , discussed in the next section , will ensure that your library is fully managed and organized the way iTunes expects , but if you ’re going to use this option anyway , you might as well let iTunes copy the files to the new location in the process and save yourself a step .
Note : Mac OS
X users can get away with moving their media files around on the same drive and iTunes will still be able to find them .
This is not iTunes - specific but is actually due to the fact that the Mac OS X operating system itself keeps track of files when they ’re moved to new locations on the same drive , regardless of file type .
This will not work , however , when moving files to a different drive , partition , or computer .
Consolidate : The Right Way
So , knowing that these pitfalls exist , what ’s the best way ?
Remember that iTunes ’ philosophy of managing your media is actually to insulate you from having to worry about the underlying file system .
On the basis of this approach , it makes sense that it should provide the necessary tools itself to facilitate moving your library to a new location .
So in other words , rather than messing around copying / moving files through Finder or Windows Explorer , why not let iTunes deal with this for you ?
This is handled in iTunes through the Consolidate files option , found under File , Library , Organize Library in iTunes .
What the Consolidate files option actually does it to gather all of the files listed in your iTunes library into the iTunes Media folder .
It does this by copying any referenced files into the iTunes Media folder , renaming them with the proper track name , and organizing them into its standard file and folder structure .
This option is at least partly intended to allow you to bring “ referenced ” files into the iTunes Media folder from various other locations in the event that you may have added them to your library with the “ Copy Files ” option disabled .
However the only real distinction between a file that is “ managed ” and a file that is “ referenced ” is the actual iTunes Media folder path .
Files in this folder are considered “ managed ” files and anything outside is a “ referenced ” file .
So , if you change the location of the iTunes Media folder to a new path and then use the Consolidate files option , iTunes will happily copy all of these files into your new location , updating all of the file location information in the iTunes database in the process .
Performing the Move
To actually perform the move , start by going into your iTunes Advanced Preferences , and changing the iTunes Media folder path to whatever new location you want your iTunes media files to be stored in .
This will usually be an external hard drive , but it can be any valid path , including a secondary hard drive or even a network share :
Once you have updated the iTunes Media folder location , simply select File , Library , Organize Library … ( in iTunes 8 , this option was “ Consolidate Library ” and in iTunes 7 and prior , it was located on the “ Advanced ” menu ) :
You will be presented with a dialog box with the option to consolidate files or reorganize them .
Select “ Consolidate files ” and click OK .
iTunes will begin the process of copying the files into their proper locations and updating these locations in the iTunes library database .
Note that this process copies the tracks to the new location rather than moving them .
Although the original tracks still exist , the iTunes library database is updated with the new location for each track , which makes the process difficult to undo unless you have kept a backup of your library database from prior to the consolidation .
Making such a backup is certainly an option , although not normally required .
The other important note is that this will reorganize your entire library file system into iTunes ’ default way of laying it out ( e.g. ARTIST\ALBUM\TRACK .MP3 in the case of music files ) .
This may not be a desirable option for those who have their media file system laid out in their own organizational structure , or who use other third - party applications that expect media files to be organized a certain way .
Unfortunately , if you ’re in this situation , there really is no easy way to move your iTunes media content to a new location without creating a whole new iTunes library and reimporting all of your tracks into the new library from their new locations .
Note :
If you ’ve upgraded to the new iTunes Media organization , your Mobile Applications and iPod Games folders will be copied into the iTunes Media folder as part of this process as well .
Confirming and Cleaning Up
Once this process has completed , you should be able to confirm that the files have been copied to the new location and that iTunes is referencing them properly from there simply by selecting a track and choosing File , Get Info .
The “ Summary ” tab for the file properties will indicate the physical location of that track , which should reflect the new iTunes Media folder path .
Since iTunes copies the media content rather than moving it , you will likely also want to delete your iTunes media files from their original locations to free up space .
Note : Keep in mind that iTunes only moves content that is actually listed in the iTunes library database , which means any stray files that were lying around the iTunes Media folder wo n’t be copied to the new location .
This should not be a concern unless you ’re storing non-iTunes media content in your iTunes Media folder .
Remember that this process only moves the iTunes content however .
Your iTunes library database will still be located in its original location , likely on your primary hard drive in your Music folder , as described earlier .
So while you can clean out the “ iTunes Media ” sub - folder from here once you ’ve consolidated your library to another location , you should not touch any of the other files or folders in your main iTunes folder .
Moving the Library Database
If you ’re simply interested in moving your files to a larger disk , there ’s seldom any reason to worry about moving the library database , as it does n’t normally take up a lot of storage space , and there are advantages to leaving this file on your local hard drive and simply storing the content on an external drive .
That having been said , if you do want to move the library database to another location , this is certainly possible as well as long as you ’re using iTunes 7 or later .
This must be done separately from the process of moving the content described above , and you ’re best to move the content first and then relocate the library database once you ’ve confirmed that everything is still working properly .
To do this , shut down iTunes , and copy your “ iTunes ” folder ( under your “ Music ” or “ My Music ” folder ) to the new location .
Keep in mind that you may still have media content located in an “ iTunes Media ” sub - folder and you probably do n’t want to waste time copying this content over if you ’ve already consolidated it to another location , so you may want to exclude that one sub - folder .
Once you have copied the “ iTunes ” folder , including the “ iTunes Library.itl ” and all related support files and folders , simply restart iTunes while holding down the SHIFT key ( Windows ) or OPT key ( Mac ) and you will be prompted to either create a new library or choose a location for an existing library :
Simply click “ Choose Library ” and browse for the location where you copied the iTunes folder .
iTunes will startup using that particular library database instead of the one from the original location .
Once you have set this location iTunes will continue to use it unless you change it again using the same method .
Moving the iTunes library database onto an external hard drive can be useful if you plan to move the external hard drive between multiple computers .
It can also be useful to store it in a common area on a local computer for access by multiple user profiles , or even on a network share .
One word of caution , however : The iTunes database is not designed for multi-user access .
If you decide to place it on a network share or in a common directory on a standalone workstation , always make sure that you do not have more than one copy of iTunes running against it at a time , otherwise you will risk corrupting your iTunes database .
Moving Between Operating Systems
Although the iTunes database format is the same for both the Windows and Mac OS X versions of iTunes , moving your iTunes library from Windows to Mac OS X or vice - versa is complicated by one other issue :
The file systems between these two operating systems are completely different ; even though iTunes will be able to read the library database from the other operating system , it will not be able to make much sense of the paths stored there .
For example , where Windows uses drive letters , Mac OS X uses drive names , so there ’s no way for Mac OS X to figure out what to do with a path like “ D: \Music . ”
However , the good news is that since iTunes will default to looking for any missing files in its normal iTunes Media folder , you can leverage this behaviour when migrating your library to a different operating system .
To make this work , you must first ensure that iTunes has organized all of the files according to its default naming standard .
This way when you move the files onto the new operating system iTunes will be able to find them in their default locations .
To do this , first visit your iTunes Advanced preferences .
If the Keep iTunes Media folder organized option is enabled , deselect it and click OK .
Then , go back into your Advanced preferences and RE - select this option and again click OK .
This will tell iTunes to go through your iTunes Media folder and ensure that all music files are named according to its defaults .
You will be shown a progress indicator while this is happening .
Once this has completed , perform a “ Consolidate files ” operation , as described earlier to bring in any referenced tracks that may exist outside of your iTunes Media folder .
Following these steps , your iTunes Media folder should be properly organized with all of your files in the default locations that iTunes expects to find them .
You can then simply copy your entire iTunes folder and iTunes Media folder over to the new computer and operating system in the same way that you would transfer any other set of files .
When iTunes starts , it wo n’t be able to find the music files by their specific location , but it will automatically and transparently “ fall back ” to looking in the default location where it would expect those files to be — in the iTunes Media folder .
iTunes does this in the background transparently so you wo n’t even notice it happening — things should just work .
Note :
In many cases , automatically downloaded artwork may not appear properly when moving your iTunes library from Windows to Mac OS X or vice - versa .
This issue should only affect automatically downloaded artwork , and can be easily resolved simply by asking iTunes to get the artwork again .
Dealing with a Referenced Library
Another option of course is to simply start a new iTunes library from your existing media content .
In this case , you would start up iTunes with a new database and re-import everything .
Of course , this will not retain any playlists , ratings , play counts or other library metadata — you will in essence be starting over from scratch .
You will also need to reload the content onto any iPod , iPhone or Apple TV devices you may be syncing , since these will also see the new library and require you to perform an “ Erase and Sync ” operation .
Starting a whole new library will likely be your best option if you have a primarily referenced media collection scattered through folders outside of iTunes ’ own music folder and you want to preserve this file system organization .
In this case you can simply move your media content to the new location , and then start a new library and import it with the Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library option turned OFF , in much the same way you would have when you first imported your content to your original iTunes library .
More advanced users may be able to work around this as well by using symbolic links ( OS X ) or NTFS Junctions ( Windows ) to effectively relocate parts of the file system .
This process basically involves copying the media files to a larger hard drive and then creating links in the file system to point to those new locations .
iTunes continues to see the files as if they were in the same place as they have always been , while the operating system actually accesses them from the new location .
Symbolic links and NTFS junctions are advanced operating system features that are beyond the scope of this article and setting this up should only be attempted by those users comfortable working in the file system with command - line tools .
Using an External Hard Drive and a Portable Computer
Once you have consolidated your library content onto an external hard drive , iTunes will continue to use that location for any newly imported or downloaded content , subject to your iTunes preference settings .
However , this creates an additional consideration for users of portable computers , since the external hard drive may not always be available .
Fortunately , iTunes actually works around this quite well , so there ’s no need to pack up the external hard drive when going out with your laptop .
Basically , when you start iTunes with your external drive disconnected , the iTunes Media folder path will temporarily revert to its default location on your local hard drive .
This allows iTunes to run properly , although obviously you will not have access to any of the content that ’s not already in that location .
You will see broken links to any files that you try to access since the external hard drive is not present .
No need to worry though as this will correct itself once the drive is available again .
However , this does allow you to download new content ( e.g. import CDs , add files to your library , download podcast episodes , purchase content from the iTunes Store , etc ) .
This new content will be saved in your local iTunes Media folder , and will be usable from there .
You can even sync your iPod or iOS device to your library in this state .
Unavailable tracks ( those with the exclamation marks beside them ) will remain on the device since they are still listed in the library .
You obviously wo n’t be able to add content to your device that is n’t already there , but you could certainly sync any new content you ’ve added while disconnected since those files exist on your laptop computer .
Further , even ratings and playcounts will be updated in the iTunes library during an automatic sync .
This can be a useful way to import a few tracks off a new CD when you ’re away from home and get them loaded onto your iPod without having to wait until you get home or having to resort to switching your iPod to manual mode .
Once you do return back home and plug the external hard drive back in , you simply need to restart iTunes and it will detect that its proper iTunes Media folder has returned , and go back to using that .
Any content you ’ve downloaded or imported while you were away from your main library storage can be transferred over simply by running the Consolidate files option to copy those files over .
The way that iTunes handles this provides a very effective way to maintain a large iTunes library that is somewhat usable on the go without having to keep it all on your laptop ’s internal hard drive .
You can even keep a copy of your favorite tracks in your local iTunes Media folder for use while you ’re away from your external hard drive ; iTunes will seamlessly switch between using whichever set of media files are available .
( CNN ) -- A Malaysian model , who was set to become the first woman to be caned in the southeast Asian country for drinking beer in public , had her sentence postponed Monday until the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan .
Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno's punishment is unique in that she has opted to go through with it .
Authorities had picked up Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno , 32 , from her father 's house Monday morning and were taking her to a prison in the eastern state of Pahang when the van turned around and brought her back .
" They sent her back to the house .
They said the top official asked them not to bring her to Kuala Lumpur , " said Kartika 's father , Shukarno Abdul Muttalib .
Authorities in Pahang said the delay would run until the month of fasting ends .
Monday was the third day of Ramadan .
An Islamic , or sharia , court in Pahang had fined Kartika -- a Muslim -- $ 1,400 ( 5,000 Malaysian ringgit ) and sentenced her to six strokes with a rattan cane for drinking at a hotel bar two years ago .
Kartika , a 32 - year - old part - time model and mother of two , was visiting Malaysia from Singapore at the time .
She pleaded guilty , paid the fine , and wanted her caning to be carried out in public .
Watch more on Kartika 's release »
She said she lost her job as a nurse in Singapore and took up part - time modeling to support her husband in raising their two children .
Her son has cerebral palsy ; her daughter a heart condition .
" I want to move on .
This case has been hanging over me for a long time , " she told CNN last week .
On Monday morning , Kartika hugged her children , bade a tearful goodbye to the throngs of people gathered at her father 's house , and boarded the van .
She was to be taken to a prison on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur .
The caning would have been carried out within seven days of that , making her the first woman to be caned in Malaysia under sharia law .
Kartika 's punishment is unique in that she has opted to go through with it .
Two other Malaysians sentenced to the same fate have filed appeals , the Syariah ( Sharia ) Lawyers ' Association of Malaysia said .
The case drew widespread attention and condemnation , in and outside Malaysia .
The moderate Muslim country has a dual - track justice system , in which Islamic courts operate alongside civil courts .
Muslims -- who make up about 60 percent of the 28 million who populate the country -- are forbidden from consuming alcohol .
Other religious groups are exempt .
Though caning is used as a supplementary punishment in Malaysia for at least 40 crimes , such as rape or immigration violations , it is not meted out by Malaysia 's civil court for alcohol consumption .
But the country 's civil system also cannot overrule a sharia court sentence .
In this respect , Kartika would have been the first woman to be caned for violating the country 's religious laws .
" Regardless of whether or not such penalties fall under Syariah law or civil law , we believe that these should be repealed , as they go against the fundamental human right to be free from torture and violence , " said Haslinah Yaacob , vice president for the All Women 's Action Society .

San Bernardino authorities arrested a woman Friday who they say boarded 22 mentally ill , elderly and other people in prison - like conditions , housing some in converted chicken coops behind razor wire fences .
Pensri Sophar Dalton , 61 , was arrested on 16 counts of suspected elder abuse , according to City Atty .
James F. Penman .
Some of the people appeared to have mental health issues , he said .
“ The stench was pretty horrific , ” Penman said .
“ These were very squalid conditions . ”
The people were being held in dilapidated buildings , some without running water or toilets .
The facility is not licensed with the state or the city , Penman said .
Two milk box crates containing prescription medicines were found at the site .
At least two of the residents were in wheelchairs .
Police arrested Dalton after going to her home in the 2800 block of North Golden Avenue to arrest a man with outstanding warrants for drunk driving , according Penman said .
Penman said that while some residents were held in converted chicken coops , others lived in shared bedrooms , the doors of which had padlocks on them .
Residents ate on two picnic tables beneath a metal roof outside on a dirt floor .
Two residents were taken to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton .

This was too funny to pass up .
We 've known all along that Glenn Beck is a two - bit phony .
Now we see how Glenn Beck gets himself properly weepy for the cameras : A little Vicks Vaporub .
One might dismiss this as merely a one - off for this shoot .
But you can hear Beck himself say :
Beck : I think it 's getting used to it -- my eyes are getting used to it .
From regular and continuous use , mayhaps ?
The whole scene reminds us that Beck practices his schtick over and over before he performs .
Which means he 's gotten real good at working up those tears and choking up to say , " I love my country -- but I fear for it ! "
This may be what Sen. Lindsey Graham had in mind yesterday :
Via Sam Stein :
" Only in America can you make that much money crying , " Graham said of Beck .
" Glenn Beck is not aligned with any party .
He is aligned with cynicism and there has always been a market for cynics .
But we became a great nation not because we are a nation of cynics .
We became a great nation because we are a nation of believers . "
In other Beck news :
-- Media Matters has an excellent followup to the Salon piece about Beck 's disciplehood at the feet of W. Cleon Skousen -- which in turn illustrated Beck 's long history of promoting extremist beliefs -- pointing out that Skousen was not exactly what you would call ... enlightened on matters of race :
Fox News ' Glenn
Beck has heavily promoted the writings of far - right activist W. Cleon Skousen , even making Skousen 's book , The 5000 Year Leap , a central part of his 9 - 12 Project .
Skousen is the author of several controversial works , including The Making of America : The Substance and Meaning of the Constitution , which presented as " the story of slavery in America " a passage from a book that attacked abolitionists for delaying emancipation ; cast slave owners as " the worst victims of the system " ; claimed white schoolchildren " were likely to envy the freedom of their colored playmates " ; and claimed that " [ s ] lavery did not make white labor unrespectable , but merely inefficient , " because " the slave had a deliberateness of motion which no amount of supervision could quicken . "
This continues to remind me of last week 's interview with Katie Couric , when he refused to explain what he meant by white culture .
[ Via ThinkProgress . ]
-- Beck is having a little difficulty dealing with Internet memes .
Especially when dealing with charges that , by golly , we have n't been able to disprove yet !
-- Finally , has anyone else noticed that , on the cover of his new book , Beck looks exactly like the illegitimate love child of Colonel Klink and Sergeant Schultz ?
Just wondering .
In his third season as TBS ’s No. 1 national baseball announcer , Chip Caray is slightly better than he was two years ago when the network began carrying the league division series .
But that does n’t mean he is a No. 1 announcer .
Caray is still prone to bad play calls , descriptive exaggerations and factual errors .
Every announcer makes mistakes , but Caray ’s lips form a pattern of an announcer out of his element .
The producer , Glenn Diamond ; the director , Lonnie Dale ; and the statistician are either failing him or he is spurning their advice and support .
No one in the production truck could rescue him from his 10th - inning classic faux pas during the Twins - Tigers tie breaker Tuesday night .
Caray called the Twins ’ Nick Punto ’s sharply hit liner to left field this way : “ Line drive .
Base hit .
Caught out there .
The runner tags .
Throw to the plate .
On target .
And in time !
A double play . ”
My ears quivered in amazement at hearing a very obvious lineout called a single as smoothly as Caray did .
The FDIC has greatly underestimated the problems of our nation ’s banking system .
Earlier in the week the FDIC proposed that banks put up $ 45 billion to protect bank depositors .
The average American must be amazed that a system backing $ 9 trillion in deposits is essentially broke .
Clearly the FDIC has the backing of the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve but there is some irony in having the FDIC tell banks to pay an early assessment to protect our money .
These banks are going to use bail out money to pay to protect taxpayer deposits !
The banking system is going to have some deep and profound issues as the $ 3 trillion in commercial real estate loans go bad in the next few years .
The problem is how the banking system is structured .
Take a look at how assets are distributed over the 8,204 banks :
This is an incredible chart .
Total assets at FDIC insured banks amount to $ 13.3 trillion .
However , out of 8,204 banks 116 hold a stunning $ 10.28 trillion of these assets .
We can have the smaller banks fail and the asset base would hardly move .
Yet the issue of course is that the vast majority of big dollar problems are in the bigger banks .
The FDIC made the call for the prepayment this week because it is now officially in the red .
It is no surprise given that a system backing some $ 7.42 trillion in loans with what is now no reserve is doomed to fail .
It was destined to run out of money .
Yet it is naïve to think that only $ 45 billion is going to protect the system from the $ 3 trillion in commercial real estate loans that are held in many not too big to fail banks .
The end outcome is more trouble for banks and the taxpayer should gear up for a second round of bailouts .
If you doubt this the Federal Reserve has already discussed “ Plan C ” which was a backroom talk to preemptively bailout the commercial real estate industry .
The plan from the FDIC would front load bank assessment fees making institutions pay up for fees that were due up until 2012 .
This assessment is going to wipe out the $ 1.8 billion in supposed bank profits from the first half of the year .
There is n’t any issue with the prepayment per se , but the fact that banks are claiming that all is well is a massive bait and switch on the American people .
The insurance fund is wiped out not because of great bank performance but because the FDIC is virtually taking over a few banks every Friday .
Of course this flies in the face of a recovering economy .
With recent auto sales data out , car sales plummeted as expected after the cash for clunkers gimmick ran out .
So banks with their $ 1.8 billion “ profit ” was nothing more than accounting chicanery and bailout money moved around to give the appearance of profit .
To show you how quickly things are changing the FDIC in May had projected losses of $ 70 billion from failed banks .
That number is now up to $ 100 billion and this is with the stock market going gangbusters and the financial sector rallying with hot money .
The insurance fund started out the year with $ 30 billion but most of that has already disappeared with rising delinquencies and high unemployment .
The problem with the FDIC approach is that it is exchanging liquid assets from reserves and taking over toxic mortgages from these failed banks .
These assets have much lower values in today ’s market and chances are the FDIC is over estimating the value of the assets they are acquiring .
What is even more disturbing is their extremely optimistic outcomes on commercial real estate which are more toxic loans than even their residential property siblings .
The problem with the deposit insurance fund is we are told no depositor has ever lost a penny from insured deposits :
Of course this is n’t taking into account the subsidies and taxpayer money going to bail out banks or the devaluation and destruction of the U.S dollar .
You do n’t lose a penny , you lose a dollar with how things are being approached .
The number of troubled institutions is growing exponentially :
This is by the FDIC estimates so we can assume that more are on the troubled list .
By the end of this recession ( or two ) we will have 1,000 or more failed banks .

Ever since Sony announced the PS3 slim back in August at Gamescom in Cologne , Germany , the console manufacturer and consumer electronics giant has been on quite a roll .
Following the release of the announced slimmer , lighter version of the PS3 , came the PSPgo launch , and Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves releasing to much acclaim .
It seems as though nothing can slow Sony down .
From the moment the PS3 slim was released on September 1 , 2009 at a lower price point of $ 299 , sales immediately skyrocketed .
So much so , Microsoft ’s Aaron Greenberg is even expecting for the PlayStation 3 to top the Xbox 360 when September ’s NPD results come in .
While speaking with Game Informer , Aaron Greenberg , Director of Product Management for Xbox 360 and Xbox Live talked candidly about the sudden surge of PS3 sales .
He even went as far as to admit Sony would come out on top on September console sales .
“ It is not a real concern to us – in fact , I can tell you to that when NPD releases September sales … we fully expect PlayStation 3 will come in as the console with the most units sold for the month , ”
Sony sold over one million of its new PS3 in just 3 weeks after its release .
Even with sales that massive , Greenberg remains confident that the Xbox 360 will outsell the PS3 for not only the calender year , but for this generation of consoles .
“ What I can tell you is we remain confident that Xbox 360 will not only outsell PS3 for the full calendar year , but for this entire generation . ”
Confident words , when Sony is right on their tails in worldwide console sales , thanks to strong sales in both Europe and Japan .
Here in North America , the PlayStation 3 still trails the Xbox 360 , but if the PS3 can maintain its momentum it ’s quite possible the PS3 could overtake the Xbox 360 in 2010 in worldwide sales .
Stay tuned to PlayStation LifeStyle as we ’ll have the official NPD data shortly .

Manchester airport security has given its first shot to a naked scanner .
Authorities claim that this will accelerate the security checks by scanning every little thing that the passenger is carrying with him .
The images will be destroyed straight away , say the authorities .
The scanner generates a black and white image of the human body including their body piercing , breast enlargement , and person ’s genitals .
Hence it ’s a complete naked show of passenger .
Currently the scanner has been installed at the terminal 2 of Manchester airport .
Sarah Barrett , head of customer experience at the airport , said “ most passengers did not like the traditional ‘ pat down ’ search . ”
The authorities also claim that these images would be destroyed immediately after the scanning .
The pros are that the authorities would get a complete access to any explosive , armor or some other dangerous equipments a person is carrying with himself , and in terms of security this would be in the best interest of general public as passengers will no longer have to take off their shoes , coats or other out fits and they can save plenty of their time .
Still the cons ca n’t be neglected , most of the people are n’t comfortable with authorities having a complete naked display of them and besides this is a real invasion of our last privacies .
Some guy having a naked picture of us !
People would quite hesitate trusting these big authorities for handling their naked pictures .
People are calling it huge violation , and unacceptable act , misuse of power and who knows if these pictures are trafficked .
The scanners cost £ 80,000 each .
They are fixed in booths and they will generate virtual three dimensional image using beam of electromagnetic waves .
Ms Barrett said the radiation levels are “ super safe ” .
She said : “ Passengers can go through this machine 5,000 times a year each without worrying .
The amount of radiation transmitted is tiny . ”
Authorities will decide whether to install them permanently in about a year ’s time .

THE COSTS OF PREMATURE BIRTHS THE COSTS OF PREMATURE BIRTHS Caring for preemies ' medical needs costs the world $ 26 billion a year .
Premature babies are at risk for many serious problems , including : - Cerebral palsy - Blindness - Hearing loss - Learning disabilities Source : The March of Dimes More than 1 million babies die each year because they 're born too soon , according to the first report to estimate the global burden of premature births .
About 13 million babies a year — nearly 10 % of all newborns — are born prematurely , after less than 37 weeks of the normal 40 - week pregnancy , according to a report released Sunday by the March of Dimes
The preterm birth rate in the USA is especially high : 12.7 % of all babies are born early , according to the March of Dimes .
That rate has increased 36 % in the past 25 years , partly because of an increase in elective cesarean section , an increase in older mothers and the growing use of assisted reproduction , which increases the risk of twins , triples and higher - order multiple births , the report says .
Most of the increase in the USA is in " late preterm " babies , born at 34 to 36 weeks of pregnancy , the report says .
Some babies are at higher risk than others , the report says .
In the USA , black babies are 1 ½ times as likely as whites to be premature — a major reason that black infant mortality is so much higher than that of whites , says Christopher Howson , vice president for global programs at the March of Dimes .
Doctors can do far more to save preemies than they could only a generation ago , says Nicholas Fisk , director of the University of Queensland Centre for Clinical Research in Australia , who was n't involved in the report .
Yet doctors still have no reliable way to prevent preterm birth , Fisk says .
At best , doctors can delay delivery by a day or two — just long enough to give women drugs to mature their babies ' lungs .
At 23 to 26 weeks of pregnancy , the odds of survival increase 2 % to 3 % with every day a baby remains in the womb , he says .
Fisk says drug companies are reluctant to create drugs for acute preterm labor because of the high cost of research and relatively low potential for profit , given that women might take them only for a few days .
Instead of focusing on acute preterm labor , Fisk says , researchers might help more women by identifying underlying problems , such as inflammation , that develop early in the pregnancy .
For example , researchers have been studying the hormone progesterone , which might help women who are at high risk of early delivery because of a shortened cervix , Fisk says .
Women would probably take progesterone for several weeks or months .

Life is full of choices .
Any time we flip on the television or cook
dinner , we ’re making a decision .
What are we going to watch ?
Will it be steak for dinner ?
Or pizza ?
Should I buy the PS3 or the Xbox
360 ?
We answer most of these questions in spontaneous choices that often
occur without much conscious thought , and yet many of our
life ’s choices can alter our lives .
Even something as simple
as watching TV might influence your future : Perhaps you ’re so
intrigued by the latest iteration of Shark Week on the Discovery
Channel that you opt to go back to school to become a marine
biologist .
These consequences occur on a near daily basis ,
and everyone around you is tempered by your reputation earned through
your previous encounters and decisions .
But what if you could see what it could have been like ?
What if you
could replay your life , making different decisions along the way ?
Perhaps if you ’d been friends with different people in high
school , you could ’ve been a straight " A " student ?
Or maybe
your
decision to get married early in life led to a very profitable
lifestyle , yet kept you from your dream of sailing around the world ?
These are the sort of dilemmas that BioWare is hoping to give gamers in
their upcoming roleplaying game , Dragon
Age : Origins .
While at GamesCom
2009 , the Edmonton - based studio transported audiences of journalists to
the world of Ferelden – a dark , gritty world seeping with
cankerous outbreaks of a pestilence called “ The
Blight . ”
It ’s here that the gamer is placed , and
the character that you control exists as one of the lone saviors left
in a world almost without hope .
Dispecable agents from all over
Ferelden are
trying to take advantage of the coming storm , and betrayals are
happening faster than you can blink .
The demo began with a video
covering the basics of the world of Dragon Age , and two of Dragon
Age ’s top developers lead the GamesCom 2009 adventures ,
specifically
Lead Designer Mark Laidlaw and Global Product Manager David Silverman .
Both of these men are avid gamers – just like you and me
– and they wanted to ensure that players understand the sort
of
gravity that the gameplay within Dragon Age holds for potential fans .
“ There ’s hundreds of choices to make in Dragon
Age , ” Silverman stated .
“ The cool thing about this
game is that every decision you make in the game has a rippling
consequence that will come back to haunt or help you . ”
Now most people have seen choices in video games before , and they 're
all over in
BioWare games .
For roleplaying gamers especially , the notion of choice
is n’t anything new by any stretch of the imagination .
Even MMOs like Age
of Conan and Tabula
Rasa have used choice
and storytelling as one of their selling points .
But the Dragon Age
developers are looking to do something more with their iteration on the
mechanics of decision making .
“ What you ’re going to see if the 2.0 version of
choice , ” Silverman continued .
“ It’s
[ asking the gamer ] what they would do if their morality was brought
into
question .
What do you do when there is n’t a clear good or bad
choice ?
When it ’s not just a question of kicking kittens or
saving babies ? ”
“ Even in the origin stories , ” Laidlaw explained ,
“ you ’ll find these sort of decisions to make .
There
may be a lean to them one way or the other , but you can certainly
justify the things that you do . ”
For the demonstration , Laidlaw and
Silverman dropped the audience into
one of those moral choices that will affect the rest of the game for
the player .
And , as Laidlaw explained , the choice was far from clear
cut .
“ That ’s one of the great things about Dragon
Age , ” Laidlaw continued .
“ There ’s a gray
morality to it .
There ’s no good or evil slider .
There ’s no nemesis twirling his moustache [ to declare that
he ’s evil ] . ”
The scenario that the developers dropped us into is about 10 - 15 hours
into the game according to Laidlaw and Silverman , depending upon how
the gamers push through the content .
The audience found itself facing
the hero ’s party , which included Morrigan , Wynne , and
Leliana .
The hero was obviously a warrior of some sort , draped as he
was with a thick suit of plate mail and wielding a massive sword .
Again , the developers explained that the group was inside of an
important religious temple and was about to discover an incredibly
important religious artifact known as the Urn of Sacred Ashes , an item
thought to have been lost by the religious order known as the Chantry
of Andraste .
The party had been sent to this location in order to heal
an important ally , Arl Eamon , and thus use his armies in the fight
against the Blight .
After making it through a rabid cult and a series of tests known as The
Gauntlet , the character stands in front of the Urn of Sacred Ashes and
that ’s where the player ’s choice suddenly jumps to
the forefront in a bold and stunning way .
As the character stands over
the urn , both Wynne and Leliana proclaim their awe at being in the
presence of such a mighty item .
On the other hand , Morrigan issues a
snide comment , clearly not impressed with such religious idols .
“ This is really like finding the Holy Grail of Dragon
Age , ” Silverman states .
“ [ To Wynne and Leliana ]
this is the discovery of a lifetime .
They thought it was lost
forever . ”
In this particular version of events , Silverman had our character take
a pinch of the ashes to hopefully heal Arl Eamon , but this leads him to
the moral dilemma surrounding what then to do with the Urn of Sacred
Ashes .
Silverman presented one particular argument –
do n’t worry you ’ll hear about another version from
Laidlaw – but it ’s important to note that
everything from party composition to character ’s relationship
with the main character will influence how these sort of events play
out .
“ So what do we do with the ashes ? ” Silverman asked .
“ This is an incredibly powerful artifact .
Not only does it
have significant religious benefits and effects , but it also has
practical magical purposes as well .
These ashes can cure anything and
essentially grant you everlasting life .
The Urn can make you
immortal . ”
Silverman went on to explain that the Blight is on the move and
they ’re amassing to destroy every living thing on Ferelden .
What happens if they got ahold of the sacred urn and the ashes within
it ?
You ’d never be able to defeat the Blight , even with an
army of a half dozen nations .
“ That ’s a high price
to pay to keep an object sitting around in a nice temple , ”
Silverman said .
“ And what if man gets corrupted ?
You all saw
what happened in Lord of the Rings .
Here ’s a whole urn full
of sacred ashes where one flake of this stuff can cure a king where
none of the most powerful mages from across the land can do
it . ”
With Silverman ’s point of view
in mind , the character opted
to destroy the rest of the Urn of Sacred Ashes by dumping
dragon ’s blood into the container .
It may be a despicable
act , but surely the ends justify the means , right ?
Almost as soon as the character begins to pour the blood into the urn ,
both Wynne and Leliana nearly jump out of their skins .
They
ca n’t believe what you ’ve just done – two
of your very own party members – and it ’s up to the
player to try to convince them that what you ’ve done is the
right way to do things .
Unfortunately , things do n't go so well for the character in the game .
Both
Wynne and Leliana are unable to come to grips with the situation , and
the temple ’s immortal Guardian declares that
“ Andraste must be avenged ! ” and lights into the
fight as well .
You still have one ally on your side , the ever lovable
Morrigan , and the two remaining party members must fight off the three
religious zealots .
By the end of the battle , you ’ve massacred
two of your former party members , leaving them to rot on the stone
floor of the temple while you go on your merry way with only Morrigan
in tow .
“ That did n’t turn out quite the way you
would ’ve hoped , ” Silverman states with a laugh .
“ But it ’s clear that your party members in Dragon
Age have a soul .
They have their own emotions , their own motives , and
their own moral compasses .
I had to make the moral choice that
– for the greater good – it was better to destroy
these ashes .
Both Leliana and Wynne were willing to sacrifice their
own lives for what they believed in , which was saving this
urn . ”
After that encounter , there was one more
person Morrigan and our
character had to talk to , the man who spent half his life trying to
find the Urn of Sacred Ashes .
With the blood of our allies still
covering our bodies , Morrigan and the main character begin conversing
with him , hopefully to explain what happened and keep it secret .
But nothing can go according to plan .
The religious scholar finds out
that we ’ve found the urn and begins to make plans to tell
other pilgrims about the tale .
Our character , on the other hand , wants
to keep it a secret and not turn the temple into Disneyland .
Aside from
the ashes being destroyed , there ’s a whole cult outside of
the temple that tries to kill anything that enters the area , so
it ’s not exactly the safest place for pilgrims to be
meandering about .
While the character tries to explain that it must be
kept from the public , the scholar again states that he’ll
spread the word “ or die trying . ”
Which is exactly what happens .
I ’m not going to give away the awesome death scene , but it
was one of the more surprising ways to
kill a man that has his back turned .
Let ’s just say the
audience laughed and then gave out a shocked groan .
“ That ’s probably the coolest death in the
game ” Silverman finished .
With the blood of three innocent victims on our character ’s
hands , this version of the demo finishes .
Of course , Silverman explains
that the developers do n’t have time to show us everything
that might have happened if we did n’t destroy the ashes in
the urn .
Perhaps the darkspawn get ahold of the ashes ?
What if their
armies were then unstoppable thanks to our choice ?
“ The ends justify the means , ” Silverman echoes .
“ And now we ’re one step closer to defeating the
Blight .
This was clearly the right choice ”
Of course , Laidlaw was n’t so
convinced .
“ Or was it [ the right choice ] ? ” he asks .
“ That ’s the question .
Taken from a completely
different point of view , going through the same sequence of events
could be completed very differently .
The nice thing about
David ’s argument is that it ’s very compelling and
emotional … but it ’s also a bit hyperbolic and full
of crap . ”
And so the demonstration restarts just before the Urn of Sacred Ashes .
In Laidlaw ’s version of the demonstration , his character
believe that he is not just a Grey Warden that has to stop the Blight
at all costs , but he ’s there to protect the world from the
spread of evil .
Thus we ’re thrust back into the Gauntlet at the end of the
third trial , and the test asks our party to undertake a true
“ leap of faith . ”
It ’s very much an ode to
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade , in that the characters are asked to
walk through fire without their armor or weapons strapped to their
backs .
Of course , Laidlaw ’s character immediately strips down to his
skivvies and so does his party ( which is quite compelling in a group of
females ) .
In this act , Laidlaw truly shows his characters devotion and
comes away unscathed .
He then has the character ascend the steps and
stare down at the alter .
“ Contrary to what David felt at this point , ”
Laidlaw states , “ my character is feeling that he’s
staring down at what the Wardens represent in the world .
They ’re not just ridiculous butt kickers that can kill
thousands of darkspawn .
Yes they can do that , but is that the important
part to the people ? ”
“ No ! ” Laidlaw continues .
“ The important
part of the Wardens is that they represent hope .
The chance that they
[ might get through the Blight ] .
We ’re not thinking ,
let ’s destroy it .
On the contrary , people need hope as badly
as anything , and that ’s what this represents . ”
And so , Laidlaw ’s character merely takes a pinch of the ashes
and then proceeds to tell the scholar outside that he also wishes to
open the temple up to pilgrims .
He ’s not concerned about
their lives coming to the temple , because his character will take the
time to clear a path for those individuals .
All rhetoric aside , there truly is a tone that players can adopt for
their characters in Dragon Age .
While Silverman ’s character
was playing a darker path than Laidlaw ’s , both men were able
to evoke the emotions of their characters into the game itself .
Unlike
many of the games that have come in the past , the advancements in
graphics over the last few years truly make it easy to see the results
of your choices on the people around you .
When you first walk up to the Urn of Sacred Ashes , the facial
expressions and voice work with Wynne and Leliana make it
explicitly clear that they have an almost fanatical reverence for this
object .
Even if you ’re playing a darker character ,
it ’s easy to feel a slight twinge of guilt when you pour the
dragon ’s blood into the urn .
And when you do – or
do n’t – you immediately know how your actions have
affected your standing with your two religious compatriots .
I believe
Leliana even calls your character – owing to her bardic
background – a " fiend . "
Unlike the storytelling in previous BioWare games , Dragon Age : Origins
uses every tool that it can to push the story toward the player .
From
the cinematic angles to the variety of choices in front of the player ,
there ’s a scale to the game that seems incredibly compelling .
And it gets even better .
After the demonstration was over , Laidlaw and
Silverman took a few minutes to discuss the “ what
ifs ” to this scenario .
Although the demonstration showed a
group composed of three women , Laidlaw stated that even if Leliana and
Wynne are n’t in the party with the character when he makes
his choice , they ’ll still react to that decision when the
character chooses to put them back into the party .
The repercussions of
the event are felt throughout Ferelden , and it ’d be
inappropriate for the two most religious members of the adventuring
troupe to ignore the blasphemous act .
That said , Laidlaw also suggested that the outcome with Wynne and
Leliana can end differently depending on their approval rating with
the main character .
Laidlaw would n’t go into specifics , but
if you ’ve earned their trust , perhaps they can be convinced
that destroying the Urn of Sacred Ashes was the way to go .
The possibilities – if BioWare took the time to put them into
the game – are endless .
The developers at BioWare have never
let me down before , and I do n’t imagine they ’ll
start a new trend with their latest addition to the fantasy RPG market .
And that 's not all folks !
At the end of the demo , the group encountered
a....* gasp*...... dragon .
But space here is limited , so make sure you
tune back in tomorrow for the rest of the story !
The premier flu - fighting drug is contaminating rivers downstream of sewage - treatment facilities , researchers in Japan confirm .
The source : urinary excretion by people taking oseltamivir phosphate , best known as Tamiflu .
Concerns are now building that birds , which are natural influenza carriers , are being exposed to waterborne residues of Tamiflu ’s active form and might develop and spread drug - resistant strains of seasonal and avian flu .
For their new study , Gopal Ghosh and his colleagues at Kyoto University sampled water discharged from three local sewage treatment plants and water at several points along two rivers into which the treated water flowed .
Sampling started early in December 2008 , as flu season got underway .
The researchers sampled again at the height of the seasonal flu onslaught in early February and again as infection rates waned .
Tamiflu ’s active form , oseltamivir carboxylate , or OC , turned up in the treated sewage on every occasion , the researchers report online Sept. 28 in Environmental Health Perspectives .
Values were in the low nanograms - per - liter range during the first and last samplings , and reached a high of almost 300 ng / L at one outflow during the flu ’s peak , a week when there were 1,738 recorded flu cases in Kyoto .
River residues showed up during only that second sampling — from low - nanogram levels at most sampling points to a high of 190 ng/ L in a portion of the Nishitakase River where treated sewage accounts for 90 percent of the flow .
Computer modeling has shown that OC should survive sewage treatment , noted Wolf von Tümpling Jr. of the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research , a federal institute in Magdeburg , Germany .
Ghosh ’s team is now the first to confirm this , he said .
Von Tümpling ’s own data show that once exposed to sunlight , OC will break down , albeit slowly .
Concentrations would fall at best by half every three weeks , he said .
If correlations predicted by earlier studies are correct , concentrations measured at some river sites in the new Kyoto study seem “ high enough to lead to antiviral resistance in waterfowl , ” Ghosh says
And the Kyoto team did n’t test during a pandemic , when Tamiflu prescription rates might be 10 times higher , von Tümpling notes .
Indeed , the expected coinciding hits by seasonal and H1N1 swine flu this winter , could send Tamiflu use skyrocketing .
In a July 14 letter , Food and Drug Administration deputy commissioner Joshua Sharfstein noted that “ there is no adequate , approved and available alternative to the emergency use of certain oseltamivir phosphate products for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza . ”
Once ingested , virtually all Tamiflu will end up in the environment in the active form , noted environmental chemist Jerker Fick of Umeå University in Sweden .
The reason : Tamiflu becomes active once the body converts it into a carboxylate form .
Roughly 80 percent of an ingested dose becomes this OC , which the body eventually excretes .
The body sheds the remaining 20 percent of Tamiflu in its original form , but this phosphate form is immediately turned into the active , carboxylate form when it reaches a water treatment plant , he said .
Two years ago , Fick ’s team published data showing that most sewage - treatment technologies will remove “ zero percent ” of any OC present .
And ducks love hanging out around warm , nutrient - rich outflows of treated water during winter - flu season .
While sampling for waterborne OC last year in Japan , “ I saw it myself , ” he said .
If Tamiflu resistance does develop in exposed birds , the affected flu strains will probably be conventional seasonal and avian - flu strains , which claim thousands of lives each year , and not H1N1 .
That ’s because H1N1 seems to bypass birds as it spreads among people , noted William Schaffner , chair of preventive medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville , Tennessee .
He also notes that U.S. policy is more conservative than Japan ’s when it comes to Tamiflu use .
Federal guidelines , he said , recommend that “ Tamiflu be reserved for treatment of the very sick and anyone who is immunocompromised . ”

We started asking around , and everyone gave us the same answer : " I do n't have any data for that , " said Amanda Sabia , principal analyst for Internet demand at Gartner Group .
" Good question , " said Comcast 's Mary Nell Westbrook .
" We 're giving it a look . "
She got back to us the next day : " We just do n't have anything . "
Apparently it 's not something companies study .
Some engineers at Cisco surmised that temperature would affect the conductivity of the copper — and thus the average download velocity of a YouTube video .
After all , the Wiedemann - Franz law states that the electrical conductivity of a metal falls as the temperature rises .
Since the vast majority of the world 's cable is in the northern hemisphere , the warm summertime months above the equator should see a drop in Internet speeds .
" No way , " said Doug Webster , a senior director at Cisco .
" The infrastructure is engineered to counter those effects . "
Oh , snap .
Fortunately , his company had the data to end this feud .
The networking juggernaut regularly surveys 15 to 20 of the world 's largest ISPs .
And though Cisco had never crunched the numbers to account for seasonal variation until we asked , its data shows that the bits move most swiftly in June , July , and August .
How could the Internet thumb its binary nose at the laws of physics ?
Webster has a theory :
The Internet runs faster in the summer because people are outside enjoying the nice weather .
It turns out that he 's right .
Traffic has a far greater effect on speed than the weather does .
Download - friendly July has the least Web traffic .
In 2008 , 56 percent fewer bits moved through the Intertubes in July than in September .
Using Webster 's logic , you 'd think that January and February — when everyone 's inside ducking the cold — would have the slowest data - transfer rates .
But again , the numbers beg to differ .
The Net is most sluggish in September .
Webster did n't have an explanation for this .
Sure , schools are in session , but the same goes for February .
So we called Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron , who pointed out that this spike corresponds with a well - known phenomenon : " Economic productivity is highest in the autumn . "
It makes sense , according to Joe Robinson , who coaches massive corporations like IBM on work - life balance .
" I can cite eight studies indicating that performance and productivity go up after vacation , " he said .
When you return from a long stint at the beach , you 're not just recharged , you 're more efficient .
Even reaction times go up by 30 to 40 percent .
It 's not surprising then that Internet speeds lag when we 're all back from vacay , hustling online , grabbing at that brass ring .

My bungee nightmare : Briton hits water at 80 mph after elastic cord flies loose
As he hurtled towards the water at 80 mph on a bungee jump , Rishi Baveja anxiously awaited the moment when the elastic cord snapped him back aloft .
It never came .
The harness around his feet worked free and he continued accelerating until he hit the surface of a Thai lagoon .
Going , going : A video from the platform shows Rishi Baveja jump , left , and the cord almost fully unfurls with him still attached , right
Fortunately he managed to take the full force of the impact on his chest , escaping catastrophic head injuries .
But the Cambridge graduate still suffered a ruptured spleen , torn liver , collapsed lungs and massive bruising .
Surgeons , who likened his injuries to those of a car crash victim , had to remove the spleen and he spent a month in a Bangkok hospital before he was well enough to return to his home near Wakefield , West Yorkshire .
Gone :
He hits the water and the cord swings under the platform , left , before it swings back into view minus Mr Baveja , who was seriously injured
' All the doctors were staggered that I lived , ' he said .
' I 'm very lucky .
If I had landed head first I would be brain damaged or dead . '
Mr Baveja , whose father Amarjeet is a GP , was in Phuket on a month - long holiday to celebrate gaining a 2.2 degree in engineering .
Lucky to be alive : Rishi Baveja spent a month in hospital but is now recovered
He paid £ 50 to make the jump at the Jungle Bungy centre in Kathu .
A crane took him to a 165 ft platform where a harness was placed around his feet and fastened to a bungee cord with several wraps of material .
A video of the jump records his yelp of fear just before he hits the water , while an instructor appears to say ' Oh ' , as the realisation of what is happening dawns on him .
Mr Baveja said it was not clear how the harness was able to work loose and he would not be suing the operators because he feels there is little prospect of success .
' I knew the jump would be scary but I did n't think it was dangerous .
I had a long phone conversation with my mum telling her it was safe .
' She only believed me when I told her that the website of the jump centre claimed it had a 100 per cent safety record .
It still says that .
I did n't need to do that jump .
I wish I had n't . '
Mr Baveja 's parents flew out to his bedside when they were told of the accident .
Despite losing his spleen he hopes to return to full health - and has not been put off extreme sports .
He plans to go skydiving when he has recovered .

If you like a tasty slab of meat , make sure you place your orders soon .
Pork chops will become soggier and paler as the world warms , say veterinary scientists , and steaks could become blander , leaner , darker and more prone to spoilage .
This is all because the quality of our meat depends on whether or not animals experience heat stress during transport to the abattoir .
Cattle begin to suffer heat stress at 20 °C , pigs at 31 °C .
“ The one thing we can be sure of is that they ’ll experience those harmful temperatures more often with climate change , ” says Neville Gregory of the Royal Veterinary College in Hatfield , UK .

Gregory has spent over a decade studying how meat quality varies with the temperature at which farm animals are kept .
In a paper published in Food Research International this month , he puts his findings in the context of future climate change .
Blotting paper
Unless farmers take protective measures , global warming will make pork soggier and paler , says Gregory .
Normally , after an animal dies , energy reserves – in the form of glycogen – are broken down into lactic acid , causing the carcass pH to fall from 7.0 to 5.5 .
But heat - stressed pork acidifies more quickly .
When this happens , muscle proteins fall apart , and as a result so does the meat ’s structure .
“ What you ’re left with is meat that resembles soggy white blotting paper , ” says Gregory .
Heat - stressed pork tends to be sold at a lower price than premium meat , as because it ’s not what people expect on their plates .
But in a warmer future , soggy pork chops could become standard , he says .
Bland steak
If you ’re partial to rump steak , your fare will suffer too .
Beef , says Gregory , will taste blander and look darker : “ almost mahogany in colour , or umber , and in the worst case , black . ” .
Heat - stressed cows run out of glycogen before they die , and as a result produce very little lactic acid after death .
As with pork , the pH of beef drops , but because there is less lactic acid in beef than in pork , it stalls at 6.3 .
At this higher pH , proteins retain water , which prevents oxygen from penetrating the meat .
“ This causes the meat ’s pigment to default to its darker , oxygen - free state , ” says Gregory .
Normand St - Pierre of the animal sciences department at Ohio State University says Gregory ’s work ignores the possibility of artificially cooling farmed animals .
“ It assumes that husbandry practices will not adapt to climate change by enhancing the animal - cooling technology used on their farms as mean temperatures rise , ” he says .
“ I think that producers around the world are immensely more clever than that . ”
Zebu to the rescue
If cool - weather farmers start cross- breeding their cows with heat - resistant , tropical species such as the south Asian zebu ( Bos indicus ) , westerners will have to get used to eating tougher beef , says Gregory .
“ Bos indicus has a very high activity of calpastatin , a protein that inhibits the breakdown of muscle after death and leaves the meat tough ” , says Gregory .
“ The implications of global warming for animal production have not been given much thought ” , says Peter Hansen , an animal scientist at the University of Florida in Gainesville .
“ Hopefully , this paper will stimulate some much - needed debate among policy makers . ”

I have no idea whether this estimate is still valid , but back in the days when I was working with O’Connor & Associates , the head of technology ( and O’Connor had a well run technology operation ) said the cost of documenting software ( as in having the developers write up what they did in sufficient detail so a third party could maintain the it ) was an additional 20 % .
It was very difficult to get traders to pay for it , ironically not so much for the hard dollar costs , but the fact that IT was resource constrained .
The idea that the coders would spend a lot of time on leaving a paper trail , rather than getting to a business center ’s urgent need , was a hard sell .
But Lehman illustrates what happens when you do what most places do , and skip documentation .
Now of course , modern IT on the Street was supposed to be using more off the shelf software and doing less custom development , but you would never know that reading this Financial Times story :
Many dead as two trains collide in Egypt
At least 25 people have been killed and more than 50 injured in a crash between two passenger trains on the outskirts of the Cairo , the Egyptian capital .
The vehicles were traveling on the same track , and were both headed in the same direction , according to television reports .
The trains collided on Saturday at Al - Ayyat in Giza , about 70 km ( 40 miles ) south of Cairo .
Dozens of ambulances rushed to the scene , with rescue workers trying to use a crane to lift one wagon from on top of the other to pull out more people out of the trains .
Officials said they believed the death toll could rise as rescue and recovery operations continued .
No foreigners were reported among the casualties .

There has been great demand for this plan .
Thus far , around 45,000 adults have enrolled , compared to an estimated 60,000 who were previously uninsured .
Among covered businesses , roughly 20 percent have chosen to use the city ’s public option for at least some of their employees .
But interestingly , in a recent survey of the city ’s businesses , very few ( less than 5 percent ) of the employers who chose the public option are thinking about dropping existing ( private market ) insurance coverage .
The public option has been used largely to cover previously uninsured workers and to supplement private - coverage options .
Through our experience working on health - care - reform efforts in California and Washington ( one of us worked for President George W. Bush ’s Council of Economic Advisers ) , we have seen how concern over employer costs can be a sticking point in the health care debate , even in the absence of persuasive evidence that increased costs would seriously harm businesses .
San Francisco ’s example should put some of those fears to rest .
Many businesses there had to raise their health spending substantially to meet the new requirements , but so far the plan has not hurt jobs .
As of December 2008 , there was no indication that San Francisco ’s employment grew more slowly after the enactment of the employer - spending requirement than did employment in surrounding areas in San Mateo and Alameda counties .
If anything , employment trends were slightly better in San Francisco .
This is true whether you consider overall employment or employment in sectors most affected by the employer mandate , like retail businesses and restaurants .
So how have employers adjusted to the higher costs , if not by cutting jobs ?
More than 25 percent of restaurants , for example , have instituted a “ surcharge ”  about 4 percent of the bill for most establishments  to pay for the additional costs .
Local service businesses can add this surcharge ( or raise prices ) without risking their competitive position , since their competitors will be required to take similar measures .
Furthermore , some of the costs may be passed on to employees in the form of smaller pay raises , which could help ward off the possibility of job losses .
Over the longer term , if more widespread coverage allows people to choose jobs based on their skills and not out of fear of losing health insurance from one specific employer , increased productivity will help pay for some of the costs of the mandate .
The San Francisco experiment has demonstrated that requiring a shared - responsibility model  in which employers pay to help achieve universal coverage  has not led to the kind of job losses many fear .
The public option has also passed the market test , while not crowding out private options .
The positive changes in San Francisco provide a glimpse of what the future might look like if Washington passes substantial health reform this year .
DALLAS , Texas ( CNN ) --
An investigation into claims that faulty evidence led Texas to execute an innocent man in 2004 was at a " crucial point " when the state 's governor replaced three of its members this week , one of the three said Thursday .
A family photo shows Cameron Todd Willingham with his wife , Stacy , and daughters Kameron , Amber and Karmon .
Gov. Rick Perry 's shake - up of the Texas Forensic Science Commission came two days before it was to hear from the author of a scathing report in the case of Cameron Todd Willingham .
That Friday session has been postponed indefinitely in the wake of Perry 's new appointments , and critics of the governor accused him of trying to quash the Willingham probe .
" I think people are making a lot of this issue , " Perry told reporters Thursday in Austin , Texas .
He said the replacement of commission Chairman Sam Bassett and commissioners Alan Levy and Aliece Watts , whose terms had expired , was " pretty normal protocol . "
" If you 've got a whole new investigation going forward , it makes a lot more sense to put the new people in now and let them start the full process , rather than bring people in there for a short period of time and then replace them , " he said .
" I think it makes a whole lot more sense to make a change now than to make a change later . "
The Forensic Science Commission began investigating the Willingham case in 2008 , hiring Maryland fire investigation expert Craig Beyler to examine the evidence used to convince a jury the fire that killed Willingham 's three daughters was deliberately set .
Levy said Thursday he told the governor 's office " that it would be disruptive to make the new appointments right now . "
" The commission was at a crucial point in the investigation , " he said .
Asked about the future of the Willingham investigation , he said , " I do n't know if it will ever be heard . "
Levy , a top prosecutor in Fort Worth , Texas , said he had asked to remain on the commission , but received no response from the governor 's office .
Sam Bassett , the panel 's former chairman , said he also asked to remain .
Do n't Miss The Innocence Project
Beyler 's report is the latest of three to conclude that arson was not the likely cause of the 1991 fire , and the first commissioned by a state agency .
Death penalty opponents say an impartial review of the Willingham case could lead to an unprecedented admission that the state executed an innocent man .
The Beyler report concluded that the ruling of arson at the heart of Willingham 's conviction " could not be sustained " by modern science or the standards of the time .
The report , filed in August , said the state fire marshal who testified in Willingham 's trial approached his job with an attitude " more characteristic of mystics or psychics " than with that of a detective who followed scientific standards .
Perry , who faces a Republican primary challenge in his bid for a third term next year , refused to issue a last - minute stay of execution for Willingham in 2004 and has said he remains confident that Willingham was guilty .
So have authorities in Corsicana , south of Dallas , who prosecuted Willingham in his daughter 's deaths .
Asked whether the governor wants to see the Willingham investigation go forward , Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger said , " That 's a decision of the commission . "
" The governor has made his position on this case clear , and has said that he has not seen anything that would cause him to think that the decisions made by the courts of Texas was not correct , " Cesinger said .
" Beyond that , the business of the commission is up to the commission . "
Wednesday 's appointments raised concern among Willingham 's relatives , who worked to avert his execution and to clear his name after his death .
" It sounds like someone made Gov. Perry mad , " his stepmother , Eugena Willingham , said after hearing the news during an interview with CNN at her home in Ardmore , Oklahoma .
" I think it 's going to delay things , " she said .
" It makes me wonder why . "
Innocence Project co-founder Barry Scheck compared the shake - up to the Watergate scandal 's " Saturday Night Massacre , " when embattled President Richard Nixon sought the removal of a special prosecutor investigating his administration .
" Rather than let this important hearing go forward and the report be heard , the governor fires the independent chairman and two other members of this commission , " Scheck said .
" It 's like Nixon firing Archibald Cox to avoid turning over the Watergate tapes . "
The Innocence Project seeks to help prisoners who were wrongfully convicted .
Its 2006 report on the Willingham case concluded that " an innocent man was executed . "
That report led to Beyler being hired by the Forensic Science Commission to review the case .
Neither Bassett nor Levy would say whether they believed political considerations were behind their replacement , though Bassett said in a written statement that the investigation should not be dropped " because there might be political ramifications . "
Perry replaced Bassett with John Bradley , the district attorney of Williamson County , north of Austin .
The governor appointed Bradley to his current post in 2001 , and Scott Cobb , president of the Texas Moratorium Network , called him " one of the most hard - line prosecutors in the entire state . "
" I really do n't have a lot of confidence with him on this commission , " Cobb said .
On the other hand , however , " If he is convinced by the evidence , it would make an even bigger impact . "
Bradley spoke about the appointment via telephone Thursday afternoon .
" My day started off yesterday with a phone call from the governor 's office informing me that I had been appointed , so I 've got a lot of work to do , " he said .
" I 've got a pretty full - time job as district attorney and was already chairing another statewide commission , " one that focused on mental health issues in the Texas criminal justice system .
He said he would " approach the job very methodically , " and said he did not know when the Beyler hearing would be rescheduled .
But he dismissed claims that his appointment was meant to stall the Willingham investigation .
" People tend to read into these things the kind of preconceived notions they come to these issues with , " Bradley said .
" They 're not going to change those positions overnight .
They 're going to watch how the commission does its work . "
He said if he does his job right , the commission will " probably satisfy most of those people . "

All About Capital Punishment • Rick Perry
Stratford , historically known as Stratford Langthorne , is one of the major centres of Greater London located in the West of the city .
It is here that the summer events will take place ; a monumental event for England .
Due to this , Stratford has been the focus of large scale redevelopment in the area over recent years .
Major projects are contributing towards the area 's regeneration .
There have been improvements to the railways with a ' High Speed 1 ' station in place , which will provide fast links between London and Kent , with trains also travelling to and from the continent .
A large shopping centre is also planned , similar to Bluewater - several major chains such as John Lewis and Waitrose have already signed up .
Many more superstores and residential areas are being built too to accommodate the extra people that will be drawn to the locality .
With the area becoming more and more popular , you may require a companion to take it all in with .
Stratford escorts are available at any time of day or night , so anytime you want some company you will be able to arrange a meeting .
Spending time with a Stratford escort is a great way to view the local sights and to oversee the regeneration first hand .
However , Stratford is not simply a mass of building works .
There are very pretty areas of the town , with many bars and shops to browse .
If you are entertaining escorts in Stratford , you could maybe go to one of the many local restaurants to dine together .
If this simply is n't enough time for you to enjoy your Stratford escort , you could stay in a hotel nearby and stretch the night out for as long as you can .
Stratford escorts are so desirable that you wo n't want to let them go !
" Evil Maid " Attacks on Encrypted Hard Drives
Earlier this month , Joanna Rutkowska implemented the “ evil maid ” attack against TrueCrypt .
The same kind of attack should work against any whole - disk encryption , including PGP Disk and BitLocker .
Basically , the attack works like this :
Step 1 : Attacker gains access to your shut - down computer and boots it from a separate volume .
The attacker writes a hacked bootloader onto your system , then shuts it down .
Step 2 : You boot your computer using the attacker ’s hacked bootloader , entering your encryption key .
Once the disk is unlocked , the hacked bootloader does its mischief .
It might install malware to capture the key and send it over the Internet somewhere , or store it in some location on the disk to be retrieved later , or whatever .
You can see why it ’s called the “ evil maid ” attack ; a likely scenario is that you leave your encrypted computer in your hotel room when you go out to dinner , and the maid sneaks in and installs the hacked bootloader .
The same maid could even sneak back the next night and erase any traces of her actions .
This attack exploits the same basic vulnerability as the “ Cold Boot ” attack from last year , and the “ Stoned Boot ” attack from earlier this year , and there ’s no real defense to this sort of thing .
As soon as you give up physical control of your computer , all bets are off .
Similar hardware - based attacks were among the main reasons why Symantec ’s CTO Mark Bregman was recently advised by “ three - letter agencies in the US Government ” to use separate laptop and mobile device when traveling to China , citing potential hardware - based compromise .
PGP sums it up in their blog .
No security product on the market today can protect you if the underlying computer has been compromised by malware with root level administrative privileges .
That said , there exists well - understood common sense defenses against “ Cold Boot , ” “ Stoned Boot ” “ Evil Maid , ” and many other attacks yet to be named and publicized .
The defenses are basically two - factor authentication : a token you do n’t leave in your hotel room for the maid to find and use .
The maid could still corrupt the machine , but it ’s more work than just storing the password for later use .
Putting your data on a thumb drive and taking it with you does n’t work ; when you return you ’re plugging your thumb into a corrupted machine .
The real defense here is trusted boot , something Trusted Computing is supposed to enable .
But Trusted Computing has its own problems , which is why we have n’t seen anything out of Microsoft in the seven - plus years they have been working on it ( I wrote this in 2002 about what they then called Palladium ) .
In the meantime , people who encrypt their hard drives , or partitions on their hard drives , have to realize that the encryption gives them less protection than they probably believe .
It protects against someone confiscating or stealing their computer and then trying to get at the data .
It does not protect against an attacker who has access to your computer over a period of time during which you use it , too .
EDITED TO ADD ( 10/23 ) : A few readers have pointed out that BitLocker , the one thing that has come out of Microsoft ’s Trusted Computing initiative in the seven - plus years they ’ve been working on it , can prevent these sorts of attacks if the computer has a TPM module , version 1.2 or later , on the motherboard .
( Note : Not all computers do . )
I actually knew that ; I just did n’t remember it .
EDITED TO ADD ( 11/12 ) : Peter Kleissner ’s Stoned Boot attacks on TrueCrypt .
EDITED TO ADD ( 12/9 ) : A similar attack is possible against BitLocker with a TPM .

Jeff Greason talks about the work of the Augustine committee at the Space Investment Summit 7 in Boston on September 30 .
( credit : J. Foust )
A committee member speaks
While many might think that the Review of US Human Space Flight Plans Committee ( better , and more simply , known as the Augustine committee after chairman Norm Augustine ) completed their work with the release of their summary report nearly a month ago , they ’re not done yet .
Still due from the committee is its final full report , which was originally planned for the end of September but now expected in the middle of October .
To that end , NASA announced late Friday that the committee would hold an additional one - hour meeting , by teleconference , this Thursday to discuss the “ finalization of scoring of options ” presented in the summary report .
“ Because we were tasked with coming up with options , we could say , when it was a political issue and not a technical issue , ‘ that ’s not our call . ’”
While their work is not yet complete , it ’s close enough to done that individual committee members are now speaking about their work and providing their own opinions about the future of NASA ’s human spaceflight plans .
A case in point is Wednesday ’s speech at the Space Investment Summit 7 in Boston by committee member Jeff Greason , cofounder and president of XCOR Aerospace .
While that would seem to be a natural forum to talk about his company and its suborbital vehicle development effort , he instead discussed his participation on the Augustine committee and the insights he took away from its work .
“ Everybody worked like dogs ” Greason said NASA ’s George Whitesides ( the current chief of staff to administrator Charles Bolden ) approached him to be on the committee .
“ Part of the reason I wanted to do it is , like many people , I ’ve been a fan of NASA and America ’s achievements in space my whole life , ” he said .
“ I would n’t be a space entrepreneur if I had n’t been fed up with NASA ’s lack of progress .
The temptation to go into the belly of the beast and look at it from the other side was very interesting . ”
Initially he was concerned about the time commitment , but was assured by Whitesides that “ it wo n’t be more than a quarter - time ” job .
Instead , he found himself working 90 - hour weeks to support the committee .
“ Right from the beginning of the program I learned about the value of NASA budget estimates , ” he joked .
That lever of effort was shared by the other members of committee , who Greason lauded in his talk .
“ I ca n’t say enough good things about the other members of the panel , ” he said .
“ Everybody worked like dogs , ” traveling around the country and working together late into the night and starting again early the next morning on a regular basis .
“ Norm Augustine , who ’s done a few of these things , said that he ’s never seen a panel work as hard . ”
One other thing that set this committee ’s work apart was the scope of its task .
Previously blue - ribbon committees “ tended to ask very narrow , focused questions ” , Greason said , while this committee was asked to provide options for human explorations .
“ It was critically important to our charter that it be options , ” he said , allowing them to sidestep political issues .
“ Because we were tasked with coming up with options , we could say , when it was a political issue and not a technical issue , ‘ that ’s not our call . ’
If there are two good technical answers let ’s put them both up and let the national policymakers make up their minds which ones they want . ”
Fixed costs and unaffordable plans
The key problem with the current “ program of record ” , as the committee called the Constellation program , is that it was based on a budget that was considerably higher than what the White House has requested and Congress has appropriated to date .
“ Talking about NASA ’s budget cuts sometimes misses the point because they never had that money to start with , they just thought they would . ”
Greason said .
If we went director to Mars “ we ’d be sorry , ” Greason concluded .
“ We ’d be Apollo all over again : we ’d get there , we ’d go a few times , and then we would stop doing it . ”
This was graphically illustrated in a chart that showed the decreasing spending plans over time , one that Greason said actually made the situation look better than it actually is .
That ’s because much of the current spending goes to fixed costs that must be accounted for but are difficult for the agency to keep track of .
“ NASA is an organization that is dominated by fixed costs .
In business terms everything is in the overhead , ” he said .
The committee found , with some effort , that the fixed cost of NASA ’s human spaceflight program is $ 6 –7 billion a year .
“ The bottom line is that they ca n’t afford to keep the doors open with they money they ’ve got , let alone do anything with it . ”
He added that , in his own opinion , it was “ a fiction ” to project budgets decades into the future , given the uncertainties about the economy , policy changes , and the like .
Any program that relies on a high budget continuously over many years is vulnerable to such changes , making it in his opinion a “ very fragile program ” that ’s unlikely to survive over the long haul .
“ The number one carryaway lesson from the Apollo program that nobody ever seems to realize is : what ’s the most important fact about the Saturn 5 ?
We do n’t have it any more , ” he said .
“ Do you know why ?
We canceled it because we could n’t afford it . ”
Those budget concerns also shaped the committee ’s thoughts about where the program should go .
While they agreed that Mars was the ideal , ultimate destination for NASA ’s human exploration efforts , they felt it was premature to go directly to the Red Planet .
“ We ’re not ready technically , ” Greason said , saying that the cost of doing human Mars missions with current technologies is “ unforeseeably large ” .
“ This is not opening the frontier , this is not expanding human civilization , ” he said .
“ This is not even Apollo on steroids .
This is Apollo from the giant insect movies . ”
“ If we did it we ’d be sorry , ” he concluded .
“ We ’d be Apollo all over again : we ’d get there , we ’d go a few times , and then we would stop doing it . ”
Benefits of the flexible path If Mars is out the picture in the foreseeable future , where should NASA be looking to go first beyond low Earth orbit ?
Many options come to mind : the Moon , near Earth objects ( NEOs ) , the moons of Mars , and Lagrange points .
First , though , Greason said it made sense to keep the International Space Station operating beyond the notional shutdown date of 2016 , in order to do technology maturation , provide a destination to support commercial services , and to practice international cooperation .
In order to build up experience for eventual missions to Mars , NASA needs to build up experience in a number of areas .
Some of them , like developing landers and learning how to do long - term operations on a planetary surface , call for a return to the Moon .
Others , such as building up experience with longer missions away from the Earth , better fit missions to NEOs or other destinations beyond cislunar space .
“ What became obvious as we thought about it is , it ’s a false choice , ” he said .
“ You ’re going to do all of these things before you go to Mars . ”
The question that ’s left then is the sequence of the missions : going back to the Moon first or going to other destinations before a return to the lunar surface .
“ From a technical perspective , they both work , and options for both appear in the final report , ” he said .
“ However , if you anticipate a world of budgetary constraint , there is a more obvious choice . ”
In - space propellant transfer “ is such a fundamental technology it ’s somewhat shocking that we do n’t have it , ” he said .
That more obvious choice — the so - called “ flexible path ” option that defers the return to the lunar surface in favor of other destinations — comes from the phasing of the costs of the program .
Returning to the Moon first requires developing landers and surface systems at the same time as core elements like the capsule and booster .
The flexible path option , though , defers the costs of the landers and surface systems : it does have some up - front costs for maneuvering stages and airlock modules , but those are much smaller than the costs of developing the lander and surface systems .
“ Unless you anticipate living in an Apollo - like era again , where NASA gets this huge infusion of funding that only lasts for a short time , ” he concluded , “ one of [ the options ] seems to lend themselves better to a budget - constrained environment than the other one . ”
Launch vehicles and propellant depots
Much of the discussion during the Augustine committee ’s deliberations this summer and in the weeks since the release of the committee ’s summary report has focused on launch vehicles , in particular the future of the Ares 1 ( see “ Is Ares 1 too little , too late ? ” , The Space Review , this issue ) as well as options for heavy lift in place of the planned Ares 5 .
The report included a variety of options , from continuing the current Constellation architecture to EELV - and shuttle - derived alternatives .
“ The launch vehicle picture is very contentious , very complicated , and we as a committee did not reach any consensus on that , and so we floated them all up to the policymakers , ” Greason said .
Greason did note that launch , like other assets , gets cheaper on a per- unit basis the more of them you buy .
A heavy - lift vehicle , he said , would be a “ NASA - unique ” vehicle that would launch only a few times .
“ If you think that all of that NASA fixed cost is a virtue , because it supports infrastructure , jobs , companies , that are important to you , ” he said , “ then that ’s a very good choice , because that justifies , and can only be maintained and operated with , the continuance and maintenance of all that infrastructure . ”
However , he said , if you ’re trying to minimize costs , it makes more sense to use a smaller launch vehicle that flies more frequently and has other users and applications .
The key to making that work for exploration architectures that require large amounts of propellant — and hence have driven the planning for heavy - lift vehicles like the Ares 5 — is the use of propellant depots and in - space propellant transfer .
“ If you use in - space propellant transfer , it ’s no longer true that you have to have a really big piece , ” he said .
Greason said a “ highlight ” of his time on the committee was its work on that topic .
“ This is such a fundamental technology it ’s somewhat shocking that we do n’t have it , ” he said .
However , the key technologies are ready to be flight - tested , if someone would take to lead to fly them .
“ There was surprise in how close to ready - to - go this is . ”
He said that while he had his own opinions on the right selection of launch vehicles , he did n’t have any insights on what direction the White House and Congress would go .
“ It ’s really up to policymakers whether we have a space program or a jobs program . ”
Time to come out of the closet A deeper issue that the choice of destinations or technologies is the reason why the US should have a human spaceflight program ( see “ The $ 3 - billion - a - year question ” , The Space Review , September 21 , 2009 ) .
“ As Norm likes to say , you need to talk about your goals in space , and the destinations are a consequence of that , but far too often they get turned the other way around , ” Greason said .
“ We are opening a new frontier for humanity , we are creating new places and making them accessible for us .
This is what the future is about . ”
Greason addressed — and rejected — some of the common justifications for human spaceflight , ranging from science to international cooperation to technology spinoffs .
Humans can be far more effective in scientific work than robots , he noted as one example , “ but that does n’t mean you can justify the space program based on the science that it does ” since other fields of research can give you “ more science than the buck ” .
“ The trap with all of these justifications is that it ’s not enough to say that if we spend money on space then we get these benefits , ” he said .
“ If you ’re justifying spending money on space because of this benefit or that benefit , you have to look not at the alternative of not doing it , you have to look at the opportunity cost : what else could you have spent that money on , and could you have gotten benefits out of that , too . ”
All these things are benefits that you get as part of having a human spaceflight program , but what , then , is the key justification for it ?
“ I knew that the reason why we go to space is because we ’re going to live there someday , ” he said .
“ We are opening a new frontier for humanity , we are creating new places and making them accessible for us .
This is what the future is about . ”
Greason said he was “ stunned ” that the rest of the committee agreed with him .
“ I never imagined that nine other people who are aerospace greybeards not only knew that but were willing to say that . ”
And then , in a line that generated an impromptu round of applause from the Boston audience : “ It ’s time for the real justification for human spaceflight to come out of the closet . ”

Inspiration is a big bother , at least when you do n't have it .
I never felt that I had anything to contribute to the Perl community until the Nordic Perl Workshop this year , when I suddenly was involved in a small way .
I 'm still involved in a small way , and only occasionally , but that works rather well .
In retrospect , my expectation that contributing would be a Big Deal turned out be wrong .
I do n't have to solve all the problems in the world , and I do n't have to solve the Big Ones , either .
It does n't even take much of my time , and this level of contribution is one that suits many people .
Inspiration comes from the impression I have that there are many more people like me , and that all those little trickles of water we add to the pool are enough to keep the more active contributors going .
What is difficult , however , is to keep up with the Iron Man blogging challenge .
I knew it would be when I got started , but I figured that there would always be something to write about without seeming too inane .
Today 's post shows that I was wrong on that count . :D

Hey Marc , I need you to make some copies , mail this letter , and , oh yea -- roll back civil equality for gay people
by Jeremy Hooper
People often ask me why I care so much about this equality fight .
For me , that question is almost offensive .
Because how could I not care about my life ?
My citizenship ?
My family ?
My country and the fair fulfillment of its laws ?
My safety on this mortal coil ?
How could I not want to stand up against the forces who threaten all these things and more ?
When I began engaging in this co-called " culture war , " I did n't do so for fun .
Heck , I had been working in the entertainment industry in the years prior .
In terms of glamour , the gay rights fight was a definite downgrade .
I also did n't do so because of outside pressure .
In fact , I would say there were more people who tried to persuade me out of " rocking the boat " than there were supporters .
And yet I 've kept it up , because I understand that the threats are very real .
The more I have learned about all of this , the more I have to offer .
So on my own free will , I choose to share my knowledge with the world , hoping to spark positive change for a community that has been denied justice for far too long .
So why do I tell you all this ?
Well , because I was startled to read the following little nugget in a new Washington Post article :
[ Jesse Connolly 's ] conservative counterpart , Marc Mutty , plays more to type .
The chairman of Stand for Marriage Maine said he agreed to lead the opposition campaign " because my boss told me to . "
His boss is Richard Malone , bishop of the Portland Roman Catholic diocese , which has unequivocally thrown itself into the election , going so far as to pass around collection plates at Sunday Masses to fund the campaign .
For Gay Marriage , the Maine Event Is Low - Key [ Wa Po ]
" Because my boss told me to " ?!
" Because my boss told me to " ?!
" BECAUSE MY BOSS TOLD ME TO " ?!
Surely there is some jest in Mr. Mutty 's answer ; but I suspect there is a majority share of truth .
And that truth shows one of the clear differences between our two sides !
Look , we gay folk do n't want this fight .
I 've always said that my greatest accomplishment would be to render my work irrelevant .
However , we LGBTs ( and allies ) have no choice BUT to push back , since folks like Bishop Malone are telling people like Marc Mutty that they have to attack LGBT lives and loves , because that is what God would want them to do .
Instead of dedicating the considerable time , money , and manpower to embolden actual societal goods / combat actual societal ills , scores of faith - based figures ( like Malone ) have created a cottage industry built entirely around keeping LGBT people stigmatized .
And so for people like Marc Mutty , this is just another day at the office .
He says " my boss told me to " with the same complacent ease that most workers reserve for the times that they have to run out and grab their superior a cup of coffee .
Well eventhough these constant attacks on our existences might make our blood hotter that the aforementioned scalding beverage , the stripping of our civil rights is not just another menial office task .
If Marc Mutty truly is fighting to rollback marriage equality in Maine simple because his boss told him to use his personal religious views to take away others ' civil liberties , then that may be an accomplishment he wants to leave off his resumé .
That is , if he hopes to move on to an employer who places productivity above inefficient , costly , injurious time - wasters .
**
* NOTE : Be sure to read the full WaPo piece .
It 's a good take on the Maine fight .
Your thoughts
Sounds like the Catholic Church needs to be reporting some " in kind " contributions to the campaign ??
If MacNutty is on their payroll , and is more than likely spending most ( if not all ) of his time working on a political campaign , that sounds like a campaign contribution to me .
And , unless the actual campaign is reimbursing the Catholics for his salary expense , then to me it sounds like the church is taking tax - exempt receipts and using them for non -tax - exempt purposes .
If that is n't illegal , then it should be !
Posted by : Dick Mills | Oct 9 , 2009 8:47:13 AM
I do n't understand this description of Catholic fund - raising from the pews :
One of the churchgoers , Gwen De Cicco , 38 , of Portland , said she had seen envelopes left on the pews at another church across town , soliciting donations for the campaign .
The small print on the envelope notified parishioners that these donations were not tax deductible .
So , the money collected by the church is going to SFMM ?
And will eventually be reported as a lump sum from the diocese ?
Does n't that make the church a PAC ?
Or , are the envelopes delivered en masse to SFMM ?
So , individual checks should be accounted for ?
I know these questions are being asked elsewhere by smarter people than me ...
I just had n't considered the mechanics before .

Bose :
They have it all down to a science .
In California , there were strict instructions given to pastors about what kind of envelopes to use , how to use them , where to send them .
They have it all figured out so they can * just barely * get around the laws .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Oct 9 , 2009 5:17:38 PM
My guess is that when he said " my boss told me to , " he was not referring to the bishop .
He was talking about the Boss Upstairs .
Though oddly enough , Jesus never mentioned much about homosexuality ...
Posted by : Rook | Oct 9 , 2009 6:17:34 PM
Bose , the only way that a church can get away with " taking up a special offering " for a political advocacy campaign , is to have donors place contributions in sealed envelopes , and deliver the unopened envelopes to the campaign .
Any checks in those envelopes must be made out to the campaign , and not to the church , and any contributions over a certain dollar amount ( I think in Maine it is $ 50 ) must include the identifying information about the donor - and that identifying information along with the amount of the donation must be disclosed publicly .
Of course , that is the only " legal " way for them to do it , and that does n't necessarily mean that they are strictly obeying the law .
If the church lends employees , office equipment , or any other church supplied services , equipment , or supplies to the campaign , those contributions are considered to be in - kind donations .
In kind donations are supposed to be reported to the IRS , and are " technically " subject to severe limitations .
But , the IRS has n't ever defined what those limitations really are .
I personally , believe that any church that provides any services to any political campaign should be required to disclose each and every expense .
And that each of those expenses should be taxable at twice the corporate tax rates .
This would incentivise the formation of PACs for churches that want to enter political races , and force them to obey campaign finance laws , and necessitate the adherence to arms - length arrangements between the PAC and the church .
And , that 's the way it should be .
I also believe that failure to obey the disclosure laws should result in fines of no less than 5 times the contributed amount , and serious criminal repercussions .
Churches should never ( NEVER ) be allowed to get away with utilizing tax - exempt donations for taxable electioneering PERIOD !
And , now , they get away with doing that far too often .
But , that 's just me , and who the fuck am I .

I used to think of Google as a friend in my personal battle against spam .
The company has done an exceptional job of keeping my inbox free of unwanted pharmaceutical ads .
Unfortunately , I ’ve recently come to realize that Google may have a double standard when it comes to physical junk mail .
Over the past few weeks I ’ve received several marketing letters from Google by way of the U.S. postal service .
Each letter was unremarkable by itself .
Each included an identical offer of credit towards the Google AdWords service .
The only thing notable about these letters is that each one was addressed to :
Monday February
Captain Copyright Has Left the Building
Medialoper
If I understand this correctly , someone at Google thinks that Monday February is a person who works in the Captain Copyright Has Left the Building department at Medialoper .
The first time around I found the letter amusing .
The second time I began to wonder how a Google bot could make such a careless parsing error .
By the time I received the third letter I became convinced that something truly odd was happening .
I did , in fact , write an article titled Captain Copyright Has Left the Building , published on Monday February 5th , 2007 .
It seems pretty obvious that Google is using a program to crawl websites in search of data to feed into a mailing list for marketing purposes .
Spammers do this sort of thing all the time .
It ’s called address harvesting and Google considers it a very bad thing .
Unfortunately Google appears to have an address harvester of its own , and a broken one at that .
While harvesting physical mailing addresses from the web is n’t technically illegal ( at least not that I ’m aware of ) it is certainly against the spirit of Google ’s ongoing effort to fight spam .
I contacted Matt Cutts , head of Google ’s web spam team , via Twitter for comment .
So far the only answer I ’ve received is that “ people are still checking on it “ .
I ’ll be interested in hearing what those people have to say , because it sure looks like Google is engaging in the same practices that it claims to be fighting in its war on spam .
A food production expert says Australia may face a massive famine if governments fail to address an impending global food shortage .
A conference of food productivity experts in Sydney this week heard the greatest threat to the world is not climate change , but food production on land and in the water .
Science communicator Julian Cribb , an adjunct professor at the University of Technology Sydney , made a keynote address at the seminar saying there is expected to be about 9.2 billion people in the world in 2050 , barring wars or major accidents .
But Professor Cribb says that population will create an alarming problem - there simply will not be enough food to go round .
" Basically what the world has not noticed is that hunger has been sneaking up on us for quite a while , " he told ABC News Online .
" Population is growing and demand for food is rising .
" Governments have had it so good for so long - the world has had plenty of food - they have become complacent and ignorant .
" Climate change is going to get worse and worse , but the food problems are going to be in the next two to three decades .
" I 'm warning now because it takes about a generation to develop new technologies and get them out broadscale .
We need to take action now about these things . "
Treasury head Ken Henry this week said that Australia 's population growth is the biggest challenge to Commonwealth and state governments since Federation .
Professor Cribb agrees it will cause problems , and says governments must not forget future famine goes hand in hand with population growth .
" They have grossly underestimated the potential for population growth in Australia , " he said .
" If you get a major collapse in food supply in an area like the north China plains or the Indo - Gangetic plains , there will be hundreds of millions of refugees cut lose so we could easily see 20 or 30 million refugees arrive in Australia over a couple of years .
" That 's going to completely alter any plans we might have for a managed population growth .
" This is quite a dangerous situation .
We may be OK for food , but if others are not , we will cop the backwash . "
He says a range of issues have sparked current food production problems .
" Apart from the obvious things going on in the world food markets , there 's a colossal shortage of water emerging because cities worldwide are pinching the farmers ' water , " he said .
" There 's land degradation that 's proceeded unabated for about 30 or 40 years now .
We 're losing land at the rate of 1 per cent of the world 's farmland every year .
" We 're running into energy shortages , we 're running into shortages of fertilisers , and on top of that you 've got climate change .
All of these things are making the agricultural environment much less certain . "
Professor Cribb says governments should be doing a range of things now to fix the problem .
" They need to focus on recycling water and nutrients , putting more science into agriculture to get farmers better technology , stopping cities from stealing farmers ' land and water , paying farmers a better price so that they do n't destroy the environment that produces the food and opening up free trade in agriculture , " he said .
" We really need to get on to this .
Australia is as much to blame as any other country for neglecting its agricultural science .
Let 's face it , this is what keeps the people fed .
" So if you neglect that , you neglect the first and most important thing for any country . "
Staff and friends at a furniture depot in Tewkesbury , South - west England have attempted to break the world record for mattress dominoes .
The short film has been a huge hit on video sharing sites on the internet and has even featured on American network news .
The group managed to topple 41 dominoes .
It is unclear if that is a record , but it certainly gives a new twist to the phrase " hitting the sack " .

Dr. Daniel Schultz , who has been FDA ’s chief medical device official , is the first high ranking FDA official whose controversial device approvals have resulted in his leaving the agency " by mutual consent . "
Earlier this year , nine scientists spoke up to incoming President Obama that they had concerns about how medical devices were approved without adequate checks for effectiveness and safety .
Read more :
The approvals had been issued by Dr. Schultz , over the objections of FDA scientists .
Dr. Janet Woodcock , director of the FDA ’s all - powerful , Center for Drug Evaluation and Research ( CDER ) , is under investigation by the Inspector General .
The investigation was commenced after an ethics complaint was filed by Amphastar Pharmaceuticals Inc. which charges that Dr. Woodcock has a conflict of interest favoring its competitor , Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc .
Both companies seek approval for the generic version of the drug , Lovenox , a blood thinner with multi-billion - dollar sales .
The Wall Street Journal reports ( below ) that Dr. Woodcock ’ close contacts with Momenta in the middle of a drug- approval process were ( to say the least ) ethically questionable .
Morgan Stanley characterized the Woodcock / Momenta connection as a " game changer " whereupon Momenta ’s stock jumped 17 % in a day .
It is further reported that Dr. Woodcock co-authored journal articles with Momenta scientists , then co-authored two medical journal articles last year that won scientific — as well as Wall Street — kudos for Momenta .
The WSJ notes : " It is unusual for FDA officials to co-author journal articles with industry researchers , though the FDA said it encourages publication in journals in collaboration with noted scientists .
Dr. Woodcock , who joined the FDA about 20 years ago , has done so only a handful of times in recent years .
In addition , this instance occurred in the middle of a drug- approval process . "
Another high ranking FDA official , Dr. Thomas Laughren , FDA ’s director of psychiatry products , overruled FDA ’s team of safety officers , much as Dr. Schultz did :
On April 29 , 2007 , Dr. Laughren issued an approvable letter to Eli Lilly for pediatric use of Zyprexa ( olanzapine ) – despite serious concerns about the integrity of the data obtained in Russia .
Dr. Thomas Laughren has been in a pivotal high ranking position at FDA ’s powerful CDER center that has authority over the review and drug approval process since 1983 .
Throughout his tenure at the FDA Dr. Laughren has maintained close ongoing collaborative ties with pharmaceutical industry officials and industry financed psychiatrists in academia and professional associations .
Dr. Laughren has participated in influential industry sponsored consensus panels convened by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry ( AACAP ) that recommended expanded use of psychotropic drugs - primarily SSRI antidepressants and the so - called ‘ atypical ’ antipsychotics - for unapproved , off - label uses in children .
The Alliance for Human Research Protection has compiled a list of influential journal articles , a book chapter , and industry sponsored consensus statements that list Dr. Laughren as co-author–thereby greatly enhancing their influence .
Dr. Laughren participated in consensus forums whose purpose was to influence regulatory policy and / or expanded use of psychotropic drugs and to influence practice guidelines .
His name and position are penned to articles whose authors include Eli Lilly ’s chief medical officer , and unabashed industry - subsidized drug promoters - even a convicted felon .
For more than a decade Dr. Laughren endorsed industry ’s denials that SSRI antidepressants increased the suicide risk for consumers .
He dismissed safety concerns raised by FDA medical reviewers : instead , he penned his name to articles and consensus statements that recommended broadening the criteria for diagnosing psychiatric illness and expanded use of SSRI antidepressants , antipsychotics , and combinations .
For example , Dr. Laughren ’s name is penned to consensus statements recommending broadening the criteria for pediatric bipolar disorder .
Such an endorsement by Dr. Laughren provides an authoritative green light to physicians to prescribe antipsychotics –the most hazardous drugs in pharmacopoeia for children–even as the drugs had not been approved for children .
Dr. Laughren not only co-authored major articles promoting industry ’s marketing goals but his name is penned to an apparently ghostwritten article :
" Mood Disorders in the Medically Ill : Scientific Review and Recommendations , " published by the Journal of the Society of Biological Psychiatry , 2005 .
The article promotes the notion that depression accompanies practically all patients with medical illnesses - e.g. , cardiovascular disease , cancer , AIDS , Alzheimer ’s , Parkinson ’s , Diabetes , Osteoporosis , Obesity , and Pain .
Dr. Laughren , a co-author , recommends the use of antidepressants for presumed underlying depression , even claiming that " SSRIs may be cardioprotective . "
Dr. Laughren ’s name has lent the appearance of legitimacy of what is clearly industry propaganda that has no basis in science or evidence - based medicine .
See , AHRP letter of complaint addressed to the former FDA commissioner , Dr. Andrew vonEschenbach ( June 2007 )
and a follow - up letter ( April 2008 ) at : https://www.ahrp.org/cms/images/stories/articles/fda-double-agent2008.pdf
Dr. Schultz , Dr. Woodcock , and Dr. Laughren are among top echelon FDA officials who have held sway for years , serving the interest of the industry they are supposed to regulate .
These pivotal FDA officials–and several others –have approved unsafe–indeed , dangerous–prescription drugs and medical devices disregarding the recommendations of the agency ’s safety scientists .
The beneficiaries of ill - considered FDA marketing approvals have been drug and device manufacturers , while the American public has been badly served : millions have suffered serious harm , hundreds of thousands have died as a result of poorly reviewed FDA - licensed drugs and devices .
See : QuarterWatch analysis of FDA adverse event reports for the third quarter of 2008 – bear in mind that adverse events reported to the FDA comprise only between 1 % and 10 % :
" During the third quarter of 2008 the FDA received 24,872 serious adverse drug event reports identifying 854 different drugs .
For the third quarter of 2008 reported serious , disabling adverse drug events were 30.5 % higher than the same quarter one year ago .
There were 2,778 patient deaths , 1,162 cases of disability and 20,932 cases of other kinds of serious injury .
Reported patient deaths in the third quarter were 41 % higher than the same quarter in the previous year .

British National Party leader Nick Griffin may be asked to appear on Question Time , the BBC said today .
A spokesman for the broadcaster said it was bound by rules to treat all political parties with " due impartiality " .
No representatives of the far - right BNP - which was elected to the European Parliament in June - have appeared on the political debate show before .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The BBC said it was talking to other parties about the move , some of whom had previously refused to share a platform with the BNP because of its policies on race .
Other smaller parties elected to the European Parliament , such as the Green Party and Ukip , have been represented on Question Time .
A spokesman for the broadcaster said : " The BBC is obliged to treat all political parties registered with the Electoral Commission and operating within the law with due impartiality . "
" Due impartiality is achieved both by ensuring appropriate scrutiny for each party and by the appearances of a range of politicians across a series of programmes .
" Our audiences - and the electorate - will make up their own minds about the different policies offered by elected politicians . "
An analysis of public opinion polls and terrorist activity in 143 pairs of countries has shown for the first time that when people in one country hold negative views toward the leadership and policies of another , terrorist acts are more likely to be carried out .
Princeton University economist Alan Krueger and co-author Jitka Malečková of Charles University in the Czech Republic have found that there is a strong relationship between attitudes expressed toward a foreign country -- indicated in surveys on foreign leaders ' performance -- and the occurrence of terrorism against that country .
The research is detailed in the Sept. 18 issue of the journal Science .
" Public opinion appears to be a useful predictor of terrorist activity , " said Krueger , the Bendheim Professor in Economics and Public Policy .
He has held a joint appointment since 1987 in Princeton 's Department of Economics and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs .
" This is the first study to relate public opinion across countries to concrete actions such as terrorism , " he added .
Until now , the notion that public attitudes can contribute to terrorism has been inadequately explored , Krueger noted .
The study 's findings are significant , he said , because public opinion provides a valuable early warning signal of terrorism and helps researchers better understand the causes of terrorism .
The researchers carried out their study by mining public opinion polls of residents in 19 countries in the Middle East and northern Africa conducted by Gallup .
Respondents were asked whether they approved of the job performance of the leaders of nine large countries .
Those countries , selected because they are world powers in terms of size , population or military strength , are the United States , Canada , China , France , Germany , India , Japan , Russia and the United Kingdom .
The opinions , both positive and negative , were then linked to the number of terrorist attacks conducted against the nine world powers by people from the 19 countries between 2004 and 2008 .
The terror attacks were compiled by the National Counterterrorism Center .
In findings that are consistent with his earlier work , Krueger said there is not a direct connection between poverty and terrorism , contrary to a popular view .
Economic status has more to do with target countries than it does with the states where the attacks originate , according to Krueger .
Countries with advanced economies as well as a high degree of civil liberties , he said , are most likely to be the targets of terrorism .
The study does not explain whether terrorists act in response to public opinion or whether they are simply reacting just like the larger public to external events , he noted .
In either case , however , he noted that public opinion surveys can provide a powerful indication of the likelihood of terrorist activity .
Krueger hypothesized that greater disapproval of another country 's leaders or policies may result in more terrorist acts because it increases the number of people who provide material support and encouragement for terrorism , and increases the number of people interested in joining cells and carrying out terrorist acts themselves .
Extending the analysis , the researchers proposed that new leadership and policies in a country -- such as the election of President Barack Obama in the United States -- might change opinions in other countries and alter terrorist activity .
Krueger has published many papers about the origins of terrorism , and he has urged terrorism experts to apply the rigorous techniques of social science to questions concerning terrorism and its effects .
###
Krueger is currently on leave from Princeton , working as the assistant secretary for economic policy and chief economist at the U.S. Department of Treasury .
The research was conducted while Krueger was at Princeton and submitted before he assumed his position with the government .
The contents of the paper do not necessarily reflect the views of the U.S. government .
Work on the project was partly supported by a grant from the European Commission to the European Security Economics project .
The founder of a Roman Catholic religious order that ran retreat centers for troubled priests warned American bishops in forceful letters dating back to 1952 that pedophiles should be removed from the priesthood because they could not be cured .
The Rev. Gerald M. C. Fitzgerald , founder of the order , Servants of the Paraclete , delivered the same advice in person to Vatican officials in Rome in 1962 and to Pope Paul VI a year later , according to the letters , which were unsealed by a judge in the course of litigation against the church .
The documents contradict the most consistent defense given by bishops about the sexual abuse scandal : that they were unaware until recently that offenders could not be rehabilitated and returned to the ministry .
Father Fitzgerald , who died in 1969 , even made a $ 5,000 down payment on a Caribbean island where he planned to build an isolated retreat to sequester priests who were sexual predators .
His letters show he was driven by a desire to save the church from scandal , and to save laypeople from being victimized .
He wrote to dozens of bishops , saying that he had learned through experience that most of the abusers were unrepentant , manipulative and dangerous .
He called them “ vipers . ”

Michele Bachmann holds a fundraising lead over the two Democrats challenging her in a 6th Congressional District race on pace to be pricier than 2008 .
Required campaign reports filed Thursday have Bachmann sitting on a $ 617,000 stockpile with a year to go , more than the incumbent had at this point in 2007 .
But the two Democrats vying to take Bachmann on are also raising money at a more rapid clip than her past opponents .
Dr. Maureen Reed has $ 311,000 in the bank and State Sen. Tarryl Clark has $ 270,000 at the ready .
All sides expect the figures to multiply .
Bachmann and her chief rival spent more than $ 5.7 million in the last campaign and outside groups kicked in another $ 1 million independently .

Knowing how to choose fresh fish or seafood is a vital skill for a seafood cook .
Unless you caught the fish yourself , you need to check the signs to ensure it 's fresh .
Buying fresh fish is easy if you know what to look for .
The Spruce Eats / Chloe Giroux
Whole Fish
Look for bright , clear eyes .
The eyes are the window to a truly fresh fish , for they fade quickly into gray dullness .
Dull - eyed fish may be safe to eat , but they are past their prime .
Next , look at the fish .
Does it shine ?
Does it look metallic and clean ?
Or has it dulled or have discolored patches on it ?
If so , it is marginal .
Smell it .
A fresh fish should smell like clean water , or a touch briny or even like cucumbers .
Under no circumstances should you buy a nasty smelling fish .
Cooking wo n't improve it .
Look at the gills , which should be a rich red .
If the fish is old , they will turn the color of faded brick .
Fish Fillets
Look for vibrant flesh .
All fish fade as they age .
If the fillet still has skin , that skin should look as pristine as the skin on an equally good whole fish — shiny and metallic .
The smell test is especially important with fillets .
They should have no pungent aromas .
Is there liquid on the meat ?
If so , that liquid should be clear , not milky .
Milky liquid on a fillet is the first stage of rot .
If the fishmonger lets you , press the meat with your finger .
It should be resilient enough so your indentation disappears .
If your fingerprint remains , move on .
Live Fish
The best way to choose a live fish or crab or lobster is to look for signs of life .
Is it scampering around in its tank ?
Swimming happily ?
Or is it sulking in a corner or hanging motionless and panting ?
If so , do n’t buy it .
Lobsters and crabs starve themselves in tanks and often can be almost empty inside when you crack open one that ’s been imprisoned in a tank for weeks .
Your best bet is to make friends with the fishmonger and find out when the new shipments arrive .
Plan on being there to meet it and buy it then .
You will be rewarded for your extra effort .
Shellfish
Buy only at the finest fish markets .
These are the places where turnover is so rapid you can be assured of fresh mussels , clams or oysters .
You may still get a dead one , but the ratio will be far lower .
What is a dead one ?
Shellfish are sold alive , so they should react to you .
Put them on the countertop and back away for a moment .
Then tap the shell :
It should close tighter than it was .
Oysters are a little tough to do this with , but clams and mussels will definitely react .
You can also tell a dead shellfish after you ’ve cooked them all .
Dead ones do not open after being cooked .
Throw them away .
Scallops are a special case .
Scallops are almost always sold shucked , so what you are looking for are “ dry packed ” scallops , meaning they are not shipped and stored in brine .
Those scallops you see wallowing in milky ick ?
Leave them be .
Better to buy frozen , vacuum - sealed scallops , which are perfectly good by the way , than an inferior wet - packed scallop .
Shrimp are easy .
Buy them whole and frozen .
Whole because the shell protects them from the rigors of being frozen without losing too much moisture , and frozen because shrimp cook ( and rot ) very rapidly .
Should you be near a shrimping region or have access to truly magnificent fresh shrimp , by all means , buy them with the head on if possible .
Why ?
Because head - on shrimp stay moister .
Remember : Nothing says boring like a dry , overcooked shrimp .
All the information about shrimp applies to crayfish , too .
Unless you can get them live , in which case , follow the instructions for lobsters or crabs .
Squid or octopus are almost always sold to the wholesaler pre-frozen , so you should buy them frozen .
Both squid , commonly known as calamari and its more richly flavored cousin the octopus , freeze exceptionally well .
Again , if you can buy squid and octopus not to mention cuttlefish fresh , do it !
They are rare treats even at fine fish markets and should be appreciated as such .
Like finfish , you should look first at their eyes , which should be clean and bright .
The Fish Market
When it comes to the shop itself , the absolute bottom line is that a fish shop should not stink .
If you walk into a fish market and it reeks , turn around and leave .
Fantastic fish can be had at a farmer ’s market stall , a hole in the wall or in a flashy boutique , but none should smell like low tide .
Ever .
The murder of Jasmine Fiore has triggered an international manhunt
US police investigating a gruesome murder near Los Angeles identified the mutilated victim by a serial number on her breast implants , prosecutors say .
The naked body of Jasmine Fiore , a 28 - year - old former model , was found in a suitcase a week ago .
Detectives were unable to use dental records or fingerprints , as her teeth and fingers had been removed .
But they tracked the number of her implants .
Her husband , a reality - show contestant , has been charged with her murder .
Ryan Alexander Jenkins , 32 , had reported his wife missing , but then disappeared himself .
Police believe he may have fled to his native Canada .
He was taking part in the show Megan Wants a Millionaire .
Described as an investment banker , Mr Jenkins was one of several wealthy young men trying to win the affections of a young woman in the show .
The TV channel VH1 cancelled the series after he was identified as a suspect .
Ms Fiore had no connection with the show , but she and Mr Jenkins had married in Las Vegas in March .
Media reports say she had sought to annul the marriage .
Suspect 's boat found
Ms Fiore 's mangled body was found in a suitcase in a metal trash bin in Buena Park , south of Los Angeles , on 15 August .
US authorities have offered a $ 25,000 reward for information leading to Mr Jenkins ' arrest and Canadian police have issued a nationwide warrant for his arrest .
After several days of searching , police found his boat more than 950 miles ( 1,500 km ) north of Los Angeles - in the town of Point Roberts on the Canadian border .
Mr Jenkins is believed to have friends and family in several Canadian cities .
But it will be hard for him to hide in Canada , as his name and face have been splashed across newspapers and TV in recent days , the BBC's Ian Gunn in Vancouver says .
Passengers on a domestic Air Canada flight on Friday reported seeing the suspect on the plane , but police later said the passenger was not Mr Jenkins , our correspondent says .
The Michigan man behind a massive iPod repair and return scam will soon be thinking about his actions in a jail cell .
Twenty - three - year - old Nicholas Woodhams , also known as the " iPod Mechanic , " was sentenced to 13 months in prison this week after pleading guilty to mail fraud and money laundering charges earlier this year .
In addition to jail time , Woodhams was ordered to pay $ 648,568 in restitution to Apple as well as $ 8,066.85 to the US Postal Service , according to the US Attorney General 's Office .
Apple filed a lawsuit against Woodhams in July of 2008 for defrauding the company out of numerous iPod shuffles and other iPod repairs .
The company accused Woodhams of exploiting Apple 's advance replacement system for the iPod shuffle , reselling the new devices through his own website .
Additionally , Woodhams exploited Apple 's iPod Warranty Service Program to get repairs on iPods that were out of warranty .
Less than a year later , prosecutors in Michigan filed criminal charges against Woodhams , alleging that he committed fraud and laundered money as a part of his scam .
In April of this year , Woodhams must have been scared enough to try and come up with a plea bargain , admitting that he was guilty for the criminal charges .
That brings us to where we are today : Woodhams was sentenced by US District Judge Robert Holmes Bell to prison time plus restitution on Tuesday of this week .
In addition to all of the above , Woodhams was also forced to forfeit about $ 750,000 worth of ill - gotten gains , including a house in Michigan , an Audi S4 , an Ariel Atom 2 , a Honda motorcycle , and more than half a million dollars in cold , hard cash .
For those keeping track , that 's a grand total of about $ 1,406,634.85 ( or so ) that Woodhams will be forking over to everyone involved .
For someone who is only 23 , that 's a hefty price to pay for what originated as an easy way to make a buck on the Internet .
The libel lawyer Peter Carter - Ruck , who died on Friday , had a chilling effect on the media .
He was a chancer , out for the maximum fee .
And he did for freedom of speech what the Boston Strangler did for door - to - door salesmen .
Until Carter - Ruck got his teeth into the libel law , actions were infrequent and inexpensive .
But from the 1950s , Carter - Ruck became the leading libel lawyer and clients sought him out .
He honed his menacing letters to encourage socialites to sue for imagined slights and fashion a weapon for politicians to suppress hostile stories .
He preferred the bludgeon of the writ to the rather more effective call to an editor preferred by Lord Goodman .
He established the idea that libel law was complicated and merited very high fees .
In the process he became very rich .
" I like to bill the clients as the tears are flowing , " he told me .
Libel was good to him : four homes , a Rolls - Royce and a string of yachts called Fair Judgement .
But perniciously he built a libel factory , paid for by the media 's legal and insurance bills .
Carter - Ruck had some novel techniques .
You could only settle a libel action by paying his exorbitant fees without any question of the bill being checked by the court .
He hit upon the wheeze of Randolph Churchill retaining all the libel QCs to prevent them acting for Private Eye ( a practice since banned ) and of serial libel actions , as in the case of Princess Elizabeth of Toro ( which brought us the term " Ugandan discussions " ) .
His practice had rightwing connections .
With Carter - Ruck at the helm , the firm of Oswald Hickson Collier acted for the Conservative party and the likes of Norman Tebbit and Cecil Parkinson .
In his memoirs he praised the rightwing financier Sir James Goldsmith for alleviating the injustice of the lack of legal aid with money from a foundation .
He said it let solicitors assess cases in the same way as the Legal Aid Board would .
However , the assessor was none other than Carter - Ruck , and his firm was paid , win or lose .
The beneficiaries tended not to be widows and orphans but rightwing politicos such as Neil Hamilton , who trousered £ 20,000 from the BBC for a Panorama programme - Carter - Ruck 's bill was £ 240,000 .
The Goldsmith Foundation 's other beneficiaries included Brian Crozier , a cold war enthusiast with intelligence links , and an official of the breakaway Union of Democratic Mineworkers who sued Arthur Scargill .
Once described as the Margaret Thatcher of defamation law , Carter - Ruck was a conviction libel lawyer .
If he acted for the plaintiff , he thought it the most outrageous libel ; if for the defendant , the case should never have been bought .
The common thread was to extract the maximum .
Carter - Ruck had one row after another with his partners .
In 1977 they tried to boot him out and after four years ' litigation were successful when he decamped to another part of the same building to form Peter Carter - Ruck & Partners .
Within four years all his founding partners had left , including his daughter .
I left his firm in pure Carter - Ruck circumstances .
Heinemann , for whom we acted , was publishing a book about the Ford family , by Robert Lacey .
I was told by Carter - Ruck that there was no conflict in our advising .
Lacey sent part of the book to Henry Ford for comment .
Later I found Carter - Ruck advising
Ford that the book was full of libel .
He proved unable to give a truthful explanation .
Cases brought by Tudor Roberts , a solicitor , and the journalist Derek Jameson illustrate the Carter - Ruck techniques .
In 1985 Roberts was awarded £ 20,000 damages against Private Eye plus costs on the higher scale .
I agreed before I left Carter - Ruck 's firm that he would only pay the costs recoverable from Private Eye.
Carter - Ruck , however , billed Roberts £ 60,000 .
The cost judge allowed only £ 18,567 .
My assurance was ignored .
Carter Ruck wanted the lot .
It was two years before Roberts was reimbursed his damages and the legal costs he had earlier paid .
Derek Jameson , as a tabloid editor , had been unwisely advised to sue the BBC over a satirical sketch .
Carter - Ruck said Jameson would get £ 25,000 - £ 50,000 .
David Eady QC advised Carter - Ruck in writing that Jameson accept the £ 10 that the BBC had offered in settlement plus his costs .
Carter - Ruck concealed this opinion from Jameson .
Jameson lost the case and was sent a bill by Carter Ruck for £ 41,342.50 .
When he learned by chance of the QC 's pessimistic advice , Carter - Ruck told him a string of lies .

Updates to Team Fortress 2 have been released .
The updates will be applied automatically when your Steam client is restarted .
The specific changes include :
On Thursday , RIM and Verizon announced the long - rumored BlackBerry Storm2 9550 .
RIM did n't just add a new coat of paint and a few software tweaks with the new device .
We 've spelled out five of the key improvements between the original Storm and Storm2 .
On Thursday , RIM and Verizon announced the long - rumored .
RIM did n't just add a new coat of paint and a few software tweaks with the new device .
Finally , the innovative touchscreen smartphone just works , and just a few key deficiencies kept it from earning an Editor 's Choice award .
After getting our hands on it ( ) , we 've decided it 's a great device and the phone RIM should have released the first time out .
What has been improved ?
Here are five big differences between the Storm and Storm2 .
1 ) A vastly improved touchscreen : Let 's just say it : the first Storm 's touch screen was weird .
When it came out , people could n't stop talking about its odd clicking touch screen that provided haptic feedback .
It was like pushing down on a physical button , and yet it was n't .
Not compared to a keyboard , anyway .
The Storm2's screen has a lot of similarities to the original , but now RIM has placed four electrical actuators under the screen ( one for each corner ) .
This makes the screen more responsive and better for typing .
2 ) A lot less bugs :
When the was released last November , the unit was buggy as heck .
We ran into many problems during testing , and users complained that the software felt incomplete .
Six months after the release , RIM and Verizon fixed most of the bugs with .
Fortunately , the Storm2 should n't have this problem , and the subsequent bad buzz because most of the kinks have already been worked out .
( There are still a few bugs , mind you , but nothing drastic . )
3 ) Multi-touch : Since the iPhone 3GS is now the standard all touch - screen smartphones live up to , the addition of multi- touch to the Storm2 is important .
It 's not full multi- touch , but it 's a good start .
For example , you can copy and paste text by holding two fingers on both ends .
4 ) Wi-Fi : While Verizon 's 3G network is pretty peppy and far - reaching , people complained when the first Storm did n't have Wi-Fi while the BlackBerry Bold did .
Most major devices these days add Wi-Fi to be taken more seriously as a computing platform , so it 's good to see it on the Storm2 .
5 ) Bottom - edge speakerphone :
The original Storm had its speakerphone molded into its aluminum back panel .
This was an unfortunate design problem ; if you wanted to do anything on the touch screen while on speakerphone , well , too bad .
The Storm2's speakerphone is on the bottom edge of the phone , allowing users to talk on the phone while using the touch screen .
It read : " Whether you subscribe to the theological or secular explanation , the 7.6 - magnitude quake that killed more than 1,100 people came on the eve of the multi-billion - rupiah inauguration ball for newly elected members of the House of Representatives and the Regional Representative Council in Jakarta . "
The Logic of Inquiry : Rhetorical Devices ___________________
Both inductive and deductive arguments , even when properly formed , may result in invalid conclusions if the terms of the argument are not properly formed .
The study of these sorts of errors ( called  fallacies  ) is called rhetoric .
There are seven main fallacies : Fallacy of Relevance :
The argument does not relate to the issue it is supposed to be addressing .
Ad hominem ( personal attack ) 
If you cant argue the case , argue against the person making the case 
Ad bellum ( appeal to force ) 
Might makes right .
Ad ignorantium ( appeal to ignorance  ) 
You cant prove its not true , so I m right ,  or , as Bart Simpson puts it ,  I did nt do it .
Nobody saw me .
You cant prove it .
Ad misericordium ( appeal to pity  ) 
If you dont fund this project , hundreds of people will be thrown out of work . 
Ad populum ( appeal to the gallery  ) 
All the polls support this position . 
Ad vericundium ( appeal to authority  ) Smith & Jones ( 1997 ) say this is the way to go . 
Post hoc , ergo propter hoc ( false cause  )
The Latin words mean  It came after this , so it must be because of this .
For example ,  Students moved in , and there went the neighborhood .
Accident & Hasty Generalization :
This fallacy occurs by moving from the group to the individual ( when the group characteristic is not universal ) , and from the particular to the universal .
For example ,  People in this neighborhood have incomes above $ 100,000 ; you live in this neighborhood , so your income must be above $ 100,000  may or may not be true it depends on whether the group characteristic ( income above $ 100,000 ) is a universal ( in order to live in this neighborhood , you must have an income above $ 100,000 ) or a generalization ( the average income in this neighborhood is above $ 100,000  ) .
Similarly ,  This crow is black , so all crows are black may or may not be true if all birds in the family crow must have black feathers , then it is true ; but if the color of the feathers is accidental ( e.g. , can there be albino crows ? ) , then it is not .
Complex Question :
This fallacy occurs when two ( or more ) questions are combined into one , such as  Have you stopped beating your children yet ? 
This assumes two questions 
Have you ever beaten your children ? and  If so , have you stopped beating your children ? 
Begging the Question :
This fallacy occurs when the answer to a question assumes what the question was asking in the first place , rather than providing proof ( circular reasoning ) .
For example ,  Your work does not meet performance standareds because it is unsatisfactory . 
( And why is it unsatisfactory ?
Because it fails to meet performance standards ! ) .
Irrelevant Conclusion :
This is similar to begging the question , except that a conclusion is offered which appears to answer the question , but it does not necessarily come from the data which were offered in evidence .
For example ,  Look at all the effort I am putting forth ; of course Im an effective manager !  ( as if effort and effectiveness were the same thing ) .
Fallacy of Ambiguity : A shift in the meaning of the middle term creates the appearance of a valid argument : Equivocation :
The same term is used , but with different meanings (  All men are mortal .
Jane is not a man .
Therefore Jane is not a mortal .)
Amphiboly :
The grammatical structure itself permits different meanings (  Time flies like an arrow ; fruit flies like an apple  )
Accent : Emphasis changes the meaning ( You did something right !  implying that you usually dont ) .
Excerpted from URSI 609 -- Applied Quantitative Analysis by Tony Filipovitch
( The claim that there are seven main types of fallacies , followed by a listing of only six is how it appears in the original .
I 'm not sure if this is a gaffe , a clever joke , or an example of one of the types of fallacies ( Perhaps a fallacy of ommission . )
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
After a heady week on a high - stakes world stage , President Obama returned to America 's messiest political mosh pit -- the health care debate .
President Obama says the time for health care reform is now .
Speaking before the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation 's annual dinner on Saturday night , Obama prescribed the same contentious policy pill he 's embraced since taking office : health care reform and his intention to " get it done this year . "
" We must bring about a better health care system in this country not in ten years , not in five years , not in one year , this year , " he said .
Taking on the voices that say the administration is moving too fast on health care and needs to slow down , he cited examples of people who need urgent health care , and said such people can't be asked to wait .
" We have been waiting for health reform since the days of Teddy Roosevelt , we 've been waiting since the days of Harry Truman .
We 've been waiting since Johnson and Nixon and Clinton .
We can not wait any longer . "
Watch Clinton staffers discuss their failure to enact health care reform »
In recent days , Obama appeared before the U.N. General Assembly and the Group of 20 summit in Pittsburgh , during a week punctuated by a dramatic condemnation at the G - 20 by Obama , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , and French President Nicolas Sarkozy of Iran for secretly developing a second uranium enrichment facility .
But health care came up there at the G - 20 , too , Obama recounted Saturday night .
He mentioned a conversation with an unnamed foreign leader at the summit about the furious health care debate .
" He says , ' Barack , explain to me this health care debate .
We do n't understand it .
You 're trying to make sure everybody has health care and they 're putting a Hitler mustache on you .
That does n't make sense to me , explain that to me , ' " Obama said , referring to the antagonistic rhetoric and imagery disseminated about the president by opponents of health care reform .
However in his speech , Obama exuded hope and confidence that he'd get legislation through soon .
" There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over .
There comes a time to remember the fierce urgency of right now .
Now 's the time to enact health insurance reform in the United States in America , " he told the dinner audience .
Watch how a family is affected by health care debate »
As for the economy , Obama said many people have forgotten how bad things were when he took office and said the administration was making efforts to improve things , such as saving jobs .
Obama also focused on the sacrifices made by African - Americans .
But he dwelled on what he regards as the major issue of education and cited the disturbing trend of high school dropout rates .
He said government can help improve education , mentioning grant and aid programs , rewarding successful teachers and penalizing those who are n't , and rebuilding a crumbling school .
But he said " government alone cannot get our children to the promised land , " and parents need to do the tough legwork in helping their children achieve .
" No excuses for mediocrity , " he said .
" If they come home with a ' B , ' do n't tell them that 's great -- I know some of you do that -- tell them to work harder and get an ' A . ' "

The challenges these women face is the same that all trans people have to face .
Our gender is not seen as real or authentic and for we are transitioning for some sort of benefit .
An example of the theme can be found in
In golf we 've all witnessed Michelle Wie 's attempts to compete with the men , and we 've watched her fail on every occasion .
Most women would n't even dare try .
But surely any member of the PGA Tour would have incredible success if he went Juwwana Man and joined the LPGA Tour , right ?
Granted , the Long Drive Association is n't the prototypical professional golf tour , but the U.S. Women 's Open is governed by the USGA and that means a transwoman could compete in that event .
I have a hard time believing that surgery , testosterone inhibiting drugs and a good degree of mental manipulation can erode all traces of masculinity .
Who would you give better odds of hitting a golf ball farther , little Paula Creamer or a lady who used to rough up gang members for a living as a 245 - pound man and just so happened to be an above average golfer ?
Regardless of whether or not I believe gender transformation should be an acceptable social practice , it really has no place in sports .
Under no circumstances should a two - year hiatus , some expensive surgery and a cocktail of drugs allow someone to play from the forward tees .
With all the criticism and attacks that she is going to face , I just have to tell Mercedes :
You go girl !
Do n't let the haters keep you down .
The biggest complaint about trans women competing in women 's sports is that they have an unfair advantage over cis women .
While trans women who have male levels of testosterone do have a larger muscle mass then cis women , after a certain amount of time on hormones , the average muscle mass of transitioning trans women is no different than the average for cis women .
Any advantage they had due to the influence of male hormones is gone .
This is covered very well at the Women 's Sport Foundation .
Fortunately , progress has been made in letting trans women , who have undergone hormone replacement therapy and surgery , participate in high level sports where there tends to be the biggest problems .
The challenges these women face is the same that all trans people have to face .
Our gender is not seen as real or authentic and for we are transitioning for some sort of benefit .
An example of the theme can be found in this quote With all the criticism and attacks that she is going to face , I just have to tell Mercedes :
You go girl !
Do n't let the haters keep you down .
[ Part 5 in an ongoing series .
Part 1 is here ; Part 2 is here ; Part 3 is here ; Part 4 is here . ]
[ Some of the links have a trigger warning . ]
The topic of trans women in women 's sports has been brought up again recently due to a UK boxer , Mercedes Newbiggin , transitioning to become female .
Her transition has brought out the typical transphobic responses , such as this gem from the conservative Fox News show Red Eye ( Google it if you want ; I am not going to link to them ) with a panelist suggesting a show called " Million Dollar Tranny " and using the wrong pronouns .
It is not anything new being slung at a prominent trans person .
Because she plans on competing in women 's boxing after her transition , there 's a whole extra level of vitriol , as can be seen in this webpage ( check out the delightful comments ) .
This echoes an earlier brouhaha about a trans woman who won the women 's long drive competition
Last Thursday , the House Energy and Commerce Committee finally held a hearing on the highly controversial Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act , the children 's - product - safety law that took effect on Feb. 10 . Chairman Henry Waxman ( D. , Calif . ) allowed a single witness : Inez Tenenbaum , the newly installed chair of the Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) , who , like himself , is a strong advocate of the law .
Not one of the thousands of craftspeople , retailers and small manufacturers the law has sent reeling was permitted to testify .

Some people suspect that a multitasking lifestyle has changed how they think , leaving them easily distracted and unable to concentrate even when separated from computers and phones .
Their uneasiness may be justified .
In several benchmark tests of focus , college students who routinely juggle many flows of information , bouncing from e-mail to web text to video to chat to phone calls , fared significantly worse than their low - multitasking peers .
Other studies have focused on multitasking 's immediate effects — children doing worse on homework while watching television , office workers being more productive when not checking email every five minutes .
" We wanted to ask a different question , " said Clifford Nass , a Stanford University cognitive scientist .
" What happens to people who multitasking all the time ? "
In a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Nass and Stanford psychologists Anthony Wagner and Eyal Ophir surveyed 262 students on their media consumption habits .
The 19 students who multitasked the most and 22 who multitasked least then took two computer - based tests , each completed while concentrating only on the task at hand .
First , they had to remember the briefly glimpsed orientations of red rectangles surrounded by different numbers of blue rectangles .
In the second task , they were asked to categorize a random string of words , and then to do it again without categorizing words that were preceded by a beep .
In a third test , a different group of 30 high - and low - multitaskers were asked to identify target letters on a screen .
As the test was repeated , they had to remember whether letters had also been targeted in earlier trials .
In every test , students who spent less time simultaneously reading e-mail , surfing the web , talking on the phone and watching TV performed best .
" These are all very standard tasks in psychology , " said Nass .
" In the first , there 's lots of evidence that if people do poorly , they have trouble ignoring irrelevant information .
For the second task , there are many demonstrations that this is a good reflection of people 's ability to organize things in their working memory .
The third task shows how fast and readily people switch from doing one thing to another . "
As for what caused the differences — whether people with a predisposition to multitask happen to be mentally disorganized , or if multitasking feeds the condition — " that 's the million dollar question , and we do n't have a million dollar answer , " said Nass .
Wagner next plans to use brain imaging to study the neurology of multitasking , while Ness wants to look at the development of multitasking habits in children .
" The causality question is enormous here , " he said .
" There 's a lot of social pressure to multitask .
You 're getting tweets , e-mails , IMs from multiple people at once , and the web offers unbelievable opportunities for text and video .
It may be thrust upon you . "

The most important political event this week wo n't be Obama 's speech on health care .
WASHINGTON -- President Obama 's health care speech on Wednesday will be only the second most consequential political moment of the week .
Judged by the standard of an event 's potential long - term impact on our public life , the most important will be the argument before the Supreme Court ( on the same day , as it happens ) about a case that , if decided wrongly , could surrender control of our democracy to corporate interests .
This sounds melodramatic .
It 's not .
The court is considering eviscerating laws that have been on the books since , in one case , 1907 and in the other , 1947 banning direct contributions and spending by corporations in federal election campaigns .
Doing so would obliterate precedents that go back two and three decades .
The full impact of what the court could do in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission has only begun to receive the attention it deserves .
Even the word " radical " does not capture the extent to which the justices could turn our political system upside down .
Will it use a case originally brought on a narrow issue to bring our politics back to the corruption of the Gilded Age ?
Citizens United , a conservative group , brought suit arguing that it should be exempt from the restrictions of the 2002 McCain - Feingold campaign finance law for a movie it made that was sharply critical of Hillary Clinton .
The organization said it should not have to disclose who financed the film .
Vladimir Nabokov , the acclaimed author of Ada , Pnin , Pale Fire and that transgressive bestseller Lolita , is a writer whose imaginative mastery continues to torment successive generations .
Behind the imminent publication of his posthumous 18th novel is an extraordinary story , a literary magician 's spell .
On 5 December 1976 , the New York Times Book Review published a pre-Christmas round - up in which a number of famous writers selected the " three books they most enjoyed this year " .
Vladimir Nabokov 's response to this routine inquiry was at once moving and mysterious .
Having revealed that he was seriously ill , he listed " the books I read during the summer months of 1976 while hospitalised in Lausanne " : Dante 's Inferno in the Charles Singleton translation , The Butterflies of North America by William H Howe ( Nabokov was a world - famous lepidopterist ) and , finally , The Original Of Laura .
This , he wrote , was " the not - quite - finished manuscript of a novel which I had begun writing and reworking before my illness and which was completed in my mind " .
With artful cunning , Nabokov proceeded to reveal a mystery that is only now , 33 years later , on the brink of being solved .
" I must have gone through it [ The Original of Laura ] some 50 times , " he confided , " and in my diurnal delirium kept reading it aloud to a small dream audience in a walled garden . "
Who could resist such entrancing fabrications ?
" My audience , " Nabokov went on , " consisted of peacocks , pigeons , my long dead parents , two cypresses , several young nurses crouching around , and a family doctor so old as to be almost invisible .
Perhaps because of my stumblings and fits of coughing , the story of my poor Laura had less success with my listeners than it will have , I hope , with intelligent reviewers when properly published . "
With that fleeting reference to " my poor Laura " , the spell was almost wound up .
There was just one more twist .
Shortly after Christmas , provoked by that tantalising fragment in his newspaper , Herbert Mitgang , a New York Times reporter specialising in books and writers , began to make inquiries of Nabokov 's publisher and confirmed , as he reported on 5 January , that the celebrated author of Lolita had indeed " completed his next novel in his head " .
This news he corroborated with Nabokov 's New York editor , who told him : " It 's all there : the characters , the scenes , the details .
He [ Nabokov ] is about to do the actual writing on three - by - five - inch cards . "
Writing on index cards , in pencil , had become Nabokov 's preferred method of composition .
He would fill each card with narrative and dialogue , shuffle the completed pack and then , in the words of his editor , " deal himself a novel " .
What literary news could be more thrilling ?
In summary , we now know that the novel concerns beautiful and promiscuous Flora Lanskaya , " the original of Laura " , and her unhappy marriage to the grossly fat Philip Wild .
The theme of the book , central to Nabokov , is Death and what lies beyond it .
Wild is engaged on a process of self - dissolution , thinking away his corporeal self in a bizarre act of cerebral suicide .
Next month we shall at last discover what this fabled manuscript actually amounts to ; at the time there was only gossip .
Mitgang reported that the working title of this new novel by a contemporary European master was " Tool " .
This was , he speculated , " presumably an anagram , somehow based on a character named Laura " .
Fired by the mystery of " Tool " , and the excitement of the quest , Mitgang flew to Switzerland .
The 77 - year - old Nabokov and his devoted wife , Vera , had lived there , amid the marble and chandeliers of the Montreux Palace Hotel , for more than 15 years .
Mitgang was to be slightly frustrated .
The celebrated author refused to grant the New York Times an interview , but he was , apparently , happy to entertain a purely social visit from Mitgang , who told the Observer last week that he'd had " about half an hour in the hotel lobby with Nabokov " .
Mitgang says he found Nabokov to be " very cordial " , but that he got little else from the meeting .
He later wrote that it would be " idle to speculate about the title or the meaning [ of ' Tool ' ] because Mr Nabokov likes to play games with words , ideas , and publishers " .
The true nature of the new book would not be vouchsafed " until those shuffled cards are typed into a manuscript " .
None the less , having made the pilgrimage to Montreux , Mitgang was not going to go away empty handed .
" And what , " he asked , breathlessly breaking the rules of the encounter , " is the new novel about ? "
" If I told you , " Nabokov demurred , with teasing courtesy , " that would be an interview . "
Never had the magician cast a better spell .
He had done it often enough before , in print .
As he said in his memoir , Speak , Memory : " I like to fold my magic carpet , after use , in such a way as to superimpose one part of the pattern upon another . "
This time illusion and reality would become tragically fused .
For Nabokov , art and life were always " a game of intricate enchantment and deception " .
Lolita , his most famous creation , is an enchantress .
His greatest novels display extraordinary narrative legerdemain and fiendish invention , partly inspired by the ludic interaction of English and Russian .
Of himself , he wrote that , in his imagination : " I appear as an idol , a wizard , bird - headed , emerald - gloved , dressed in tights made of bright - blue scales . "
Perhaps you have to be an aristocrat born on Shakespeare 's birthday to play Prospero .
Nabokov came from a family of almost impossible grandeur , Russian liberals who fled the Crimea in 1919 .
As a young man , after a Cambridge education , he stumbled into a career as a drifter , a collector of butterflies and author of strange books .
A brilliant outsider , he established a modest literary reputation across the Europe of the 1920s and 1930s , supporting himself through lessons in English and tennis and crossword puzzles composed for a Russian emigre newspaper .
In 1940 , fleeing the Nazis , Nabokov embarked on a second exile to America , landing in New York with just $ 100 .
Here , in his early 40s , he started to write in English for the first time .
His young cousin , the renowned French publisher Ivan Nabokov , says : " Vladimir had an English nanny .
English was his first language and he always had a terrific ear . "
Nabokov eventually found his niche , teaching at Wellesley College and Cornell and finally publishing Lolita , after many rejections , in 1955 .
After years of living in a kind of literary twilight , the sensational success of that great literary narcissist , Humbert Humbert , and his scandalous predilection for " light of my life " Dolores Haze , thrust Nabokov under the hot lights of American celebrity .
It was not a congenial experience and in 1961 he retired to Switzerland with his wife to devote himself to his books .
Now the plot thickens again .
The first major novel to spring from his pencil after Lolita spookily rehearses the strange afterlife of " Tool " .
Pale Fire ( 1962 ) has been described , by Mary McCarthy , as " a jack in the box , a Fabergé gem , a clockwork toy , a chess problem , an infernal machine " .
John Shade , a famous American poet , murdered in 1959 , has left a final poem .
Nabokov gives the reader four cantos of Pale Fire , 999 lines of rhyming couplets , plus an editor 's foreword and scholarly annotations .
When the disparate parts of the manuscript are fitted together , a novel of many planes and levels is revealed , a novel inspired by games of chess , the heroic couplets of Alexander Pope and the lambent mysteries of nature ( Pale Fire is full of lakes , trees and butterflies ) .
And the poem ?
This , we are informed by Charles Kinbote , the editor of Shade 's posthumous masterpiece , " consists of 80 medium - sized index cards " on which the poet , Shade , has written out " in a minute , tidy , remarkably clear hand , the text of his poem ... "
Already , The Original Of Laura has its antecedents .
But not yet a title .
When " Tool " first surfaced in Nabokov 's notebooks , in 1974 , it was Dying Is Fun and then The Opposite of Laura .
If Nabokov hoped he could tease his worldwide readership , some of whom loved him close to idolatry , with The Original of Laura as work in progress , he was to be cruelly denied .
Mitgang says that when he met the novelist in the new year of 1977 , " he seemed to be old , but in good health " .
In fact , Nabokov was dying .
When the BBC filmed him in the spring of 1977 , he was low in the water and visibly sinking .
He moved slowly , his skin was " grey and flabby " and he was breathing hard .
As his condition deteriorated , he worked obsessively to finish the new novel that was so synaesthetically vivid in his imagination .
In the end , he had to acknowledge his fate .
If the manuscript could never be finished to its perfectionist author 's satisfaction , it must never see the light of day .
Now the spell he had nurtured would become an old man 's malediction .
He instructed Vera that , after his death , it should be destroyed forthwith .
Nabokov died from bronchitis on 2 July 1977 , in the presence of his family and , according to his son , Dmitri , " with a triple moan of descending pitch " .
The writer 's departure seems like just another piece of wizardry .
" The echo is so strong , " his son writes , " that I imagine that it is indeed all staged , that he will soon speak again . "
It could not be and the spell became a curse .
The 138 index cards of " Tool " were placed in a safe deposit box in the vault of a Swiss bank while Vera wrestled with her late husband 's injunction .
From time to time , she enlisted sympathetic outsiders for advice .
Brian Boyd , Nabokov 's distinguished biographer , was given a taste of the manuscript amid conditions of great secrecy during the mid-80s and advised against publication , an opinion he later rescinded .
" People should n't expect to be swept away , " he has said , tactfully .
" It 's the kind of writing that induces admiration and awe but not engagement . "
Those for whom Nabokov is , in the words of Martin Amis , " the laureate of cruelty " , see his deathbed decree as peculiarly vexing .
But it was not unique .
Virgil instructed his heirs to destroy The Aeneid , and was defied by the emperor Augustus .
Kafka asked his friend Max Brod to burn all his papers , which included the novels we know as The Trial and The Castle .
" Fortunately , " said Nabokov in his own lecture on Kafka , " Brod did not comply with his friend 's wishes . "
This remark has been used by the Nabokov estate as a prescient approval of its failure to destroy The Original of Laura .
The burden of administering the Nabokov estate had fallen to the writer 's beloved son , " my dearest Dmitri " , who was also known to his father as Mitya , Mityusha , Mityenka , Mityushenka and Dmitrichko .
An only child , Dmitri has always expressed a quasi-tribal loyalty to the Nabokov name , but that is not the whole story .
Vladimir loathed music and never learned to drive ; Dmitri is a one - time opera singer with a love of fast cars .
In the narrative of what happened next , the complexity of the father - son relationship has played a vital part .
Last week , his cousin Ivan Nabokov described to the Observer the executor 's anguish .
He remembers Dmitri telephoning for support .
" If you 're asking me , I replied , you 've already made up your mind : your instruction was to destroy it . . "
Now 75 , Dmitri , known to the Italian press as " Lolito " , is as tough , vivid and entertaining , fast - talking and Americanised as his father was elusive , sweet - natured and immemorially Russian .
For years , he lived in the Nabokov apartment in Montreux , or in Palm Beach , enjoying a playboy lifestyle with Ferraris and a string of girlfriends .
In his time , he has been a passionate mountaineer and a racing driver until a near - fatal crash in 1980 curtailed all climbing , singing and driving .
When Vera Nabokov died in 1991 , there was no escaping the family curse .
Dmitri , who had already made an admired translation of Nabokov 's ur - Lolita , The Enchanter , welcomed an immersion in his father 's work as a way of remaining close to him .
" When the task passed to me , " he writes in his introduction to The Original of Laura , it was as though he " had never died , but lived on , looking over my shoulder in a kind of virtual limbo , available to offer a thought or counsel to assist me with a vital decision " .
It is not known when Dmitri first began to study the 138 index cards , but when he did he seemed to make up his mind .
The Original of Laura , he wrote , was " the most controlled distillation of my father 's creativity , his most brilliant novel " .
Nevertheless , he continued to vacillate , like Hamlet , in the execution of his filial obligation to his late father 's request .
Once again , he turned to his publisher - cousin .
About 10 years ago , the index cards of " Tool " were converted into a 76 - page typescript and shown to Ivan Nabokov and some others in the estate 's inner circle .
Nabokov says , pointedly , that , " We were all of the same opinion .
It was just a torso , and not a glorious torso . "
But now , once again , life was intruding on art .
Entering his 70s , Dmitri Nabokov was progressively unwell with a grim tally of geriatric afflictions involving expensive Swiss doctors .
To put it bluntly , he needed the money .
Then , in 2005 , there was a new twist .
Ron Rosenbaum is a New York journalist who happens to believe , as he told the Observer , that Vladimir Nabokov is " the greatest writer of the 20th century , the only one close to William Shakespeare 's level " .
In November 2005 , Rosenbaum , who enjoys a reputation as a literary gadfly , wrote a column , " Dear Dmitri , Don't burn Laura ! " in the New York Observer .
Having rehearsed the history of " Tool " , Rosenbaum reported an email exchange with Dmitri Nabokov about the manuscript ( " He will probably destroy it before he dies ! " ) and closed with a passionate plea : " Wo n't some university library step forward with a detailed plan for funding the preservation of The Original of Laura , this irreplaceable literary treasure ? "
The result : uproar .
The eccentric , worldwide fraternity of Nabokov scholars had a field day .
Dmitri , apparently maddened by the controversy , now adopted his father 's teasing stance .
He declared himself to be " torn " between his obligations to posterity and to his father 's shade .
Asked if he would burn or shred the manuscript , he replied , mischievously : " Perhaps I already have and prefer not to reveal the method . "
The teasing went both ways .
In 1991 , an American librarian published a literary critical essay , apparently by a Swiss professor , entitled " A first look at Nabokov 's last novel " , which was quickly exposed as a brilliant spoof .
Others became entangled in the debate .
" It 's perfectly straightforward , " said Tom Stoppard .
" Nabokov wanted it burnt , so burn it . "
Novelist Edmund
White , whose early work had been championed by Nabokov , was equally blunt .
" If a writer really wants something destroyed , " he told the Times , " he burns it . "
John Banville said that this situation was " a difficult and painful one " .
Conceding that The Original of Laura may turn out to be inferior , Banville decided that it should be saved from the flames .
" A great writer is always worth reading , " he said , " even at his worst . "
So how good was The Original of Laura , and what was its place in the Nabokov canon ?
Ron Rosenbaum , who had begun to exhibit some of the symptoms that afflict everyone who approaches this manuscript , was now on a mission to find out and it left him wanting , he said , " to spend the rest of my life trying to evaluate its relationship to the rest of VN 's work " .
But when he spoke to the Observer recently , Rosenbaum admitted that he was " deeply conflicted " about what he had seen .
Ivan Nabokov , who has watched this saga from the privileged position of one who actually knew the author , can't quite see what the fuss is about .
" To me , it 's an inconsequential matter , " he told the Observer , but as a distinguished former editor he fully understands the publishers ' dilemma .
Never mind the " burn or not to burn " question ; here is a highly publicised , highly prized volume that 's barely 76 pages long , by an author who wanted it destroyed , for which several imprints worldwide have paid a lot of money .
" Sonny Mehta at Knopf has come up with a brilliant solution , " he says .
Designed by Chip Kidd , The Original of Laura will appear in a highly collectible edition : Nabokov 's handwritten index cards are reproduced in facsimile to display his neat handwriting , his furious crossings - out and his fascinating inserts .
There 's one valedictory wink from the great magician , a final card containing a list of synonyms for " efface " – expunge , erase , delete , rub out , wipe out and ... obliterate .
Better late …

Think that the Catholic church is gunning for our lives and loves now , what with them being one of the largest contributors to Maine 's anti-equality campaign , as well as the guiding faith behind the National Organization For Marriage ?
Yea , well just wait until November , when the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops will release yet another statement about how wrong our lives and loves supposedly are , and how unutilized they think our genitalia should be :
" The legal recognition of same - sex unions poses a multifaceted threat to the very fabric of society , striking at the source from which society and culture come and which they are meant to serve . "
They go on to write that LGBT people should live a life dedicated to chastity , and that male - female complementarity reigns superior to basic equal rights .

Your thoughts
Well , at least the Catholic elites are honest : their religious beliefs should dictate all of our civil rights .
Is n't their religion a choice , too ?
After all , there have been successful ex-Catholics after therapy ( their greatest fear : using logic to scrutinize the institution and its scare tactics for conforming ) .

They are still longing for the days when their religious affiliation gave them free reign to slaughter anyone and everyone who dared to disagree with them .
Any threat to their stupefying religious teachings was a threat to " society , " and was dealt with at the point of a blade , or at the business end of a musket .
Ah ... such fond memories they must have .

Several hundred hotel workers and their supporters turned out yesterday for a raucous rally in front of the Hyatt Regency Boston for the 100 housekeepers who were fired by the hotel chain .
Politicians called for businesses to boycott the Hyatt , and workers banged on drums , rattled detergent bottles filled with rocks , and chanted “ Hyatt , shame on you ’’ as they marched in front of the hotel with picket signs .
Hyatt Hotels Corp. laid off the entire housekeeping staffs at the Hyatt Regency Boston , Hyatt Regency Cambridge , and Hyatt Harborside Hotel after the morning shift had ended on Aug. 31 , citing challenging economic conditions , and immediately replaced them with workers from an out - of - state staffing firm .
The housekeepers had been training those very workers , from Georgia ’s Hospitality Staffing Solutions , who they were told would be filling in for vacations .
US Representative Michael Capuano and state Senator Anthony Galluccio called for a boycott of Hyatt .
“ Maybe they should have just taken the chocolates off the pillows , I do n’t know , ’’ Capuano told the people assembled on Avenue de Lafayette , near Downtown Crossing .
“ If we let them do this , another hotel will do it , and then another business , and on and on . ’’
City Councilor Maureen
Feeney told the crowd that tourism is one of the largest industries in Boston , adding , “ Do you know who we have to thank for that ?
You . ’’
Mayor Thomas M. Menino did not attend the rally , but in a statement , said : “ The Hyatt made a crude business decision that will have devastating effects on real people who work hard everyday .
My administration stands with these workers and will continue to fight for fair wages for all of our people . ’’
In a statement issued yesterday , Hyatt Hotels Corp. said , “ Due to the unprecedented economic environment , the Hyatt hotels in Boston -- like businesses all over America -- have had to make very difficult decisions to adjust costs in response to continuing declines in revenue .
Unfortunately , these decisions have affected our associates at Boston - area properties .
A restructuring of our housekeeping services included staff reductions that we deeply regret . ’’
Several of the fired hotel workers spoke at the rally , including Serendu Kamara , a former Hyatt Harborside employee who is pregnant and has three children at home .
“ I gave everything I have for them , ’’ she said .
Ritz - Carlton room service waiter Jose Sanchez , dressed in a black vest and striped tie , came to the rally during his break .
“ I think it ’s disgusting what happened here , ’’ said Sanchez , a union representative at the Ritz .
“ It ’s the height of arrogance and corporate greed , ’’ said state Senator Marc Pacheco .
“ The assault on the most vulnerable target is an assault on all workers . ’’
The rally was part of an outpouring of support for the housekeepers - from people offering financial assistance to others saying they will be boycotting the Hyatt - which came yesterday after The Boston Globe ’s front - page story about the layoffs .
Ronald Hiemann , the chief executive of Seajet in Chelsea , a shipping company specializing in Asian goods , said he would no longer recommend the Hyatt to business associates in town from overseas .
“ Hyatt has been crossed off the list , ’’ he wrote in an e-mail .
Hiemann also sent a letter to the Coalition of New England Companies for Trade , which holds a regular event at the Hyatt Regency in Newport , R.I. , asking the group to book elsewhere .

There is little doubt that , if UN staff and ambassadors could vote , Barack Obama would have won by an even bigger landslide than he achieved .
From his speeches they expect him to negotiate where possible , to build consensual international alliances .
They may not get all that they want .
( Winning back hearts and minds , 6 November 2008 )
After Obama 's election I wrote here : " It may not be the second coming , but to use the eschatological phraseology of the Palins of this world , it is certainly the end of the reign of the Antichrist . "
I also recalled what I 'd said during the campaign : " The world looked upon these elections as an IQ test for the American public .
The electorate has aced the test .
It has put centuries of racism behind it and elected a president who shows signs of knowing where the rest of the world is . "
Frankly , while still far from euphoric , I feel vindicated .
The coalition of not - so - covert racists , teabaggers , birthers and defenders of Medicare against the state should be a reminder to the purist Obama - detractors of the left just who could instead be staffing the US government now .
OK , Rush Limbaugh 's " magic Negro " did not wave a wand and change everything immediately .
But in many ways it is remarkable how much Obama has achieved in the face of financial crisis .
And no one who saw how much money and support he got from Wall Street can be honestly be surprised at the shape of his response .
The current plans for healthcare reform leaves a lot to be desired , above all a public option .
But it is happening , at least .
One hopes that Obama is biding his time to come in and leash the Blue Dogs of Capitol Hill to get it through .
But even then he has breached the wall of opposition , and another term and " once more into that breach " should bring in reform – if only because of the fiscal costs of not doing it .
Guantánamo is not closed , but it is closing , and with it the lawless domestic and international doctrines of the Bush - era justice department .
US troops have been pulled from Iraqi cities , and we can be reasonably sure that if the Iraqi government asked them to leave the country , they would go .
Yes there is talk of a build up in Afghanistan , but that is , after all , what Obama promised , even if he certainly should take a more active role in revising the tactics and strategy there .
He has scrapped the son - of - Star Wars missile defence programme in Europe that was expensive , ineffective and needlessly provocative to the Russians .
The UN dues are paid up , and Obama has adopted a multilateral outlook .
On the Middle East , he has quietly confronted Binyamin Netanyahu , held firm on Israel meeting its own promises on settlements and , relatively un-noticed , told Israel that it should do as Richard Goldstone says and hold an impartial inquiry into Gaza .
When he backslides , by all means let people shove .
But let them remember how far up the slope he 's pushed us in less than a year .

The Washington Post yesterday made available an unclassified version of Gen. Stanley McChrystal ’s long - awaited report on the war in Afghanistan .
Politically , the report is bold , in that it acknowledges the enemy has the initiative and we have been fighting the war – for eight years – in counterproductive ways .
But intellectually , both as analysis and as prescription , it is five pounds of substance in a 50 - pound bag .
The report ’s message can be summarized in one sentence : we need to start doing classic counterinsurgency , and to do so , we need more " resources , " i.e. , troops .
In a narrow , technical sense , that statement is valid .
Classic counterinsurgency doctrine says we need hundreds of thousands more troops in Afghanistan .
Past that syllogism , the report ’s validity becomes questionable .
Defects begin with the study ’s failure to address Fourth Generation war ’s first and most important question :
Is there a state in Afghanistan ?
At times , the report appears to assume a state ; elsewhere , it speaks of the Afghan state ’s weaknesses .
It never addresses the main fact , namely that at present there is no state , and under the current Afghan government there is no prospect of creating one .
The failure to acknowledge the absence of a state leads the rest of the report through the looking glass .
For example , it puts great emphasis on expanding the Afghan National Security Forces ( army and police ) .
But absent a state , there are no state armed forces .
The ANSF are militiamen who take a salary paid , through intermediaries , by foreign governments .
How many Pashtun do you find in the ANSF ?
Similarly , the report laments that Afghanistan ’s prisons have become recruiting centers for the Taliban .
It calls for getting the U.S. out of the prison business and turning it all over to the Afghan government .
But who will then run those " state " prisons ?
The Taliban , of course , just as they do now .
In a curious passage , the report says , on page 2 - 20 ,
" The greater resources [ ISAF requires ] will not be sufficient to achieve success , but will enable implementation of the new strategy .
Conversely , inadequate resources will likely result in failure .
However , without a new strategy , the mission should not be resourced . "
Here we encounter the report ’s most dangerous failing .
It confuses the strategic and the operational levels of war .
In fact , the report does not offer a new strategy , but a new operational - level plan .
How the war is fought , i.e. , by following classic counter - insurgency doctrine , is operational , not strategic .
America must find a new strategy , since the current strategy depends on an Afghan state that does not exist .
But the report offers no new strategy .
The passage on page 2 - 20 thus ends up saying , " If you do n’t give us more troops , we will fail .
But you should n’t give us more troops unless we adopt a new strategy , which we do n’t have .
And even if you do give us the troops we want for the new strategy we have n’t got , they will not be enough to achieve success . "
This reveals utter intellectual confusion .
The proper response of the White House , the Pentagon , and Congress to Gen. McChrystal ’s report is , " Back to the drawing board , fellas . "
How might Fourth Generation theory help us rewrite the report ?
At the operational level , most of what it recommends under the rubric of counterinsurgency is sound .
Drawing on the report ’s concept of " proper resourcing " that allows for " appropriate and acceptable risk , " we would concentrate our counterinsurgency efforts in a few provinces , such as Helmand , to show the Taliban we can fight it to a stalemate .
We would endeavor to do so while gradually drawing troop levels down , not sending in more troops .
The goal of these actions on the operational level would be to buy time both in Afghanistan and on the home front .
We would use that time to implement a genuine new strategy .
It would proceed from these facts :
There is no state in Afghanistan , and none can be created by or for the current Afghan government .
Our strategic goal , as Gen. McChrystal ’s report states in its first paragraph , is to prevent al - Qaeda ’s return to Afghanistan .
There is currently no evidence of al - Qaeda presence in Afghanistan .
One of the best open sources of intelligence , Nightwatch , recently stated this directly , and Gen. McChrystal ’s report hints at it .
Our strategic goal would be to see the creation of a state in Afghanistan that can and will prevent al - Qaeda ’s return .
Who can do that ?
The Taliban .
We would use the time bought by counterinsurgency operations to negotiate with the Taliban , the Haqqani Network , the Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin , and other Afghan leaders , including some in the current Afghan government , toward a power - sharing arrangement .
A government that includes the Taliban can create a state .
The risk is the Taliban ’s willingness to keep al - Qaeda out .
Why should Mullah Omar agree to that ?
Because al - Qaeda no longer needs Afghan bases .
It has far more useful ones in Pakistan .
That is why it is not in Afghanistan now .
If President Obama and Congress accept Gen. McChrystal ’s report and adopt a new operational plan in support of the current strategy , building an Afghan state around the regime now in Kabul , they will guarantee an American defeat .
Sending more American troops to Afghanistan will only magnify the defeat .
Ironically , what Washington needs to do is follow Gen. McChrystal ’s own recommendation and refuse more resources without a new strategy .
Let ’s hope the politicians realize this is their last exit before a bottomless quagmire .

A high - school student from West Virginia has discovered a new astronomical object , a strange type of neutron star called a rotating radio transient .
Lucas Bolyard , a sophomore at South Harrison High School in Clarksburg , WV , made the discovery while participating in a project in which students are trained to search through data from the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope ( GBT ) .
Bolyard made the discovery in March , after he already had studied more than 2,000 data plots from the GBT and found nothing .
The project is the Pulsar Search Collaboratory ( PSC ) , which allows students to do real scientific research by looking at data from the GBT , the largest radio telescope in the US .
“ Lucas is one of the most enthusiastic students involved in the project , ” said Duncan Lorimer , astronomer from West Virginia University .
“ He ’s one of these youngsters that never gives up , he ’s very persistent and he has all the attributes that a scientist should have . ”
Rotating radio transients are thought to be similar to pulsars , superdense neutron stars that are the corpses of massive stars that exploded as supernovae .
Pulsars are known for their lighthouse - like beams of radio waves that sweep through space as the neutron star rotates , creating a pulse as the beam sweeps by a radio telescope .
While pulsars emit these radio waves continuously , rotating radio transients emit only sporadically , one burst at a time , with as much as several hours between bursts .
Because of this , they are difficult to discover and observe , with the first one only discovered in 2006 .
“ This neutron star is rotating very rapidly , so you have something the size of city with the mass of the sun , spinning incredibly rapidly , ” said Lorimer “ which also has an incredibly large magnetic field which is how we detect it with radio telescopes . ”
“ These objects are very interesting , both by themselves and for what they tell us about neutron stars and supernovae , ” said Maura McLaughlin , also from WVU .
“ We do n’t know what makes them different from pulsars — why they turn on and off .
If we answer that question , it ’s likely to tell us something new about the environments of pulsars and how their radio waves are generated . ”
“ They also tell us there are more neutron stars than we knew about before , and that means there are more supernova explosions .
In fact , we now almost have more neutron stars than can be accounted for by the supernovae we can detect , ” she added .
“ I was home on a weekend and had nothing to do , so I decided to look at some more plots from the GBT , ” Bolyard said .
“ I saw a plot with a pulse , but there was a lot of radio interference , too .
The pulse almost got dismissed as interference , ” he added .
Nonetheless , he reported it , and it went on a list of candidates for McLaughlin and Lorimer to re-examine , scheduling new observations of the region of sky from which the pulse came .
Disappointingly , the follow - up observations showed nothing , indicating that the object was not a normal pulsar .
However , the astronomers explained to Bolyard that his pulse still might have come from a rotating radio transient .
Confirmation did n’t come until July .
Bolyard was at the NRAO ’s Green Bank Observatory with fellow PSC students .
The night before , the group had been observing with the GBT in the wee hours , and all were very tired .
Then Lorimer showed Bolyard a new plot of his pulse , reprocessed from raw data , indicating that it is real , not interference , and that Bolyard is likely the discoverer of one of only about 30 rotating radio transients known .
Suddenly , Bolyard said , he was n’t tired anymore .
“ That news made me full of energy , ” he exclaimed .
“ My friends were really excited because they think I ’m going to be famous ! ”
As of a year ago , Bolyard said he would n’t have thought of becoming astronomer , but this has given him second thoughts .
“ Making this discovery has made me very excited to get into a scientific field , ” he said .
“ It ’s a lot of hard work , but it ’s worth it . ”
The PSC , led by NRAO Education Officer Sue Ann Heatherly and Project Director Rachel Rosen , includes training for teachers and student leaders , and provides parcels of data from the GBT to student teams .
The project involves teachers and students in helping astronomers analyze data from 1500 hours of observing with the GBT .
The 120 terabytes of data were produced by 70,000 individual pointings of the giant , 17 - million - pound telescope .
Some 300 hours of the observing data were reserved for analysis by student teams .
Learn more about the PSC and Bolyard ’s discovery on the Sept. 18 edition of 365 Days of Astronomy .
NRAO has a video about the discovery .
The student teams use analysis software to reveal evidence of pulsars .
Each portion of the data is analyzed by multiple teams .
In addition to learning to use the analysis software , the student teams also must learn to recognize man-made radio interference that contaminates the data .
The project will continue through 2011 .
“ The students get to actually look through data that has never been looked through before , ” Rosen said .
From the training , she added , “ the students get a wonderful grasp of what they ’re looking at , and they understand the science behind the plots that they ’re looking at . ”

Usain Bolt , the Jamaican sprinter who shattered two world records last week , may now be the world 's fastest human , but his accomplishments raise some intriguing questions about how he and other humans match up against the rest of the animal kingdom .
At top speed , Mr. Bolt hit about 30 miles per hour as he set his records ( he averaged 23.5 mph over 100 meters ) .
The cheetah , in contrast , can reach a top speed of 70 mph and maintain it for about 200-300 yards , long enough to cream Mr. Bolt .
The pronghorn can run at about 65 mph ...
Each of the world 's 40,000 spider species survives by hunting and killing — except , that is , for Bagheera kiplingi , the world 's first vegetarian arachnid .
Found in Central America , the order - defying jumping spider eats nutrient - rich structures called Beltian bodies , which are found on the tips of Acacia trees .
Trees produce the bodies to feed ants that defend them , which is a textbook example of what 's called co-evolutionary mutalism , and one that B. kiplingi has evolved to exploit .
In a paper published Monday in Current Biology , researchers describe the spider 's ant - evading habits and provide a molecular analysis of its body composition , proving that B. kiplingi is indeed what it eats : plants , with a few larval ants on the side .
( After all , 400 million years of evolutionary habits die hard . )
A few other spiders have been documented consuming nectar , but only as a snack .
No other spider is so predominantly vegetarian .
And that 's not all :
It looks like B. kiplingi males help care for eggs and young — something entirely unprecedented in the spider world .
The researchers are now studying whether there 's a link between B. kiplingi's predilection for plants and parental concern .
Maybe going veggie softened its heart .

Brandon is currently working on a book about ecosystem and planetary tipping points .
The 2009 TransOhio Symposium was a veritable who ’s who in the trans community .
Attendees , presenters and performers came all the way from the likes of D.C. , Missouri , and Iowa to see what the Buckeye State has to offer by way of trans activism .
( Forty percent of Americans do live within 500 miles of Ohio , after all . )
The keynote speaker Helen Boyd , author of My Husband Betty , spoke over lunch to a packed house at Capital Law School .
The lecture hall was full , so her talk was streamed in another lecture to accommodate the overflow .
Boyd talked about her relationship with Betty as her transition began about 10 years ago .
As partners , Betty promised to move as slowly as she could with her transition and Boyd offered to move as fast as she could ; Betty ’s ultimate goal with her transition was to still be married to Boyd when all was said and done .
This , of course , caused some controversy among Betty ’s community of trans friends .
To mark the nationwide kiss - in scheduled for that day , at 2 p.m .
Boyd stopped and asked everyone in the room to lock lips in solidarity with the demonstrations .
Boyd highlighted six areas that are important for couples undergoing transition to remember :
People will get the trans partner ’s new name wrong .
It takes time , but do n’t give them forever to make the adjustments either .
While every new development – like that first like sprout of facial hair – may be exciting to you , it might be a conversation that is better had in depth with other trans friends .
Get trans friends :
Do n’t put everything on the non-trans partner .
Try to walk in your non-trans partner ’s shoes ( probably not literally ) .
They are probably having a hard time with the fact that they are having a hard time with some aspect of your transition .
Know the person you are talking to .
Pick the time and space for heavy conversations .
Moments of joy for one partner may not be so easy for the other .
Following lunch , Mara Keisling , director of the National Center for Transgender Equality , gave a refreshing lecture on the current national policies and legislation .
Keisling was frank and entertaining , giving the audience the raw version of what ’s up in Washington .
She highlighted the hate crimes bills as monumental because it is the first time transpeople have ever been mentioned positively in federal legislation .
This is important because in order for their to be more progress made we have to have lawmakers agreeing that killing transpeople is wrong before they can agree firing them is wrong .
NCTE has several resources on its Web site , including Transgender Equality for the Federal Government , ENDA Fact Sheet and ENDA Toolkit , Driver ’s License Policies ( state by state ) , PASS ID Fact Sheet and more on the left sidebar .
Following the conference activities was a variety show at Wall St. Fabulously Fluid featured a hodgepodge musical performances , standup comedy and drag , including the Cleveland Kings and Girls , the Royal Renegades , the Black Mondays and a few solo performers .
Adam Apple of Cleveland Kings and Girls performed his opus “ Stop and Stare . ”
The performance begins with Apple getting into drag on stage to light elevator music ; once he has transformed , he begins revealing facts about himself ­– ranging from mundane to miserable – and the song “ Stop and Stare ” by OneRepublic replaces the other music midway through .
Once Apple has gone through the posters , he performs a more hopeful song .
The message of the entire performance is that Apple is human , and so are the rest of us .

Lots of terror in the news all of a sudden ... This is the one that everyone is talking about .
A 24 year old Aghan - born man named Najibullah Zazi , in an apparent attempt to make bombs , purchased a suspiciously large amount of acetone and a product containing hydrogen peroxide .
Also see here and here .
He appears to have co-conspirators .
In an unrelated case , 21 year old Betim Kaziu has been charged with being an al Qaeda militant .
A 19 year old Jordanian named Hosam Maher Husein Smadi " who entered the United States illegally " discussed in an online forum a plot to blow up the Fountain Place skyscraper in Dallas .
He bought what he thought was a bomb from an undercover agent and tried to set it off with a cell phone detonator .
Questions :
How does a young Jordanian get into this country illegallydays ?
And how did he get the money for the bomb ?
29 year old Michael Finton , who uses the name Talib Islam , came to the attention of authorities when he contacted John Walker Lindh .
After meeting an undercover FBI agent posing as an al Qaeda operative , he was supplied with a ton of explosives , which he tried to detonate in front of the Federal Building in Springfield .
The explosives were inactive ; he was arrested .

I have given brief rundowns of events that are surely more complex than would appear at first glance .
Right now , I simply want to take note of the overall pattern .
Something seems to be up , eh wot ?
I must confess that Obama deserves congratulations :
He has not tried to make political use of these incidents .
But Portland is something else : the new face of America 's maverick food cart movement .
We know this because no one else puts it together like we have -- the volume of experimenters , the variety , the pedigreed ingredients ( duck confit on the best baguettes at $ 5.50 -- are you kidding ?! ) and the punk - rock shacks .
As Next Generation food creatives abandon the heat -- and expense -- of restaurant kitchens to create their demented little houses on the prairie , they are inventing their own model of modern restaurateuring .
Multnomah County has 450 carts , a 20 percent jump over last year , with another 32 carts under review .
The surge comes with an ace in the hole :
No other big city is friendlier to vendors , with affordable licenses ( a mere $ 315 ) and unrivaled access to real estate ( average rent $ 500 a month ) .
You 've seen them yourself : block - long shantytowns that are the food courts of the future -- the growing cluster on Southwest Alder between Ninth and 11th ; the late - night frenzy at Southeast Hawthorne and 12th ; the student - friendly nexus at Southwest College and Fourth ; and the first sign of food cart gentrification , the just - opened Mississippi Marketplace , a development on a once - forlorn empty lot .
Streetside dining has been the food story of the year .
These top 10 picks all share an obsession with craft and flavor that rivals top restaurant chefs .
What 's impressive is how these cooks are sourcing farm - fresh ingredients just like the city 's best chefs .
The only difference is you might find yourself sitting next to a fire hydrant in the rain .
Trust me :
One bite and you wo n't care .
Ed MacPherson is your college whiz - kid hyper - scientist : wormholes , time travel , heavy stellar engineering .

" Of course I dislike the Nazis .
But who is to say they 're morally wrong ? "
The shocking statement was made by a college student in New York , as documented by author Kerby Anderson in a much - needed book , " Christian Ethics in Plain Language " .
The professor of the class , Anderson reports , " .... said that he has never met a student who denied the Holocaust happened .
But he also reported that 10 to 20 percent of his students cannot bring themselves to say that killing millions of people is wrong . "
This is certainly an indictment of how modern society has made a false religion out of " tolerance " and how we adults have failed to teach that there are , indeed , moral absolutes .
What evidence more strongly proves the dangerous folly of moral relativism than young people who can't distinguish between learning to " tolerate " what they merely " dislike " and recognizing what is , on its face , evil ?
We 're in real trouble when even the most egregious evils can't be named as such .
Recent surveys that reveal a growing number of youth believe that lying and adultery are acceptable behaviors indicate that we are headed for serious trouble as a society .
We 've become so obsessed with what is " politically correct " and the need not to " offend " that we are failing to teach the principles that every civil society must uphold in order to survive .
If basic relational concepts such as fidelity and honesty cannot be recognized as bedrock principles then how on earth do we expect the next generation to defend the principles of freedom and justice ?
Some truths are supposed to be self - evident .
Yet even our Founding Fathers saw the need to clearly state them as such .
Dr. Jeff Myers , a recognized expert in leadership development who has trained some two million people in mentoring and world view understanding warns , " We live in what may be one of the first generations in Western Civilization that is not intentionally preparing to pass its values to the next generation . "
One great resource to help you train the next generation are the materials from Dr. Myers ' organization , Passing the Baton .
At www.passingthebaton.org you can order a complete kit that will enable you to mentor and equip young people with the ability to develop a strong moral compass .
As their website states , " The mission of Passing the Baton is to move leader development to the forefront of the cultural agenda by identifying and mobilizing one million adults to personally equip the next generation of culture - shaping leaders .
"
You may also wish to explore other materials by Dr. Myers including his coaching curriculum , " Understanding the Times " , which is used in many private schools around the nation .
Kerby Anderson's , " Christian Ethics in Plain Language , " is also a terrific resource that provides the Judeo - Christian foundations on a variety of ethical issues .
The book is ideal for our time - pressed world .
Take the chapter on abortion :
In only 14 pages , Anderson gives us a history of this abhorrent practice , a brief description of the various abortion methods , and an array of arguments against the killing -- biblical , philosophical and medical .
Readers also get a section titled " Answers to Pro-Abortion Rhetoric " to help them discern when someone is trying to deceive through the use of clever words .
Parents will find the chapter on sexual ethics particularly helpful .
It includes information on teen sexuality , school based clinics , and sex education .
Anderson , the national director of Probe Ministries International , is well equipped to help develop the critical thinking skills that our young people desperately need .
An accomplished writer and co-host of the popular radio show , " Point of View " , Anderson knows how to communicate effectively and offers many resources at www.probe.org.
It takes but one generation for a nation to implode from believing lies and practicing moral relativism .
Our children need us to deliberately guide and teach them the truth that will keep them free .
" You 've got to be kidding . "
That 's what Don Stapley said as sheriff 's deputies arrested him September 21 in the county parking garage .
The county supervisor was so stunned , he said nearly the same thing , again , just a moment later : " You have got to be joking . "
Someone at the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office thought Stapley 's quote was sufficiently amusing to include in the press release announcing his arrest later that day .
It 's the sort of embarrassing detail these guys delight in providing to reporters : " This guy 's so arrogant , we came to arrest him on 100 criminal counts , and he thinks we 're kidding !
Can you believe it ? "
Info Joe Arpaio
But , two weeks later , the comment that once drew chuckles now seems downright prescient .
They had to be kidding — but they were not .
They actually arrested Don Stapley without an indictment , without a grand jury , without even consulting a prosecutor .
In fact , they cuffed a county supervisor and hauled him off to court without bothering to secure charges against him .
Two weeks after the chaos of the arrest , the situation is clear : Maricopa County is captive to the whims of a police force all too eager to use its powers to harass its enemies and distract us from its manifold failures .
Sheriff Joe Arpaio's men arrested Don Stapley not in the interest of justice , but to save face after a previous case against Stapley fell apart .
They made up an excuse to parade him in front of television cameras , then insinuated that he was guilty of all sorts of crimes they 'd never bothered to get an indictment for .
When the prosecutor ostensibly assigned to the case expressed reservation about those tactics , Arpaio 's BFF , Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas , suddenly appointed new prosecutors to go after Stapley .
Naturally , they were a pair of D.C. - based pundits more familiar with the Fox News studio than the politics of this county .
Surely , they must be kidding .
Don Stapley 's bizarre arrest two weeks ago was n't the first time that Sheriff Joe Arpaio and County Attorney Andrew Thomas sought to arrest the county supervisor .
It was merely the first time they succeeded .
Last December , a joint investigation by Thomas and Arpaio led to a 118 - count indictment against Stapley , a Republican representing the East Valley .
As I wrote at the time , the charges against Stapley were overkill :
He faced more than a decade in prison for what amounted to an error in paperwork .
Meanwhile , Sheriff Arpaio made the same mistakes , with no repercussions .
But if the indictment was fairly silly , well , at least in that case they bothered to get one .
In 2008 , procedure was followed : The Sheriff 's Office developed a case and brought it to the County Attorney 's Office , which took it to the grand jury , which issued an indictment .
As everyone knows , a grand jury will indict anything from a ham sandwich to a can of tuna fish — it 's not a sign of guilt .
But at least it forces the prosecutors to make a case .
Last December , after the indictment , Thomas ' office took the indictment to a judge , seeking a warrant for Stapley 's arrest .
The judge refused .
Stapley , after all , holds public office in the same county that was prosecuting him .
He was n't a flight risk .
Given a summons to court , the judge knew that he 'd surely turn himself in .
When , at the judge 's insistence , the summons was issued instead of an arrest warrant , go figure : Stapley did turn himself in .
The system worked just the way it was supposed to .
For everyone , that is , except Sheriff Arpaio and County Attorney Thomas .
Thanks to the judge 's denial , they missed their chance to parade a handcuffed Stapley past a leering mob of TV news crews .
In the news business , we call this a " perp walk . "
There 's no better way to humiliate a well - known defendant — or get free airtime for publicity - grubbing pols like Arpaio and Thomas .
But if Stapley did n't have to do the perp walk last December , well , the sheriff would see to it that Stapley was forced to do it eventually .
And on September 21 , Arpaio got his chance .
This time , there was no judge to speak on behalf of reason .
The sheriff had skipped that step .
He did it on a technicality :
An exception on the books allows cops to arrest a suspect , even if they have n't had time consult with a prosecutor .
It 's called a " probable cause arrest , " and the cops use it to , say , arrest people caught in the act of robbing a bank — or in the robbery 's immediate aftermath , when the suspect may well flee .
So the cop arrests the suspect and makes a " probable cause " statement : I think this man robbed a bank because I caught him standing outside it with $ 1 million in cash .
The prosecutors then have 48 hours to follow up with an indictment , or a direct complaint :
We , the State of Arizona , charge this man with bank robbery .
A probable cause arrest is rarely , if ever , made in a white - collar case .
In fact , the only one in recent decades that anyone in Arizona may recall was the Sheriff 's Office 's arresting the owners of this newspaper , Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin , for supposedly violating grand jury secrecy .
And we all know how that one turned out .
No matter what the allegations against Stapley , this arrest was outside the pale .
It takes months to build a case for fraudulent schemes , or perjury , or mortgage fraud .
No legitimate law enforcement agency would want to tip its hand by arresting a suspect before prosecutors were ready to act .
Yet that 's exactly what happened here .
The sheriff arrested Stapley , saying he had probable cause that the county supervisor had committed 93 felonies .
He provided an addendum to the court suggesting Stapley had a secret slush fund , that he 'd accepted contributions from political donors and failed to disclose them .
Suffice it to say , an " addendum " has no legal standing .
And these were exactly the kinds of complicated transactions that require a prosecutor 's levelheaded assessment .
But Sheriff Arpaio 's motive is n't building a strong criminal case .
The guy is all innuendo .
The Sheriff 's Office did n't arrest Stapley to bring him to court — after all , there were no charges , so there was no reason for him to be in court .
They arrested him simply to get their perp walk .
Forty - eight hours later , when no prosecutor proved willing to take the case on such short notice , it was as if the whole thing never happened .
The timing of Stapley 's made - for - TV arrest was no coincidence .
Just one week earlier , the sheriff 's case against Stapley had collapsed .
Remember that 2008 indictment ?
Remember those allegations that Stapley failed to list all his real estate holdings on county - mandated disclosure forms ?
As I first detailed in January , there 's compelling evidence that County Attorney Thomas began pursuing the case at the suggestion of his private lawyer , Leo Beus .
Beus was locked in decades - long litigation with Stapley 's business partner , an ex-con named Conley Wolfswinkel .
Beus was exploring the relationship between Wolfswinkel and Stapley at the time Thomas began his investigation .
In true form , however , Thomas and Arpaio barely bothered to examine that relationship before getting an indictment against Stapley .
They simply went for the low - hanging fruit of Stapley 's inaccurate paperwork — then hinted there was a lot more to come .
But that indictment was built on a foundation of sand , as Stapley 's lawyers quickly discovered .
As it turned out , the county had never officially voted to require the forms in question , at least not in a way that held up in a court of law .
Once Stapley 's lawyers pointed out that simple fact , the judge in the case threw out 51 of the charges .
And that put the whole case in jeopardy .
The entire indictment rested on the forms :
If they were n't technically required , the additional charges Thomas had slapped on Stapley ( like perjury , for filling them out incorrectly ) would hardly stand up in court .
By that point , Thomas had been forced to recuse himself .
Retired Navajo County Attorney Mel Bowers , working in conjunction with the Yavapai County Attorney , had taken over .
Once the bulk of the indictment was thrown out of court , Bowers was savvy enough to realize the case was in trouble .
On Friday , September 18 , Bowers asked the judge to dismiss the rest of the charges against Stapley , too .
For the case to continue , Bowers suggested in his filing , he'd have to get the appellate court to reverse the judge and say that the disclosure forms were legally mandated .
Barring a legal reversal of fortune , Stapley was home free .
Thomas and Arpaio , who 'd originally brought the charges to much fanfare , had some serious egg on their faces .
What to do ?
They could try to build another case against Stapley .
Armed with subpoenas that had allowed them to comb through Stapley 's bank records , Arpaio 's guys had uncovered a slush fund that ( at minimum ) raised questions .
But building a case takes skill and patience .
Arpaio 's guys had neither .
They arrested Stapley on the new charges on the very next working day after prosecutor Bowers ' filing .
Never mind that they had n't done their homework .
The arrest provided enough smoke and mirrors to distract TV viewers into thinking there was something there — that Stapley must have done something illegal .
It now seems almost certain that campaign finance laws do not apply to Stapley 's slush fund , as the sheriff insinuated .
We also know now that Stapley consulted a top lawyer before setting up the fund .
How much do you want to bet this whole thing turns out to be legal ?
But that likely wo n't matter .
As my colleague Ray Stern reported on our Valley Fever blog , the special prosecutor originally appointed to handle the charges against Stapley , Bowers , had expressed some chagrin with the way the September 21 arrest was handled .
So , surprise !
Even though County Attorney Thomas had supposedly recused himself from anything to do with Stapley 's criminal case , suddenly he was back on the stick .
Thomas appointed a pair of Washington , D.C. - based " special prosecutors " to handle the new allegations — basically ripping the case away from the skeptical Bowers and his cohorts in Yavapai .
And Thomas made a truly inspired choice to handle this one on his behalf .
Husband and wife Victoria Toensing and Joseph D. Di­Genova are both former Justice Department attorneys .
Like Arpaio , they volunteered for Mitt Romney 's presidential campaign .
But they 're best known for their regular appearances on cable television .
Slate.com described DiGenova as " a former prosecutor who goes for the soundbite " — and noted that he and Toensing seemed " to act as a conduit " for leaks from the office of Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr during his investigation of President Bill Clinton .
Indeed , DiGenova was famously convinced that Clinton was " investigating " the couple after they sided with Starr in l'affair Lewinksy .
As for Toensing , she subsequently made a name for herself by defending Robert Novak after he outed spook Valerie Plame .
DiGenova and Toensing are not the kind of lawyer you bring in to handle a case soberly and prudently .
They are the kind you bring in for a mud fight .
And mud fights — not successful criminal prosecutions — are what we 've all come to expect from Arpaio and Thomas .
In the past six years , this dynamic duo has proved that they 're all perp walk , no conviction .
Consider the arrests of New Times ' owners .
The sheriff had to realize that he'd never get a conviction for two guys who dared to publish the details of a subpoena that sought the identity of the paper 's online readers .
But Arpaio did n't care :
He wanted to get back at the newspaper owners who dared to defy him .
He also wanted to scare future critics into silence .
After Lacey and Larkin were arrested , the charges ( and the case against them ) evaporated the next day .
Then there 's Arpaio and Thomas ' much - vaunted anti-corruption task force , Operation MACE .
The pair announced MACE 's formation at a press conference 21/ 2 years ago , saying they were going to root out fraud at the Maricopa County Community College District and investigate Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard .
They later opened cases against State Senator Russell Jones and Supervisor Stapley .
The investigation into Goddard fizzled .
It 's now been " open " for almost three years without so much as a misdemeanor .
The community college investigation , too , has yielded nothing .
As for Jones , he was indicted on the pettiest of charges , which a judge quickly tossed .
Thomas and Arpaio appealed — only to lose again .
You'd think they'd get the hint , but no :
They 're begging to take the case to the Arizona Supreme Court .
They 've got to save face somehow .
Indeed , the only corruption MACE has prosecuted successfully to date is a case involving $ 60,000 in embezzlement at a rural fire district in the Harquahala Valley .
They hardly needed a task force for that .
The Arizona Republic reported that the Sheriff 's Office has nine full - time investigators assigned to MACE .
Nine !
The newspaper concluded that the anti-corruption task force cost $ 870,000 a year for personnel alone , with Thomas ' expenses on top of that .
Yet Arpaio and Thomas never found anything on Terry Goddard .
They never got anywhere with the college district .
They 've lost the Jones case twice already .
They 're batting one for five — and that one hit came against the political equivalent of the ' 62 Mets .
No wonder they had to bring in a pair of D.C. - based pundits to go after Don Stapley .
When your record is this disastrous , you 've got to do something to change the subject .

The opinions expressed are his own – There are times when silence can be as eloquent as words .
Take the case of Washington ’s reaction to announcements , in quick succession , from Mexico and Argentina of changes in their drug policies that run counter to America ’s own rigidly prohibitionist federal laws .
No U.S. expressions of dismay or alarm .
Contrast that with three years ago , when Mexico was close to enacting timid reforms almost identical to those that became effective on August 21 .
In 2006 , shouts of shock and horror from the administration of George W. Bush reached such a pitch that the then Mexican president , Vicente Fox , abruptly vetoed a bill his own party had written and he had supported .
What has changed ?
Was it a matter of something happening in August , when most of official Washington is on holiday ?
Or was it a sign of greater American readiness to rethink a war on drugs that has , in almost four decades , failed to curb production and stifle consumption of illicit drugs ?
And that despite law enforcement efforts that resulted in an average of around 4,700 arrests for drug offences every single day since the beginning of the millennium .
( Just under 40 percent of those arrests are for possession of marijuana ) .
Or was it a matter of more countries realising that , as drug reform advocate Ethan Nadelmann puts it , “ looking to the United States as a role model for drug control is like looking to apartheid - era South Africa for how to deal with race . ”
Nadelmann heads the Drug Policy Alliance , one of several groups lobbying for reform of U.S. drug policies .
Under the Mexican law that took effect in August , it is legal to possess small , precisely specified amounts , for personal use , of marijuana , heroin , opium , cocaine , methamphetamine and LSD .
In Argentina , the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional criminal sanctions for the possession of small quantities of marijuana for personal use .
The ruling opened the door to legislation similar to Mexico’s .
Brazil decriminalised drug possession in 2006 ; Ecuador is likely to follow suit this year .
In much of Europe , drug use ( as opposed to drug trafficking ) is treated as an administrative offence rather than a criminal act .
America ’s hard - line approach has helped to make the United States the country with the world ’s largest prison population .
Advocates of more flexible policies say they feel the winds of change beginning to rise in the administration of Barack Obama , a president who has admitted that in his youth , he smoked marijuana frequently and used “ a little blow ” ( of cocaine ) when he could afford it .
But hopes for a break from long - standing orthodoxy might be premature , even though a recent Zogby poll showed 52 percent support for treating marijuana as a legal , taxed and regulated drug .
AMSTERDAM’S SCHIZOPHRENIC PRAGMATISM
“ As regards to legalization , it is not in the president ’s vocabulary and it is not in mine , ” Obama ’s drug czar , former Seattle police chief Gil Kerlikowske said in July .
“ Marijuana is dangerous and has no medicinal benefits .
” Oddly , he made the statement in California , where an estimated 250,000 people can legally buy marijuana with a letter of recommendation from their physician .
The drug is used for a variety of illnesses , from chronic pain to insomnia and depression .
There is extensive academic literature on the medical benefits of marijuana .
Medical opinion , however , conflicts with the congressionally - mandated job description Kerlikowske inherited when he took up the post .
It says that the director of the Office of National Drug Policy , the White House group in charge of drug war strategy , must “ oppose any attempt to legalize the use of a substance listed in schedule I of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act .
” Schedule I of the act , which took force in 1970 during the administration of Richard Nixon , the president who formally declared “ war on drugs ” , places marijuana alongside powerfully addictive drugs such as heroin .
The wrong - headed classification matches that of an international treaty , the 1961 United Nations Single Convention of Narcotics Drugs .
The convention is a major obstacle for signatory countries that want to legalize drugs .
No country has actually done that .
Even the Netherlands , the Mecca of marijuana aficionados , operates on a system best described as schizophrenic pragmatism .
Amsterdam ’s “ coffee shops ” are allowed to have 500 grams of marijuana on the premises and sell no more than 5 grams per person to people over 18 .
The runners who re-supply the shops routinely carry more than the legal quantity and violate the law .
So do importers .
While the failure of the drug war and the prohibitionist ideology that drives it have been analysed in great detail in scores of sober assessments by academics and government commissions , there have been few studies of the “ how to ” of legalization .
What , for example , would happen to the criminal mafias that are now running a violent illicit business with a turnover estimated at more than $ 300 billion a year ?
Some drug traffickers would switch to other criminal activities and it is realistic to expect increases in such areas as cyber crime and extortion , according to Steve Rolles , Head of Research of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation , a British think tank .
“ But the big picture will undoubtedly show a significant net fall in overall criminal activity in the longer term , ” he said in an interview .
“ Getting rid of illegal drug markets is about reducing opportunities for crime .
” Rolles is author of the optimistically titled “ After the war on drugs : Blueprint for Regulation , ” a book scheduled for publication in November and meant to kickstart a debate on what he sees as something of a blank slate – the specifics of regulation for currently illegal drugs .
On a global scale , nothing much can happen unless there are changes in the world ’s largest and most lucrative market for drugs , the United States .
If they happen , they wo n’t happen fast .
“ I see this as a multi- generational effort , with incremental changes , ” said Nadelmann , who has been involved in drug policy since he taught at Princeton University in the late 1980s .
“ But for the first time , I feel I have the wind in my back and not in my face .

Human Rights commissioner Rosslyn Noonan says a new law giving non-police agencies greater powers to snoop is " chilling " and " disproportionately invasive " .
The Search and Surveillance Bill , now before the justice and electoral select committee , sets out the powers police have to search and monitor people , but also extends powers to other agencies , such as the Commerce Commission and local authorities .
They will be able to secure warrants to use surveillance devices , such as cameras , search computers remotely and search vehicles without a warrant .
Ms Noonan said those agencies needed to justify having extra powers .
" It 's quite chilling , really .
In New Zealand we have the police force , which most New Zealanders have considerable trust and respect for ... with most of these other agencies the community as a whole would n't even know who they are and suddenly they have got all these powers . "
She conceded the legislation needed to be updated but said many of the powers were disproportionately invasive given the agencies ' responsibilities .
Other legal experts say the new powers , based on a 2007 Law Commission report , could be vulnerable to abuse .
Ralph Simpson , partner in commercial law firm Bell Gully , said police were trained and reasonably responsible in the use of surveillance powers , but other agencies were not qualified .
Agencies in Britain had received similar powers and had abused them , with some councils using surveillance devices " to detect dogs crapping on other people 's lawns " , he said .
Non-police agencies did not need surveillance powers and the police could do it for them if needed , he said .
" Why does the Overseas Investment Office need the ability to search my car ?
" If you look at local government or the Commerce Commission , why do they need access to put video cameras or listening devices on private property ?
It 's a pretty significant invasion of property . "
Surveillance devices should be used on private property only to gather evidence on serious offending , he said .
Council for Civil Liberties spokesman Michael Bott said the extension of extra powers to these agencies raised serious concerns .
" Have these state agencies got Bill of Rights training and are they rights - sensitive ?
Have they got police training and institutional knowledge ? "
A provision allowing police to require people to answer questions was " repugnant " , he said .
Police Association vice - president Chris Cahill said it was important that agencies had powers to investigate in areas police could not , but they would need to be trained and use those powers appropriately .
The bill would also allow police to search without warrants if they thought there was evidence of a serious crime punishable by 14 years ' jail or more , and that any delay could mean evidence was destroyed ; and to detain a person at the scene of a search .
SNOOP AND SEIZE
Agencies such as the Commerce Commission and the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry will be able to :
Obtain warrants to use surveillance and tracking devices
Ask a person to consent to a search of themselves , a place or vehicle .
Detain a person during a search of a place or vehicle Seize items in " plain view " without a warrant Stop and search vehicles without a warrant .

A justice of the peace in northern Louisiana has refused to grant a marriage license to an interracial couple because he believes it would harm any children born of that relationship .
“ I ’m not a racist , ” Keith Bardwell , justice of the peace in the state ’s Tangihapoa Parish , told the Hammond , Louisiana , Daily Star .
“ I do ceremonies for black couples right here in my house .
My main concern is for the children . ”

The Louisiana chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is calling the justice ’s move “ tragic and illegal . ”
The Hammond Daily Star reports :
Beth Humphrey , 30 , said she and her boyfriend , Terence McKay , 32 , both of Hammond , intend to consult the US Justice Department about filing a discrimination complaint .
Humphrey said she called Bardwell Oct. 6 to inquire about getting a marriage license signed .
She said Bardwell ’s wife told her that Bardwell will not sign marriage licenses for interracial couples .
The paper quotes the justice of the peace as saying that “ 99 percent of the time ” an interracial couple will consist of a black man and white woman , and “ I find that rather confusing . ”
Evidently , Bardwell has long had a policy of not marrying interracial couples , and admitted that Louisiana ’s attorney general had warned him years ago that he could “ get into trouble ” because of it .

“ I told him if I do , I ’ll resign , ” Bardwell told the Daily Star .
“ I have rights too .
I ’m not obligated to do that just because I ’m a justice of the peace . ”
Bardwell said that neither black nor white society accepts the offspring of an interracial couple , and the children suffer as a result .
He also stated that interracial families are unstable , and the children of these families often end up in the care of grandparents .
“ In my heart , I feel the children will later suffer , ” he said , adding that “ if he does an interracial marriage for one couple , he must do the same for all , ” the Daily Star writes .

“ I try to treat everyone equally , ” he said .
Humphrey and McKay are considering filing a discrimination complaint with the US Justice Department .

A teenaged artist who was forced to stop selling his collages when Damien Hirst sent threats to his gallery ( the collages incorporated ironic images of Hirst 's diamond - encrusted skull sculpture ) is now facing a possible jail sentence because he took a box of pencils from a Hirst installation as a prank and offered to return them only if Hirst would let him go back to displaying and selling his art .
Hirst claims the box of pencils — Faber Castell Mongol 482s from 1990 — is worth GBP500,000 , making this one of the gravest modern art thefts in British history .
Taking revenge , Cartrain took the box of pencils that were part of Hirst 's sculpture , Pharmacy , which was being shown as part of its Classified exhibition that closed at the end of last month .
He then created a " wanted " - style poster that read : " For the safe return of Damien Hirst 's pencils I would like my artworks back that DACS and Hirst took off me in November .
It 's not a large demand …
Hirst has until the end of this month to resolve this or on 31 July the pencils will be sharpened .
He has been warned . "
Yesterday , Cartrain told The Independent : " I went to the Tate Britain and by chance had a golden opportunity to borrow a packet of pencils from the Pharmacy exhibit .
That same day I made up a fake police appeal poster advertising that the pencils had been removed from the Tate and that if anyone had any information they should contact the police on the phone number advertised .
" A few weeks later I went out and I returned home to find out the art and antiques squad from New Scotland Yard had called round with a warrant for my arrest … "
But that is not the end of it .
Police also arrested Cartrain 's 49 - year - old father , who they suspected of harbouring the pencils .
" Initially , we arrested his dad but it soon became clear that it was his son who was responsible , " said a police source .
" We arranged to arrest him by appointment .
The act of theft was clearly a stunt to gain publicity . "
In the next few years , the VASIMR ion engine could be used to boost the space station ’s orbit ( Illustration : Ad Astra Rocket Company )
Rockets that would use charged particles to propel super - fast missions to Mars are one step closer , now that a small - scale prototype has been demonstrated at full power .
The ion engine may be used to maintain the orbit of the International Space Station within the next five years , and could lay the groundwork for rockets that could one day travel to Mars in about a month .
Since 2005 , the Ad Astra Rocket Company of Webster , Texas , has been working to perfect a type of engine it calls VASIMR ( Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket ) .
It uses radio waves to heat argon gas , turning it into a hot plasma – a state of matter in which electrons are no longer bound to atomic nuclei .
Magnetic fields then squirt the superheated plasma out the back of the engine , producing thrust in the opposite direction .
Advertisement
It shoots the propellant out at much higher velocity than conventional engines , resulting in far more acceleration per kilogram of fuel consumed .
In the near term , the company hopes to use a 200 - kilowatt VASIMR engine to provide periodic boosts to the orbit of the International Space Station ( ISS ) , which gradually drops in altitude due to atmospheric drag .
Now , the company has run such an engine at full power for the first time .
On Wednesday , it ran its VX - 200 engine at 201 kilowatts in a vacuum chamber in Houston , passing the 200 - kilowatt mark for the first time .
NASA deal
“ It ’s the most powerful plasma rocket in the world right now , ” says Franklin Chang - Diaz , the former NASA astronaut who heads the company .
The nearest thing to a competitor is NASA ’s 50 - kilowatt Hall thruster , an engine based on accelerating electrically charged atoms , or ions , that the agency stopped developing in 2005 due to budget cuts .
Ad Astra has signed an agreement with NASA to test a 200 - kilowatt VASIMR engine on the ISS in 2013 .
The company is talking to two space firms , SpaceX and Orbital Sciences , about the possibility of delivering the engine to the ISS on one of their launch vehicles .
If the tests go well , the company hopes to offer regular boosts to the space station ’s orbit on a commercial basis starting the following year .
More efficient
Previously , spacecraft – including Russian and European cargo ships – have provided these boosts by firing their engines while docked with the space station .
But with conventional thrusters , the boosts consume 7.5 tonnes of propellant each year .
VASIMR could do the same job with just 0.3 tonnes of argon per year , Chang - Diaz says .
Since it is expensive to launch fuel into orbit , that could save millions of dollars per year , he says .
The revenue generated by the ISS boosts would help the company “ make the technology better and enable human missions to Mars ” , Chang - Diaz told New Scientist .
Less radiation
A 10 - to 20 - megawatt class VASIMR engine could propel human missions to Mars in as little as 39 days , he says , compared to the six months or more required with conventional rockets .
The shorter trip would reduce astronaut exposure to space radiation , which could otherwise be a major barrier for human missions to Mars , especially given signs that radiation levels may be particularly high in coming decades .
Propelling fast trips to Mars may one day be very profitable for the company , says Chang - Diaz .
“ But for now , profit is not at Mars , it ’s closer to Earth , ” he says .
We all know that feeling .
Friday night , quitting time .
You ’re hot , sweaty , tired , and all you want is to do is go home to a nice pair of big , full , smooth …
beers !
Unfortunately for some of us , this is n’t as easy as it sounds .
When you live in a dry county , the closest beer you can find is sometimes hours away .
In this instance , a beer run becomes necessary .
In case you are not familiar with a beer run , it ’s basically where a bunch of guys get in a car and drive to the closest wet county to buy alcohol .
Why , you may be asking yourself , is it necessary for more than one person to go ?
This is simply because dry counties normally have a limit on how much beer one person is allowed to possess at a time .
One particular town in Kentucky only allows two twelve packs per adult over 21 .
If you get caught with more than the allowed limit in your home or car , the fine is hefty .
Therefore , the more people you can get to go on the beer run , the more beer you will be allowed to buy and bring back into the dry county with you .
As we all know , the more beer , the better .
Because there are few things that can cause more chaos than a pack of thirsty men making a road trip , we here at Gunaxin have decided to provide a list of rules for you poor fellows who must endure the weekly beer run .
While there ’s nothing that can make those hours between quitting time and your first beer any easier to handle , we hope these guidelines will at least make them a little more organized .
Rule numero uno :
If you ca n’t buy beer , you ca n’t go .
You ’ve just reached that magical age where you can legally buy yourself a tall cold one .
Unfortunately , your girlfriend still has three months before she turns 21 .
Do n’t even think about asking your buddies if she can tag along on a beer run .
If this means she gets mad and you have to stay behind as well , we ’re sorry .
There ’s no sense in filling a space with somebody who cannot contribute to the final beer tally .
Number 2 :
Everybody has to buy the limit in beer .
If you ’re allowed twenty four beers each , then all of you must buy twenty four beers each .
The point of a beer run is to get as much beer back into Dry County Hell as you legally can .
This is n’t going to happen if some cheapskate wants to save money and buy just one or two beers .
Each person can , however , buy the brand (s ) of their choice .
Number 3 :
If somebody buys the cheapest , watered down garbage in the store , the guys who sprung for the good stuff are NOT obligated to share with him .
Number 4 :
Take turns being the sober driver .
In case the gang decides to stop in a bar and have a few before returning home with their loot , you ’re going to need a sober driver .
This poor fellow has to wait until he gets home before enjoying his beer , so everybody must take their turn .
Number 5 :
If this is your first beer run , you are the sober driver .
Call it paying your dues .
If there is n’t a new guy , turns progress in whatever order you choose .
Number 6 :
Passenger / room - for - beer ratio is imporatant .
You want enough room to take as many people as possible , yet you still need space to put the beer .
Think extended cab pick ups , SUVs and cars with large trunks .
If you ’ve got the best vehicle for the job , you are obligated allow it to be used for beer runs every week , even if you have to miss a run .
Number 7 :
The sober driver only pays half his share for the beer , as does the person whose vehicle you ’re using .
The other half is split amongst everybody else .
If the sober driver is driving his own vehicle , his beer is free .
Number 8 :
The owner of the vehicle pays for gas , no matter who is driving .
Number 9 :
Once you ’re home , everybody retains custody of the beer they bought .
Ideally , this beer will last until the next beer run .
This , however , is sometimes not an easy task .
While you are not obligated to share with your beerless buddies mid-week , remember the golden beer rule :
“ Giveth of thy beer freely , and you shall avoid thirst in your own times of need . ”
MILAN ( Reuters ) - The United States has no alternative to oil to meet its massive energy needs and should recognize its energy interdependence with the Middle East , Saudi Arabia ’s Prince Turki al - Faisal wrote in an article on Friday .
U.S. President Barack Obama has been pushing to boost green energy which cuts emissions of heat - trapping gases and reduces the use of fossil fuels .
In his election campaign , Obama raised some potentially disturbing issues for the Saudis , such as ending dependence on Middle Eastern oil .
In the article translated into Italian and published by Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore , Turki said energy independence was an unrealistic , groundless and harmful concept which was likely to re-emerge once economic recovery pushed oil prices up .
“ There is no technology on the horizon which can replace oil to satisfy colossal needs of U.S. industry , transport and armed forces .
Any future scenario will be characterized by mix of renewable and non-renewable energies whether you like it or not , ” Turki said .
His criticism comes as the U.S. Senate is working on a wide - ranging energy and environmental bill aimed to put limits on the amount of greenhouse gases that big industries are allowed to emit .
Turki , a former Saudi intelligence chief and envoy to Washington and London , said the United States , the world ’s biggest energy consumer , should put aside the rhetoric of energy independence and instead recognize interdependence of energy producers and consumers .
“ Whether you like it or not , the destinies of the United States and Saudi Arabia are linked and will remain ( linked ) for decades , ” he said .
The United States is the biggest trading partner for the world ’s biggest oil exporter .
Two valuable works of art looted by the Nazis during World War II have been discovered at Southern Methodist University ( SMU ) , which is the future home of the George W. Bush Presidential Library .
The pair of paintings on display at SMU 's Meadows Museum rendered by Spanish artist Bartolome Esteban Murillo of Seville 's Patron Saints Justa and Rufina , estimated to be worth more than $ 10 million , are believed to have been stolen from the Rothschild family in Paris in 1941 .
The Monuments Men Foundation ( MMF ) , an organization that raises awareness of efforts made to preserve cultural items looted and damaged by the Nazi regime , made the announcement in a press release .
MMF said the paintings were previously identified as stolen when they were located in Germany and Austria at the end of World War II .
Bush awarded the group the 2007 National Humanities Medal at the White House for its overall work .
The former president 's office declined to comment on the story .
" The Monuments Men Foundation is proud to announce that after more than two and a half years of effort , University officials at SMU / Meadows Museum have now publicly acknowledged the correct provenance of these two paintings by Murillo , " MMF founder and president Robert Edsel said in a statement .
Edsel said that the museum on the university 's Dallas campus has recognized the Nazi theft of the artwork on their website on the museum 's website and endorsed " best practices " with regard to stolen items .
" While we congratulate University officials on taking this important step , we underscore the importance of their completing provenance research on the entire collection and publicizing those results , " he added .
He also urged the museum to add the art to a American Association of Museums database that allows victims of Nazi looting to have a fair chance to locate and recover their belongings .
Edsel said that the foundation is still working to prove the Rothschild family was properly repaid by Dallas oilman Algur Hurtle Meadows , who endowed the museum in 1965 .
According to the release , Nazi code evidencing Rothschild ownership is still visible on one of the paintings ; it appears to have been rubbed off the other .

It Sure Smells Like a Right Wing Zionist Cabal at The Daily Kos Hi ,
In 1998 I began to practice The Presence of God as laid out in a book by Brother Lawrence , a monk of the 17th century .
Learn More :
THAT DAY Prior to that I was a Stephens Minister [ a prayerful person who listens with their heart to another who is trying to discern what God is asking of them ] and afterward a one year student in an Episcopal - Methodist Formation Program for Spiritual Directors .
I knew going into the program that I would NOT be hanging out a shingle as an SD ; that I was there for the curriculum ; studying the saints and ways of prayer .
That is also when I began to write creative spiritual literature .
Before 9/11 , I did not give too much thought for another beyond my rural community .
I was apolitical , thought the world had already gone mad and there was nothing much anyone could do or say to change it .
I lived a simple contended life in the rural South and have always been grateful to be an American .
But after 9/11 , I wanted to learn why did a few - and back then it was but a few - people in the world hated Americans so much that they could cold bloodedly murder innocent people .
I also wanted to do some good in the world and that led me to the Interfaith Olive Trees Foundation for Peace and then to journey seven times into Israel Palestine as of June 2009 .
When I was a child , my dream was to grow up and become Brenda Starr , the red headed , ace investigative journalist , who was smarter than the guys , glamorous and headstrong .
Star reporter for the metropolitan daily , The Flash , the fictional Brenda traveled the world solving mysteries and unearthing scoops .
Brenda intuitively knew when somebody was not telling the truth .
Brenda boldly went around the world searching for unusual and usually dangerous stories .

Keep Hope Alive is based on the memories of a 1948 Palestinian Muslim refugee from the Galilee , who does not have Jesus is his head ; but in his heart and actions .
Keep Hope
Alive is also my spiritual journey as a child of the ' 60's and a brief history of what happened to the indigenous people of the Holy Land after civilized white men carved it up in 1947 - see map below .
I entitled my second book ; Memoirs of a Nice Irish American Girls Life in Occupied Territory : Third Intifada / Uprising : Nonviolent , But with Words Sharper than a Two - Edged Sword , because the following words ran through my head all during my fourth journey to Palestine in November 2006 :
 The word of God is living and active .
Sharper than a two - edged sword , it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit , joints and marrow ; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart .
Nothing in all creation is hidden from Gods sight .
Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him whom we must give account .

The Home Office Identity and Passport Service has announced :
Home Secretary appoints first Identity Commissioner
14 September 2009
The first Identity Commissioner , Sir Joseph Pilling , was confirmed today by the Home Secretary Alan Johnson .
The first Identity Commissioner , Sir Joseph Pilling , was confirmed today by the Home Secretary Alan Johnson .
He will take up his appointment on 1 October 2009 in time for the issue of the first identity cards to people in Greater Manchester .
The new Identity Commissioner will act independently and on behalf of the public to ensure that information held on the National Identity Register is accurate and secure as well as monitoring the use identity cards are put to by both public and private sectors .
Home Secretary Alan Johnson said :
" I am pleased to announce the appointment of Sir Joseph Pilling as the first Identity Commissioner .
" The public has the right to expect the National Identity Service to be run to the highest standards .
The Identity Commissioner will champion their interests , providing a strong and independent voice , holding the Identity and Passport Service to account and ensuring information collected under the Service is kept securely .
" He will also deliver independent scrutiny of the uses to which identity cards are put by public authorities and private organisations . "
Sir Joseph Pilling said :
" I am delighted to accept this post , and plan to be an independent voice in my work towards safeguarding the public 's privacy and identity rights , as Parliament intended .
" In the early weeks and months as I work out how best to do the job I intend to listen to the people across the National Identity Service and to people outside the system with views about my new role . "
Pointfree notation is often the most elegant way to write a function in Haskell .
Put simply , any time you write code such as :
foo x = f ( g ( h x ) )
Or , if you are a dollar fan :
foo x = f $ g $ h x
You can rewrite it as :
foo = f . g . h
Consider this example of a function composition from Neil Mitchell that finds the mode ( most common element ) of a list :
mostCommon :: Ord a = > [ a ] -> a mostCommon = head .
maximumBy ( comparing length ) .
group .
sort
A nice composition of four functions .
Each function in that pipeline of functions is taking a single input and producing a single output , which is then fed into the next function .
This pipeline of pure functions is analogous to a pipeline of communicating processes — each taking a single input and sending on a single output to the next process .
So is there an easy way of converting such function pipelines into process pipelines ?
The answer is yes — by using arrows .
Even if you are a Haskell programmer , you may not be familiar with arrows .
They can be used to express these input and output compositions .
We can convert our function pipeline to use arrow notation by just changing the composition operator :
mostCommonArr1 :: Ord a = > [ a ] -> a mostCommonArr1 = head <<< maximumBy ( comparing length ) <<< group <<< sort
This is because by good design / happy accident , a function does not need any special annotation to become part of an arrow .
If we want to be more general , we must use the arr function to convert pure functions into arrows :
mostCommonArr2 :: Ord a = > [ a ] -> a mostCommonArr2 = arr head <<< arr ( maximumBy ( comparing length ) ) <<< arr group <<< arr sort
A bit more cumbersome perhaps , but we have n’t changed the original too much — the pipeline of the four functions is still visibly there .
Now that we have our function pipeline expressed in terms of arrows , changing to a process pipeline is a relatively simple matter .
You ’ll need to import the Control .
Concurrent .CHP .
Arrow module , and then re-type the pipeline to be a CHP process with channels , and stick runPipeline on the front :
mostCommonArrProc :: Ord a => Chanin [ a ] ->
Chanout a -> CHP ( ) mostCommonArrProc = runPipeline $ arr head <<< arr ( maximumBy ( comparing length ) ) <<< arr group <<< arr sort
And that ’s it .
The function here is now a communicating pipeline of four functions , wrapped up into one .
mostCommonArrProc will sit there waiting to be sent a list of items , and once it has been , it will output the most common element of the list .
So we ’ve re-used our simple pure - function pipeline as a pipeline of communicating processes , with only a little change in notation .
Note : Since base - 4 , Arrow has become based on Category , which means you can actually express the function using the original dot composition , like so :
mostCommonCatProc :: Ord a => Chanin [ a ] ->
Chanout a -> CHP ( ) mostCommonCatProc = runPipeline $ arr head . arr ( maximumBy ( comparing length ) ) . arr group .
arr sort
I prefer the <<< notation of the arrows , as I think it better expresses a pipeline of processes — and it does n’t require base - 4 .
One Nation , the party which burst onto the political scene 12 years ago , looks set to end its controversial run with a whimper .
The Electoral Commission is again threatening to de-register the party , arguing it does not have the minimum 500 members or a serving representative in Parliament .
Rosa Lee Long was the last standing One Nation MP but she lost her seat in Queensland 's state election in March , and that put the entire party 's future in doubt .
" The Electoral Commission , as we know , has always ... picked on One Nation , " Ms Lee Long said .
" We are always being asked to show cause or prove this or prove that .
Ever since we started out as a party , there has always been , I think , undue microscopic looking into the party , so to speak .
" [ The commission has been ] trying to de-register us and get rid of us for a long , long time .
We first started out in about 1997 .
It is now 2009 , so that is 12 years , is n't it ? "
One Nation secretary Rod Evans insists the party has the numbers and a future .
" In fact , we submitted over 600 members ' names .
My understanding was that they would contact a selection , " he said .
" In this case they contacted apparently 500 plus ; 170 have responded , which means of course that the others whom we submitted either did n't bother to respond or omitted to do so within the time frame . "
But even if One Nation survives this latest battle , Ms Lee Long says lots of grass roots members are giving up .
" People do get tired of fighting .
There is no doubt about that , " she said .
" We all seem to be going down the gurgler and that is just hard to watch , but generally speaking , in the end it is up to the people .
" We are the employers and the politicians are our employees , and if the employers keep putting these employees in those positions ... if they keep voting for that , well goodness gracious , it does n't say much for the political intelligence of a lot of Australians . "
Dirty tricks
As well as blaming the public for not voting for the anti-immigration , anti-economic liberalisation party , Ms Lee Long says dirty tricks by the major parties are to blame for One Nation 's demise .
" They all come out from their various corners and attacked us and took us to court time after time after time , until the bit of money that we did get was all spent basically on court cases , and then they deregistered it , " she said .
" It came from the federal perspective and then it came from the state perspective , when Pauline [ Hanson ] was thrown in jail , which was absolutely ridiculous in my opinion . "
One Nation 's fiery redhead founder , Pauline Hanson , was jailed for electoral fraud and then acquitted .
But she is no longer a member of the party that experts believe is in its death throes .
Political commentator Scott Prasser says One Nation had a big high in 1998 but since then it has all been downhill for a number of reasons .
" Poor leadership I think was one thing .
Lack of consistency of purpose - what exactly did One Nation stand for ? " he said .
" I think it attracted a wide variety of different people with different interests and it was very hard to keep that together as a force . "
Professor Prasser believes even if One Nation does survive this latest challenge , it will only last another couple of years .
" We are seeing the decline of another minor party just like the Democratic Labor Party ... the Australian Democrats of course still going but a pale shadow of their former selves , " he said .
" It is very hard for minor parties to survive in the long term .
They must have a very particular niche and I think the Greens have got that particular niche . "
Michael Owen was last night ruled out of contention for Fabio Capello 's England squad on the same day that he declared his intention to revive his international career .
The Manchester United striker limped out of the Champions League victory over Wolfsburg after just 20 minutes with Fabio Capello in the Old Trafford stands .
Owen , 29 , was always a long shot for the World Cup qualifiers against Ukraine on 10 October and Belarus four days ' later but Capello 's presence at the game suggested that the England manager was at least prepared to give him a chance .
Instead Owen faces three weeks on the sidelines recovering from another groin injury .
Sir Alex Ferguson played down fears about Owen 's long - term durability last night although it will not have escaped his attention that taking penalties against journalists at an event for sponsor Tissot on Monday will not have been the ideal rest for such an injury - prone player .
In Cyprus , Chelsea also went top of their group with a Nicolas Anelka goal enough to beat Apoel Nicosia .

Owen said yesterday before the game that he was " passionate as ever " about playing for England .
Last night was just his third start for the club since he joined in the summer .
Ferguson said : " He felt his groin in training on Sunday and he trained a little bit on Monday , had a rest on Tuesday and he thought he was fine .
Groins are groins and on a wet surface like that he 's turned quickly , it has gone again and we 've had to take him off .
It 's not serious , but groin injuries can be troublesome and it could be two to three weeks . "
The goals from Ryan Giggs and Michael Carrick after Edin Dzeko's opener for Wolfsburg shocked Old Trafford won the game for United .
In Nicosia , Anelka scored the only goal of the game after 18 minutes but even so Carlo Ancelotti was very critical of his players at half - time .
Ancelotti said : " I agree it was a good result it was n't a good performance .
We started with good control , scored a goal , and we had opportunities to do quick counter - attacks after that , but we did n't do this .
" I 'm not satisfied .
I wanted Chelsea to play better and to take more control , to play with courage .
But I think that , in this moment of the season , it 's normal .
We have to change , for sure , and I think the players did good work .
They ran a lot on the pitch , but we have to play better .
This is normal . "
The best league in the world is back .

Like the robotic rovers Spirit and Opportunity , which wheeled tirelessly across the dusty surface of Mars , a new robot spent most of July traveling across the muddy ocean bottom , about 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) off the California coast .
This robot , the Benthic Rover , has been providing scientists with an entirely new view of life on the deep seafloor .
It will also give scientists a way to document the effects of climate change on the deep sea .
The Rover is the result of four years of hard work by a team of engineers and scientists led by MBARI project engineer Alana Sherman and marine biologist Ken Smith .
About the size and weight of a small compact car , the Benthic Rover moves very slowly across the seafloor , taking photographs of the animals and sediment in its path .
Every three to five meters ( 10 to 16 feet ) the Rover stops and makes a series of measurements on the community of organisms living in the seafloor sediment .
These measurements will help scientists understand one of the ongoing mysteries of the ocean — how animals on the deep seafloor find enough food to survive .
Most life in the deep sea feeds on particles of organic debris , known as marine snow , which drift slowly down from the sunlit surface layers of the ocean .
But even after decades of research , marine biologists have not been able to figure out how the small amount of nutrition in marine snow can support the large numbers of organisms that live on and in seafloor sediment .
The Benthic Rover carries two experimental chambers called " benthic respirometers " that are inserted a few centimeters into the seafloor to measure how much oxygen is being consumed by the community of organisms within the sediment .
This , in turn , allows scientists to calculate how much food the organisms are consuming .
At the same time , optical sensors on the Rover scan the seafloor to measure how much food has arrived recently from the surface waters .
MBARI researchers have been working on the Benthic Rover since 2005 , overcoming many challenges along the way .
The most obvious challenge was designing the Rover to survive at depths where the pressure of seawater is about 420 kilograms per square meter ( 6,000 pounds per square inch ) .
To withstand this pressure , the engineers had to shield the Rover 's electronics and batteries inside custom - made titanium pressure spheres .
To keep the Rover from sinking into the soft seafloor mud , the engineers outfitted the vehicle with large yellow blocks of buoyant foam that will not collapse under extreme pressure .
This foam gives the Rover , which weighs about 1,400 kilograms ( 3,000 pounds ) in air , a weight of only about 45 kilograms ( 100 pounds ) in seawater .

Other engineering challenges required less high - tech solutions .
In constructing the Rover 's tractor - like treads , the design team used a decidedly low - tech material — commercial conveyor belts .
After watching the Benthic Rover on the seafloor using MBARI 's remotely operated vehicles ( ROVs ) , however , the researchers discovered that the belts were picking up mud and depositing it in front of the vehicle , where it was contaminating the scientific measurements .
In response , the team came up with a low - tech but effective solution : they removed the heads from two push brooms and bolted them onto the vehicle so that the stiff bristles would clean off the treads as they rotated .
The team also discovered that whenever the Rover moved , it stirred up a cloud of sediment like the cloud of dust that follows the character " Pig - Pen " in the Charlie Brown comic strip .
This mud could have affected the Rover 's measurements .
To reduce this risk , the engineers programmed the Rover to move very , very slowly — about one meter ( 3 feet ) a minute .
The Rover is also programmed to sense the direction of the prevailing current , and only move in an up - current direction , so that any stirred - up mud will be carried away from the front of the vehicle .
In its basic configuration , the Benthic Rover is designed to operate on batteries , without any human input .
However , during its month - long journey this summer , the Rover was connected by a long extension cord to a newly - completed underwater observatory .
This observatory , known as the Monterey Accelerated Research System ( MARS ) , provided power for the robot , as well as a high - speed data link back to shore .
According to Sherman , " Hooking up the Rover to the observatory opened up a whole new world of interactivity .
Usually when we deploy the Rover , we have little or no communication with the vehicle .
We drop it overboard , cross our fingers , and hope that it works . "
In this case , however , the observatory connection allowed MBARI researchers to fine tune the Rover 's performance and view its data , videos , and still images in real time .
Sherman recalls , " One weekend I was at home , with my laptop on the kitchen table , controlling the vehicle and watching the live video from 900 meters below the surface of Monterey Bay .
It was amazing ! "
Later this fall , the Rover will be sent back down to the undersea observatory site in Monterey Bay for a two - month deployment .
Next year the team hopes to take the Rover out to a site about 220 km ( 140 miles ) offshore of Central California .
They will let the Rover sink 4,000 meters down to the seafloor , where it will make measurements on its own for six months .
The team would also like to take the Rover to Antarctica , to study the unique seafloor ecosystems there .
The Rover may also be hooked up to a proposed deep - water observatory several hundred miles off the coast of Washington state .
In addition to answering some key questions of oceanography , the Benthic Rover will help researchers study the effects of climate change in the ocean .
As the Earth 's atmosphere and oceans become warmer , even life in the deep sea will be affected .
The Benthic Rover , and its possible successors , will help researchers understand how deep - sea communities are changing over time .
Just as the rovers Spirit and Opportunity gave us dramatic new perspectives on the planet Mars , so the Benthic Rover is giving researchers new perspectives of a dark world that is in some ways more mysterious than the surface of the distant red planet .

It is easy to create Javascript objects , but this method goes one step further by allowing you to create a Javascript object with private and public methods , as well as private variables .
It ’s a perfect way to create a single access point for Javascript and Flash to communicate .
The project I ’m currently working on requires heavy interaction between a Flash object and the HTML / DOM .
Links on the page need to call methods on the Flash object , and events in the Flash object need to trigger actions on the page .
I decided to create a DOM / Flash Connector in Javascript that would expose all of the methods that each can call into the other .
I wanted it to be fully encapsulated , and as object oriented as possible .
One example of what it needed to do was show extended content ( in HTML ) that the Flash object was not large enough to display .
For example , when a photo is displayed within the Flash object , the photo ’s title , description , comments , tags , rating , etc. is displayed in HTML below the Flash object .
Here is the method I chose to use :
var Connector = function ( ) { var _flashElSelector = false ; var _flashIsReady = false ; var _flash = null ; // load html into extended content area // this is a " private " method in the Connector class // it can only be called from within the returned object var _populateExtendedContent = function ( url , data ) { $ ( ' # extendedcontent ' ) . load ( url , data ) ; } ; return { // initialize connector object // set the jQuery selector to be used for retrieving // the Flash object element init : function ( selector ) { _flashElSelector = selector ; } , // flash is ready // flash calls this method as soon as it is ready to accept // incoming method calls flashReady : function ( ) { // find flash object in DOM _flash = $ ( _flashElSelector ) . get ( 0 ) ; _flashIsReady = true ; } , // show content for specified ID in extended content area showExtendedContent : function ( id ) { // call the " private " method to display content in the // HTML part of the site _populateExtendedContent ( '/ show/extendedconten t ' , { id : id } ) ; } , /** * Flash Methods */ // show content for specified ID in Flash object showContent : function ( id ) { // if flash is n't ready to accept method calls , ignore // this request if ( _flashIsReady ) { // call the showContent ( ) method on the Flash object // this is a method that is exposed by Flash that will // display content , based on the content 's ID _flash .
showContent ( id ) ; // call the showExtendedContent ( ) method on the Connector // in this case , " this " refers to the same object as the // global " Connector " does // displays the extended content in the HTML area of the site this .
showExtendedContent ( id ) ; } } } // closure }( ) ; // set the jQuery selector for retrieving the Flash object // this is done on the individual pages that have Flash to allow // for different IDs for the Flash objects on each page Connector .
init ( ' # flashobject ' ) ;
If the user selected some content to be displayed within the Flash object , Flash would call to the connector as follows to display the extended information for the content in HTML .
Connector .
showExtendedContent ( 5 ) ;
If the user selected some content to be displayed within the HTML part of the site , Javascript would call to the connector as follows to display the content in Flash and the extended information for the content in HTML .
Connector .
showContent ( 5 ) ;
Note that since the function being assigned to Connector has the ( ) ; at the end of it ( line 67 ) , it gets executed immediately .
This function then returns an object that contains several functions and is assigned to the Connector variable .
All of the variables and functions within Connector , that are not returned , are private and inaccessible from the global scope , but fully accessible from within the Connector , as evidenced by line 36 .
If you have any questions regarding the script please feel free to post them here in the comments .
I ’m sure there are many other ways of creating Javascript objects , so please share your thoughts .

From an email making the rounds :
These appear to be the ones left that Pelsoi needs to get a robust public option passed in the House .
As Chris says , the following undecideds are a waste of time :
Do n't bother with Boyd , Berry , Ellsworth , Hill , Gordon or Tanner
But these can make a difference .
Remember , a robust public option in the House increases our chances greatly of getting a good public option when the House and Senate bills go to conference .
She is currently conducting what 's known as a public whip -- huddling with her rank and file and asking everybody , including fence sitters , where they stand on the robust public option .
That means we should have answers soon .
Late update :
The meeting ended a few minutes ago -- though the push is continuing .
We 'll update you as details trickle out .
TPM : Pelosi Publicly Demanding Public Option Skeptics Get Off The Fence
We can make a difference now .
Update I : When you call , tell the Congressperson ( or their staff ) that you support " the robust public option that 's tied to Medicare plus 5 % rates . "
That 's the one Pelosi is trying to pass .
Former staff of Thomas Cook who were arrested this morning after staging a sit-in at the company 's shop in Grafton Street in breach of a High Court order have been released without penalty after they purged their contempt of court .
The protesters appeared before Mr Justice Michael Peart as a large number of supporters staged a protest outside the Four Courts .
Mr Justice Peart ordered that group of 27 workers , along with officials of the Transport Salaried Staff ’s Association be released from custody .
People before Profit Councillor Richard Boyd Barrett , Socialist Party Councillor Matthew Waine and PBP volunteer Sara O’Rourke were also freed .
The judge said that while the breach of the order was unlawful , given the undertakings the court received he decided it was not necessary to commit anyone to prison or to impose a fine .
Mr Justice Peart , acknowledging that the workers had felt badly treated by their employers , said that in a democratic society the rule of law “ cannot be broken ” or else there would be “ anarchy . ”
However the Judge said that he was satisfied that the undertakings given by all parties was sufficient to purge their contempt .
Mr Justice Peart had ordered their arrest when they refused to obey a court order issued on Saturday for them to vacate the premises .
The staff , who are in dispute with the company over a redundancy package , had ignored advice from lawyers and their union to comply with the terms of the court order .
They were arrested at the Grafton Street premises before dawn this morning and taken to the Bridewell Garda station .
A Garda spokesman confirmed that a woman who is eight months pregnant was the first person to be removed from the branch .
She was admitted to the Coombe hospital on the advice of a doctor , where she later gave birth to a girl named Chelsea .
The ex-staff occupied the premises after being told by management on Friday afternoon that the shop would be shut immediately as a result of actions taken by the TSSA which included a public protest against the terms of a redundancy deal offered to 77 Thomas Cook staff .
The shop and another , Direct Holidays , a subsidiary in Talbot Street , were due to shut on September 6th , but the closure date for the Grafton Street branch was brought forward .
The staff were holding out for a redundancy deal which would give them eight weeks per year of service .
The company is currently offering five weeks per year of service .
The former workers claim that Thomas Cook is a hugely profitable company which paid its chief executive £ 7 million last year and can afford an enhanced redundancy deal .
Unite - the union whose members staged a seven week occupation at Waterford Crystal earlier this year - called this morning ’s removal of workers from the Thomas Cook store as “ a dark stain on the history of industrial relations in Ireland . ”
“ These are ordinary working people standing up for their rights ” , said Unite regional secretary Jimmy Kelly .
“ They have a right to be treated with respect and for their employer to hold to a standard of engagement that in this case has merely been cast aside .

The exact definition of the time specification can be found in /usr / share / doc / at - 3.1.10 / timespec .
For both at and batch , commands are read from standard input or the file specified with the -f option and executed .
The working directory , the environment ( except for the variables TERM , DISPLAY and _ ) and the umask are retained from the time of invocation .
An at - or batch - command invoked from a su(1 ) shell will retain the current userid .
The user will be mailed standard error and standard output from his commands , if any .
Mail will be sent using the command / usr / sbin / sendmail .
If at is executed from a su(1 ) shell , the owner of the login shell will receive the mail .
The superuser may use these commands in any case .
For other users , permission to use at is determined by the files /etc / at.allow and /etc/at.deny .
If the file /etc / at.allow exists , only usernames mentioned in it are allowed to use at .
If /etc / at.allow does not exist , /etc / at.deny is checked , every username not mentioned in it is then allowed to use at .
If neither exists , only the superuser is allowed use of at .
An empty /etc / at.deny means that every user is allowed use these commands , this is the default configuration .
An environmental nonprofit group has obtained pictures of the Department of Energy 's specially designed trucks that are used to transport nuclear material around the country .
“ The trucks carrying nuclear weapons and dangerous materials such as plutonium pass through cities and neighborhoods all the time and the public should be aware of what they look like , ” says Tom Clements of the Friends of the Earth group based in Columbia , South Carolina , which obtained the photos through a Freedom of Information Act request .
“ Release of these photos will help inform the public about secretive shipments of dangerous nuclear material that are taking place in plain view . ”
And they look , well , a lot like trucks .
According to a Department of Energy fact sheet on the " Safeguards Transporter , " the vehicles are " specially designed part of an 18 - wheel rig that incorporates various deterrents to prevent unauthorized removal of cargo .
Each shipment is accompanied by armed federal agents .
There have beenlongstanding concerns bout the safety of transporting nuclear material over the nation 's highways .
Earlier this week a semitrailer carrying missile parts ( but no nuclear material ) operated by the U.S. Air Forceoverturned in North Dakota .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Retail sales surged in August , with the Cash for Clunkers program giving auto sales an extra boost , the government reported Tuesday .
The Commerce Department said total retail sales jumped 2.7 % last month , compared with July 's revised decline of 0.2 % .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com predicted August sales increased 2 % .
Sales excluding autos and auto parts rose 1.1 % , compared to a 0.6 % decrease in July .
Economists expected a gain of 0.4 % in August sales , excluding auto purchases .
" With broad - based gains , it 's hard to say any sector is a standout , which is great , " said Adam York , analyst at Wells Fargo Securities .
" We had promising core numbers , but we do n't want to call a trend out of one month . "
Clunkers revs up auto sales :
The decline in July had snapped two straight months of gains , surprising economists who expected an increase on car sales from the Cash for Clunkers trade - in program .
However , the August index got a lift from the Clunkers program , which launched July 27 .
Vehicles purchased after July 1 were eligible for refund vouchers worth $ 3,500 to $ 4,500 on traded - in cars with a fuel economy rating of 18 miles per gallon or less .
The program ran through its initial $ 1 billion in its first week , and lawmakers approved an additional $ 2 billion in funding on Aug .
7 . Car dealers had until Aug. 24 to sign deals under the program .
The Clunkers benefit was clear in the auto sales index , which rose 11.9 % over July .
Some of the other biggest sales winners were gasoline stations , whose sales rose 5.1 % , as well as clothing and department stores , which each rose 2.4 % .
" We expected a big jump in autos , obviously , but we got decent increases elsewhere when we expected only modest gains , " said Wells Fargo 's York .
But furniture store sales slipped by 1.6 % , and building / garden equipment fell by 1.2 % .
The Clunkers program may have had " unintended consequences " in that it cannibalized sales in non-auto sectors , said Ellen Davis , a vice president at the National Retail Federation .
" While this is good news for automakers , it might not be good news for retail , " Davis said .
" Many Americans are now saddled with another monthly bill that will take away from what they 're able to spend on discretionary merchandise . "
York said it was " tough to say " whether the broad gains will hold in future months , though September auto sales will certainly reverse without the Clunkers benefit .
" We 'll be watching whether these core numbers will hold onto gains or give them back , " York said .
" It 's unclear whether this can continue despite the weak labor market . "

Here 's video excerpts :
As you can see , although Bush 's speech did contain some inspirational rhetoric , significant portions of it were focused promoting his own education plan .
A conspiracy theorist might even claim Bush ’s goal was to influence parents in the upcoming election by " indoctrinating " their children .

Scientists using the Cassini spacecraft 's Magnetospheric Imaging instrument ( MIMI ) have detected a new , temporary radiation belt at Saturn , located around the orbit of its moon Dione at about 377,000 km from the center of the planet .
The discovery will be presented at the European Planetary Science Congress in Potsdam by Dr Elias Roussos on Monday 14 September .
Radiation belts , like Earth ’s Van Allen belts , have been discovered at Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune .
However , to date , it has only been possible to observe the variability of their intensity at Earth and Jupiter .
Now that Cassini has been orbiting Saturn for more than five years , it has been possible to assess for the first time changes in Saturn ’s radiation belts .
An international team of astronomers made the discovery analysing data from the MIMI ’s LEMMS sensor , which measures the energy and angular distribution of charged particles in the magnetic bubble that surrounds Saturn .
“ The most dramatic changes have been observed as sudden increases in the intensity of high energy charged particles in the inner part of Saturn 's magnetosphere , in the vicinity of the moons Dione and Tethys , " said Dr. Roussos .
“ These intensifications , which could create temporary satellite atmospheres around these moons , occurred three times in 2005 as a response to an equal number of solar storms that hit Saturn 's magnetosphere and formed a new , temporary component to Saturn ’s radiation belts , " he added .
The new belt , which has been named “ the Dione belt , " was only detected by MIMI / LEMMS for a few weeks after each of its three appearances .
The team believe that newly formed charged particles in the Dione belt were gradually absorbed by Dione itself and another nearby moon , named Tethys , which lies slightly closer to Saturn at an orbit of 295,000 km .
Unlike the Van Allen belts around the Earth , Saturn ’s radiation belts inside the orbit of Tethys are very stable , showing negligible response to solar storm occurrences and no variability over the five years that they have been monitored by Cassini .
Interestingly , it was found that the transient Dione belt was only detected outside the orbit of Tethys .
It appeared to be clearly separated from the inner belts by a permanent radiation gap all along the orbit of Tethys .
“ Our observations suggest that Tethys acts as a barrier against inward transport of energetic particles and is shielding the planet ’s inner radiation belts from solar wind influences .
That makes the inner , ionic radiation belts of Saturn the most isolated magnetospheric structure in our solar system , " said Dr Roussos .
The radiation belts within Tethys 's orbit probably arise from the interaction of the planet ’s main rings and atmosphere and galactic cosmic ray particles that , unlike the solar wind , have the very high energies needed to penetrate the innermost Saturnian magnetosphere .
This means that the inner radiation belts will only vary if the cosmic ray intensities at the distance of Saturn change significantly .
However , as Dr. Roussos emphasised , “ Outside the orbit of Tethys , the variability of Saturn 's radiation belt might be enhanced in the coming years as we start approaching the solar maximum .
If solar storms occur frequently in the new solar cycle , the Dione belt might become a permanent , although highly variable , component of Saturn 's magnetosphere , which could affect significantly Saturn 's global magnetospheric dynamics . ”
This is a safe Democratic district .
The Ambassador to Israel slot is still open , ummm , President Obama ?
Obviously , the rumors of the Ambassadorship is HOT and HEAVY !!
U.S. Rep. Robert Wexler , who represents Broward and Palm Beach counties , plans to resign from Congress .
He plans to announce his plans at a news conference Wednesday at 10 a.m. in Boca Raton . ,
A Democratic source with knowledge of Wexler 's plans said he is likely to take a public policy job that deals with the Middle East .
Wexler , a senior member of the House Foreign Relations Committee , has long been involved in issues involving Israel and Turkey .
A Pakistan army operation to free hostages taken after an attack on the military headquarters has ended with all militants killed or arrested and at least 30 hostages freed , an army spokesman said .
" The operation is over .
It was highly successful .
We have rescued the hostages in a such a large number , " military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas told state - run television .
" The situation is now totally under control ... the entire area has been cleared .
There are no terrorists inside . "
He says three hostages , two commandos and four of the gunmen were killed .
Two commandos were wounded and one wounded militant was arrested .
On Saturday ( local time ) , five militants barricaded themselves into an office just inside the military headquarters in the garrison city Rawalpindi , which adjoins the capital Islamabad , Major General Abbas said .
The drama unfolded just before midday on Saturday , when nine Taliban gunmen in military uniform and armed with automatic weapons and grenades drove up to the military compound and shot their way through one checkpost .
Four militants and six soldiers were killed near a second post but the rest of the rebels fled during the fight , taking military employees hostage in the third dramatic strike blamed on Taliban militants in the past week .
The attack on the tightly guarded headquarters came as the military prepared a major offensive against the militants in their north - western stronghold of South Waziristan on the Afghan border .
It calls into question recent government claims setbacks for the militants this year had put them on the defensive , but a senior official says it will not hinder plans to tackle the South Waziristan bases .
The strike at the heart of the powerful military may also revive fears for nuclear - armed Pakistan 's stability at a time when the United States needs its help in the campaign against an intensifying insurgency in Afghanistan .
International condemnation
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the Saturday attack , saying it showed the threat to the Pakistani government and the very important steps the civilian leadership and military were taking to root out extremists .
The Australian Government has also condemned the attack , with Foreign Affairs Minister Stephen Smith offering Australia 's condolences .
" This very much underlines the gravity of the threat that Pakistan faces , " he said .
" It very much reinforces Australia 's desire to be of assistance to Pakistan at this time . "

Glenn Beck , the conservative commentator and self - proclaimed “ rodeo clown ” , found a new hobby horse the other night — secretly “ communist ” and “ fascist ” art buried into the exterior design program of Rockefeller Center .
In Beck ’s rant he also managed to imply that “ Rockefeller ” , it ’s not clear which Rockefeller he meant , was also somehow a secret communist .
Or was it a fascist ?
Or maybe both .
But let ’s get real , one of the several actual motives for Beck ’s latest bug - eyed , comic - sinister monologue — other than to gain himself more publicity and to mash the words “ progressive / fascist / communist ” into a single loaded term — is to put it to NBC , arch - rival of Fox News and co-owner of MSNBC , which is headquartered at Rock Center .
One of the first insidious works that Beck “ discovers ” are a pair of carved low - relief figures , called Industry and Agriculture , that flank the entrance of one of the low - rise buildings on the Center ’s south end .
That building will be vaguely familiar to many people because it opens onto the plaza where the Today show holds its outdoor summer concerts .
The studio where Today broadcasts from is just across from it .
Beck makes sure to mention the Today connection , leaving you with the vague impression that Matt Lauer is insidiously using Miley Cyrus to lure us into a trap set by Joe Stalin .
And what is it that inflames Beck about these carvings ?
One of the figures , Agriculture , holds a sickle .
Meanwhile Industry leans on a hammer .
Hammer .
Sickle .
Hammer and sickle !
They ’re not actually touching , much less crossing , but never mind — they ’re secretly suggesting the communist symbol .
Just think —
Rockefeller Center is across the street from my office .
I pass this terrifying radical fetish figure nearly every day without suspecting its malign intent .
Let ’s put aside for a moment the fact that sickles and hammers were symbols of agriculture and labor long before the communists hit upon the idea of combining them as their symbol .
And that workers and farmers were a standard theme in Art Deco .
I had actually always thought the “ hammer ” Industry leans on was a shovel , buried partly in soil represented by the dark grey stone base of the building .
That ’s why the figure always looked less to me like a symbol of militant labor than a WPA road worker on a break .
( At the feet of Agriculture grass grows from the same grey “ soil ” . )
The Rockefeller Center website also describes the thing as a shovel .
But images can be ambiguous and you can read it either way .
Meanwhile , it ’s the siren song of Italian fascism that Beck hears in another artwork at the Center , a 10 by 16 - ft. neoclassical glass wall sculpture by a little remembered Italian - American artist , Attilio Piccirilli .
What it shows is a young man walking towards the sun in front a of chariot driven by a muscled figure .
Beck takes it to be a fascist tableaux of youth leading humanity towards a bright future and ends up identifying the charioteer as Mussolini .
As related in Daniel Okrent ’s book Great Fortune , an altogether terrific history of Rockefeller Center , the story behind this one is a little more complicated .
It appears above the main doorway of what ’s called Italia House .
When Rockefeller Center was built , some of the low - rise office buildings along Fifth Avenue were devoted to Great Britain , France and Italy in the hope of attracting businesses from those nations to sign on as tenants .
Rockefeller ’s architects commissioned the exterior art for each of the “ Houses ” , work they hoped would project each nation ’s image of itself .
France is all about art and luxury .
Britain has allegorical figures representing industry , agriculture , etc. Italy has Piccirilli ’s tableaux .
There ’s not a shred of evidence that Piccirilli had Fascist leanings .
( He was the closest friend of that arch democrat , New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia . )
But his work appears on the front of a building that for a while was a business center for Italian companies that were outposts of a sort for the nation governed by Mussolini .
So notwithstanding that it trafficks in the kind of neoclassical imagery that was the shared language of representational art in all nations in the 1930s , it sits on the front of a building that was once devoted to Italy in the 30s .
In the context of the times it chimed with the blowsy rhetoric of fascist self - aggrandizement , though just about no one looking at it today would take away any such message from it .
The fact is , the most important single figure behind the decorative program of Rockefeller Center was n’t Joe Stalin or Benito Mussolini , neither of whom were consulted .
It was John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , the millionaire oilman who built the place , and for one reason — he hated modern art .
( The famous irony , of course , is that his wife Abby loved it , and was a founder of the Museum of Modern Art . )
Because Rockefeller did n’t want anything too modern at his big project , the sculpture and carvings all around the Center are almost entirely representational , and mostly in the muscular neoclassical style that had been adopted by aesthetically conservative artists all over the world in the 1930s , including the Soviet Union , Fascist Italy and the good old U.S.A .
So Rockefeller Center is full of gods and goddesses and winged horses and whatever else , borrowed from the working kit of Greek and Roman classical imagery , most of them stylized in that Art Deco - Moderne way of the 1920s and ’30s that served both Mussolini in Rome and the eminently anti-totalitarian Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington , which was built during the presidency of — gasp ! — Herbert Hoover .
You can find Beck ’s blather here .
There has been an angry reaction in India to the assault of four Indian men outside a bar in Melbourne this week , with calls for the Indian community to " stand up " and take " some form of retaliation " .
The victims say they were bashed by up to 70 people in a car park in High Street at Epping on Saturday night .
But police say there were only four or five offenders , although there were another 15 people making racist comments .
The latest incident has further damaged Australia 's reputation in India and the Indian government wants Australian officials to take more action to protect Indians working and studying in this country .
Media editor and author Farrukh Dhondy has urged Indians in Australia to take matters into their own hands .
" There really has to be some form of retaliation from the Indian community as a whole .
India has to stand up , " he said .
" The Indians in Australia have to stand up and demonstrate that they are not there in a victim culture , simply complaining to the police . "
A spokesman for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs , Vishnu Prakash , has called on the Australian Government to take more action .
" We hope the latest incident is investigated with care and the culprits are dealt with , as per the laws of the land , " he said .
" It would also help if various measures being contemplated by the Australian side , in addition to those that have already been announced , are put in place at the earliest to prevent the recurrence of such incidents in future . "
Things had been going well for Australian Government officials in India .
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard , Trade Minister Simon Crean and Treasurer Wayne Swan all made visits to Delhi , promising zero tolerance for racism in Australia .
Victorian Premier John Brumby will arrive in India next week .
Australia 's deputy high commissioner to India Lachlan Strahan says the latest attack is deeply regrettable , but he cannot guarantee it will be the last .
" We 've seen an appreciable decline in the number of incidents , but again , I must stress we cannot give a categorical guarantee that no such incidents will happen again , " he said .
Market down
Education agents in India are reeling from the latest incident .
The vice - president of the Association of Australian Education Representatives in India , Bubbly Johar , says many Indian parents are too frightened to send their children to Australia .
" These type of attacks are very , very dangerous .
What happens is that they are so scared of sending their students to Australia , " he said .
" The market is going down .
We have no inquiries now .
We are 80 per cent down . "
Mr Johar has also accused the Australian High Commission of being too slow to process visa applications from those students who do want to go to Australia .
The extra checks were ordered by the Immigration Minister Senator Chris Evans to stop fraudulent visa applications in an already overheated student market .

A 13 - year - old paperboy in Bedfordshire who takes home £ 6.53 a week could have been one of the youngest people in the UK to be offered a redundancy package .
Kane Middleton received a formal letter which told him he was being laid off from his round in Clophill .
It outlined a redundancy package of " one week 's pay in lieu of notice , which equates to £ 6.93 ( subject to tax and NI ) " .
His employer , Letterbox Direct , was unavailable for comment .
Kane said he began his round two months ago to buy treats and a new cage for his hamster , Splodge .
Speaking about receiving the letter , he said : " I got this piece of paper and I did n't really understand all the words .
" I asked my mum and she told me I had been made redundant .
" I felt annoyed and upset . "
His mother Jocelyn said she was disappointed that her son had received an " impersonal " letter .
This is a story involving balls for your ass , and an entity called the Church of Wow !
It therefore must be told .
There are few communities in world quite so profoundly devoted to the abandonment of science and rationality as some of those in northern California .
A friend of mine is a parent in one such otherwise idyllic community , and as one of the very few skeptics in town , he spends much of his life with fingers in the dike holding back the flood of woo that might otherwise wash his town away .
He received a cc on this email from another parent to his child ’s teacher .
The “ physio balls ” referred to are simply the large rubber bouncy balls used in physical therapy and some exercise gyms :
Dear Ms S. and parents of the eighth grade , I would like to present the opportunity to bring Physio balls into the classroom for our kids this year .
Currently there are 5000 classrooms in Switzerland ( where the physioball originated ) using balls .
See this link : www.swisster.ch/…/swiss-ball-from-physiotherapy-to-fitness_120-1814253
There have been numerous studies conducted around the benefits of kids using balls in classrooms some of which I have included below .

We are fortunate to be hosting Elisa Lodge this coming weekend for workshops in her work which is called Primal Energetics .
She has introduced the use of balls in schools in Big Sur and is willing to come to our school to do the same .
I am proposing that she visit the classroom on Tuesday September 29 to introduce the balls and spend on hour with the kids .
The cost per student would be $ 15 - $ 30 sliding scale .
This includes the balls which usually run at this price their own .
I spoke with Ms S. about this before the semester began and her concern was what to do with the chairs and can we afford it .
I trust we can work around these obstacles and students who decide not to use the balls can take them home to use there .
The balls can partially or wholly replace the use of chairs .
Please respond soon with any thoughts or questions .
I will be meeting with Ms. B. [ the school principal ] tomorrow to present this to her .
Nothing has been set yet and of course its instrumentation depends on whether or not we are in favor of it .
enjoy P .
A near miss .
Most of that email was perfectly fine , until it reached the point of bringing in a spiritual advisor to teach the children “ primal energetics ” ( a scientifically meaningless term , in case you were wondering ) for $ 15 - 30 each .
And so my friend , K. , took advantage of the “ Reply All ” function in his email ( I love this ) :
S. , I ’ll weigh in as skeptical on this one .
First , the terminology ( “ Primal Energetics ” ) is highly suggestive of a multi - level marketing scheme .
I do n’t dispute the value of exercise balls , but I ’m concerned that the physio - balls are an entrée to the classroom to pitch more products .
Next , this person also goes by the name “ Wowza ” and has supposedly co-founded the “ Church of Wow . ”
http://wowzacise.com/about/
One of the things I love about [ our school ] is the richness and depth of the curriculum , with emphasis on critical thinking .
Turning the classroom over to the Church of Wow seems like a step in a bizarre direction .
Some of the claims Ms. Lodge makes include rhetoric typical of quack alternative healing practices .
Her own “ Wowzacize ” site http://wowzacise.com/esalen/ includes this set of claims :
Together , we will contrast conditioned attitudes and static behavior patterns with a vital physiology that reflects fluid flexibility , free - spirited breathing , resonant vocal power and authentic emotional energy .
Integrating an expressive vocabulary of feeling into daily life activities eroticizes nerve fibers , warms the flesh , and arouses the arteries , fires alertness and pumps blood into our heart with undivided passion .
With more unbridled energy and creative vigor , there is renewed freedom to breathe as the wind , walk with joy , speak with heart , and play the game of life with grace , boldness and daring .
In other words , exercise feels good .
I ’ll tell the class that for free .
This website http://www.naturalpath.com/keywords/elisa_lodge attributes the following quote to Ms. Lodge : Every organ , bone and cell in our body has its own resonant frequency … together they make up a composite frequency like the stringed instruments of an orchestra [ Lodge , 2006 . ] .
It also reports that she advocates humming to engage “ neurostimulators of the brain with energetic stimulation . ”
Again , this type of rhetoric is redolent with quackery red flags .
As to these claims : I would like to present the opportunity to bring Physio balls into the classroom for our kids this year .
Currently there are 5000 classrooms in Switzerland ( where the physioball originated ) using balls .
See this link : www.swisster.ch/…/swiss-ball-from-physiotherapy-to-fitness_120-1814253
Dead link .
There have been numerous studies conducted around the benefits of kids using balls in classrooms some of which I have included below .
Read more : http://student-health-issues.suite101.com/article.cfm/no_more_classroom_chairs#ixzz0ITJK20Q1&C also google for more info .
I do n’t see anything on the National Institute of Health , U.S. Dept. of Education , Mayo Clinic or PubMed sites advocating chairless classrooms , Primal Energetics or Wowzacize .
There are generic references to exercise ball use , not associated with the benefits of “ resonant frequencies ” of organs , “ eroticizing ” of nerve fibers or any other of the fantastical claims .
The cost per student would be $ 15 - $ 30 sliding scale .
This includes the balls which usually run at this price their own .
Since our kids have an exercise program , it ’s not clear to me why we have to pay this extra money and lose an hour of class time for exercise ball training .
Especially since these items are available at sporting goods stores for families who may wish to use them .
There are also free instructional videos on YouTube .
A private , parochial school in Carver County , Minnesota , found the exercise balls so successful that the school has replaced all classroom chairs with the balls .
Principal Deb Kelzer states , “ The kids were really excited to come back to school and sit on those balls .
I was hesitant at first but I thought , ‘ Why not ? ’
There ’s too much sitting around that goes on . ”
[ Heron Marquez Estrada , Star Tribune , startribune.com , Oct. 27 , 2007 ]
I would remind you that testimonials are both highly persuasive and worthless .
The book presents 23 complete lesson plans and 118 activities that have been successfully used by teachers in physical education classes .
Virtually all of these activities can be used in inclusive settings .
In conclusion , I do n’t think we should open the classroom door to people hawking books and making absurd , unsupported medical claims .
It runs counter to the reality - based instruction in the curriculum .
It is my opinion that the main beneficiary of this session would be Ms. Lodge .
K.
One parent did chime in agreeing that physioballs would be great for the school ’s physical education program , and that ’s probably true .
A lot of things would .
But she stopped short of endorsing the Primal Energetics classroom training .
However , just in case there was any doubt that she was a member of this particular community , she had to add :
Regarding some of the government health websites and “ recommendations ” that K. cited as not “ supporting or reporting physioball use for kids , ” remeber that it is also government agencies that brought us STAR testing , no child left behind , and recommendations of all sorts of things that many of us probably do n’t agree with or that piss us off !
Because , you know , since the government ’s imperfect , Magic Balls for Your Ass must therefore be good .
K. ’s email reply had the intended effect .
Confronted with a skeptical perspective , P. backed down and retracted her original proposal , saving the parents money , and saving the kids from this astonishing magical Primal Energetics lesson .
P. wrote :
Hi K. and all Elisa Lodge ( Wowza ) is a very dear friend of mine and an incredible teacher .
She has been a teacher of mine now for 5 years .
I would never suggest inviting someone into the classroom I was not 100 % sure of .
Yes , I completely agree she seems outrageous .
( Maybe that should have influenced you to begin with … these kids are not all yours . )
In person , she is one of the kindest and most accessible people I know .
She lays no pretences whatsoever and spends a lot of time with children .
She is incredibly compassionate and is in no way involved in any schemes .
No doubt .
But note , K. said nothing negative about Wowza ’s personality or intentions .
It was all about the validity of her Primal Energetics as a classroom topic .
Being a nice person does not justify the teaching of horse bollocks .
I apologize for not being more clear about my connection to her and the recommendation I give regarding her work .
I do understand that her work may seem “ out there ” from an outside perspective .
She is genuinely interested in kids and adults finding true joy and love for their lives .
In terms of the financial side of it , I just wanted her to be somehow compensated for her work so this was set by me not her .
Remember , none of this is set .
I am just coming from a place of really wanting the best for our kids and offering that out .
Magic Balls , Primal Energetics , and the Church of Wow ! are what ’s “ best for our kids ” ?
Again , I apologize if there has been any misunderstandings .
Sincerely , P .
There ’s no doubt in my mind that Wowza is indeed a warm and compassionate lady as P. says , and that P. never remotely intended anything inappropriate .
But it ’s not enough to simply have good intentions .
Especially when you ’re involved in education , you need to have good information as well .
And to have good information , you have to learn to think critically about the information you ’re given .
P. did not .
Wowza certainly does not .
Thankfully , K. did .
A tip of the hat to you , K .
NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope has discovered an enormous ring around Saturn -- by far the largest of the giant planet 's many rings .
The new belt lies at the far reaches of the Saturnian system , with an orbit tilted 27 degrees from the main ring plane .
The bulk of its material starts about six million kilometers ( 3.7 million miles ) away from the planet and extends outward roughly another 12 million kilometers ( 7.4 million miles ) .
One of Saturn 's farthest moons , Phoebe , circles within the newfound ring , and is likely the source of its material .
Saturn 's newest halo is thick , too -- its vertical height is about 20 times the diameter of the planet .
It would take about one billion Earths stacked together to fill the ring .
" This is one supersized ring , " said Anne Verbiscer , an astronomer at the University of Virginia , Charlottesville .
" If you could see the ring , it would span the width of two full moons ' worth of sky , one on either side of Saturn . "
Verbiscer ; Douglas Hamilton of the University of Maryland , College Park ; and Michael Skrutskie , of the University of Virginia , Charlottesville , are authors of a paper about the discovery to be published online tomorrow by the journal Nature .
An artist 's concept of the newfound ring is online at http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/multimedia/spitzer-20091007a.html .
The ring itself is tenuous , made up of a thin array of ice and dust particles .
Spitzer 's infrared eyes were able to spot the glow of the band 's cool dust .
The telescope , launched in 2003 , is currently 107 million kilometers ( 66 million miles ) from Earth in orbit around the sun .

The discovery may help solve an age - old riddle of one of Saturn 's moons .
Iapetus has a strange appearance -- one side is bright and the other is really dark , in a pattern that resembles the yin -yang symbol .
The astronomer Giovanni Cassini first spotted the moon in 1671 , and years later figured out it has a dark side , now named Cassini Regio in his honor .
A stunning picture of Iapetus taken by NASA 's Cassini spacecraft is online at http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08384 .
Saturn 's newest addition could explain how Cassini Regio came to be .
The ring is circling in the same direction as Phoebe , while Iapetus , the other rings and most of Saturn 's moons are all going the opposite way .
According to the scientists , some of the dark and dusty material from the outer ring moves inward toward Iapetus , slamming the icy moon like bugs on a windshield .
" Astronomers have long suspected that there is a connection between Saturn 's outer moon Phoebe and the dark material on Iapetus , " said Hamilton .
" This new ring provides convincing evidence of that relationship . "
Verbiscer and her colleagues used Spitzer 's longer - wavelength infrared camera , called the multiband imaging photometer , to scan through a patch of sky far from Saturn and a bit inside Phoebe 's orbit .
The astronomers had a hunch that Phoebe might be circling around in a belt of dust kicked up from its minor collisions with comets -- a process similar to that around stars with dusty disks of planetary debris .
Sure enough , when the scientists took a first look at their Spitzer data , a band of dust jumped out .
The ring would be difficult to see with visible - light telescopes .
Its particles are diffuse and may even extend beyond the bulk of the ring material all the way in to Saturn and all the way out to interplanetary space .
The relatively small numbers of particles in the ring would n't reflect much visible light , especially out at Saturn where sunlight is weak .
advertisement
" The particles are so far apart that if you were to stand in the ring , you would n't even know it , " said Verbiscer .
Spitzer was able to sense the glow of the cool dust , which is only about 80 Kelvin ( minus 316 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
Cool objects shine with infrared , or thermal radiation ; for example , even a cup of ice cream is blazing with infrared light .
" By focusing on the glow of the ring 's cool dust , Spitzer made it easy to find , " said Verbiscer .
These observations were made before Spitzer ran out of coolant in May and began its " warm " mission .
NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , manages the Spitzer Space Telescope mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington .
Science operations are conducted at the Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology , also in Pasadena .
Caltech manages JPL for NASA .
The multiband imaging photometer for Spitzer was built by Ball Aerospace Corporation , Boulder , Colo. , and the University of Arizona , Tucson .
Its principal investigator is George Rieke of the University of Arizona .

The United States economy is now out of the emergency room and appears to be on a slow path to recovery .
But enormous dosages of monetary medicine continue to be administered and , before long , we will need to deal with their side effects .
For now , most of those effects are invisible and could indeed remain latent for a long time .
Still , their threat may be as ominous as that posed by the financial crisis itself .
To understand this threat , we need to look at where we stand historically .
If we leave aside the war - impacted years of 1942 to 1946 , the largest annual deficit the United States has incurred since 1920 was 6 percent of gross domestic product .
This fiscal year , though , the deficit will rise to about 13 percent of G.D.P. , more than twice the non-wartime record .
In dollars , that equates to a staggering $ 1.8 trillion .
Fiscally , we are in uncharted territory .
Because of this gigantic deficit , our country ’s “ net debt ” ( that is , the amount held publicly ) is mushrooming .
During this fiscal year , it will increase more than one percentage point per month , climbing to about 56 percent of G.D.P. from 41 percent .
Admittedly , other countries , like Japan and Italy , have far higher ratios and no one can know the precise level of net debt to G.D.P. at which the United States will lose its reputation for financial integrity .
But a few more years like this one and we will find out .
An increase in federal debt can be financed in three ways : borrowing from foreigners , borrowing from our own citizens or , through a roundabout process , printing money .
Let ’s look at the prospects for each individually  and in combination .

The current account deficit  dollars that we force - feed to the rest of the world and that must then be invested  will be $ 400 billion or so this year .
Assume , in a relatively benign scenario , that all of this is directed by the recipients 
China leads the list  to purchases of United States debt .
Never mind that this all - Treasuries allocation is no sure thing : some countries may decide that purchasing American stocks , real estate or entire companies makes more sense than soaking up dollar - denominated bonds .
Rumblings to that effect have recently increased .
“ If you look at the C.V. ’s of current Czech politicians , you see that most of them are in their 50s , ” he said .
This means they matured in what he called “ early normalization , ” roughly from 1969 to the mid-1970s , when the Soviet - led invasion that crushed the brief Prague Spring reforms of 1968 gave way to a dull and autocratic regime dependent on Moscow .
“ One of the darkest periods ” of national history , Mr. Havel said .
In his view , those years have marked many current politicians , leaving them prone to conspiratorial thinking and acts of petty deceit .
Compounding that , he said , is “ some kind of existential crisis ” caused by a global pursuit of materialism and by the specific Czech legacy of 40 years of Communist government .
Indeed , the contrast between the atmosphere in Prague today and during the magical autumn of 1989 and the Velvet Revolution could scarcely be greater .
Today , the city is a freer , far wealthier place than 20 years ago , with private property restored and millions of tourists proving an economic if not aesthetic boon to one of Europe ’s most beautiful capitals .
But as an exhibit at the Old Town Hall reveals , the spirit of 1989 was humane in a way rarely felt since .
In grainy black - and - white photographs , the show traces the arc between the first demonstrations against Communism here in 1988 , through the mass exodus of East Germans via the West German Embassy in Prague in August 1989 , to the fall of the Berlin Wall and then the Velvet Revolution itself .
As Vaclav Maly , then a dissident with Mr. Havel and now auxiliary bishop of Prague , notes in the introduction to the show , “ It is good to realize that once there were times when we were not afraid to show feelings , and did not take considerateness and kindness to be a sign of weakness . ”
Asked for his favorite memory of the Velvet Revolution , Mr. Havel said it was the mass gathering on Letna Plain above Prague in late November 1989 , when 750,000 people gathered in freezing temperatures .
“ It was so cold , there were too many speakers , but I looked out and felt that something was definitely changing , that it was a turning point , ” he said .
EPA likely to declare CO2 a dangerous pollutant
EPA Administrator - designate Lisa Jackson testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington , Wednesday , Jan. 14,2009 , before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing on her nomination .

Carbon dioxide is likely to be declared a dangerous pollutant - a move that could help propel slow - moving climate - change legislation on Capitol Hill , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency said Monday .
EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson told reporters that a formal " endangerment finding , " which would trigger federal regulations on greenhouse gas emissions , probably would " happen in the next months . "
Jackson announced her timeline even as top senators said they were delaying plans to introduce legislation that would set new limits on carbon dioxide emissions .
Senators had been scheduled to unveil legislation next Tuesday , but the date has now been pushed back to later in September .
The House narrowly passed a broad energy and climate - change bill in June , but supporters have moved more slowly in the Senate , where the issue has been trumped recently by work on the health care overhaul .
The EPA kick - started the regulatory process in April when it proposed declaring carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases as pollutants that jeopardize the public health and welfare .
EPA scientists believe the greenhouse gases contribute to global warming by trapping heat in the Earth 's atmosphere .
The EPA can formalize the finding anytime , now that it has closed a 60 - day public comment period that netted more than 300,000 responses .
A formal endangerment finding would obligate the agency to regulate greenhouse gas pollution under the Clean Air Act - even if Congress does n't pass a final climate - change bill .
President Obama and Jackson have said they would prefer that Congress - rather than the EPA - take the lead in implementing new greenhouse gas limits .
Businesses and energy industry leaders also have largely favored congressional action over EPA - imposed limits , because they believe lawmakers are better positioned to combine economic safeguards with any new carbon cap .
" Legislation is so important , because it will combine the most efficient , most economy - wide , least costly ( and ) least disruptive way to deal with carbon dioxide pollution , " Jackson said .
" We get further faster without top - down regulation . "
But Jackson insisted the EPA would continue on a path that began when the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases qualified as pollutants and could be regulated if the government determined they threatened the public .
" Two years is a long time for this country to wait for us to respond to the Supreme Court 's ruling , " Jackson said .
Supporters of climate change legislation are hoping the threat of EPA - mandated limits will spur congressional action .
Sens. Barbara Boxer , D - Calif. , and John Kerry , D - Mass. , had been planning to introduce their own climate change bill next week .
But in a joint statement Monday , the pair said they were delaying the bill introduction until " later in September " because of the death of Sen.
Edward Kennedy , D - Mass. , Kerry 's hip surgery in August , and Kerry 's membership on the Finance Committee , which is negotiating health care .
Sen . James Inhofe of Oklahoma , the top Republican on Boxer 's Environment and Public Works Committee , said the delay " is emblematic of the division and disarray in the Democratic Party over cap - and - trade and health care legislation . "

His presence would improve the global credibility of the EU
On current trends , the 21st century looks like being dominated by a " G2 " of the US and China .
That is not good news for Europe .
The US and China ( like most other powers ) are sometimes unilateralist and lack Europe 's enthusiasm for strong international rules and institutions .
If the EU wants to send a signal that it intends to play a role in shaping the new world order , it should appoint Tony Blair as its first president .
The likely ratification of the Lisbon treaty means that the EU will be able to leave behind 25 years of sterile debates on institutions .
The Europeans should now tackle crucial external challenges such as climate change , energy security , migration , nuclear proliferation , the Middle East and Russia .
Blair 's leadership could galvanise the union to focus on this outward - looking agenda .
He would bring some stardust to an organisation in great need of dynamism and a fresh start .
The Lisbon treaty creates a full - time president for the European Council ( the regular summits of heads of government ) , but gives that person no formal powers .
His or her influence will depend on their charm , powers of persuasion and force of personality .
A successful president will be modest enough not to provoke fears of empire - building among the governments , but strong enough to offer leadership , help to forge a consensus and , when necessary , knock heads together .
Among the 27 governments , there are two theories about what sort of president the EU needs .
Nicolas Sarkozy , the French president , wants a big figure with the stature to play a leading role on the world 's diplomatic stage .
I share that view , but many leaders from smaller member - states want a lesser figure who would not threaten them .
They think Blair would be too grand to focus on the details of the business of the European Council .
I am the first to acknowledge that Blair is not an ideal candidate .
His support for President George Bush and the invasion of Iraq have made him thoroughly unpopular in many places ( I think the Iraq war a huge mistake , but I do n't regard Blair as a liar on that issue ; the British intelligence services told him that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and the intelligence services of our leading allies said the same ) .
The fact that a lot of people hate Blair could make it harder for him to do a good job as president .
If Angela Merkel , the German chancellor , were available , she would be an ideal candidate , being a consensual figure .
But she is not and most of the other names touted for the job , such as the prime ministers of Belgium , Holland and Luxembourg , are virtually unknown on other continents .
Blair has clear views on many issues and has therefore made enemies .
European federalists scorn him for failing to take Britain into the euro .
Protectionists dislike his commitment to free trade .
Anti-Americans worry about his belief that Europe should work closely with the US .
Furthermore , the European People 's party , the centre - right group that is the largest in the European Parliament , is demanding that one of its own should take the presidency ( technically , Blair counts as a socialist ) .
The best argument for a Blair presidency is that it would improve the EU 's global credibility .
Though the EU makes up 20 % of world GDP , it punches below its weight in international diplomacy – because the 27 governments are sometimes divided , but also because its system of external representation is horribly messy .
The rotating presidency , often held by a small country , the commission and the high representative for foreign policy all try to speak for the EU .
The Lisbon treaty would scrap the rotating presidency 's role in foreign policy , creating not only a full - time president , but also a new foreign policy chief to replace the high representative and the external relations commissioner .
The message I hear in places such as Beijing , Delhi and Washington is that if the EU wants to be taken seriously , it should choose a big name as president .
As one Indian official said to me : " If you choose the prime minister of Luxembourg , we may not find time to meet him . "
The president will also have a key role to play within the EU .
One of the union 's biggest problems is that few people understand what it does , how it works or why it contributes to their prosperity and security .
Blair is a skilled and effective communicator who could sell the EU to its own citizens .
Another point in Blair 's favour is that he made a valuable contribution to the EU during his 10 years in office .
In 1998 , he had the idea of giving the EU a role in defence policy and that has subsequently led to the deployment of two dozen missions of peacekeepers , policemen and administrators to conflict zones such as Bosnia , Congo , Palestine and the Somali coast .
He championed the cause of EU enlargement and , as the Central and East Europeans know , did a lot to ensure that they joined in 2004 and 2007 .
During the British presidency in 2005 , Blair pushed climate change and energy security to the top of the EU 's agenda .
The Iraq war certainly prevented Blair from pursuing his ambition of reconciling the British people to the EU .
But he is Britain 's most pro-European prime minister since Edward Heath .
A President Blair could also help the EU to cope with a Conservative Britain .
His presence in Brussels would provoke some Eurosceptics , but if a government led by David Cameron tried to unpick parts of the Lisbon treaty or opt out of some institutions , Blair would be an eloquent defender of the EU on radio and television .
He would explain to the British people why Eurosceptic policies could damage Britain 's interests .
Yet it may be the Conservatives who spike Blair 's chances of getting the job .
William Hague , the shadow foreign secretary , has told the other EU governments that the Conservatives would see support for a Blair presidency as a " hostile act " .
A week ago , Blair was the clear favourite , with the likely support of Britain , France , Germany , Italy and Spain , plus several of the smaller countries .
But on my travels around Europe last week , I have found that Hague 's comments have made a huge impact .
A number of prime ministers are unwilling to take a step that would incur the wrath of an incoming Conservative government .
President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel remain supporters of Blair , but are now hesitating over backing a man with so many opponents .
The Conservatives may have achieved their first diplomatic coup in Europe , even before taking office .

NO .
He co-authored the Iraq war and is not a convinced democrat
Although Tony Blair is almost the very last person who should be appointed as Europe 's first president , on the face of it he seems the only sensible candidate .
At 56 he brims with the energy of a much younger man ; he has international standing and experience and an undoubted feel for the needs and ambitions of the big players .
By comparison his nearest rival , poor Jean - Claude Juncker , the prime minister of Luxembourg , seems like a harmless worthy who has no better chance in this contest than the mayor of Harrogate .
And if you 're half asleep , President Blair sounds sort of convincing , possibly because he has been so long preparing for the role , with a 10 - year rehearsal period as prime minister , during which the word " presidential " became shorthand for his dictatorial attitude to parliamentary democracy and cabinet government .
But that is precisely the quality they are looking for to increase Europe 's global influence .
They want experience of high - altitudes , certainty , drive and L'aerodynamisme ; they want Euro - fighter , not Euro - suit .
That 's because the conclave of European leaders that will elect this new secular pope can ignore public opinion as well as principle in the process created by the Lisbon treaty , Blair 's record seems to matter far less than it should .
As one commentator said last week : " If the presidency goes to a politician who lacks fame and charisma , its place will forever be low down in the international pecking order . "
It is an odd way of looking at a job that gives new and undelineated power to an individual without a mandate of the European people .
If you conceive of a job like this , you surely have higher ambitions than to fill it immediately with a man who was not merely implicated in the decision to go to war in Iraq , but was its co-author .
This love of brand – any damn brand as long as recognition is high – says much about the undemocratic , swooning frivolity of so many European leaders but they may yet come to regret their haste when Blair appears in front of the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq War .
No wonder he pushed so hard to make it secret because , among other things he will shortly be expected to answer questions about the early meetings with George Bush in 2001 and 2002 when the path to war was set , the evidence of distorted intelligence , the pressure on the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith to change his legal advice and the serious accusation that Blair knew of Bush 's plan to provoke war by flying U - 2 spy planes painted in UN livery into Iraq 's airspace .
Something that the European leaders have perhaps failed to grasp is that the central figure of the Chilcot inquiry is Tony Blair and the central issues are whether he took Britain to war in Iraq on evidence which he knew or suspected was false , and whether he sacrificed British national interest , and indeed lives , to the Bush administration 's desperate need to go after " something really big " in order to assert American military supremacy after 9/11 .
Blair 's centrality will not vanish when he stops being interviewed by the inquiry and nor will the embarrassment to the European presidency , because it is his judgment and integrity that will be on trial in the first weeks of his presidency , if indeed he is elected for the 30 - month term .
And when Chilcot reports he will necessarily focus on Blair 's premiership , his use or abuse of power .
No doubt this is the argument that the shadow foreign secretary William Hague has been putting to European ambassadors over the last few weeks in an attempt to sabotage Blair 's run .
But there are others , which Blair 's brilliant presentation allow people to forget .
The reason he was able commit Britain to war , almost as an act of personal will , is that he has innate contempt for the opinion of others .
He seems to think it is enough for him to utter that oddly childish formulation " I believed I was right at the time " , as if believing something right is the same as being right .
It allows him not to address his poor judgment and not to make amends , which must surely warn European leaders that his moral / intellectual equipment is perhaps not all that it should be .
Actually I do n't believe that he is without feeling , or conscience , and I am sure he was affected when parents such as Deirdre Gover , who gave such a moving interview to the BBC's Eddie Mair about her 30 year - old son , Kristian , talked of their loss .
It must weigh heavily on him .
But let us not forget how thoroughly anti-European his instincts were when he sided completely with Bush and America and paid no attention to Jacques Chirac 's opposition , or the millions of sensible people who marched through the capitals of Europe pleading with Bush and Blair to listen to them .
That heedlessness should count for a lot now that the Iraq death toll is estimated to be 600,000 .
The second part of the argument for disqualification is that Blair is not a convinced democrat , which is important when you realise that Europe is changing with the Lisbon Treaty and acquiring foreign policy institutions and all sorts of shadowy committees to preside over internal security .
The new president will be responsible for setting the tone of business at the apex of the EU and ensuring transparency and accountability .
Is the man who did so much to undermine the power of the British parliament right for this ?
I doubt whether much of this has occurred to European leaders because most leaders appear to be thinking in terms of power and the influence of Europe , not the integrity of its institutions .
When Tony Blair left office in 2007 , he seemed to display dissatisfaction with Britain .
Although he has homes here , it was if Britain had become too small for him , and very soon he was on the international stage , working as the Quartet Powers representative in the Middle East , trying to repeat his triumph in Northern Ireland , signing up with JP Morgan , speaking , writing , raising money for his religious foundation and teaching at Yale .
He has made a fortune and has kept out of Gordon Brown 's hair , but apart from money and tact this astonishing activity seems also to betray an unquenchable ambition .
Who knows ?
Perhaps it has been since the day he left Number 10 .
But before European leaders roll over before the charm of this impressive but mysterious man , it is worth their asking whether Deirdre Gover , mother of Kristian , is right when she said : " Tony Blair deceived us on weapons of mass destruction .
He should be held responsible for the conflict .
He lied to his cabinet , to his government , to parliament and to us . "

Tony Blair is a flawed candidate for the EU presidency .
He was not a brave pro-European at home .
He sided with American neocons .
He invaded Iraq .
He would inflame British euro - sceptics .
But he is the best British candidate .
Britain would have an opportunity to lead the EU , and an inside track on trade , security and financial issues .
His vision of Europe as a group of nation states finding common cause to advance common interests is realistic .
Best to back our man , however imperfect , than refuse a prize that might not come our way again for decades .

ANTHONY SELDON
Tony Blair could be really outstanding .
People have him wrong : they think he spent his premiership fixated on Clinton and Bush , but in fact he gave considerable and increasing time to Europe once he had worked out what he wanted to do .
His plan to enter the euro was ill - considered , and when Brown defeated it the second time in 2003 , he cared little .
His defining moment came in Brussels in June 2005 , when he set the tone for a more liberal , less bureaucratic and enlarged Europe .
Britain needs a voice to match China , India and the US and a Blair is best placed to provide exactly that .

If a poll were taken in the US , both Democrats and Republicans would choose Blair as the clear favourite to lead the EU .
Lisbon looks set to launch the European superstate : will it choose to be a partner with the US in tackling global problems or seek a role as a counterweight ?
Only an Atlanticist president will seek partnership .
Only an Atlanticist will work for the EU to have a common defence policy rooted in Nato .
Love him or hate him , Tony Blair is an Atlanticist and an international statesman with substance and sizzle .

Lord Butler on 22 February 2007 made devastatingly clear why Tony Blair is not a fit and proper person to preside over Council meetings of European heads of government .
Butler used the word " disingenuous " to describe how Blair was told by the UK intelligence community " we know little about Iraq 's chemical and biological weapons work since late 1988 " and yet told parliament just over a month laterthat the picture painted by our intelligence services was " extensive , detailed and authoritative " .
Like contempt of court , contempt of parliament should always be a disqualification for holding high office .

Tony Blair is a personality with a formidable reputation on the European stage who has always enjoyed a very good relationship with Italy .
I have always admired him , despite differences over the war in Iraq .
However , when it comes to considering him as a candidate for the European presidency , it needs to be underlined that the UK is not in the Schengen Agreement , nor part of the Euro zone and is therefore not central to the process of European integration .
Blair is a splendid man but possibly not the right candidate for this job .

LIFE AFTER NO 10
Since leaving office Tony Blair has been busy .
Here are a few of the former prime minister 's interests .
■ In June 2007 he was offered the role of Middle East peace envoy for the Quartet ( the US , EU , Russia and the UN ) , focusing on working with the Palestinians to improve their economy and build the necessary governance and security in their quest for statehood .
■ In December 2007 he converted to Roman Catholicism and went on to set up the multi-million pound charitable Tony Blair Faith Foundation .
It focuses on uniting people of different religious traditions in practical action , for example , the eradication of malaria .
As part of this role , he teaches 10 seminars a year at Yale university .
■ In 2007 , he set up the Tony Blair Sports Foundation to nurture young sporting talent in deprived areas in the north east .
The foundation focuses on indoor rowing , tennis , athletics and football .
■ In January 2008 , Tony Blair was given advisory roles with JP Morgan Chase and Zurich Financial Services paying £ 2 m and £ 500,000 a year respectively .
■ In March 2008 , Blair founded the Breaking the Climate Deadlock Initiative .
The focus is on countries and regions fundamental to a successful global deal , including the US , the European Union , Japan , India and China .
■ He is a major figure on the lecture circuit , commanding fees of up to £ 240,000 per 90 - minute talk , while his memoirs secured a £ 4.6 m advance from Random House .
■ In February 2009 , Tony Blair Associates was set up to provide in partnership with others strategic advice on political and economic trends and governmental reform .

Last month , about 240,000 registered Democrats in New York City — myself included — voted in a runoff election for public advocate and comptroller , two of New York 's three directly elected citywide offices .
Facing only nominal Republican opposition in November , the winners of the runoff — John Liu in the comptroller race , and Bill de Blasio in the public advocate race — are essentially guaranteed victory in the general election .
In other words , two of the top three municipal offices in the nation 's largest city were chosen by 6 % of the city 's electorate .
That is n't democracy .
It 's oligarchy .
And it 's not working .
It was n't so long ago that we Democrats were celebrating our dominance .
Last November , I joined hundreds of my fellow Democrats at an election night event hosted by the New York state Democratic Party .
We celebrated the election of a Democratic president , a Democratic landslide in Congress , and with equal excitement the news that the New York state Senate , that last bastion of Republican control in our home state , had fallen into Democratic hands .
For the first time since 1935 , Democrats would control the governorship and both chambers of the state legislature .
2009 was going to be a great year .
In June , the state Senate was thrown into disorder when two Democratic members — Pedro Espada Jr. and Hiram Monserrate — staged a parliamentary coup and attempted to reinstall the Republican leadership .
Last month , New York 's Democratic Gov. David Paterson lost the public support of our party 's national - standard bearer , the president of the United States .
Meanwhile , New Yorkers continue to pay among the highest taxes in the nation , footing the bill for the backdoor borrowing of the state 's hundreds of barely regulated authorities , a bloated public workforce rife with redundancies , and of course , the salaries of indicted state legislators ( including Sen .
Monserrate , recently convicted of misdemeanor assault — and still collecting a paycheck ) .
Google accounts for 87 % of the UK search market Google has lifted the lid on its updated search engine , which developers have nicknamed " Caffeine " .
Although still in the testing phase , the firm says it is the " first step in improving the speed , accuracy and comprehensiveness of search results " .
The new engine will replace Google 's current one after tests are complete .
Martin McNulty of search marketing specialist Trafficbroker said the upgrade threatened to put Microsoft 's new engine , Bing , " in the shade " .
" Google have let Caffeine quietly slip out .
It talked about vertical specific searches while quietly doubling the speed and starts introducing real - time results and news feeds , " he said .
" Bing was launched with a massive media budget .
" Trouble is , Bing presents itself as an alternative to something that users are still - for now - happy with , " he added .
Virtual monopoly Google is still the dominant search engine .
According to market research firm Hitwise , Google accounted for more than 87 % of the UK search market in 2008 .
However , in recent months , the search engine market has got a little busier .
As well as Microsoft 's Bing.com - which saw a tie - up between Microsoft and Yahoo - the " computational knowledge engine " Wolfram Alpha and a revamped Ask Jeeves have also entered the fray .
Google is also facing competition from Facebook , which has just acquired FriendFeed , praised for its " real - time " search engine .
This type of search is valuable because it lets you know what is happening right now on any given subject .
Back in May , Google founder Larry Page admitted that the search giant had fallen behind other services like that of Twitter , which boasts nearly 45 million users worldwide .
Fresher content Google 's head of Webspam , Matt Cutts , denied that Caffeine was launched in response to competitive search engines .
" I love competition in search and want lots of it , but this change has been in the works for months , " he wrote in his blog .
" I think the best way for Google to do well in search is to continue what we 've done for the last decade or so : focus relentlessly on pushing our search quality forward .
Nobody cares more about search than Google , and I do n't think we 'll ever stop trying to improve . "
Alex Watson , editor of Custom PC magazine , said Caffeine was reflecting a general trend to what he calls " the real - time web " .
" Caffeine now picks up news stories and puts fresher content higher up the search results , " he said .
" That said , it 's likely that most people wo n't notice the change .
It still looks the same , it 's the algorithms that have changed .
" However , it is now doing things that would never be possible a few years ago and knowing Google , this would have been in the works for some time . "

Antony Funnell : Now to the issue of energy consumption .
And later this month , the Australian government is expected to release grant guidelines for a project they hope will eventually lead to the rolling - out of a commercial - scale ' smart ' energy grid , and $ 100 million has been allocated for the pilot project .
So what do we mean by a ' smart ' grid and how will it work ?
Well , the minister responsible for the project is Peter Garrett .
Peter Garrett :
The idea is a simple one , even though there 's some complexity in it , and that 's to have a much more intelligent information - sensitive distribution and consumption network for energy that enables consumers to make informed decisions , that enables generators and distributors to have a much better sense of energy use and energy use patterns , and which also provides for a much greater assessment of faults and problems along the grid , in order that they can be rectified and dealt with much more quickly .
Antony Funnell :
And are you expecting that one company , say , or organisation , will take the lead in trying to implement the smart - grid policy across the country ?
Peter Garrett :
Well what we want to do is a substantially - sized pilot which would be led by an energy distributor .
Our expectation is that it would be made up of additional consortia partners which may include retailers , may include technology companies , non-government organisations , local councils , state instrumentalities , community groups and the like .
Antony Funnell : Australia 's existing electricity grid is quite old .
Is it possible to institute this type of plan within the existing infrastructure that we have ?
Peter Garrett :
We believe it is .
McKinseys did a significant pre-deployment report for the government to look at , and there 's been quite a bit of spark reactivity particularly taking place in the United States for example , in Denver , Colorado .
And we think that we 've got the technology , in a sense , that 's ready to be implemented .
It 's just a case of , in a pilot , of ensuring that we use the technology that we have , including addressing some of those technology deficits that exist .
And the idea here is to really gather up a really solid body of information and data , information that will reduce the risks and uncertainties for smart grid investment in the future , information that will give us a much better idea of environmental and economic efficiencies and information about consumer behaviour as well .
All of these information sets are very necessary to inform long - term investment in our grid , and particularly as we move more and more , as I think we must do , to smart grids in that deployment .
Antony Funnell :
And just to be clear about this , you 're looking at this initiative as a way of improving energy efficiency for the commercial sector as well as the domestic household sector , because a lot of the emphasis that governments , state and federal , in the past have put on energy saving seems to have been focused on the domestic side of the equation , not the commercial side .
Peter Garrett : Your question 's quite right .
It 's from the deployment of energy down through the distribution networks and into the users , into the households .
And it 's across that entirety of energy grid that we 're looking for efficiencies , and there are clearly many opportunities that exist there for them .
Antony Funnell :
You were quoted recently as saying that this smart - grid , smart - city initiative was similar to an internet for the energy industry .
Could I get you to expand on that for me ?
Peter Garrett :
Well I think it 's pretty clear that we 've got very sophisticated communications and technology capacities now , even in existing households you 'll see smart appliances that can be programmed to turn on and off at certain times .
We 've had smart meters , which effectively are a two - way interface between the householder and the distributor or the deliverer of energy into a household .
And we 've got a significant computing capacity now which enables us to actually understand how a grid is actually working .
Armed with that knowledge , and with the capacity to take a real - time temperature test , if you like , on energy use both in terms of informing your decisions and a consumer within a household , but also informing your decisions as a distributor or as a generator , you 're effectively building the capacity for a much more interactive and integrated interface in terms of energy use across the grid .
So maybe the internet was n't designed to work in the way in which we thought it would , it 's certainly the case here that by having this really significant commitment for a pilot project , we can determine the best way for a smart - grid to be rolled out and have the information available for those that want to start taking those big investment decisions further down the line .
Antony Funnell :
And do you assume there will be synergies between this grid if it goes ahead , if it proves to be successful in this pilot stage , between this grid and the roll - out of the new national broadband network ?
Peter Garrett : Yes , we 're saying that we recognise that the roll - out of the NBN will be a critical factor .
It 's not a stand - alone connect for the grid , in terms of the pilot project , but clearly over time , with the expectations that we 'll get roll - out of the national broadband network , it will provide an additional communicative element in the grid .
But it 's not designed specifically to integrate with the NBN , given that the NBN 's rolling out where I 'm speaking to you from , in Tasmania first .
We may find a consortia that proposes a successful smart - grid project to operate in a state where the NBN 's not as advanced .
In the longer term though , clearly the two will have a great deal to do with one another .
Antony Funnell : Peter Garrett , Federal Minister for the Environment , Heritage and the Arts , many thanks for talking with us on Future Tense .
Peter Garrett : Thanks ,
Antony .
Antony Funnell : Now as I mentioned earlier , the grant guidelines for the federal government 's smart grid project are due to be released at the end of October .
But that 's not to say that there has n't already been work on the concept .
In fact , a group of universities and Australia 's major publicly funded research institution , the CSIRO , have been toiling away from the past 12 months on their own initiative , called the Intelligent Grid Research Program .
Chris Dunstan is one of those involved .
And he 's a research principal with the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology , Sydney .
Chris Dunstan :
Our research through the Intelligent Grid Research Program covers seven projects , and they encompass technological aspects , economic aspects and social aspects .
There are five universities involved with the CSIRO , supported through the energy transform flagship .
And my particular focus , and it's one of those seven projects , is on what we call institutional barriers , stakeholder engagement and economic modelling .
So mine is perhaps the broadest in scope , but other projects deal with integrating renewable energy into the local electricity network .
There 's a project in Western Australia looking at community consultation around intelligent grid , and there 's a couple of projects in Queensland that are looking at how you can make the most of a local level of a range of what we call distributor generation , small - scale generation within the grid .
Antony Funnell :
Am I right in saying it's not just about achieving a more efficient electricity system for the country , but also reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the end ?
Chris Dunstan :
That 's very much the focus of our research program .
Smart grids , intelligent grid , intelligent networks , these terms get bandied around , and while they 've got a common core , as I described earlier , they are , depending on who 's applying them , there 's a different meaning or a different focus .
The particular focus of our research program is explicitly to achieve significant greenhouse gas emission reductions , by facilitating what we call distributed energy , so local generation , energy efficiency , and managing the load at the customer level , into a smart grid through advanced communications and control technologies .
Antony Funnell : Now in a practical sense , if we have a smart grid in the future , an intelligent grid system in the future , how will that be different from the system that we currently have , the electricity system we currently have , particularly for consumers ?
Chris Dunstan :
It 's not as though the existing electricity grid is completely dumb and the future is infinitely intelligent .
There is already quite a bit of advanced technologies and smart technologies within the grid , but in terms of the consumer side of the ledger , things that we 'll be looking for are interval meters , smart meters that provide not just a once - off reading of your energy consumption three months after the fact , but a meter that can tell you as a consumer at any particular time what your energy consumption is , how you 're using your energy , and also communications so that even if you 're not at home , for example , you can log in and find out what energy consumption levels are .
And then you can make some decisions about how you use your energy , about which appliances you turn on or off , also how you program your appliances .
So for example , that gives us the opportunity for time of use measuring , so rather than paying the same 12 cents per kilowatt hour , 24/7 , the price varies depending on the amount of demand on the system .
Many people are familiar with the notion of off - peak pricing , which has been around for many years .
This would be much more sophisticated , so you would break it down not just into normal tariffs and off - peak , but prices that would be higher during the day , but in summer they might be higher again , but offsetting that , you 've got lower prices for the rest of the time , and in the lower demand seasons , autumn , winter , and so on .
So what it means is that from the point of view of the consumer , you 've got much more information to deal with , which can be both a good and a bad thing , but you 've got the option there of managing your load .
Equally importantly though , is the capacity to plan our network so that we take greater advantage of low emission , local generation , and energy efficiency measures .
Antony Funnell :
And just to finish up , the research is under way .
Where are you at in the process , and what plans do you have for your final results ?
Where will they go ?
Chris Dunstan :
Our program 's been running for about 12 months now .
So we 're starting to get some results emerging .
We 're putting out some working papers and the like to give an indication of what we 're doing .
We 've got another two years to run with the program .
We 've got outcomes and reports that will be generated from each of the seven elements of that work , and we 'll be seeking to tie it together to provide a sort of a holistic picture of what an intelligent grid would look like , as well as some pretty clear recommendations on how governments and industry might be able to make the most of these technologies for the benefit of the industry , but more importantly for the Australian community .
Antony Funnell : Chris Dunstan , from the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology , Sydney .

Stephen Valand , 23 , and Erica Shea , 25 , quit their jobs earlier this year to start the Brooklyn Brew Shop , which makes gallon beer - brewing kits sized for New York City apartments .
The couple starting selling the kits in early July at the Brooklyn Flea Market and online .
But before deciding to jump into business together , they went on a seven - week backpacking trip to Europe to see if they were compatible .
Gathering the seed money : ( Mr. Valand )
We just worked , just quit our jobs and did it with our own money .
I ’ve always been good at saving money .
It ’s pretty much all my money .
( Ms. Shea )
He gets paid back first , and I am basically working for free .
Because we are going through the flea market , the overhead is n’t that high .
The stand itself is basically $ 100 a day .
The major investment was the grain and the equipment and meeting wholesalers ’ minimum buy -ins .
Right now everything we make is reinvested .
Was it hard to quit ?
( Ms. Shea )
No , that part was easy .
( Mr. Valand )
The hard part was saving the money , deciding not to eat out .
My father was a truck driver , so he worked for himself .
I never liked the idea of working for people or taking orders .
How did you get the idea ?
( Ms. Shea ) I grew up in a record store , vinyl .
My dad had done some home - brewing through the record store .
I came across all my dad ’s old equipment and decided it would be a fun thing to get into .
I , Don Mashak , created this blog as a point of rational discussion about the proposed bank bailout .
My first reaction to hearing about the the bailout was , “ What happened to free market forces , risk and reward ? ” I did n’t hear any of these financial institutions complaining they were making too much money and offering to share the rewards with us when they were getting 5 - 25 million dollar per year bonuses , but now they want us to share the risk ( losses )
From a more pragmatic view point , if there is no pain to the bankers , they will have no incentive in the future to motivate them to avoid making the same mistakes that got us where we are now , again .
Worse , the bailout is not a real solution , but rather a postponement and reallocation of the pain .
Somebody is going to suffer sooner or later .
It can be the stockholder , owners , board members and officers of the banks now or the taxpayers and general citizenry later .
Our choices are recession / depression now or hyperinflation and ridiculous taxes in the future .
( In effect , we who enjoyed the strong economy will be forcing our children to suffer the consequences ) I would prefer we invoke a , “ That which does not kill us makes us stronger ” attitude and not saddle future generations with the burden of paying for our mistakes .
Next , if we are going to consider a bailout of any kind , should it not be contingent on the passage of laws to prevent it from happening again , should it also not be executed in terms of true factoring .
As I understand it , the current terms and conditions call for the US Taxpayers to pay 100 % of the value of the outstanding balances on these bad mortgages that these banks are trying to sell us and the real value of the real estate securing the mortgages is between 50 % and 70 % of the outstanding balance .
In the free market , when a business is suffering from insolvency or having liquidity problems , the free market factoring vultures start circling .
They offer to buy the struggling businesses recievables / assets a steep deep discount and the struggling business generally has no choice because no one else is going to come to their aid .
Depending on how bad the risk is , a FACTOR anywhere from pennies to fifty cents on the dollar .
Our representatives , Congress , are not driving a hard bargain on behalf of us the Taxpayer ; instead they appear to be spending our money like drunken sailors with a 100 % of face value bailout , with the seeming expectation of getting later backroom discussion kickbacks .
Should n’t they be offering the banks a dime on the dollar , as the representatives of we the Taxpayer ?
It seems to me that we , the Taxpayer Factor Vultures , are in position demand terms to our liking .
Besides the foregoing paragraph suggestions .
Should not legislation be passed making it a felony for any politician to interfere with the legitimate activity of bank regulators , examiners and auditiors .
Too often , these Government Bank overseers felt a tap on the shoulder by some Senator or Congressman ( or the Senator / Congressmans Chief of Staff ) telling them to back off when the overseer wrote truth reports about concerns with deviations from accepted banking practices .
And , if they resisted , poof they were fired or transferred to another district .
Had they been allowed to proceed unimpeded , most of the pain we are about to feel would not have happend .
Even further , where are the terms and conditions requiring the board members , senior management and the stockholders to pay back some portion of big profits earned over the last 5 - 7 years of being turned into the US Treasury as a requirement for the bailout .
And , Should not a condition of any tax payer bailout of this magnitude be contingent on all of the senior management and board members not serving in any senior management or board member capacity for any financial institution for the rest of their lives to prevent them from causing the same situation again and to serve as incentive for future generations of bankers to avoid the same consequence .
Well , that is my rant for today .

History of Naming Weather Systems
Although the tradition of recording the weather dates back at least to the Renaissance times , the tradition of naming highs and lows is much shorter .
In World War II the American Weather Service started to identify typhoons in the pacific with female names .
Thus it was easier for them to follow the current weather situation and to distinguish between several severe weather systems .
This procedure was so helpful and satisfying that it was subsequently adopted for the hurricanes in the Atlantic , too .
In 1954 , Karla Wege , who was a student at the Institute for Meteorology of the Free University ( FU ) Berlin and later weather moderator at the ZDF ( Second German Television ) , suggested to name all vortices , both lows and highs in Central Europe .
At that time the Institute of Meteorology of the FU Berlin was in charge of issuing comprehensive weather forecasts for the Berlin region .
Since 1954 the Institute named lows with female names and highs with male names to track pressure systems in the weather charts more easily .
To carry out the idea is simple .
There were ten rundowns of the alphabet for highs and ten lists for lows .
This adds up to 260 female and 260 male listed names .
If they were used up , things started anew .
Until the 1990s this practise was used exclusively by Berlins newspapers , local radio stations and TV - media .
Severe storms , such as  Vivien and  Wiebke changed this habit and since then the names have been commonly used by German media .
Somewhat earlier Americans shifted to naming tropical storms in an alternating way , i.e. , giving male and female names , but only when the storms reached a threatening stage .
Things being not quite the same here , FU meteorologists traditionally name all vortices , termed lows and highs , that influence the Central European weather .
In 1998 , a debate began as to whether it was discrimination to name the highs with good weather with male names and lows with bad weather with female names .
The issue was resolved by giving the lows male names and the highs female names in odd years , and vice versa in even years .
In November 2002 ,  Aktion Wetterpate ( Adopt - a - Vortex )  was born .
Now the public had the opportunity to become clients  and adopt highs or lows .
Since March 2002 , we dont use the names from our old lists .
We make an alphabetical list of all the suggested names .
To suggest a name ( or to adopt a name ) , a fee has to be paid .
Instead of irregular income as donations with this regular income , we are able to maintain  the Students Observation Service at the Weather Station 10381 ( Berlin - Dahlem ) .
November 2007 saw the fifth anniversary of Adopt - a - Vortex .
Over 1.800 participants from 15 European countries plus Brazil , Japan und the United States have already been adopted as clients .
The names that are given ( = adopted ) are published in the  Berliner Wetterkarte and are available for use by any weather services or media ( newspapers , radio , TV , internet ) .
This practice has been well established for over 60 years and maintaining it is requested not only by the German Weather Service or by the commercial service providers but also , by the public .
Apart from the US - Weather Service , the Institute of Meteorology is the only source for named vortices worldwide .
Arecibo in Context : Watching for NEOs
Some things to keep in mind with regard to near - Earth objects : NASA is working with a Congressional mandate from 2005 that it discover ninety percent of all NEOs that are 140 meters in diameter or greater .
The deadline for this task is 2020 , and the interim report Near - Earth Object Surveys and Hazard Mitigation Strategies ( written by a committee appointed by the National Research Council ) says the surveys currently in progress are not capable of meeting this goal .
The final report is to appear in December .
Now switch to Arecibo .
The radio telescope there , run by Cornell University and the National Science Foundation , has run into serious funding questions .
NSF must decide whether the current cooperative relationship between Cornell and NSF should continue , and whether the observatory itself should be funded .
You may recall that an NSF panel recommended in late 2006 that Arecibo ’s operating budget be reduced in a series of steps , ultimately taking it from $ 10.5 million to $ 4 million by 2011 .
Such reductions could close the observatory .
The role of Arecibo ’s planetary radar in the NEO issue ?
That ’s also spelled out in the interim report , which cites the observatory ’s ‘ unmatched precision and accuracy ’ in detecting comets and asteroids that could hit the Earth .
We still do n’t know what ’s going to happen with Arecibo , but the report certainly can’t hurt .
Says Don Campbell ( National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center ) :
“ If the survey committee had not come out that strongly , it would have virtually ruled out any funding .
[ The report ] was a necessary , but not sufficient condition to get funding from either NASA or NSF . ”

Short of sending a spacecraft to an NEO ( itself a desirable outcome ) , the Arecibo planetary radar provides the best imaging and tracking for these objects that we have .
We may argue about the likelihood of our planet being struck by any of these objects , but the idea that we would surrender this powerful tool for building and tracking the NEO inventory , now in place and functioning , seems incredible .
We wait with guarded optimism to see how the funding picture develops for Arecibo .

Researchers : XML Security Flaws are Pervasive
Security researchers today unveiled details about a little - known but ubiquitous class of vulnerabilities that may reside in a range of Internet components , from Web applications to mobile and cloud computing platforms to documents , images and instant messaging products .
At issue are problems with the way many hardware and software makers handle data from an open standard called XML .
Short for " eXtensible Markup Language , " XML has been used for many years as a fast and efficient way to transport , store and structure information across a wide range of often disparate applications .
Researchers at Codenomicon Ltd. , a security testing company out of Oulu , Finland , say they found multiple critical flaws in XML " libraries , " chunks of code that are typically used and re-used in software applications to process XML data .
Codenomicon is a spinoff from the University of Oulu , and is run by many of the same individuals who in 2001 - 2002 found and reported a widespread vulnerability in a remote Internet management protocol called ASN.1 .
That research kicked off months of studying and patching by the U.S. government and private sector , which found the ASN.1 flaws extended to some of the nation 's most critical electronic infrastructures , including the telephone network , the power grid , and air traffic control systems .
Howard Schmidt , a Codenomicon board member who served as cyber security adviser to President Bush during the ASN.1 episode , said these XML flaws are nearly as widespread .
Schmidt said the result of a successful attack against a vulnerable XML library could range from allowing the remote installation of malicious software to simply sending the application into an infinite loop , rendering it temporarily inaccessible .
" XML is being used in so many different things we 're doing on the Web today , " Schmidt said .
" So it 's a big deal when something goes wrong with something that 's Internet - facing that so many people depend upon . "
XML is used in a variety of document formats ( docx , openoffice , playlists , configuration files and RSS feeds , to name a few ) .
As a result , there are numerous vectors for attacking XML flaws remotely , such as sending malicious documents or network requests , said Jussi Eronen , an information security adviser for CERT - FI , the Finnish Computer Emergency Response Team .
Eronen said three major software makers - including Sun Microsystems , Apache Software Foundation and Python Software Foundation - are expected to release updates today to address the XML flaws ( Sun's Java Update - Java 6 Update 15 - is already out , and mentions at least two XML flaws ) .
Eronen predicts a large number of other software vendors will ship patches for the flaw in the weeks and months ahead .
" There is no doubt whatsoever that a great deal of vulnerabilities similar to the ones released [ today ] will emerge over time , " Eronen said .
" Moreover , people tend to make similar mistakes in coding , so that a single XML file might at worst affect several libraries .
This would be a good moment to wrap our heads around this problem , and to attain some degree of understanding of how to handle similar issues in the future . "
Codenomicon founder Ari Takanen said he is not aware of any public exploits for these vulnerabilities .
But he said he hopes other , potentially affected software vendors , take this discovery seriously .
" It is impossible to forecast what will happen .
My pessimistic guess is that nobody really cares until the first exploits emerge , " Takanen told Security Fix .
Update , 5:31 p.m. ET : CERT - FI 's advisory on this is here .
1963 Kennedy Tape Debates Nuking China To Defend India
" Before any substantial commitment to defend India against China is given , we should recognize that in order to carry out that commitment against any substantial Chinese attack we would have to use nuclear weapons , " McNamara says .
Boston MA ( AFP ) Aug 25 , 2005
Senior defence aides warned president John F. Kennedy in 1963 that any guarantee to defend India against Chinese attack would require a commitment to use nuclear weapons .
On a declassified tape recording , released Thursday , the then - defence secretary Robert McNamara and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff General Maxwell Taylor urge Kennedy to look beyond India and take a broader view of how to deal with any substantial Chinese aggression .
In particular , they caution that before any substantial commitment is given to India , the United States should recognise that nuclear weapons would have to be used in a defense of the region .
The tape , released by the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston , was a recording of a National Security Council Meeting from May 9 ,
" Before any substantial commitment to defend India against China is given , we should recognize that in order to carry out that commitment against any substantial Chinese attack we would have to use nuclear weapons , " McNamara says .
" Any large Chinese Communist attack on any part of that area would require the use of nuclear weapons by the US , and this is to be preferred over the introduction of large numbers of US soldiers , " he adds .
The debate was triggered by Kennedy 's proposal to provide a relatively newly - independent and democratic India with a security guarantee against attack from neighbouring , communist - ruled China .
At one point during the discussion , undersecretary of state George Ball suggests using nuclear weapons in Asia , post - Hiroshima , might lay the United States open to charges of double standards .
" We are going to inject into this whole world opinion the old bugaboo of being willing to use nuclear weapons against Asians when we are talking about a different kind of strategy in Europe , " Ball says .
" This is going to create great problems with the Japanese - with all the yellow people , " he adds .
Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963 .
Maura Porter , archivist for the Kennedy Library , said the release of the tape offered " a unique perspective as to the inner workings of the Kennedy White House . "

Archaeologists have discovered evidence of what they believe was a second Stonehenge located a little more than a mile away from the world - famous prehistoric monument .
The new find on the west bank of the river Avon has been called " Bluestonehenge " , after the colour of the 25 Welsh stones of which it was once made up .
Excavations at the site have suggested there was once a stone circle 10 metres in diameter and surrounded by a henge – a ditch with an external bank , according to the project director , Professor Mike Parker Pearson , of the University of Sheffield .
The stones at the site were removed thousands of years ago but the sizes of the holes in which they stood indicate that this was a circle of bluestones , brought from the Preseli mountains of Wales , 150 miles away .
The standing stones marked the end of the avenue that leads from the river Avon to Stonehenge , a 1¾ - mile long processional route constructed at the end of the Stone Age .
The outer henge around the stones was built about 2400BC but arrowheads found in the stone circle indicate the stones were put up as much as 500 years earlier .
Parker Pearson said his team was waiting for results of radiocarbon dating which could reveal whether stones currently in the inner circle of Stonehenge were originally located at the other riverside construction .
It should also show whether the newly discovered circle 's stones were removed by Neolithic people and dragged along the route of the avenue to Stonehenge , to be incorporated within its major rebuilding about 2500 BC .
After that date Stonehenge consisted of about 80 Welsh stones and 83 local sarsen stones .
Pearson said : " The big , big question is when were our stones erected and when were they removed – and when we get the dating evidence we can answer both those questions . "
He added : " We speculated in the past that there might have been something at the end of the avenue near the river .
But we were completely unprepared to discover that there was an entire stone circle .
" I think we have found incontrovertible proof that the river was very important to the people who used Stonehenge .
I believe that the river formed a conduit between the living and the dead and this is the point where you leave the realm of the living at the river and enter the one of the dead at Stonehenge . "
The summer dig , which ended last month , also found evidence that the builders of the stone circle used deer antlers as pickaxes .
Excavations by the Stonehenge Riverside Project , which is a consortium of university teams , have uncovered a wealth of finds in recent years including the Neolithic village of Durrington Walls in 2005 .
" Not many people know that Stonehenge was Britain 's largest burial ground at that time .
Maybe the bluestone circle is where people were cremated before their ashes were buried at Stonehenge itself , " Parker Pearson added .
Dr Josh Pollard , project co-director from the University of Bristol , described the discovery as " incredible " .
" The newly discovered circle and henge should be considered an integral part of Stonehenge rather than a separate monument and it offers tremendous insight into the history of its famous neighbour .
Its landscape location demonstrates once again the importance of the river Avon in Neolithic funerary rites and ceremonies . "
Another team member , Professor Julian Thomas , said the discovery indicated that this stretch of the river Avon was central to the religious lives of the people who built Stonehenge .
" Old theories about Stonehenge that do not explain the evident significance of the river will have to be rethought , " he said .
There have been many theories about the use of Stonehenge , including that it was believed to have healing properties and was a giant astronomical observatory .
Stonehenge only acquired its famous silhouette after centuries of continuous rearrangement .
In about 2500 BC the gigantic sarsen stones were dragged across Salisbury plain and added to the smaller bluestones .
Evidence from earlier excavations had already suggested that more bluestones were brought in to make a more complex pattern .
" The assumption was that they went back to Wales for more , " Pearson said .
" My hunch is that they just took them from our circle down the road . "
He believes the new circle marked the processional avenue from the river Avon to Stonehenge .

Music reporter , BBC News
Lily Allen has led an artists ' campaign for a crackdown on file - sharing Pop star Lily Allen has joined almost 100 other British musicians at a heated three - hour debate to discuss how to tackle illegal music downloading .
The meeting was called after a public dispute among artists over whether serial file - sharers should be punished .
The attendees agreed perpetrators should not have their internet accounts suspended , as ministers have suggested .
Instead , they released a statement saying persistent offenders should have their bandwidths " squeezed " .
Artists including Allen , George Michael , Annie Lennox , Radiohead guitarist Ed O'Brien and Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason signed the statement .
Warning letters
The meeting in London on Thursday was open to all artists .
Those present backed Allen 's campaign to " alert music lovers to the threat that illegal downloading presents to our industry " , the statement said .
They also " overwhelmingly voted " to support a plan to send two warning letters to file - sharers before restricting their broadband speeds .
In the meeting , we did n't always agree but we came to an agreement that we thought was good for everyone
Ed O'Brien
Radiohead
That would " render sharing of media files impractical while leaving basic e-mail and web access functional " , the statement said .
Jim Killock , executive director of digital rights activists the Open Rights Group said the musicians had addressed " the symptom and not the cure " .
He said the only answer was " to licence products to compete with file - sharing " , but that major labels were being too cautious in approving new services .
The ISPA , which represents the UK 's internet service providers , agreed that the disconnection of users was " a disproportionate response " .
A spokesman added that they will submit their views to the government on the proposed new law before Tuesday .
Film composer David Arnold , songwriter Guy Chambers , Billy Bragg , singer Patrick Wolf , sixties star Sandie Shaw and Keane 's Tim Rice - Oxley were among others to put their names to the plan .
Before the meeting , a debate over whether to penalise file - sharers had raged among artists in the media and online .
Allen led the campaign for a crackdown , while lobby group the Featured Artists ' Coalition , including musicians like O'Brien and Mason , said cutting off broadband accounts would be impractical and counter - productive .
But the need for artists to reach a compromise and present a united front was considered pressing just five days before a UK government deadline for receiving views on proposed sanctions .
Lily cheered Business Secretary Lord Mandelson has said people who share files illegally should have their connections temporarily suspended as a " last resort " .
O'Brien said the artists ' meeting was " quite emotional " and " a little heated at times " .
Allen had said she would not go , and has removed an anti-file - sharing blog after just three days because she said she was getting too much abuse .
She has come in for criticism after reproducing a blog post without crediting its source and for using copyrighted music in two mixtapes when she started her career .
Until recently , both tapes were still available to be downloaded .
But the singer was cheered as she entered the room at Air Studios in Hampstead , north London , and spoke several times .
She was " extremely brave " to turn up , O'Brien told BBC News .
" She 's taken a lot of flak for what she 's said .
What she 's done has been brilliant because she started the process where artists have stood up and said , you know what , there is a consequence to illegal file - sharing .
" In the meeting , we did n't always agree but we came to an agreement that we thought was good for everyone .
" We 're going to have further meetings like this , we 're going to get together - we 've realised the importance of doing this together , " he said .
Media were not admitted into the meeting and Allen has declined to be interviewed about the subject .

Can you move to Thailand without a job ?
Is it easy to work remotely ?
An expat in Ao Nang answer these questions and has a lot more advice about living in Thailand .
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio cited a non-existent federal law and included a legal interpretation taken from an anti-immigration Web site in a document he distributed during a news conference last week .
Arpaio used the document to bolster his claim that he can continue to arrest undocumented immigrants during controversial crime sweeps even without a special agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
" We do n't need that authority .
I do n't need any federal authority from ( the agreement ) , " he said .
Arpaio said he will launch his 12th crime sweep today .
ICE stripped Arpaio of the authority to let deputies enforce federal immigration laws on the street under a revised agreement amid criticism that the sweeps are an excuse to hunt for illegal immigrants by stopping Latino motorists for minor traffic violations , an illegal practice known as profiling .
On Thursday , sheriff 's officials admitted the document contained an incorrect citation of the law .
Arpaio also acknowledged that the information came from a legal interpretation pulled by a staff member from the Internet .
Arpaio initially denied knowing which Web site .
He later said it came from the Cornell University Law School 's Web site .
However , the interpretation actually originated on the Federation for American Immigration Reform Web site and has been reposted by anti-immigrant and border - control groups .
Washington , D.C. , - based FAIR opposes immigration , legal and illegal .
The Southern Poverty Law Center has designated the organization as a hate group , which FAIR vehemently denies .
Ira Mehlman , a spokesman for FAIR , verified that the language cited in Arpaio 's document originated from a legal interpretation the group published in 1999 .
The Arpaio document cites a provision of Title 8 of the federal code followed by language that says " state and local law - enforcement officials have the general power to investigate and arrest violators of federal immigration statutes without prior INS knowledge or approval , as long as they are authorized to do so by state law . "
It also states that " evasive , nervous , or erratic behavior ; dress or speech indicating foreign citizenship ; and presence in an area known to contain a concentration of illegal aliens " can be used to constitute reasonable suspicions someone is in the country illegally .
Stephen Yale - Loehr , an immigration lawyer in Ithaca , N.Y. , who teaches at Cornell University said the document Arpaio cited did not come from the school 's Web site .
In fact , the specific statute cited does not exist .
Title 8 does address local police enforcement of federal immigration laws , but none of the language contained in Arpaio 's document comes from that law , Yale - Loehr said .
Instead , " what he has cited is an overly simplistic interpretation of a very complicated area of law , " Yale - Loehr said .
Annie Lai , a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona , said the document " sends a signal to the public that they can be targeted for law enforcement based on their appearance , and that is simply not true .
It ( also ) sends a message to his deputies that they can make stops that potentially violate people 's constitutional rights . "
The organization has filed a federal lawsuit alleging deputies illegally profiled Latino drivers and passengers during their sweeps .
Arpaio downplayed the document , arguing that although it was lifted from the Internet , the legal interpretation is sound .
" Although the citation and language does not appear in the U.S. code , Title 8 does exist , and the Sheriff 's Office believes that it still has the authority under federal law to detain illegal aliens during the course of their duties , " spokesman Brian Lee said in a statement .
At the Oct. 6 news conference , County Attorney Andrew Thomas stood by Arpaio while staff circulated the document .
Thomas did not return phone calls seeking comment Thursday .
Arpaio said if ICE officials refuse to accept suspected illegal immigrants encountered by deputies during today 's sweep , he will drive them to the border and hand them over to the Border Patrol .
ICE officials declined to comment .

UC president recommends huge tuition increases UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA System 's president recommends 15 % next spring , another 15 % next fall
Image 1 of / 4 Caption Close UC president recommends huge tuition increases 1 / 4 Back to Gallery
The price of a public education at the University of California may be going up again - not once , but twice .
UC President Mark Yudof is recommending a 15 percent increase in in - state undergraduate fees that would take effect next spring , and another 15 percent increase on top of that beginning in fall 2010 .
The governing Board of Regents will hear details of the proposal - which also includes graduate - level fee increases of 15 percent - at its meeting Wednesday , but wo n't vote until November .
If approved , the undergraduate fee increases would be the eighth and ninth in seven years , and would send the price of a year at UC above the $ 10,000 mark for the first time next fall .
" It makes me really angry , " said Gracelynne West , 20 , a first - generation college student at UC San Diego who expects to graduate in June with years of debt to pay off .
Though West has a job on campus , " I 'm already looking to get another job to pay for the increasing fees , " she said .
As usual when fees are raised , almost a third of the new money would be set aside for financial aid .
But West said the financial assistance is never enough .
" I still have to take out loans , " she said .
The regents last raised UC 's annual tuition by 9.3 percent in May , bringing this year 's undergraduate fee to $ 7,788 .
Under Yudof 's proposal , the new tuition for 2009 - 10 would become $ 8,958 , an increase of $ 1,170 , or 15 percent .
Because most students pay each semester , they would see their spring bill rise by half that amount .
Five - figure tuition
Fees would rise again next fall under the proposal , by $ 1,344 , or 15 percent , setting tuition at $ 10,302 .
Add another $ 13,000 or so for a dorm , plus the average $ 938 fee charged by each campus , and the annual cost for a California resident to attend UC would top $ 24,000 next year .
" Wow .
When I hear that number , I think this is going to send yet another discouraging signal to low - and moderate - income students and families about whether college is still within reach , " said Lauren Asher , president of the Institute for College Access and Success , a nonprofit group in Berkeley .
UC Vice President Patrick
Lenz will make the case for the higher student fees in an 18 - page report he will present Wednesday to the regents ' finance committee meeting in San Francisco .
The report , prepared by UC finance experts , says efforts to cut spending and raise fees to date have not been enough to close a budget shortfall of at least $ 753 million anticipated for this year and next .
Lower funding , higher costs
The report blames the shortfall on reduced funding from the state , a higher cost of doing business at the campus level - including soaring costs in retiree health benefits - and a mandatory contribution by UC into the university 's retirement plan .
" The President and the Chancellors believe it will be extremely difficult to close the shortfall without severe damage to the University absent additional revenue , " the report concludes .
The tuition increase for 2009 - 10 would generate $ 117 million , and the increase for next year would bring in $ 292 million .
Making ends meet
Campuses have already laid off 884 employees this year and expect to lay off 1,006 more , the report says .
Almost 2,000 jobs have also been eliminated in the past year , with nearly 2,000 more to go .
Other actions taken to save money have included raising student tuition , increasing class sizes - in some cases up to 25 percent , the report says - reducing nonunion salaries , and deferring hiring and purchasing .
The report compares UC 's proposed fees against the fees at four other public schools : the universities of Illinois , Michigan and Virginia , and the State University of New York at Buffalo .
When miscellaneous campus costs are added , the cost of attending UC in the 2010 - 11 school year would exceed for the first time the projected average cost to attend the other four schools .
WASHINGTON -- Congress could be receptive to President Barack Obama 's pledge to end a 16 - year - old policy banning gay people from serving openly in the military , a top Democratic lawmaker said .
The Pentagon also signaled openness to a change .
Speaking at a human - rights dinner in Washington Saturday , Mr. Obama pledged to end the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy , which allows homosexuals to serve in the military as long as they do n't disclose their sexual orientation or act on it .
The president , who made a similar pledge during ...

( PhysOrg.com ) --
The Japanese are preparing to develop a two trillion yen ( approximately $ 21 billion USD ) space solar project that will beam electricity from space in the form of microwaves or lasers to around 300,000 homes in Japan within three decades .
The project , to be undertaken by a research group from 16 companies including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd , aims to spend the next four years developing the technology needed to beam the electricity produced to earth .
They expect that as fossil fuels run out , an orbiting solar power plant in space may be needed to provide a significant source of electricity in the future , according to the Kensuke Kanekiyo , from the Japanese Government 's Institute of Energy Economics .
The planned solar station will produce 1 Gigawatt of electricity from its four km2 ( approximately 2.5 square miles ) array of solar panels , which is enough to power just under 300,000 Tokyo homes , at present usage levels .
Since the array will be in orbit some 36,000 km ( 22,500 miles ) above the earth 's surface , it will be unaffected by weather conditions and will be able to generate power constantly .
The U.S. agency NASA has been investigating the possibilities of a space - based solar system for several decades and has spent around $ 80 million on the research .
They and other government agencies estimate the cost of electricity supplied from an orbiting solar array could be around $ 1 billion per megawatt , which is too expensive to be commercially viable .
The Japanese realize the cost of building the solar station in orbit would be prohibitive at the moment , and the array could not be commercially viable at today 's prices .
The Japanese consortium therefore has to find ways of drastically reducing the costs .
With the launch of a single rocket costing around 10 billion yen , the cost of the space solar station could be as high as two trillion yen , according to Koji Umehara , the Director of the Japanese Space Development and Utilization ministry , making the electricity supplied exorbitantly expensive .
The first step in bringing the plans to fruition will be the launch in around 2015 of a satellite fitted with solar panels that will beam electricity to earth .
JAXA , the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency plans to have the orbiting space solar system operational some time in the 2030s .

Lines are beginning to be more sharply drawn in the Senate on healthcare reform , as the progressive Senators are breaking through with their message , and the Senate moves more and more toward the inevitable conclusion : real reform is going to require reconciliation .
Chuck Schumer has been very effectively making that argument , as he does in an interview with The American Prospect
Ah , so , so the bottom line is that even with 60 or even if Olympia Snowe comes to some kind of agreement , it ’s going to be hard , and I ’ve always favored using reconciliation for good parts of the bill .
I think that will get you the best bill , the strongest bill and the bill that will have the greatest positive effect on the American people .
Ultimately , we ’ll be judged not by whether we pass the bill , but ultimately we ’ll be judged by whether it works .
Leaving the bill as something that does n’t work , even if we pass it , leads to hurting both the country and the party ....
We 've looked at it and you can't use reconciliation for everything , [ but ] you can use it for a good number of things , " he said .
" There 's nothing wrong with using it for the places where you can use it and then trying to get the 60 votes on the places where when you can't .
You'd be surprised -- the number of places where you can use it is larger than we first thought .
Yesterday Howard Dean reinforced that point , that reconciliation was viable prospect for getting some of the better parts of the bill passed , and emphasizing that the majority of Democratic Senators does indeed support a stronger bill -- enough of them to pass a public option through reconciliation .
And one of those Democratic Senators , Jay Rockefeller , reinforces why it has to be a robust public option and not fake version like a co-op .
Watch :
DR .
DEAN : Well , I do n't think so .
I mean , by my vote count , we got 51 votes in the Senate to pass healthcare reform with the public option .
So , you know , we 'll ...
MR .
GREGORY : Yeah .
That 'd be ramming it through .
That would be a reconciliation strategy ...
DR .
DEAN : Look ... MR. GREGORY : ... and ... DR .
DEAN : I - - you -- in this audience , I think we can talk about ramming stuff through .
Newt 's been the speaker .
Republicans and Democrats both rammed things through .
The -- at , at the end of the day , the American people want a bill .
And it 's -- they 're not going to care if it 's reconciliation or if , if it 's ramming it through .
What they want is a decent bill that makes sense to them .
****** STEPHANOPOULOS : ... Now , Senator Rockefeller , I know you have said that this is a critical component of the health care plan .
You heard the president on Wednesday night .
He says he supports it , but you can't sacrifice the entire bill for the sake of this public option .
Can you vote for a bill without a robust public health option ?
ROCKEFELLER :
If there were a good alternative , I would certainly have to look at it .
STEPHANOPOULOS : What 's a good alternative ?
ROCKEFELLER : I have n't found one .
See , that 's the whole point .
People talk about a cooperative plan , health co-ops .
And I called the head of the national association really early , and he said it 's great on water , it 's great on farm , it 's great on electricity , et cetera , but it really does n't work for health care .
There 's fewer than 20 in the country , and there are only two that really work , and one of them is in Washington , the other is in Minneapolis , in Minnesota .
And both these senators from Washington are voting for a public option .
So it does n't -- it has n't had a future .
It goes back to the '30s and '40s .
And I just do n't think you can take the chance .
You have to start a national thing , all of the way up , or would you do it state - by - state , which would be harder .
Finally , it 's conveniently forgotten by most of the beltway establishment , but there 's another Senate committee besides the Baucus debacle that has a say in healthcare reform .
Sen. Kennedy 's HELP Committee now has a new chair , Tom Harkin , and Tom Harkin sounds pretty determined .
" I 'm ready to get a health reform bill passed and to President Obama before Christmas comes this December .
And you might as well stay standing because that strong health reform bill — mark my word , I 'm the chairman — is going to have a strong public option in that bill .
Sounds like the House Progressive Block might be getting some allies in the Senate .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A Senate panel voted on Thursday to bar drug companies from paying generic drugmakers to delay bringing their cheaper medicines to market .
The Judiciary Committee voted 12 to 7 to forbid such deals .
Lawmakers are seeking to ban the complicated deals that often arise after a generic drugmaker begins the process of bringing to market a cheaper version of a branded medicine .
The owner of the patent for the brand name drug often accuses the generic firm of infringement and the result is sometimes a settlement that the Federal Trade Commission calls a “ pay for delay ” deal .
The pharmaceutical companies argue that they are an effective way to resolve expensive litigation and often result in generic drugs coming to market before patents expire anyway .
The FTC has led the fight against the deals and has filed suit against several of them with mixed success .
The Justice Department , which did not oppose the settlements during the Bush administration , said in July that it considered a payment to a generic company to drop a patent challenge to be “ presumptively unlawful . ”
President Barack Obama supports a ban .
European Union antitrust regulators also oppose the deals .
Consumers , insurance companies and the federal government spend an extra $ 3.5 billion for prescription drugs every year because brand - name companies pay generic producers to stay out of the market , according to a FTC study released in June .
A branded medicine quickly loses upward of 80 percent of its revenue once cheaper generic versions start flooding the market .
The first known “ pay for delay ” deal was in 1994 , when Bristol - Myers Squibb Co paid $ 290 million to Schein Pharmaceutical to delay the sale of a generic version of the Bristol - Myers anxiety drug Buspar .
“ Pay for delay ” bills are being stiffly fought by both the brand - name pharmaceutical and generic drugmakers .

Das Datenleck bei Libri.de war größer als gestern berichtet .
Wir hatten gestern Zugang zu vielen der über 1000 Shops , die im Libri.de - Marktplatz existieren .
Darin fanden sich sämtliche digitalen Daten der jeweiligen Online - Vertriebs - Geschichte !
Am Donnerstag haben wir exklusiv über eine Sicherheitslücke beim Online - Marktplatz Libri.de berichtet , über die wir Zugang zu ca. 500.000 Rechnungen hatten .
Der Marktplatz funktioniert als Shop - System .
Mehr als 1000 Buchhändler haben sich dort einen Shop angelegt und wickeln bequem ihre Online - Bestellungen über diesen ab .
Aufgrund der Berichterstattung erhielten wir einen weiteren Hinweis auf weitere Sicherheitslücken bei Libri.de .
Wir bekamen den Hinweis , dass man sich mit den Login - Daten „ 70006000 “ ( Beispielzahl ! ) mit demselben Passwort in den ersten Shop einloggen konnte und dann jeweils mit der nächsthöheren Zahl , also „ 70006001 “ in den nächsten Shop. ( Kein Scherz : Dieselbe Situation wie bei den Rechnungen ! )
Das probierten wir bei den ersten 3 - 4 Shops aus und es klappte jedes Mal mit dieser Zahlenkombination .
Wir verzichteten dann darauf , aus den weiteren über 1000 Möglichkeiten gezielt nach shop.spiegel .de zu suchen .
Das , was wir hier vorfinden , erstaunt uns sehr – gelinde gesagt .
Wir haben die Geschichte kurz durch Screenshots dokumentiert und parallel den Hamburger Datenschutzbeauftragten sowie die Libri.de Geschäftsführung informiert .
Letzterer gaben wir den Hinweis , sofort die Passwörter zu resetten ( Passierte ziemlich schnell ) und dazu bis Freitag Vormittag Vorbereitungszeit und Möglichkeit für ein Statement , bis wir die Geschichte veröffentlichen .
Auf einigen Screenshots habe ich alle personenbezogenen Daten geschwärzt und alles mit personenbezogenen Daten anschließend gelöscht .
Das fanden wir vor :
Wir hatten Zugriff auf die kompletten Bestellstatistiken , die Bestellhistorie , Beleghistorie und Kundenliste ( Mit Mail - und Postadressen ) .
Dazu hätten wir die Möglichkeit gehabt , einen Shop „ zu übernehmen “ , indem wir die Zugangs - und Kontaktdaten ändern und selbstverständlich hätten wir auch gleich allen Kunden eine Mail schicken können mit der Empfehlung eines „ ähnlichen Buches “ .
Dazu waren anscheinend Manipulationen der Bestell - und Beleghistorie möglich .
Das waren also Shop für Shop sämtliche bisher digital angefallenen Daten des digitalen Vertriebs .
Man kann davon ausgehen , dass alle über 1000 Shopbetreiber vom System die Default - Logins XXXXYYYY / und XXXXYYYY bekommen haben .
In der Regel dürften die Default - Passwörter nicht geändert worden sein .
Wir haben es nur bei wenigen Shops ausprobiert und kamen in jeden einzelnen mit der Kombination hinein .
Theoretisch hätte jeder Shopbetreiber mit etwas kritischem Denken ausprobieren können , ob man in die Shops der Konkurrenz rein kommt und sich dabei anschauen können , was deren Kunden so kaufen – und das hätte oft geklappt !
Natürlich tragen die Shopbetreiber auch einen Teil der Verantwortung , Standardpasswörter sofort zu ändern .
Im Gegensatz zu den 500.000 Rechnungen standen in den einzelnen Shop mehr private und gewerbliche Daten .
Diese hätten besser abgesichert sein können , indem man sofort andere Passwortkombinationen beim Neuanlegen eines Shops verschickt .
Und man kann wieder nach der Qualität der TÜV SÜD „ s@fer Shopping Zertifikate “ fragen .
Warum ist diese eklatante Sicherheitslücke nicht bei der Zertifizierung und der damit verbundenen Sicherheitsüberprüfung aufgefallen ?
Wir haben versucht , zu einigen Shop - Betreibern Kontakt aufzunehmen , von denen wir aus dem System die Zugangsdaten hatten .
Aber leider waren zufällig alle Verantwortlichen entweder nicht da oder schlicht überfordert , uns am Telefon eine kurze Stellungnahme zu dem Vorfall zu geben .
Einer wirkte leicht geschockt , als wir ihm erklärten , dass wir gerade seinen Shop mit allen Daten sehen können .
Eine andere Person erklärte uns , dass das nicht möglich sein könnte , weil man den Shop - Betreiber gewechselt hätte .
Diesen mussten wir dann aufklären , dass seine digitale Shop - Historie weiterhin bei Libri.de gespeichert ist .
Johannes Caspar , der Hamburger Beauftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit , hat uns ein Statement zu diesem neuen Fall gegeben :
„ Die neuerlichen Weiterungen des Falles dokumentieren ein erschreckendes Ausmaß an Unkenntnis und Nachlässigkeit im Umgang mit Daten und der Datensicherheit .
Dies gilt zunächst für die Vergabe von Initialpasswörtern durch Libri .
Deren simple numerische Parameter laden die Store - Betreiber geradezu ein zu testen , ob es möglich ist , zu sehen , was die Konkurrenz so treibt .
Das gilt aber auch für die Storebetreiber selbst , die ihre geschäftlichen Daten offenbar für so wenig schützenswert achten , dass sie auf eine Änderung des Zugangspassworts für ihren Store verzichten .
Dass sie dadurch auch die persönlichen Daten ihrer Kunden preisgeben , ist aus Datenschutzsicht nicht hinnehmbar . “
Und auch libri.de die Möglichkeit eingeräumt , mit einem Statement zu reagieren :
Störfall Timeline · Sofort nach dem Anruf wurde durch die Systemadministration der Zugang über das Internet zu dem betroffenen Content - Managementsystem gesperrt .
· Direkt danach , um etwa 13:30 begann die Technik damit , die Sicherheits - Logs zu dem betroffenen System auszuwerten und nach auffälligen Zugriffsmustern zu forschen .
Die betroffenen Accounts konnten ermittelt werden .
Insgesamt wurden drei erfolgreiche Versuche erkannt .
Daten aus den Accounts wurden nicht in Umlauf gebracht .
· Um etwa 13:45 konnte die Ursache eingegrenzt werden : Bei den betroffenen Accounts wurden die initial vergebenen Default - Passworte nicht durch den Besitzer des Accounts geändert .
Hierdurch konnte sich der Angreifer durch systematisches Erraten des Passwortes einen illegalen Zugang verschaffen .
· Um etwa 14:00 : In einer Besprechung zwischen Technik und Betrieb wurde die Lage diskutiert : Da alle Passworte verschlüsselt gespeichert werden , kann nicht ermittelt werden , welche Buchhändler - Accounts gefährdet sein könnten und weiterhin die ( unsicheren ) Default - Passwörter oder zu schwache Passwörter verwenden .
Daher wurde beschlossen , dass alle Passwörter mit einem sicheren Passwort - Generator neu gesetzt werden .
Zudem wurden die folgenden technischen Änderungen beschlossen : I . Nach dem ersten Login wird der Benutzer gezwungen , sein Passwort sofort zu ändern .
II .
Es wird durch technische Mittel die Wahl eines sicheren Passwortes erzwungen .
III .
Nach drei fehlgeschlagenen Login - Versuchen muss der Benutzer ein CAPTCHA lösen , bevor ein erneuter Login - Versuch möglich ist .
So soll ein automatisierter Angriff verhindert werden .
· Um 14:15 Uhr wurde in der Technik mit der Umsetzung der Maßnahmen II .
und III . begonnen .
· Um 18:50 Uhr wurden die Änderungen an der Benutzerverwaltung des Content - Management Systems abgeschlossen .
· Um 18:57 Uhr wurden die Änderungen auf dem Test - System installiert und zum Test freigegeben .
· Um 20:30 Uhr wurden alle Passworte neu gesetzt .
· Um 21.15 Uhr wurden die Änderungen in den Live - Betrieb übernommen .
· Das Content - Management System wird den Buchhändlern im Laufe des Freitags , 30.10.2009 wieder über das Internet zugänglich gemacht .
Wir haben auch den Chaos Computer Club um ein Statement gebeten .
Frank Rosengart , Sprecher des CCC , dazu :
„ Libri.de hat bewiesen , dass sie nichtmal über Grundkenntnisse in IT - Sicherheit verfügen .
Das vergeben von solchen initialpasswörtern darf einfach nicht passieren und in Kombination mit der PDF - URL - Änderung muss man leider davon ausgehen , dass personenbezogene Daten bei libri.de nicht gut aufgehoben sind .
Das Unternehmen hielt es bisher auch nicht für notwendig , seine Kunden über das Problem zu informieren , was das Mindeste in einer solchen Situation gewesen wäre . “
Mein Fazit :
Libris Bemühen um Sicherheit wird sich ab jetzt einzig und allein in einem Punkt messen lassen : Transparenz , Information aller Betroffenen und positive Belege dafür , dass sich so etwas nicht wiederholt und wir demnächst keinen Teil drei haben .
Update :
In den Kommentaren hat jemand die Rundmail an die Libri. de - Händler gepostet .
Der beste
Teil daran :
Liebe Partnerbuchhändler , gestern hat der Internetblog Netzpolitik.org versucht sich illegal Zugang zum Libri.de Partnermanager von Buchhandlungen zu verschaffen .
Dies ist ihm in drei Fällen , in denen Buchhändler das initiale Passwort entgegen den Anforderungen nicht gegen ein eigenes sicheres Passwort ausgetauscht haben , durch systematisches Raten gelungen .
Die drei Buchhändler wurden durch uns informiert .
Alle anderen Buchhändler waren nicht betroffen .
Ebenso wurden keine Kundendaten verbreitet .
Ok , wir sind schuld , dass da so geschlampt wurde .

Brands and companies are both displayed in descending order according to their percentage change in volume sales .
There were 26 selling days in August 2009 and 27 selling days in August 2008 , so the change in monthly sales volume will be different than the change in the average daily sales rate for each brand / company .

After reviewing the U.S. auto industry 's sales numbers for August 2009 , the true effect of the government 's Cash for Clunkers program has come into crystal clear focus .
There are those automakers that were prepared for this promotion , having at the right time and place a lineup that was eminently attractive to the hoards of shoppers with a clunker to trade .
Then there are those other automakers that either by the very nature of their products or the fact that they spent the last few years twiddling their thumbs ( or going bankrupt ) were unable to take full advantage of the U.S. government 's open pockets .
Despite having sold fewer C4C vehicles than Honda and Toyota Ford was clearly the bigger winner last month with an increase of 16.99 % for all of Ford Motor Company and a 21.25 - percent jump for the Ford brand itself .
Those numbers include big gains for the Fusion ( up 131.6 percent ) , Focus ( up 55.9 percent ) and Flex ( up 106.5 percent ) .
Even the Mercury Milan was up 111.7 percent .
Toyota Motors Sales and American Honda did post positive gains as well , up 6.41 and 9.93 percent respectively , while Nissan North America improved to a slight decline of 2.93 percent .
Then there 's Chrysler Group LLC and General Motors , down 15.43 and 20.19 percent respectively .
While the C4C program no doubt improved what might otherwise have been an even more dismal month for these two automakers , they were clearly unable to take full advantage of the program with the baggage of recent bankruptcy around their necks and lineups , at least in Chrysler 's case , that offered little incentive to upgrade one 's clunker .
The trio of brands that has continually outpaced the rest of the industry this year – Subaru ( up 51.51 percent ) , Kia ( up 60.38 percent ) and Hyundai ( up 47.01 percent ) – continued their winning ways and then some , each reporting all - time sales records last month thanks to a boost from the C4C program .
To put their success in perspective , Hyundai and Kia together outsold Dodge Jeep and Chrysler and Subaru outsold rivals Mazda and Volkswagen
NAIROBI , Kenya 
The Sudanese journalist who was convicted of violating her country ’s decency laws for wearing a pair of green slacks in public was released from jail on Tuesday , though she is not exactly sure why .
Lubna Hussein , the journalist , was jailed on Monday after refusing to pay a fine .
Under Islamic law , she had faced up to 40 lashings , which instantly turned her case into something of an international sensation .
Mrs. Hussein said that she did not pay the fine  approximately $ 200  though a Sudanese journalist organization may have .
Sudan is partly ruled by Islamic law , and Article 152 of the country ’s penal code states that anyone “ who commits an indecent act which violates public morality or wears indecent clothing ” can be fined and lashed up to 40 times .
Mrs. Hussein has vowed to appeal the conviction , and on Tuesday she said : “ I will keep wearing the trousers .
I wo n’t be affected by the court .
This is my normal life . ”
It all started when a news agency Xinhua reported ( made up ) the existence of a city in the northern Swedish woods with 25,000 inhabitants , all hot women living together to satisfy their Scandinavian sexual desires .
The city , called Chako Paul was founded in 1820 by a rich widow and is guarded by two blonde guards that will strike men down that try to enter the city of Nordic lesbian love .
Sadly , as you would probably expect , the city does n’t exist .
But the Chinese , being so “ inquisitive ” have crippled Swedish ISP ’s with searches for “ Chako Paul ” .
According toValleywag , “ Chinese men have “ swamped … Swedish tourism bodies ” with such burning questions in recent days , millions of them .
EDIT : News is that now the Japanese are curious about the Swedish Lesbians too .
The myth , created by the Chinese media reached Sweden has left the local tourist office of Ulmeå reporting to the register that they are fairly certain that no such city excised in Sweden , based on the fact that that a city like that would be the biggest city in all of northern Sweden !
It seems that no Swedish entrepreneur has set up a website to accommodate these Chinese men on a search for the ‘ lost women of Chako Paul ’ .
If you are into web development …
Time to buy Chakopaul.com and run some ads !
EDIT : Shanghaiist.com dug around and translated the Chinese article as follows :
“ In Sweden , there is a place that is respectful of women ’s love , but with a rule that men cannot enter .
This is Chako Paul City .
The town holds around 25,000 women , all from around Europe .
If men transgress into the forbidden city , they will be beaten half to death .
The citizens of Chako Paul are mostly engaged in the forest industry , because of such many of the women wear thick belts full of woodworking equipment .
Some go into nearby cities to work and return to Chako Paul by night .
Chako Paul ’s tourism industry is increasingly prosperous , with hotels and restaurants everywhere that cater specifically to women around the world . ”

David Letterman , the late night talk show host , said on his show on Thursday that he had been the victim of an extortion attempt over charges of sexual affairs with staff members , claims that he conceded were true .
Mr. Letterman said on “ The Late Show , ” on CBS , that he had been approached by a person who wanted $ 2 million not to go public with information that Mr. Letterman had been in sexual relationships with women who work on his show .
Mr. Letterman said that he had testified before a grand jury and had admitted to the relationships .
“ My response to that is , yes I have .
Would it be embarrassing if it were made public ?
Perhaps it would , ” he said on the show .
“ I feel like I need to protect these people .
I need to certainly protect my family . ”
In March , Mr. Letterman , 62 , married his longtime girlfriend , Regina Lasko , whom he had been dating for two decades .
They have a son , now 6 .
For now , the invisibility cloak remains a thing of science fiction A physicist has said he hopes to make major advances in the field of invisibility in the next two years .
Professor Ulf Leonhardt at St Andrews University is working on a blueprint for a cloaking device that could also be used to shield coast lines .
The researcher , who cites the Invisible Woman and Harry Potter as inspiration , has been working on the concept of invisibility since 2006 .
The project will focus on a connection between light and curved space .
Prof Leonhardt , who describes his invisibility work as " geometry , light and a wee bit of magic " , hopes to manipulate modern metamaterials - or " designer atoms " to create an invisibility device using the laws of refraction .
He believes that in bending light , transparent materials like glass or water appear to distort the geometry of space , which is the cause of many optical illusions , including invisibility .
' Extreme ideas ' Prof Leonhardt said : " The idea of invisibility has fascinated people for millennia , inspiring many myths , novels and films .
" In 2006 , I began my involvement in turning invisibility from fiction into science , and , over the next two years , I plan to develop ideas that may turn invisibility from frontier science into applicable technology . "
Although the professor admitted it was difficult to predict possible applications , he suggested invisibility research could be used to improve visibility , leading to the development of the perfect retroreflectors ( cats eyes ) , better microscopes and improved lenses .
He added : " I will most certainly find easier ways of cloaking , but it remains to be seen how practical they are .
" The important thing is to understand the foundations and come up with something new or take an existing idea to extremes ; using technology and ideas to make things happen - technology we cannot imagine would ever exist . "
The project is being funded by the Royal Society 's Theo Murphy Blue Skies Award .

GDP data is often poorly measured , especially for sub-Saharan Africa .
This column shows that satellite data on lights at night can be used to enhance the quality of GDP growth measures .
Using rainfall and satellite data , it also shows that growth of immediate agricultural hinterland of a sub-Saharan city spurs growth of the city .
GDP growth is poorly measured for many countries ( Johnson , Larson , Papageorgiou , and Subramanian , 2009 ) and rarely measured for cities at all .
The Penn World Tables rank countries by the quality of their GDP and price data , with grades A - D. Almost all sub-Saharan African countries get a grade of C or D , to be interpreted roughly as a 30 % or 40 % margin of error ( Deaton and Heston , 2008 ) .
Given the low quality of GDP measures for countries and the almost total absence of GDP measures for sub-national units such as cities , we propose a readily available proxy : satellite data on lights at night .
The best use of lights data is to examine growth in GDP rather than GDP levels , so that cross-country differences in how lights spatially and culturally reflect consumption are differenced out .
We start by examining cross-country GDP growth rates , focusing on the period 1992 - 2003 , and develop a statistical framework for optimally combining the growth in lights measure for each country with estimates of GDP growth from the World Development Indicators .
We first establish that changes in lights are well related to particular positive or negative economic growth episodes for particular regions and times and , more generally , that growth in lights is a good predictor of growth in GDP measures .
As an illustration ( Elvidge et al , 2005 ) , Figure 1 contrasts the big increase in lights from 1992 to 2002 in the Eastern European countries of Poland , Hungary , and Romania with the distinct dimming of lights to the east in the former Soviet Republics of Moldova and the Ukraine , which endured a harsh transition process .
Figure 1 . Eastern Europe in lights
Next , we develop a framework to optimally combine measured GDP growth with growth in lights to obtain a best estimate of true GDP growth .
The objective is to minimise the variance of true GDP growth from its best estimate .
The weights placed on the World Bank GDP growth measure and the lights growth measure depend in part on the ratio of signal to total variance in the World Bank measure .
Applying our method to the countries given a data quality grade D in the Penn World Tables , we get estimates of true GDP growth that are starkly different from conventional measures .
We assume the World Bank measures have a signal to total variance ratio of 0.75 .
This is likely to be conservative since grade D countries are expected to GDP levels measured with a 40 % margin of error .
As examples of the application , for the Democratic Republic of Congo , lights suggest a 2.4 % annual growth rate in GDP , while official estimates suggest a - 2.6 % growth over the same time period .
The Congo seems to be growing a lot faster than official estimates suggest .
At the other extreme , Myanmar has an official growth rate of 8.6 % a year , but the lights data imply only a 3.4 % annual growth rate .
Combining the two measures using the hypothesised signal to total variance ratio , the true growth rate estimates for Congo and Myanmar are 0.08 % and 4.6 % for 1992 - 2003 .
Finally , we turn to a long standing debate in developing countries about whether growth of the immediate agricultural hinterland of a city spurs growth of the city .
We use annual rainfall data for the hinterlands of 541 cities in sub-Saharan Africa as our exogenous source of agricultural growth .
We find that increases in rainfall have big positive effects on city growth as measured by changes in night lights , confirming the casual impression that African cities and towns are heavily dependent on the economic health of their immediate hinterlands .
Lights in a given year are affected not just by rain in the same year but also by rain in the previous two or even three years .
Not surprisingly the effects are smaller for the primate cities of a country which are less dependent on their agricultural hinterlands .
But overall city growth is closely connected to local hinterland growth .

Tackling spam ' should be part of campaign to reduce emissions '
A study into spam has blamed it for the production of more than 33bn kilowatt - hours of energy every year , enough to power more than 2.4 m homes .
The Carbon Footprint of e-mail Spam report estimated that 62 trillion spam emails are sent globally every year .
This amounted to emissions of more than 17 million tons of CO2 , the research by climate consultants ICF International and anti-virus firm McAfee found .
Searching for legitimate e-mails and deleting spam used some 80 % of energy .
The study found that the average business user generates 131kg of CO2 every year , of which 22 % is related to spam .
Unwanted traffic ICF say that spam filtering would reduce unwanted spam by 75 % , the equivalent to taking 2.3 million cars off the road .
However , the ICF goes on to say that while spam filtering is effective in reducing energy waste , fighting it at the source is far better .
The report highlights the case of McColo , a US web hosting firm that had ties to spammers .
The day after it was taken offline by its two internet service providers , global spam volume fell by 70 % .
Although the respite was only temporary , McAfee said the " day without spam amounted to talking 2.2 million cars off the road " and that tackling spam should be part of the campaign to reduce carbon emissions .
Richi Jennings - an independent spam analyst who helped produce the report - told the BBC that the figures were based on the extra energy use spent dealing with spam .
" The PC on our desks uses more power when they do work , so the numbers are based on the additional work they use when dealing with spam , " he said .
The Spam Report follows only a few days after Symantec 's bi-annual Internet Security Threat report , which found that spam had increased by 192 % , with bot networks responsible for approximately 90 % of all spam e-mail .
Mr Jennings said that while McAfee and Symantec had different ways of measuring spam , he was in total agreement with the bot network figure .
" Our report was based on mail that spammers attempt to send , including ones that are blocked by an ISP at source .
Symantec only measures spam that is successfully sent .
" The vast majority of spam is sent via botnets .
We 've got Conficker building a fantastic network and you can bet your bottom dollar that it will wind up being used to send spam .
" There is speculation that the botnet Conficker is building up is owned and run by the owners of another active botnet - Waledac , itself probably connected to the classic Storm botnet - and the theory is that the owners are keeping their powder dry at the moment and will activate it once Waledac goes down .

HUNTSVILLE , AL --
When 81 - year - old Carl Craig walked into Madison Guns & Ammo Tuesday , he did n't know the gun he was carrying was an illegal weapon .
Craig had a .410 gauge pistol , made sometime in the late 1920s or early 1930s .
" The reason it is illegal is that it 's a handgun that fires a shotgun shell , " said David Hyche , Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms resident agent in Huntsville and Birmingham .
The gun was handed down to Craig by his father about 60 years ago , but it 's been kept in a box for most of that time .
Earlier last week , Craig decided to have it appraised .
" It 's a pretty unusual weapon , " he said .
" It 's a shotgun , but it 's a pistol . "
After putting the gun 's information into the computer system at Madison Guns , the store was notified the weapon was illegal , requiring the store to hold it until local ATF officers could inspect the gun .
While Craig did n't understand how the store could legally keep his personal property , he left without his gun .
The next morning , he met with local ATF officers at the store to find out what the law said about his gun .
Tim Knox , owner of Madison Guns , said he had no choice but to confiscate the gun and contact the ATF once the computer said it was an illegal weapon .
" I could lose my federal firearms license , be fined up to $ 125,000 and go to prison for five years , " Knox said .
" My salesman could 've been arrested , and Mr. Craig could 've been arrested . "
ATF 's Hyche said Knox was correct in holding the gun , and ATF agents in Huntsville worked with Craig to make sure he could keep the gun .
To make this particular gun legal requires one of two things , Hyche said .
Craig could have the gun rifled - have grooves cut into the barrel - or he could have the gun disassembled .
Before Craig left Madison Guns Wednesday , the gun was disassembled , and he was able to take the heirloom back home .
In 1934 , the National Firearms Act outlawed short - barreled shotguns .
Technically , Craig 's antique gun is illegal under the law , but Hyche said the ATF 's concern was figuring out a way to let Craig keep it .
" This happens all the time , " he said .
" We do n't want ( the gun ) destroyed or take it away from the family . "
He said it 's common that people are left guns like this when family members die , and the best thing to do is contact the ATF .
" We do n't want to charge any of those people , " Hyche said .
" We almost always find a way to accommodate the person . "
Car set ablaze after Joliet woman used lighter to check gas can level
A 27 - year - old Joliet woman is suffering from second - degree burns after using a lighter to check the fuel level in a gas can she was filling while the can was resting inside her car .
Police officials said the woman drove into a 7 - 11 gas station at 1609 E. Cass St. at about 10:30 p.m.
Tuesday night and climbed out of her car .
She then placed the gas can on the passenger seat of the vehicle , pulled down the nozzle of the pump , and began filling the can .
About halfway through , the woman ignited a lighter to shine some light on the gas can , apparently to see how full the can was , officials said .
The can ignited from the lighter 's flame and exploded , setting the vehicle 's interior ablaze , officials said .
After the fire started , the woman pushed the car away from the gas pumps to apparently ensure the fire did n't spread to the gas pumps itself .
Officials said , when police and fire officials arrived on the scene , the car was located about 5 - feet from the pumps and was completely engulfed in flames .
The woman was transported from the scene to Silver Cross Hospital in Joliet with nonlife threatening injuries to her wrist and thigh , authorities said .

Advertisement Nepal 's president and prime minister have thanked visiting actress Joanna Lumley for helping get " justice " for British army Gurkha soldiers .
President Ram Baran Yadav said she had " championed " the cause , while Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal said Nepal was " rejoicing " over her achievement .
Ms Lumley , whose father was a Gurkha regiment officer , fronted a campaign for UK settlement rights for Gurkhas .
She was greeted in Nepal by a crowd with signs describing her a " goddess " .
' An honour ' President Yadav , who told her : " You have championed the cause of Gurkhas .
" For this social justice , I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to you and to all of your team members . "
After meeting the former Absolutely Fabulous star , the prime minster said all Nepalese people recognised her achievements .
Ms Lumley was adorned with scarves by admirers amid scenes of " chaos " " I think the Gurkhas have got justice , whether complete or just to some extent I cannot see , " he said .
After the meeting , Ms Lumley said it was an " honour " to meet the prime minister , adding that he had been " so gracious " to her .
The actress told reporters : " He made a wonderful speech of welcome and he was pleased with the work we have done for the Gurkha veterans . "
Her group will also have afternoon tea with the British ambassador to Nepal , Dr Andrew Hall , before laying a wreath at a war memorial near the embassy .
As part of her tour , Ms Lumley addressed an audience of Gurkha veterans at the capital Kathmandu 's city hall .
Ms Lumley is to travel around the country , including into the Himalayas , to meet more veterans .
' Fairytale '
Many of them were among hundreds of well - wishers who mobbed her at the airport , a reception she described as a " fairytale " .
On Tuesday , Ms Lumley will visit Jhapa and Dharan to meet Gurkhas ; on Wednesday the group will meet members of the Gurkha Welfare Trust charity ; and on Thursday she will visit with Gurkhas ' widows .
My friends of Nepal , I am your family coming to Nepal for the first time
Joanna Lumley
Lumley ' daughter of Nepal '
Finally , before flying back to the UK on 1 August , Ms Lumley will visit Lumbini , the birthplace of Buddha , and then return to Kathmandu to visit orphans and homeless children .
The BBC's Alastair Leithead in Kathmandu said there was " chaos " at Tribhuvan International Airport when Ms Lumley arrived .
Our correspondent added that Ms Lumley was regarded as an " absolute hero " in Nepal following her campaigns on behalf of the Gurkhas .
She greeted the crowd with the Gurkha battle cry " Ayo Gurkhali " .
Ms Lumley added : " My friends of Nepal , I am your family coming to Nepal for the first time .
" I want to thank you so much . "
' The rest is history '
Some of those who turned out to meet her carried placards which read : " Goddess Joanna " and " Thank you " .
Ms Lumley is travelling with Gurkha Justice campaigner Peter Carroll , who started the campaign for Gurkhas ' UK settlement rights .
He said some people were expected to walk for three days just to be a part of Ms Lumley 's visit .
Mr Carroll said that he expected he would be overshadowed by Ms Lumley - despite the fact that he is well known in Nepal for launching the campaign .
He explained how he first contacted Ms Lumley after a women in Kent tapped him on the shoulder and suggested he ask her to get involved .
Mr Carroll added : " The rest is history . "
In May , the government said all retired Gurkha soldiers - originally from Nepal - with at least four years service in the British Army , could stay in the UK .

The new Canadian Mental Health Commission is “ a wonderful opportunity ” for Christians to be involved in dealing with one of the most pressing issues in our society , according to one of its members .
Chris Summerville is one of 11 non-government members of the new Commission ’s board of directors .
Besides struggling with mental health issues himself , he is the interim CEO of the Schizophrenia Society of Canada , executive director of the Manitoba Schizophrenia Society , and a certified Psychosocial Rehabilitation Practitioner .
He is also a committed Christian and an ordained pastor with the Associated Gospel Churches of Canada .
Summerville said he hopes to bring a holistic approach to the issue that addresses body , mind , soul and spirit .
According to the Associated Gospel Church website , history section : “ The AGC traces its beginnings to the early 1890s when a group of independent evangelical churches became known as the Christian Workers ’ Church of Canada ”
UPDATE : The Canadian Schizophrenia Society Board of Directors contain no apparent Medical Doctors or PhD’s , and the first name of the list appears to be a police officer from Toronto .
UPDATE 2 : Pam Forsythe is a practising Psychiatrist

Cannibis smokers have a seven - fold schizophrenia risk
Harper government devotes funds to studying the link between marijuana use and mental illness
THE CANADIAN PRESS
WINNIPEG – The Harper government is putting up $ 550,000 to gather research on marijuana use and mental illness .
The Schizophrenia Society of Canada will use the money to further research the links between cannabis and early psychosis as well as develop promotional materials warning youth about the dangers of smoking pot .
The money is part of Ottawa ’s $ 30 million national anti-drug strategy announced in 2007 .
Chris Summerville , CEO of the Schizophrenia Society , said the public does n’t realize that cannabis users have a seven - fold increase in risk of developing schizophrenia .
He pointed to recent research out of Victoria , B.C. , linking pot smoking and mental illness .
As part of the society ’s research , some 30 youths who have experienced psychosis will be trained to gather information about the reasons their peers use cannabis .
The results will be used to develop educational materials aimed at decreasing the use of illicit drugs among young people .
Winnipeg Conservative MP
Joy Smith said Tuesday that while the public regards marijuana as a soft drug , there may be very serious consequences for young pot smokers who have a predisposition to mental illness .
“ Science has shown that cannabis may actually trigger the onset of psychosis and may also intensify the symptoms for those who already have a psychotic illness , ” Smith said in announcing the grant .
“ It has been suggested that up to 80 per cent of youth who have had a psychotic episode were using cannabis .
And that ’s pretty shocking , ” said Smith , who was filling in for Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq at news conference .

Like many of you , I was saddened to read the news of Patrick Swayze ’s untimely death – Roadhouse will forever be one of my most favorite movies .
Unfortunately , there are those who will look to take advantage of any opportunity to push their pseudoscientific nonsense , just as the douchebags over at NaturalNews.com have done regarding Swayze ’s death .
Swayze died of pancreatic cancer , and he fought the disease as best he could using science - based medicine .
But in an article apparently based in an alternate reality , these anti-science - based medicine folks state that it is precisely because he relied on science - based medicine that he died .
You ’ve that right , folks : according to these deluded people , science killed Patrick Swayze ! * facepalm *
Patrick Swayze dead at 57 after chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer
Beloved actor Patrick Swayze died yesterday evening after a 20 - month battle with pancreatic cancer .
Having put his faith in conventional chemotherapy , he largely dismissed ideas that nutrition , superfoods or “ alternative medicine ” might save him , instead betting his life on the chemotherapy approach which seeks to poison the body into a state of remission instead of nourishing it into a state of health .
Okay , so these morons start pushing the “ chemotherapy = poison ” line right off the bat .
This is nothing more than a blatant attempt to scare people about a useful & serious method for combating cancer .
By equating it with poison , they try to leave the reader with the impression that nothing good comes out of chemotherapy , despite the fact that it is one of the most reliable methods of treating cancer available .
Which leads to the next part of the article …
Peter Jennings died following chemotherapy for lung cancer .
Heath Ledger died following an accidental overdose of prescription medications ( http://www.naturalnews.com/022602.html).
Michael Jackson was killed by a doctor - administered injection of lethal painkillers .
Famed newscaster Tim Russert most likely died from the fatal side effects of cholesterol medications ( http://www.naturalnews.com/023434_T…).
Former White House Press Secretary Tony
Snow died after receiving chemotherapy for colon cancer ( http://www.naturalnews.com/023626_c…), and Bernie Mac was most likely killed by pharmaceutical side effects ( http://www.naturalnews.com/023817_B…).
In this screed of pure stupid , the NaturalNews.com goofs are displaying that time honored pseudoscientific trick of cherry picking : they are pointing out only high profile deaths associated with science - based medicine .
The one , and monumentally important , fact they ’re leaving out – intentionally , I think – is that there are vastly higher numbers of people who are treated & cured of their diseases & ailments using these methods than those who are killed .
And another thing to note is the slippery rhetoric used above … notice how in the cases of Peter Jennings & Tony Snow the article states that they “ died after receiving chemotherapy ” .
They did n’t die because of the chemotherapy , they died from cancer – but the article gives the impression ( again tying into the “ chemotherapy = poison ” nonsense ) that it was the chemotherapy that killed Jennings & Snow !
This is a common logical fallacy called post hoc ergo propter hoc , or “ after this , therefore because ( on account ) of this ” – implying that because these people died after they had chemotherapy that it must have been the chemo that killed them .
It ’s also a completely douchebaggy move to make , for reasons I ’ll outline below after I vent my spleen some more .
And this next section of the article is perhaps the most reprehensible …
Western medicine offers no hope , no solutions
Of course , the cancer industry takes no responsibility for his death .
Drug companies and cancer docs never accept responsibility for the way their poisonous treatments harm ( and often kill ) many fine people .
Had Patrick Swayze ’s pancreatic cancer gone away , doctors would have hailed chemotherapy as the genius treatment that saved Swayze ’s life .
But chemotherapy has never healed anyone of cancer .
Not once in the history of medicine .
And when people die after being poisoned by chemotherapy , the oncologists and conventional medical doctors just shrug and say ridiculous things like , “ The cancer was too far along ” or “ He did n’t fight it hard enough . ”
No one fought cancer more diligently and optimistically than Patrick Swayze .
Even after being diagnosed with an admittedly scary disease — pancreatic cancer — he remained upbeat and enthusiastic about beating the condition .
He put more faith in conventional medicine and chemotherapy than perhaps anyone , and yet that medicine failed him just the same .
No one can fault Swayze himself for a lack of optimism .
“ I want to last until they find a cure , which means I ’d better get a fire under it , ” Swayze said in a highly - publicized interview with ABC ’s Barbara Walters .
No one apparently told Swayze the cancer industry is n’t looking for a cure .
They ’re looking for more business from more patients , and a genuine “ cure ” for cancer is flatly incompatible with the industry ’s business interests .
I do n’t even know where to begin with this steaming pile of crap .
Essentially , this last bit is one big , long conspiracy - mongering rant against all forms of science - based medicine .
They even say it in the section title “ Western medicine offers no hope , no solutions ” , by which when they say Western they mean scientific .
This is , again , meant to reinforce the too - widely held belief that science - based medicine cannot be trusted because all it is is a vehicle for the pharmaceutical industry to make money , also known as the Big Pharma conspiracy .
By painting any and all science - based medicine with such a brush , these “ natural cures ” woo -meisters hope to force people into believing a false dichotomy : that if science - based medicine is bad & useless , then by default the “ natural cures ” stuff must be good ( despite the lack of evidence that such “ natural cures ” are useful at all ) !
Folks , this is the same kind of argumentation employed by pseudoscientists of numerous stripes , from creationists to global warming deniers to all manner of medical quackery such as the “ natural cures ” crowd .
Note that these folks do not offer any actual science - based evidence that their supposed cures will actually cure people ’s cancer , they merely talk trash and attempt to make the medical & scientific communities out to be the bad guys .
They are offering no solutions that can be scientifically tested & verified , they are merely feeding into people ’s most base & nasty emotions in an attempt to pawn off upon them completely useless and un-regulated snake - oil “ cures ” which will do nothing but lighten your wallet while making you suspicious of actual medicine which works .
You know , now that I think about it , calling these people douchebags is kind of an insult … to douchebags .

How to Develop an SEO Link Building Strategy That Delivers the Goods ( Link Value )
Links are king when it comes to SEO .
Search engines view links as votes for a site and the higher the quantity and quality of links your site has , the better your chances of ranking for related keywords in the search results ( Google , Yahoo , Bing ) .
If you know anything about SEO , you ’re probably sitting there saying , “ no duh ” .
The problem is that not all links count for SEO purposes , and if they do , it ’s always in varying degrees .
Just because you see blue underlined text in your browser does n’t mean that Google will pass over the SEO link value to the site being linked to .
In fact , some links may be completely invisible to the search engines .
In other cases , Google may choose to discount the value of links for whatever reason .
How do you know whether or not a link on a certain page passes SEO value ?
What are the cases in which links do n’t count ?
If you ’re engaging in any sort of link building or online advertising campaign , these are important questions to ask and get clear answers to .
You need to prevent yourself from wasting precious time building worthless links that have no impact and instead understand which links have the greatest effect for your SEO rankings in order to maximize ROI .
We ’ll go into everything about SEO link value in this post .
Links that count for SEO – 2 requirements of all SEO links
In order for a link to pass SEO link value , there are 2 main conditions that need to be met .
1 . The link must be hard coded in HTML .
As long as the link uses something like < a href = ” http://www.site.com” > , it ’s fair game .
Google has also started to count Javascript links , but HTML is still the ideal .
We ’ll get more into Javascript later .
2 . The page that the link resides on must be indexed in Google .
After all , a link can only pass value as long as Google knows about it .
You can check whether or not a page is indexed by using the “ site : ” operator in the Google search box followed by the URL in question .
Remember that new pages usually take at least a few days to be crawled and indexed .
Links that DON ’T count for SEO , technically speaking
Although the two conditions above are prerequisites for a link to count for SEO , they do n’t automatically infer that a link passes value .
What do I mean ?
Below are some technical exceptions that lead to a link NOT counting in the eyes of Google .
1. Nofollow tag
If a link uses the rel= ” nofollow ” tag , Google ignores the link and does not pass any value ( or they say they do n’t anyway ) .
This tag is used in the comments section of many blog platforms ( to prevent spamming ) and is also required by Google on any advertisements or links that are paid for ( a hole in Google ’s algorithm ) .
2. Robots nofollow
Similar to the nofollow tag , the meta robots nofollow tag found in the header of a page , leads to all links on that page to be nofollowed .
You can easily check for any nofollows on links by using the SEO for Firefox tool .
3. Redirect links
Any time a link goes through an intermediary page to track ad clicks or sales or to put up a disclaimer page , the link will not pass value to the resulting page unless a 301 permanent redirect is used ( as opposed to a temporary 302 redirect ) .
You can check for this by using the Check Server Headers Tool .
For example , all banners ads here on Winning the Web go through a OIOPublisher tracking URL ( e.g .
http://www.winningtheweb.com/wp-content/plugins/oiopub-direct/modules/ tracker/go.php?id=36 ) .
If you plug that URL into the header checker tool , you ’ll see that it uses a 301 redirect to the advertiser site .
This link would normally pass value , but in this case I ’m using nofollow as well so it does n’t . 😉
4. Javascript links
Up until recently , Javascript links were invisible to the search engines .
Google has now begun crawling Javascript links – but there ’s still debate over whether or not links that use the onClick event ( to construct the destination URL ) passes value .
Use HTML links whenever possible .
If you were previously using Javascript to hide advertisement links from the search engines , use HTML and nofollow instead .
Symptoms and signs of devalued links
Okay , so say that the links pointing to your site are technically sound and are supposed to pass SEO value .
Does that mean they do ?
Not necessarily .
Below are some symptoms and signs that Google has devalued a link .
1. Strangely low PageRank
Although toolbar PageRank is n’t all that reliable of a metric , it can still point to problem areas on a site where links are devalued .
For example , if a site sells obvious paid links , Google will often whack its PR and stop the flow of link value from the site .
2 . Slow crawl rate , old cache date
I ’ve said before that crawl rate is the new PageRank .
If Google trusts a page and considers it important , the bots are going to visit and index it often .
Check the cache date of the page your links are hosted on by clicking on the Cache link next to the search listing .
If it ’s over a month old , that ’s a sign that the page is not trusted ( bad neighborhood , low authority , etc. ) and the links do n’t pass value as a result .
3. Link location
Furthermore , sitewide links in the footer or sidebar of pages can be devalued because they are often used as advertisements to manipulate the search results .
Google loves editorial links within the content of the page and will usually give the most weight to these links .
Location matters .
How to check if a link passes SEO value
Is there a way to check whether or not a particular link passes SEO value ?
Yes , but it ’s not always easy .
What you do is you create a link on the target location with anchor text containing a unique modifier .
For example , if I was placing a link to Winning the Web from some random location I was testing , I might try adding a link that says “ jibberjab internet marketing ” , an obscure but somewhat related keyword that ’s not found on any of my pages .
If after a short while , the Winning the Web page being linked to ranked for that term , I ’d know for certain that it was a result of that particular link passing value .
Get the idea ?
Let ’s try a live example and link to an iPhone blog ( iPhoneNuts.com ) I run using the link iPhonerific .
After a few days , try doing a search in Google for iphonerific .
If you see that the iPhoneNuts.com page ranks anywhere on the first few pages , then you know that this article passes link value . 🙂
Do you know how to build links that pass SEO value ?
What are some other considerations that you think are important ?

Il post precedente , naturalmente , era solo una battuta .
Questo è invece un elenco di date su quel che è successo tra il ' 92 e il ' 94 , che forse può aiutare in termini di chiarezza e di memoria .
In gran parte si tratta di un banale copiaincolla dalla cronologia di un mio libro del ' 94 , oggi fuori catalogo , sulla nascita di Forza Italia , integrato da un po ' di notizie uscite in passato o di recente e da qualche considerazione conseguente .
E' quindi solo un penny offerto alla ricostruzione di quel periodo : non contiene niente di nuovo e sicuramente manca qualcosa - perciò qualsiasi aggiunta o correzione è benvenuta .
Perché è importante quello che è successo tra il 92 e il 94 ?
Perché è un periodo fondamentale per capire tutto quello che è successo dopo .
La situazione in cui viviamo oggi è il risultato del grande caos che ci fu tra il 92 e il 94 , con la fine della Prima repubblica e l'ingresso in politica di Berlusconi .
Partiamo dal 1992 : i fatti .
Il 30 gennaio del 1992 la Cassazione chiude il maxiprocesso alla mafia con 360 condanne - di cui 19 ergastoli e 2.665 anni di carcere .
E' la prima volta che Cosa Nostra subisce un colpo così duro .
Poco dopo però , lo Stato entra gradualmente in una crisi di gravità mai vista prima , che inizia il 17 febbraio , con l'arresto di Mario Chiesa : scoppia Tangentopoli , il Psi e la Dc ( che reggevano il governo ) iniziano a sfaldarsi .
Il 1 marzo viene ucciso il deputato dc Salvo Lima , andreottiano , già garante dei rapporti tra mafia e Stato , rapporti entrati in crisi dopo il maxiprocesso e la sentenza della Cassazione .
Il 23 maggio viene ucciso Giovanni Falcone , tra gli artefici del maxiprocesso che aveva messo in crisi Cosa Nostra .
Tra maggio e luglio c'è una gigantesca speculazione attorno alla lira che porta il paese al rischio default ( e qualcuno ritiene che a innescare questa crisi siano stati anche i capitali della mafia ) .
Il 1 giugno , per la prima volta Berlusconi dice che " potrebbe fare un pensierino " a diventare presidente del Consiglio ( a Cernobbio , intervistato dalla " Provincia " di Como ) .
Il 19 luglio viene ucciso Paolo Borsellino ( strage di via D'Amelio ) .
Ad agosto diventa legge il " carcere duro " ( articolo 41 bis ) per i mafiosi .
Il 17 settembre la mafia uccide Ignazio Salvo , un altro ex referente politico della mafia in Sicilia .
A settembre iniziano le cene di Berlusconi con gli imprenditori , con cui il Cavaliere sonda il gradimento di un suo ingresso in politica .
Il 15 dicembre 1992 Craxi riceve il suo primo avviso di garanzia .
Insomma ?
Insomma nel 92 avvengono due processi in parallelo e forse intrecciati : da un lato sta iniziando a cadere il sistema politico che ha retto l'Italia dall ' inizio del Dopoguerra , e qualcuno si prepara per sostituirlo .
Dall ' altro c'è la mafia che , persi i suoi tradizionali appoggi nello Stato e infuriata per quanto ottenuto dal pool di Palermo , reagisce con la bomba di Capaci firmata Riina .
Poi , attraverso Vito Ciancimino ( altro andreottiano ) da quanto emerso di recente Cosa Nostra avrebbe iniziato una trattativa con settori dello Stato ( servizi e carabinieri ) .
A quella trattativa si sarebbe opposto Borsellino .
Alcuni ritengono che Borsellino sia stato ucciso proprio per questo .
Di recente Riina ( condannato anche per l'omicidio Borsellino ) ha sostenuto che Borsellino " lo hanno ammazzato loro " , cioè uomini dello Stato , dei servizi , che lo consideravano d'intralcio alla trattativa .
In ogni caso , dall ' agosto del 92 i mafiosi vengono sottoposti al 41 bis , nel gennaio dell ' anno dopo Riina finisce in carcere e Cosa Nostra ha un nuovo capo , Provenzano .
La strategia di Riina ( quella che ha portato alla strage di Capaci e , per quel che si sa finora , a quella di via D'Amelio ) è quindi fallita .
E nel '93 che cosa succede ?
Lo smottamento della prima repubblica prosegue , con l'inchiesta Mani Pulite che va espandendosi fino a coinvolgere buona parte della Dc e il Psi .
L'11 febbraio ' 93 Craxi si dimette da segretario del Psi .
Il 27 marzo '93 Andreotti viene indagato per associazione mafiosa .
Il 5 aprile è indagato Forlani .
Dunque i tre uomini che garantivano la stabilità di governo ( il cosiddetto Caf , Craxi , Andreotti , Forlani ) sono finiti .
Il 15 aprile del '93 Silvio Berlusconi convoca i vertici del gruppo ad Arcore e parla dei gravi rischi che il gruppo Fininvest corre nel dopo Tangentopoli , venuti a mancare gli amici di sempre nel Palazzo .
" C'é il fondato pericolo " , dice , " che si crei una situazione ostile ai nostri interessi .
Bisogna prepararsi a scendere sul terreno politico " .
Il Caf era stato il suo referente politico per anni : lo aveva ammesso pubblicamente lo stesso Confalonieri , in un'intervista a L'europeo del 25 agosto 1989 ( " Il tg di Canale 5 sarà omogeneo al mondo che vede nei Craxi , nei Forlani e negli Andreotti l'accettazione delle libertà » ) .
Il 14 maggio 1993 in via Fauro a Roma Cosa Nostra piazza quasi un quintale di tritolo per far saltare Maurizio Costanzo .
Si salva per un soffio , grazie un allineamento fortuito che crea un cono d'ombra sulla sua auto .
Costanzo nei suoi show aveva ospitato spesso
Falcone e , dopo la morte di questi , aveva fatto delle puntate molto dure contro la mafia .
Forse volevano punirlo solo per quello .
Alcuni tuttavia ipotizzano che la mafia volesse anche dare un messaggio a Berlusconi .
Un messaggio del tipo : vedi di fare il bravo .
Ma questa è solo un'ipotesi .
Il 27 maggio 1993 viene fatta esplodere una Fiat Fiorino imbottita di esplosivo a Firenze , vicino alla sede dell ' Accademia dei Georgofili ( 5 morti ) .
Un messaggio della mafia allo Stato , in un momento in cui lo Stato stesso è in confusione : caduto il governo Amato , si chiama da Bankitalia il tecnico Ciampi , mentre Craxi viene assalito con le monetine fuori dall ' hotel Raphael di Roma .
Il 25 maggio Andreotti viene indagato anche per l'omicidio Pecorelli .
Nell 'estate del 93 , come emergerà in seguito , Berlusconi inizia a preparare la discesa in campo .
A giugno Fininvest inizia l'opera di acquisto a tempo indeterminato , in tutte le agenzie fotografiche , di tutte le immagini circolanti di Silvio Berlusconi in cui il Cavaliere non era venuto bene .
Sempre a giugno , Berlusconi incarica un dirigente del suo marketing - Gianni Pilo - di fare delle proiezioni elettorali per capire se è il caso di fondare un suo partito o di appoggiare i leader nascenti , come Mario Segni ; ancora a giugno , due dirigenti del gruppo ( Domenico Lo Jucco di Publitalia e Ennio Doris di Programma Italia ) iniziano a sondare le strutture locali di Publitalia ( la concessionaria di pubblicità del gruppo ) per verificare la loro disponibilità a lavorare sul territorio in vista della creazione di un eventuale partito ( quelli che diventeranno i club di Forza Italia ) .
Il 10 luglio 93 Berlusconi dice ai suoi più stretti collaboratori che sta pensando di entrare in politica : Confalonieri è contrario , Dell ' Utri favorevole .
Subito dopo iniziano le cene di Berlusconi con gli imprenditori per la nascita di Forza Italia .
Il 23 luglio muore l'imprenditore Raul Gardini : da sempre considerata un suicidio , la morte di Gardini è adesso di nuovo al centro un'inchiesta perché secondo un pentito una società di Gardini - la Calcestruzzi - riciclava i soldi della mafia .
Il 26 luglio la Dc si scioglie .
Il 27 luglio scoppiano due nuove bombe di mafia , una a Milano e una a Roma .
La bomba a Roma viene fatta esplodere accanto alla chiesa di San Giovanni in Laterano e non fa vittime .
Quella di Milano in via Palestro fa cinque morti , probabilmente per sbaglio .
Sono dei messaggi allo Stato : lo scopo è far sapere - in un Paese il cui quadro politico è in rapido cambiamento - che la mafia può inaugurare una nuova strategia della tensione e che quindi a chi prenderà le redini dello Stato converrà trattare .
A settembre Berlusconi dice a Marcello Dell ' Utri di iniziare lavorare all ' organizzazione del nuovo partito .
Dell ' Utri parte per la creazione di Forza Italia basandosi sulle strutture locali di Publitalia e organizzando i club .
A ottobre iniziano sulle reti Fininvest due trasmissioni volute da Berlusconi sull ' attualità politica , in cui si chiede ai passanti " che cosa vuole la gente " .
Si tratta di " Luogocomune " di Davide Mengacci su Retequattro e di " Qui Itali " a di Giorgio Medail su ItaliaUno .
L'esito è sempre che la gente è stufa dei vecchi politici e vorrebbe un nuovo partito con Berlusconi leader .
Il 16 ottobre un 'auto carica di esplosivo non scoppia per puro caso fuori dallo stadio Olimpico di Roma , durante una partita .
Il 10 novembre in uno stabile di viale Isonzo a Milano iniziano i provini per il casting su 650 persone selezionate da Publitalia e candidabili con il nuovo partito che ufficialmente non esiste ancora .
Il 23 novembre Berlusconi appoggia pubblicamente Fini come candidato sindaco di Roma contro Rutelli .
Lo stesso giorno , di ritorno in aereo da Casalecchio di Reno insieme con il giornalista Andrea Pamparana , chiede a questi notizie su Antonio di Pietro nell ' eventualità di includerlo nel nuovo partito .
Il 25 novembre nasce ufficialmente Forza Italia , che vincerà le elezioni nel marzo dell ' anno successivo .
Che è Dell ' Utri , l'organizzatore di Forza Italia ?
Amico di Berlusconi dai tempi in cui entrambi studiavano Legge a Milano nella seconda metà degli anni ' 50 , con lui dagli inizi alla Edilnord e ( dopo un breve periodo al gruppo Rapisarda , legato alla mafia di Palermo ) ai vertici del gruppo del Cavaliere fino a diventare nel 1984 amministratore delegato del gruppo Fininvest .
Palermitano , è lui che negli anni ' 70 porta ad Arcore il boss mafioso Vittorio Mangano , con funzioni di stalliere .
La presenza di Mangano ad Arcore verrà giustificata come una sorta di " protezione " che Dell ' Utri avrebbe garantito alla famiglia Berlusconi spaventata da possibili sequestri di persona ; secondo altri , rappresentava invece il punto di collegamento tra Cosa Nostra e Berlusconi .
Dopo aver fondato Forza Italia , Dell ' Utri verrà eletto parlamentare e lo rimarrà ininterrottamente fino a oggi ( attualmente è senatore ) .
Nel dicembre del 2004 Dell ' Utri verrà condannato a 9 anni di carcere ( in primo grado , quindi è ancora innocente ) per concorso esterno in associazione mafioso .
Insomma , per aver fatto gli interessi della mafia .
In particolare il tribunale scriverà nella sentenza che " c'è la prova che Dell ’ Utri aveva promesso alla mafia precisi vantaggi in campo politico " .
Recentemente il pentito Nino Giuffré , già uomo di fiducia di Bernardo Provenzano , ha confermato in aula che negli anni Novanta Cosa Nostra era in rapporti con Dell ' Utri , l'uomo che secondo Provenzano ( stando alla versione Giuffrè ) garantiva il rapporto con Forza Italia e quindi con il potere politico .
Nel corso del processo a Dell ' Utri il pentito Giovanni Brusca ha ammesso di aver tenuto contatti con Dell ' Utri , mediati prima da Mangano e poi da altri , durante tutto il '93 .
Detto tutto ciò , cosa si può ragionevolmente stabilire ?
Primo : che dall ' inizio del 1992 la mafia di Riina ha perso i tradizionali punti di riferimento nei rapporti con lo Stato .
Secondo : che nel 1992 Cosa Nostra ha messo una bomba per uccidere Falcone , artefice della maxicondanna al processo .
Terzo : che nei due mesi tra la morte di Falcone e quella di Borsellino c'è stato almeno un inizio di trattativa tra la mafia e settori dello Stato .
Quarto : che Borsellino si è opposto a questa trattativa e forse è stato ammazzato anche per questo , secondo alcuni con la complicità di qualcuno esterno alla mafia .
Quinto : che con l'introduzione del 41 bis nell ' agosto del 92 la mafia ha subito un altro duro colpo e ha visto fallire la strategia di Riina .
Sesto : che all ' inizio del ' 93 Riina è stato arrestato e a comandare la mafia è rimasto Provenzano .
Settimo : che dopo questo cambio , nell 'estate del ' 93 e fino a ottobre , la mafia ha messo bombe a Firenze , Milano e Roma per provare a costringere lo Stato a stabilire un nuovo rapporto .
Ottavo : che tutto questo accadeva mentre la stabilità della politica veniva terremotata , prima per il crollo della lira e poi a seguito di Tangentopoli .
Nono : che in questa confusione e in questo vuoto dello Stato Berlusconi ha iniziato a ipotizzare di scendere in politica già nel giugno del ' 92 e ha iniziato a render concreto questo progetto nel maggio del ' 93 .
Decimo : che il progetto è stato operativamente affidato a Marcello Dell ' Utri , che 21 anni dopo verrà condannato ( in primo grado ) per mafia e in particolare per i suoi rapporti con Provenzano .
Tutto questo per arrivare tendenziosamente a dire che Berlusconi era in rapporti con la mafia ?
No , tutto questo è un insieme di fatti , che poi ciascuno può interpretare nella logica e nei nessi che crede , facendosene un'opinione politica prima ancora che giudiziaria .
Gli eventuali rapporti di Berlusconi con la mafia necessiterebbero di approfondimenti molto maggiori , a partire dai finanziamenti avuti a 27 anni da Silvio Berlusconi per la fondazione di Edilnord dalla Banca Rasini , i cui principali proprietari erano gli Azzaretto di Misilmeri ( potenti amici di Andreotti in Sicilia ) , che aveva tra i suoi clienti Calò , Riina e Provenzano e collegata a società offshore di Calvi e Gelli .
Ma questa è un'altra storia .
The ALFA SSN : Challenging Paradigms , Finding New Truths , 1969 –79
Gerhardt Thamm
This article originally appeared in a classified Studies in Intelligence , Vol. 37 No. 3 ( Fall 1993 ) .
The author received a Studies in Intelligence Annual Award for it in 1994 .
The article was declassified with slight redactions in 2007 .
We knew that the Soviets did not follow our practice in building submarines ; they did not incorporate edge - of - technology items in series - production models .
Better is the enemy of good enough .
This Russian proverb incorporates a philosophy that is both wise and true to the Russian heart .
Those who have learned to appreciate the Russian character will agree that most Russians instinctively adhere to and follow that philosophy .
To build , to create things good enough to do what they are meant to do is wise ; to make them better than necessary is a waste of energy and precious resources .
The proverb reportedly was inscribed on a plaque in the office of Deputy Minister of Defense and Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Sergei Gorshkov , who had guided the development of his navy since 1956 .
Those of us who watched the building of the Soviet Navy from its humble beginnings as a coastal defense force after World War II to a powerful bluewater navy noticed long ago that the old proverb was true , even when it came to building submarines .
We knew that the Soviets did not follow our practice in building submarines ; they did not incorporate edge - of - technology items in series - production models .
And we saw Soviets building double - hull submarines long after we had discovered that the modern single - hull design had many advantages over the double hull , among them an improved speed / horsepower ratio .
While the US Navy leaped decades ahead in submarine design , the Soviets plodded along by improving tried technologies .
Our submarines not only looked better , they were better .
Yet the Soviets seemed satisfied with evolutionary advances in submarine design .
Many US intelligence analysts were sure that the Soviets were never going to “ put all their eggs into one basket . ”
Soviet society punishes failure ; designing high - risk submarines does not enhance one 's career .
[ Top of page ]
It took infinite patience to fit this miscellany into the ALFA assessment .
Although it was a difficult challenge , it was a task in which most intelligence analysts excel .
Phase One
This was the consensus of Western intelligence analysts , at least until one pleasant day in 1969 when strollers walking along the Neva River saw a modern - looking , small submarine tied up at the fitting - out quay at Leningrad ’s old Sudomekh Submarine Shipyard .
It looked as if the submarine had just been launched from the old diesel submarine assembly shed .
The assembly shed had seen little activity since the last Foxtrot - class diesel attack submarine had been launched there several years earlier .
Naval analysts , following tradition and basing their analysis on previous launch histories , initially classified the submarine as a modern diesel - electric follow - on to a Foxtrot .
Further fitting - out activity , however , soon convinced at least one senior submarine analyst , Herb Lord , that this submarine was an SSN , a nuclear - powered attack submarine .
It had a superbly streamlined hull and an overall length of about 79 meters .
[ 1 ]
Engineering calculations gave it a surfaced displacement of some 2,600 tons , [ 2 ] with a submerged displacement of about 3,700 tons .
[ 3 ]
Aside from the exceptionally streamlined hull form , this submarine had several other highly unusual features :
In 1969 , it was the world 's smallest SSN .
It had , a rather high reserve buoyancy — a safety factor — of nearly 30 percent , in contrast to 8 to 11 percent for US SSNs .
The submarine received the NATO classification ALFA Class SSN .
Lord , an experienced photointerpreter , alerted others to concentrate their efforts on the ALFA ’s construction and fitting - out pattern .
The analysts noticed something they had never seen be - fore , a “ highly reflective ” pressure hull section near the ALFA assembly area .
Lord then requested that he be point of contact for all reports that mentioned “ highly reflective ” or unusually colored submarine parts .
During some eight years of examining photos of Soviet submarine construction yards , analysts assembled a construction history of a magnitude never before accomplished .
Periodically , and with ever increasing frequency , Lord received reports of “ highly reflective ” pressure hull sections associated with the ALFA fitting out at Sudomekh .
Later , he also received reports of highly reflective pieces of hull sections , similar to those of the Sudomekh ALFA , at the Severodvinsk Submarine Construction Yard , far to the north of Leningrad . [ 4 ]
He noted that these two yards were connected by an inland waterway , and he wondered whether both yards could be building this rather unusual class of attack submarine .
Lord subsequently conducted what is generally known as “ look - back ” analysis .
All reports of “ highly reflective ” submarine hull sections at the two construction sites were collated , reviewed , and once again evaluated .
It was a formidable , time consuming task .
There were reports of changes to the external appearance of the assembly halls ; reports dealing with unusual submarine parts at storage sites near the halls ; and reports on unusual railroad cars , tank cars , and increased production of titanium sponge .
All were scrutinized .
It took infinite patience to fit this miscellany into the ALFA submarine assessment .
Although it was a most difficult challenge , it was a task in which most intelligence analysts excel .
After reviewing all the evidence and after long discussions with his fellow intelligence analysts , and with naval designers , engineers , and others in the Intelligence Community , Lord became even more convinced that the Soviets were indeed building a “ special ” type of super submarine , the first made of titanium alloy .
Eventually , he concluded that he had to convince the US Navy that the Soviets were series - producing a highly modern , unusual SSN that , if fitted with advanced weapons , could seriously threaten US and allied naval operations .
Some analysts at CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) agreed .
In fact .
CIA had , as early as 1971 , published analysis — Use of Titanium by the Soviet Shipbuilding Industry — that strongly supported the assessment that the otherwise conservative Soviets had conducted serious , long - time research on shaping and welding heavy titanium plates , and that they had in fact developed that capability .
Lord tired to prove that the Soviets had moved from their usual submarine building methods , and that they had combined several advanced technologies in a single class of submarine .
Others were skeptical .
They thought that the shaping and welding of heavy titanium hull sections , especially in the generally “ dirty ” shipyard atmosphere , was impractical , if not impossible .
This , too , was a totally reasonable assessment , because titanium cannot be welded when exposed to air ; welds have to be shielded , usually by argon gas .
The consensus was that the Soviets could weld small parts of titanium , such as those for aircraft or missiles , in hermetically sealed chambers , but that it was impossible to weld huge submarine pressure hull sections .
Lord , however , could not be deterred .
For nine years , he would be in the center of the battle over the “ titanium submarine . ”
During the early 1960s , little reliable , high - level scientific and technical information was available , and Lord had to rely heavily on photographic intelligence .
Lord remained certain that the collective evidence overwhelmingly supported his assessment of ALFA ’s titanium alloy pressure hull .
He tried to convince the US Navy that the Soviets ” research and development had advanced to such a degree that they were able to build submarines made of light - weight titanium alloy , and that their SSN would be able to dive deeper than any of our SSNs .
In addition , a nonmagnetic titanium submarine would be most difficult to detect .
He tried to prove that the Soviets had moved from their usual submarine building methods , and that they had combined several advanced technologies in a single class of submarine :
A highly advanced , and possibly risky , pressure hull material ( titanium alloy ) .
An as - yet unknown , high - density nuclear power plant ( high power concentration in a small hull ) .
Possible automation to reduce the size of the crew .
It was an entirely unbelievable story .
The assessment was critical for US ship , submarine , and underwater sensor and weapon designers .
After almost eight years of debate with Navy decisionmakers , Lord retired .
He died a few years later , his enormous research effort never properly recognized by Naval Intelligence .
[ Top of page ]
Phase Two
In a functional reorganization in Naval Intelligence the analysis of foreign submarines was divided into ballistic and cruise missile submarines , and attack diesel and nuclear attack submarines .
The attack submarines were my responsibility , and in 1978 I became the ALFA Project Officer .
I agreed completely with Lord ’s analysis .
Now it became my mission to convince the US Navy that the Soviets were building high - threat submarines using advanced construction technology .
Also in 1978 , CIA sponsored a meeting of intelligence analysts , naval engineers , metallurgists , and submarine designers to discuss the “ enigma ” in Soviet submarine construction .
The US submarine community could not accept any possibility that the Soviets could series - produce such a sophisticated submarine .
The great majority agreed that the “ highly reflective ” parts were submarine components .
Most were certain that the components were not of conventional submarine steel .
One expert presented several dozen formulae collected from published matter freely available to any serious researcher .
He believed these open sources proved conclusively that titanium alloys dissolve in sea water .
There were a few who suggested the whole “ Sudomekh show ” could have been a large - scale “ disinformation ” program , and that the highly reflective components were just parts covered with aluminum paint .
Many leading metallurgists still believed it probably was impossible for the Soviets to have developed the capability to bend , shape , and weld thick titanium plates in a shipyard environment .
The US submarine community , “ the Rickover people , ” was happy with this assessment .
It could not accept any possibility that the Soviets could series - produce such a sophisticated submarine .
These expert opinions made the ALFA submarine assessment inconclusive .
On the one hand , I had the expert naysayers ; on the other , I had some admirals asking , “ What the hell are the Russians doing ? ”
Lord had rejected aluminum , stainless steel , and glass fibers .
There remained the HY80 , HY 100 , or possibly HY130 steels , and titanium .
Except for stainless steel — steel turns a dark , almost black color when exposed to the elements for extended periods .
I still agreed with Lord ’s analysis that a titanium alloy was the most logical material suitable for submarine pressure hulls .
As analysis continued , I perceived five essential problem areas , which I called “ enigmas . ”
These made life difficult because they challenged traditional beliefs about the very nature of Soviet submarine construction .
First Enigma :
An apparent change in Soviet design and construction methodology .
Advantage : Long - range gain .
Disadvantage : Large investment of resources .
Remarks :
If successful , Soviet submarine designers and builders were making a quantum leap into modern technology .
Second Enigma :
Use of titanium alloy in pressure hull construction .
Advantage : Titanium is stronger and weighs 33 percent less than steel ; the pressure hull can be stronger without increasing displacement ; its use gives a submarine a stronger hull for greater diving depth and increases resistance to explosives at lesser depths ; and the submarine is essentially nonmagnetic , thus decreasing the likelihood of magnetic anomaly detection ( MAD ) .
Disadvantage : Titanium is three to five times more expensive than steel ; it needs a totally different manufacturing process ; shipyard workers must be retrained ; construction halls must be reconfigured ; and bending and shaping of heavy plates of titanium alloy are far more difficult compared to steel .
Remarks :
Much evidence had been gathered that the Soviet Navy had ample research and development funds and that Soviet metallurgists had made remarkable advances in titanium manufacturing technology .
Reports indicated that the Soviet Navy had conducted research in HY 100 steel , aluminum , glass fiber , and titanium alloys for use in ship and submarine construction .
Third Enigma : Apparent use of liquid metal reactor coolants .
Advantage : Better horsepower to weight / volume ratio for higher speed .
Disadvantage : The US Navy believed that a reactor cooled by liquid metal is less safe than the pressurized water reactor ( PWR ) in use by the US Navy .
Remarks :
The US Navy ’s safety record supported the PWR approach .
Fourth Enigma : Seemingly large - scale use of automation and reduction of crew size .
Advantage : Reduced the size of the boat and the size of its crew ; lessened demand for electric power requirements ; and relieved crew from mundane tasks , thus eliminating human errors caused by fatigue and boredom .
Disadvantage : The US Navy believed automated controls to be less safe than hands - on control functions .
Remarks :
Only by automating many control functions could the Soviets reduce the size of the submarine .
This increased the ALFA ’s survivability in combat , because it became a smaller active - sonar target .
Furthermore , the low magnetic signature from a nonmagnetic titanium hull made localization of target by MAD difficult .
Having unmanned engineering spaces also reduced personnel casualties should the liquid metal reactor malfunction .
Fifth Enigma : Large rescue sphere in ALFA sail indicative of strong concern for crew survivability .
Advantage : Provides safe exit for entire crew from maximum depth without external assistance .
When the sphere is on the surface , it becomes a lifeboat ; it protects the crew from the elements ; and it has sufficient communications , emergency rations , and first aid on board .
Disadvantage : Increases weight of the submarine .
Remarks :
The ALFA ’s high reserve buoyancy , as well as a sophisticated rescue system , implied Soviet Navy concern for crew survivability .
There were other indicators : the Soviet Navy had one India class submarine rescue submarine each in Northern and Pacific fleet areas , had several “ hard ” compartments in submarines , and now had fitted a sophisticated survival system in the ALFA .
This was another item that did not square with our view that the Soviets had little concern for human life .
[ Top of page ]
I believed that different collection assets had to be activated to convince the US Navy of a serious threat to our submarines .
Turning to HUMINT
Since Lord ’s ALFA SSN approach had failed , I believed that different collection assets had to be activated to convince the US Navy of a serious threat to our submarines .
Under the guidance of an able Navy captain , I used my extensive experience as a HUMINT collector to tap these new assets .
With continuing support from CIA analysts , as well as the Agency 's collection managers and collectors , several thousand reports were screened for information about titanium .
To keep that collection current , photointerpreters spent considerable time briefing their assets in the technique of precision photography .
For three years , I followed the unfolding of this dramatic change in Soviet submarine construction .
A fair number of HUMINT reports dating from the time ALFA was under construction alluded to a new submarine with a small crew .
Some reports cited a crew of 15 , and others indicated a crew of 18 to 45 .
Admiral Rickover ’s team believed that it was impossible to operate a nuclear submarine with such a small crew , and that it was irresponsible to automate the many vital control functions of a submarine .
As a result , this information was temporarily shelved .
But the subjects of small crew and automation would not die , partly because some Western navies had already automated their submarines with considerable success .
With strong support from the CIA , I collected and assembled information that supported Lord ’s original assessment of ALFA ’s small crew .
Periodically , CIA reported that the Soviets maintained a high interest in automating submarine maneuvering , propulsion power train , weapons loading , and fire control functions .
The goal : small crew , small boat .
Eventually , the evidence that ALFA was extensively automated convinced even the most skeptical .
[ Top of page ]
A Key Report
Evidence continued to confirm Soviet concern with crew survivability .
By pure luck , in 1981 someone walking along the Neva River saw a sphere being lowered into the area where an ALFA was being fitted out .
Based on the description , analysts determined that the sphere was lowered into the ALFA sail .
The source was able to estimate the diameter of the sphere .
With that information , and based on my familiarity with West German submarines , I concluded that the Soviets had copied a submarine crew rescue sphere designed by Dr. Ulrich Gabler , the distinguished West German submarine designer .
By extrapolation , our submarine structures engineer calculated that 37 to 39 husky Russians would just fit into the rescue sphere .
Careful examination of the sail revealed a continuous breakaway seam in the rubber antisonar coating of the ALFA sail .
The assessment : the sphere , using part of the sail as a stabilizer and buoyancy tank , could be released to rise to the surface as a lifeboat .
This report contributed significantly to solving the enigmas of crew size , automation , and crew survivability .
[ Top of page ]
Accumulating Evidence
CIA also provided me with increasing evidence that appeared to confirm that :
The Soviets had diverged from their pragmatic submarine construction modus operandi by combining at least three edge - of - technology items into a production - model submarine .
Large , heavy , titanium alloy plates were shaped and welded at the Sudomekh and Severodvinsk shipyards .
Almost all reports alluded to the many difficulties encountered when welding titanium .
Liquid metal coolant was used to increase the horsepower over weight / volume ratio and thus to increase speed .
In addition .
CIA reported that the first ALFA had suffered a catastrophic failure during sea trials in the Barents Sea , when the liquid metal coolant spilled from the reactor containment vessel into the bilge .
Indeed , as later reported in Jane ’s Defence Weekly , the “ first ALFA suffered a reaction meltdown in 1970 . ” [ 5 ]
The submarine was towed to an isolated corner in Severodvinsk shipyard .
Eventually , the bow and amidships sections appeared once again at Sudomekh .
The pieces were left in open view on the quay for many years .
Nevertheless , the ALFA prototype ’s trial run , even with its disastrous aftermath , must have produced some encouraging results because series construction continued .
[ Top of page ]
Renewed Production
In mid-1974 , one ALFA was launched from Sudomekh , and in early 1976 one was launched from Severodvinsk .
The class was back in series production , and intelligence collection again went into high gear .
After more than a year of collection , the results were assembled and examined .
The reports confirmed the previous assessments that the Soviets had encountered seemingly insurmountable problems when welding titanium .
The first boat of the class had been on the ways for about seven or eight years , instead of the normal one to two years .
Fitting - out periods were also much longer than those of other SSNs .
The old and new supporting evidence was presented to another panel of [ outside ] experts convened by CIA to assess whether the Soviets could weld heavy plates of titanium alloy in a shipyard atmosphere .
Again , most of the experts opined that the Soviets most likely could not series - produce titanium pressure hulls for SSNs .
But this time , Naval Intelligence , with support from CIA analysts , disagreed with the experts .
The mutually supportive evidence from all assets had convinced the technical director of the Naval Intelligence Support Center that the Soviets had made a quantum leap in submarine technology by combining several high - risk options in one class of submarine .
Consequently , it was critical for US Navy decisionmakers to learn that :
The Soviets were building submarines with hulls made of lightweight , nonmagnetic titanium .
The most streamlined hull shape ever produced by the Soviets was designed for speeds over 40 knots . [ 6 ]
These high - technology submarines could dive below the effective range of US antisubmarine weapons .
These units , probably fitted with advanced weapons , posed a serious threat to US and allied naval forces .
The Director of Naval Intelligence , confident that his analysts had made the correct assessment in the face of aggressive opposition , invited me to present the assessment to the Vice Chief of Naval Operations .
The evidence convinced him , and he decided that the information had to be disseminated to the Navy as soon as possible .
Naval Intelligence published the ALFA assessment in record time .

Postscript
In March 1979 , technical assets detected the second ALFA making trial runs in the Barents Sea .
An analysis of the data indicated that the ALFA had exceeded 40 knots while submerged in moderately deep water .
In 1978 , [ 7 ] after two decades of effort , the ALFA class had reached initial operational capability and was in series production .
( In 1985 , the Soviets had at least six operational ALFAs . )
On 19 January 1979 , the commander of the US Naval Sea Systems Command wrote Naval Intelligence that CIA ’S extraordinary collection and Naval Intelligence ’s timely analysis of the ALFA Class SSN threat had saved the Navy $ 325 million in new torpedo designs .
It was the first time in history that this type of intelligence collection and analysis had ever been officially credited with saving such a large sum of money .
Tenacity Pays Off
The R&D and manufacturing efforts for the ALFA SSN are difficult to estimate .
Two construction sites were tied up for excessively long times with this project .
The first sea trials far exceeded Moscow ’s expectations .
Then , even with a catastrophic failure in the engineering spaces , the Soviets continued the ALFA project with tenacity unmatched by Western navies .
There is little doubt that the Soviets have incorporated these technological gains in follow - on nuclear powered submarines .
After all , the Soviet R&D community , submarine designers , and builders had , at almost prohibitive cost , accomplished what their Western counterparts thought impossible : the production of a titanium submarine that surpassed all others in speed and diving depth .
There was at least one commonalty between the Soviet ALFA construction program and the US Navy ’s intelligence effort against the submarine : in tenacity the Soviet Navy had been matched by that of one senior US Naval Intelligence analyst , Herb Lord .
We had learned once again that nothing can be taken for granted .
Most important , we learned that the Soviet Navy did not always follow old Russian proverbs .
We also learned that US intelligence was “ right on the money , ” and that the Soviets had indeed built a submarine that was “ better than good enough . ”

Greenpeace präsentiert Studie : Steuermilliarden für die Atomkraft
Auf 258 Milliarden Euro beziffert eine Studie im Auftrag von Greenpeace die reale Höhe der staatlichen Atomsubventionen .
Gabriel fordert als Konsequenz eine Steuer auf Kernbrennstoffe .
Die bisher feststehenden Kosten der Förderung von Atomenergie in Deutschland belaufen sich auf 258 Milliarden Euro .
Zu diesem Ergebnis kommt eine Studie des Forums Ökologisch - Soziale Marktwirtschaft , die von der Umweltorganisation Greenpeace in Auftrag gegeben wurde , um die realen Kosten der Atomkraft offenzulegen .
Die Bundesregierung habe die Höhe der Subventionen hingegen nur auf 200 Millionen Euro beziffert .
Die in der Studie ermittelte Gesamtsumme umfasst die realen Fördermittel von 165 Milliarden Euro bis 2008 , die sich wiederum aus direkten Finanzhilfen des Bundes wie Forschungsförderung , Kosten für den Betrieb der Endlager Asse II und Morsleben oder die Stilllegung der ostdeutschen Atommeiler zusammensetzen .
Hinzu kommen bereits heute bekannte zukünftige Kosten von mindestens 92,5 Milliarden Euro .
Doch auch hierbei sei noch nicht das ganze Bild erfasst , sagte Sebastian Schmidt vom Forum Ökologisch - Soziale Marktwirtschaft .
Die reale Summe dürfte sehr viel höher liegen , da in diesem Betrag die externalisierten Kosten noch nicht eingerechnet seien .
Dazu gehören etwa Aufwendungen für Krankheiten der in unmittelbarer Nähe eines Atomkraftwerks lebenden Menschen , die Degradierung der Umwelt oder die fehlende Haftung im Falle eines Atom - GAUs .
Die exakte Bestimmung dieser Kosten ist jedoch schwierig .
Mit der Studie liege erstmals eine umfassende Bilanzierung der staatlichen Atomsubventionen vor , erklärte Andree Böhling , Energie - Experte bei Greenpeace .
Die erhebliche Differenz zu den Angaben in den Subventionsberichten des Finanzministeriums erklärte er mit dem äußerst eng gefassten Subventionsbegriff der Regierung , in dem diverse Posten wie spezielle Steuervergünstigungen nicht berücksichtigt würden .
Das Deutsche Atomforum wies hingegen den Subventionsbegriff von Greenpeace als " haarsträubend " zurück .
Ausgaben wie die Sanierung des Uranbergbaus in Sachsen und Thüringen oder Fusionsforschung dürften nicht einberechnet werden .
Bundesumweltminister Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) begrüßte das Greenpeace - Gutachten und forderte Konsequenzen .
" Es kann nicht sein , dass die Gewinne aus der Atomenergie privatisiert und die Kosten für Schäden sozialisiert werden . "
Um die Atomwirtschaft an den Kosten zu beteiligen , sei eine Steuer auf Kernbrennstoffe notwendig .
Greenpeace forderte die Bundesregierung zu größerer Transparenz bei der Offenlegung der in die Atombranche geflossenen Subventionen auf .
In Zukunft sollen Fördermittel zudem nur noch der Nutzung erneuerbarer Energien und effizienterer Brennstoffe zugutekommen .
Eine Konsequenz aus den massiven Subventionen für Atomenergie ist laut Böhling schließlich die Behinderung eines Ausbaus erneuerbarer Energien .
Bislang beanspruchten deren Nutzung und Forschung zwar auch Fördergelder , doch könnten diese jährlich abnehmen und zeitlich begrenzt werden .
Die Studie soll die
These widerlegen , dass Atomkraft entgegen der Meinung ihrer Befürworter den billigsten Weg zur Stromerzeugung darstelle .
Die großen Gewinner seien im Endeffekt nur die Energiekonzerne Eon , RWE , Vattenfall und EnBW , die seit 2002 Gewinne von 100 Milliarden Euro eingefahren hätten - auf Kosten der Allgemeinheit .
" Die Stromkonzerne kassieren bei den Bürgern gleich zweimal ab " , sagte Böhling .
" Als Stromverbraucher und als Steuerzahler . "

Site Archive : Commentaries On Pseudo - Skepticism
A Commentary by Marcello Truzzi *
Over the years , I have decried the misuse of the term " skeptic " when used to refer to all critics of anomaly claims .
Alas , the label has been thus misapplied by both proponents and critics of the paranormal .
Sometimes users of the term have distinguished between so - called " soft " versus " hard " skeptics , and I in part revived the term " zetetic " because of the term 's misuse .
But I now think the problems created go beyond mere terminology and matters need to be set right .
Since " skepticism " properly refers to doubt rather than denial -- nonbelief rather than belief -- critics who take the negative rather than an agnostic position but still call themselves " skeptics " are actually pseudo - skeptics and have , I believed , gained a false advantage by usurping that label .
In science , the burden of proof falls upon the claimant ; and the more extraordinary a claim , the heavier is the burden of proof demanded .
The true skeptic takes an agnostic position , one that says the claim is not proved rather than disproved .
He asserts that the claimant has not borne the burden of proof and that science must continue to build its cognitive map of reality without incorporating the extraordinary claim as a new " fact . "
Since the true skeptic does not assert a claim , he has no burden to prove anything .
He just goes on using the established theories of " conventional science " as usual .
But if a critic asserts that there is evidence for disproof , that he has a negative hypothesis -- saying , for instance , that a seeming psi result was actually due to an artifact -- he is making a claim and therefore also has to bear a burden of proof .
Sometimes , such negative claims by critics are also quite extraordinary -- for example , that a UFO was actually a giant plasma , or that someone in a psi experiment was cued via an abnormal ability to hear a high pitch others with normal ears would fail to notice .
In such cases the negative claimant also may have to bear a heavier burden of proof than might normally be expected .
Critics who assert negative claims , but who mistakenly call themselves " skeptics , " often act as though they have no burden of proof placed on them at all , though such a stance would be appropriate only for the agnostic or true skeptic .
A result of this is that many critics seem to feel it is only necessary to present a case for their counter - claims based upon plausibility rather than empirical evidence .
Thus , if a subject in a psi experiment can be shown to have had an opportunity to cheat , many critics seem to assume not merely that he probably did cheat , but that he must have , regardless of what may be the complete absence of evidence that he did so cheat and sometimes even ignoring evidence of the subject 's past reputation for honesty .
Similarly , improper randomization procedures are sometimes assumed to be the cause of a subject 's high psi scores even though all that has been established is the possibility of such an artifact having been the real cause .
Of course , the evidential weight of the experiment is greatly reduced when we discover an opening in the design that would allow an artifact to confound the results .
Discovering an opportunity for error should make such experiments less evidential and usually unconvincing .
It usually disproves the claim that the experiment was " air tight " against error , but it does not disprove the anomaly claim .
Showing evidence is unconvincing is not grounds for completely dismissing it .
If a critic asserts that the result was due to artifact X , that critic then has the burden of proof to demonstrate that artifact X can and probably did produce such results under such circumstances .
Admittedly , in some cases the appeal to mere plausibility that an artifact produced the result may be so great that nearly all would accept the argument ; for example , when we learn that someone known to have cheated in the past had an opportunity to cheat in this instance , we might reasonably conclude he probably cheated this time , too .
But in far too many instances , the critic who makes a merely plausible argument for an artifact closes the door on future research when proper science demands that his hypothesis of an artifact should also be tested .
Alas , most critics seem happy to sit in their armchairs producing post hoc counter - explanations .
Whichever side ends up with the true story , science best progresses through laboratory investigations .
On the other hand , proponents of an anomaly claim who recognize the above fallacy may go too far in the other direction .
Some argue , like Lombroso when he defended the mediumship of Palladino , that the presence of wigs does not deny the existence of real hair .
All of us must remember science can tell us what is empirically unlikely but not what is empirically impossible .
Evidence in science is always a matter of degree and is seldom if ever absolutely conclusive .
Some proponents of anomaly claims , like some critics , seen unwilling to consider evidence in probabilistic terms , clinging to any slim loose end as though the critic must disprove all evidence ever put forward for a particular claim .
Both critics and proponents need to learn to think of adjudication in science as more like that found in the law courts , imperfect and with varying degrees of proof and evidence .
Absolute truth , like absolute justice , is seldom obtainable .
We can only do our best to approximate them .

I generally have some pity for women with implants as they 've succumbed to societal pressures put on women to hate their bodies .
I mean going through major surgery and then facing the very likely negative side effects and future corrective surgeries that will ensue ... it 's nuts .
But then you see them making fun of women with real breasts ( usually calling them saggy and / or flat ) and my sympathy leaves me .
Personally , I think SOFT breasts are pretty .
Rock hard implants , not so much .
( And whenever I discuss this subject I am absolutely not directing my comments at any women with implants for reconstruction after masectomy or other injury . )
Former Congressman and C Street resident Chip Pickering 's estranged wife has filed a lawsuit against Pickering 's alleged mistress .
Leisha Pickering is suing Elizabeth Creekmore - Byrd for alienation of affection .
Rep . Pickering , a Republican from Mississippi , allegedly continued seeing his college sweetheart while they were both married .
According to the suit , some of the " wrongful conduct " occurred at the C Street facility for Christian congressmen -- the same one where Sen. John Ensign ( R - NV ) and Sen. Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) have lived , and where Gov. Mark Sanford ( R - SC ) has recently sought counseling .
A 65 - year - old man rallying in favor of healthcare reform was knocked to the ground by a man who disagreed with the call for a government - run health plan outside of a Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce meeting headlined by Sen. Bill Nelson .
Luis Perrero of Coral Gables was standing among about 40 Democratic activists and union workers when a man in a Ford pick - up truck pulled up to the rally at Jungle Island and began arguing with the crowd .
The man , who only gave his first name as Raul , said Perrero called him a Spanish curse word .
He punched Perrero in the face .
Perrero fell to the ground and lay motionless for a few minutes .
" I 'm amazed the way this has become such a politicized issue , '' Perrero said , while still sitting on the ground but sitting up .
" It shows that people who are against the public option will resort to anything , including battery on a senior citizen to prevent healthcare reform . ''
Wilhelmina Ford , another healthcare reform proponent at the rally , said , " It was totally uncalled for .
The guy may have had words with him but he did n't have to hit him in the face . ''
Fire rescue responded to the scene , where a Herald reporter was present .

Dracula vs. Cujo
One dark and stormy evening , Spanish neurologist Juan Gomez - Alonso was watching a vampire movie when he realized something strange ; he noticed that vampires behave an awful lot like people with rabies .
The virus attacks the central nervous system , altering the moods and behaviors of those infected .
Sufferers become agitated and demented , and , much like vampires , their moods can turn violent .
Rabies has several more vampire - like symptoms .
It can cause insomnia , which explains the nocturnal portion of the legend .
People with rabies also suffer from muscular spasms , which can lead them to spit up blood .
What ’s stunning is the fact that these spasms are triggered by bright lights , water , mirrors , and strong smells , such as the scent of garlic .
( Sound Familiar ? )
After watching the Dracula movies a few more times , Dr. Gomez Alonso felt compelled to continue studying vampire folklore and the medical history of rabies .
Eventually , he discovered an even more profound connection between the two phenomena : Vampires stories became prominent in Europe at exactly the same time certain areas were experiencing rabies outbreaks .
This was particularly true in Hungary between 1721 and 1728 , when an epidemic plagued dogs , wolves , and humans and left the country in ruins .
Gomez - Alonso theorized that rabies actually inspired the vampire legend , and his research was published by the distinguished medical journal Neurology in 1998 .
The Madness Of King George Dr. Gomez - Alonso was n’t the first scientist who tried to pin vampirism to a real illness .
In 1985 , Canadian biochemist David Dolphin proposed a link between vampires and porphyria - a rare , chronic blood disorder characterized by the irregular production of heme , an iron - rich pigment found in blood .
The disorder can cause seizures , trances , and hallucinations that last for days or weeks .
As a result , people with porphyria often go insane .
( Britain ’s Kin George III , the one who inspired our founding fathers to start their own country , is thought to have suffered from it . )
Porphyria sufferers also experience extreme sensitivity to light , suffering blisters and burns when their skin is exposed to the sun .
Another symptom of porphyria is an intolerance to sulfur in foods .
Which food contains a lot of sulfur ?
That ’s right , garlic .
Teenage Werewolf
In addition to explaining away vampires , medicine also has some answers for werewolves and zombies .
In The Werewolf Delusion ( 1979 ) , Ian Woodward explains that rabies may have also inspired the werewolf myth .
Rabies is transmitted through biting , and the dementia and aggression of late - stage rabies can make people behave like wild animals .
Now , imagine that you are living in a village in medieval Europe and you see your friend get bitten by a wolf .
A few weeks later , he starts foaming at the mouth , howling at the moon , and biting other villagers .
Suddenly that story your grandmother told you about the Wolfman sounds like a decent explanation for what ’s going on .
Dawn Of The Dead , Revisited
From : Night of the Living Dead by George A. Romero Zombies may also be creatures of science , at least according to Costas J. Efthimiou , a physicist at the University of Central Florida .
In 2006 , he attempted to explain the mysterious case of Wilfred Doricent , a teenager who died and was buried in Haiti , only to reappear in his village more than a year later , looking and behaving like a zombie .
Efthimiou concluded that Wilfred was not the victim of a curse , but of poisoning .
In the waters of Haiti , there is a species of puffer fish whose liver can be made into a powder , which has the ability to make a person appear dead without actually killing him .
Wilfred may have been poisoned with the powder and then buried alive .
According to one of Dr. Efthimiou ’s theories , once underground , Wilfred suffered from oxygen deprivation that damaged his brain .
When the poison wore off and Wilfred woke up , he clawed his way out of the grave .
( Graves tend to be shallow in Haiti . )
Brain - damaged , he wandered the countryside for months until he ended up back in his village .
After Dr. Efthimiou published his explanation of the case , Dr. Roger Mallory , a neurologist at the Haitian Medical Society did an MRI scan of Wilfred ’s brain .
Although the results were inconclusive , he found that Wilfred ’s brain was damaged in a way that was consistent with oxygen deprivation .
It would seem that zombification is nothing more than skillful poisoning .

OTTAWA —
The giant lineups and frustration that dominated the first week of the biggest immunization program in history is expected to get worse next week , as health officials concede that public demand is exceeding the number of doses and the staff available to administer the vaccine .
Provinces reported clinic shutdowns Friday and federal officials painted a gloomy outlook for the week ahead because they have received only one - fifth the amount of vaccine that they had expected to distribute nationwide .
The manufacturer , GlaxoSmithKline , has fallen behind because it is making a special vaccine for pregnant women , Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler - Jones told a news conference .
Word of the production slowdown came as the World Health Organization reversed its earlier position and said Friday there is now no reason for pregnant women to favour the special version being made exclusively for them .
GlaxoSmithKline has switched its one production line back to making the regular vaccine , but it will take some time to ramp up to the target of producing three million doses per week .
Butler Jones said that officials learned Thursday they will have only 400,000 new doses to ship out next week and another 225,000 doses reserved for pregnant women — far short of the six million that have been distributed thus far .
Butler - Jones , who had maintained until the last few days that there would be plenty of vaccine for everyone , cautioned that the H1N1 campaign is being delivered in " real time " so there are many unprecedented challenges that were not anticipated .
" We 're producing it , testing it , distributing it , giving it to people all at the same time , " he said .
" It is something that nobody has ever actually had to deal with before in this kind of context .
It 's the largest immunization campaign in history . "
The goal , he said , is to have Canadians who want the H1N1 shot immunized by Christmas .
His appeal for patience was little comfort in many quarters , where Canadians were turned away by the hundreds as clinics ran out of time and supply on Friday and provinces scrambled to revamp their strategies .
Ontario's chief medical officer said plans to open up clinics to the general public next week have been put on hold and that the province will continue next week to administer shots only to at - risk residents — children under six , pregnant women , seniors , health workers and people with chronic conditions .
Several other provinces say they will do the same , including Nova Scotia , Quebec , and Saskatchewan .
As H1N1 clinics extend their hours or shut their doors early , complaints persisted about the distribution system , which has been confined to only a small number of large venues rather than smaller outlets such as doctors ' offices .
Lindsay Harris , standing in line in Toronto with her 10 - month - old daughter , Juliet , was not impressed by the long wait in the rain .
" The fact that they 've known about the swine flu and they 've been warning us about an outbreak for months now , and the fact that they just do n't seem to be prepared for this vaccination , is mind - boggling , " she said .
It may seem a little early to contemplate David Cameron 's memoirs but I can imagine already what form the opening chapters will take .
When he looks back at his years in opposition he will explain with justified satisfaction how he got his party off its knees and mounted a recovery .
He will also express two big regrets .
The first regret will take him back to his leadership campaign in 2005 when he pledged to take his party out of the main centre - right grouping in Brussels .
The second will bring him closer to the current pre-election frenzy and his decision to make so much of Britain 's " debt crisis " .
I do not believe that these will be fleeting asides in Cameron 's memoirs , but overwhelming themes .
In a way that is easily underestimated , what is said and done in opposition shapes the future contours of power and act as a severe constraint .
Read the retrospective thoughts of Wilson , Heath , Thatcher and , shortly , Blair .
They came to realise for good or bad that their words and deeds out of power determined what followed once they had won .
On Europe Cameron will come to recognise that he was trapped from the beginning .
His promise during the leadership campaign to pluck the Tories away from the centre - right European People 's Party ( EPP ) in Europe might have seemed logical at the time .
In opposition the easiest routes have a deceptive allure .
Cameron needed votes of several Eurosceptic MPs in the contest , or thought he did .
To his credit David Davis , Cameron 's opponent , argued that withdrawing from the EPP was a step too far .
Cameron saw a gap and went for it .

After Cameron had secured the leadership and was making " Blair - like " initiatives , he claimed there was no equivalent to Labour 's " Clause Four " , a symbol of his party 's marginalisation that he could slay dramatically .
He was wrong .
Europe is the equivalent for the Conservatives .
The party is still obsessed , even if it will not play to the gallery during the conference this week .
Cameron should have taken them on over the issue at the beginning of his leadership , but of course he could not do so .
He would have lost the battle and anyway he is , at this point , on the Eurosceptics ' side .
Already Cameron 's failure to challenge his party leads to a perverse contortion , a promise to hold a referendum on the Lisbon treaty and then public evasiveness over what would follow ratification .
For a leader who has made honesty versus dishonesty a convenient dividing line he is being dishonest because he dare not be candid with his party , or rather his party is too strong to be challenged .
He will come to deeply regret his weakness over this issue when in opposition .
He is intelligent and flexible enough to recognise , at some point , that it is in Britain 's interests to be a player in Europe when the patterns of the world are determined by a plethora of unsteady superpowers .
Seeking to be a " Blair - like " player on the international stage , he will be uneasy when Merkel and Sarkozy unite in defiance of his own outdated views .
Yet he will be able to do little about it .
Of course he would not hold the referendum after ratification , but he would seek to renegotiate some more opt-outs from the Lisbon Treaty , even though Britain already possesses more opt - outs than it needs .
I predict there will be calls for Britain to opt in to some " opt-outs " before very long , especially those relating to crime .
Still , if he wins , many of Cameron 's MPs will watch those destructive negotiations like hawks and will not be satisfied with a token gesture .
They will have every right to be hawk - like as Cameron has not discouraged their fervour , and it will be too late to change a party if power is secured .
Opposition is the only time where there is space to instigate internal reform .
Cameron 's later decision to play up the " debt crisis " will take up even more reflective melancholy space in his memoirs .
There is a tendency for British governments to panic in economic crises and make matters worse .
Denis Healey 's memoirs provide a prophetic insight into what Cameron will write in a few years ' time .
He admits that , as Chancellor , the Treasury overestimated the need for spending cuts in the mid-1970s .
Its figures were wrong .
Healey admitted that those in the cabinet who were arguing that the axe had fallen too savagely proved to be right .
Now we do not have to look back or ahead .
Most distinguished economists regard the Conservatives ' obsession with the level of debt as over the top .
Samuel Brittan was the latest ( in the Financial Times last week ) to warn that Cameron is making too much of it .
As with Europe , the chosen path must have seemed so tempting .
How does an opposition in Britain claim that this country 's recession is uniquely the consequence of its Labour government ?
Cameron chose to do so by claiming that Brown's " debt crisis " was incomparably worse than elsewhere .
The shift has worked for him beautifully in opposition , realigning his leadership with right - wing activists and newspapers .
But over time , Cameron will come to realise that his stance obliged him to cut more deeply and quickly than necessary , jeopardising reforms that cost money in the short term .
Opposition is exceptionally challenging , closer to an art than a science .
But whatever the chosen route towards power , the words that accompany it matter hugely .
In the spring of 1997 Tony Blair confided to Clare Short : " Do n't worry .
We will be more radical in government . "
Predictably New Labour was less radical , constrained by cautiously evasive commitments made in opposition .
After resigning , Blair expressed regret that he did not do more in relation to public services during the first term .
He will write about it in his memoirs .
He could have done more , but chose not to make the arguments in opposition .
Alastair Campbell revealed recently that Blair 's biggest regret was that he did not get Britain into the Euro .
But Blair was never going to get the chance to do so after he decided in opposition to offer a referendum on the issue and to declare at the same time that he " loved the pound " .
Blair 's regrets are rooted in what he said and did in opposition .
Similarly Cameron has hinted at being more radical in power .
He will be less so .
Power is more complicated and daunting than opposition .
What is more , there is always another election to win .
By most measurements Cameron has been a successful leader .
He has been reliably calm under fire , an engaging communicator and a leader who has given space for some of his allies to develop innovative ideas .
But in retrospect he will also have a tinge of regret about this pre-election gathering .
So far he has pulled off the trick of personifying change , but with talk of Europe and benefit cuts dominating Manchester , it feels closer to a Tory conference from the early 1990s , although one that is more sensitively choreographed and tonally perfect – serious but not triumphalist .
Speaking to some of the younger candidates and policy advisers , I sense a gush of youthful energy , but then the old issues surface to remind us their party is not as fresh as it seems .
As I write , Sky News is showing the famous clip of Peter Lilley as Social Security Secretary attacking in verse those on benefits .
I wonder how long it will be before Cameron writes his memoirs .

Did you recently decided to make yourself a High - end Gaming Rig and ended - up in confusion of what to get .
Whether to choose that new 1GHz AMD ATi Radeon HD or one of those of Nvidia CUDA / SLI powered GTX quad cores ?
Well , here is the solution - Get best of both worlds .
Lucid last year promised to develop a chipset that would enable any motherboard to work with any combination of GPUs and still able to get 100 percent of the performance out of both .
It took them more than a year to fight against laws of physics 🙂 .
Now , the company has unveiled its HYDRA 200 Parallel Graphics Chip , a tiny 65nm processor that , when installed on a motherboard or expansion card .
On the motherboard manufacturing and support front , MSI has eagerly showed interest , and they become the first company to sign up .
What ’s even more interesting was to see their demonstration Intel P55 - based Gaming Motherboard , offering a HYDRA 200 and three PCIe slots for some serious GPU power .
In - house preliminary tests show performance never seen before on MSI Big Bang motherboards running such popular game titles as Crysis , F.E.A.R.2 : Project Origin , Left4 Dead 2 and Bioshock .
The motherboard will be available in the stores for 2009 holiday season .
Here is the basics of How it works :
This device is capable of intercepting DirectX or OpenGL command stream before it hits the GPU , analyzing the data , and dividing up scene at an object level .
Rather than rendering alternating frames , or screens split on the horizontal , this part is capable of load balancing things like groups of triangles that are associated with a single group of textures and sending these tasks to whatever GPU it makes the most sense to render on .
The scene is composited after all GPUs finish rendering their parts and send the data back to the Lucid chip .
Utterly amazing , no less than rocket science .

Help convince the Canadian Justice Minister to NOT EXTRADITE Marc Emery to the USA , then ask the US federal judge to give Marc Emery a very short or non-custodial sentence !
Marc Emery was taken into custody on Monday , September 28th .
Marc is being held in Canada until the Justice Minister signs the extradition order to send him to the USA .
Tell the Justice Minister to refuse the extradition of Marc Emery !
Canadian Marc Emery has been fighting extradition to the USA and possible life imprisonment since July 2005 .
In March 2008 , the Canadian Government decided to turn down a unique type of plea deal the USA and Marc Emery 's lawyer had arranged -- one that required Canadian charges to be laid and the incarceration be in Canada .
In July 2009 , Marc 's co-accused , Michelle Rainey and Greg Williams , were sentenced to 2 years probation in Canada .
In early September 2009 , Marc Emery decided to sign a plea deal for a 5 - year sentence in the US federal prison system .
You can read Marc 's reasons for taking the plea deal in his blog post " Why I'm Cutting a Deal " .
Read more about what will likely happen to Marc from this point on by reading Jodie Emery 's blog post " Marc Emery Imprisoned : Monday , September 28 , Vancouver " .
Read news articles and view some videos from the day Marc surrendered into custody here .
HOW TO HELP FREE MARC EMERY : First of all and most importantly , please be polite and respectful – but very firm – when contacting the following people .
Secondly , strongly emphasize that Marc Emery is a Canadian citizen who never went to the USA and carried out his activities in Canada .
If he has broken the law in Canada , he should be tried and sentenced in Canada , not sent to a foreign country to be punished under much harsher laws .
Try to bring up these important points along with the " Facts About Marc Emery " listed below to help you better explain why Marc Emery should not be imprisoned in the USA .-
Vancouver police investigated Marc in 2003 and tried to have charges filed in court , but the Crown refused , so the VPD admitted that the USA picked up the file to get harsh punishment for Marc in the USA .
If Marc could n't be charged in Canada , he should not be charged in America . -
The US District Attorney arranged a plea deal in January 2008 that would allow Marc to serve his time in Canada , as long as the Conservative government laid charges here in Canada ... but the government refused .
Again , if the government would n't charge or punish Marc in Canada , he should not be charged or punished in America .
1 )
Contact the Justice Minister of Canada , Rob Nicholson , to tell him that you are a voter and you want him to refuse the extradition order for Marc Emery .
You must insist that the message be delivered directly to the Justice Minister , and ask for a response too !
Here is a phone script : " Hello , my name is ________ and I want you to give this message directly to the Justice Minister .
I 'm calling about Canadian Marc Emery , who is awaiting extradition to the USA for selling marijuana seeds through the mail .
It would be cruel and unusual punishment to extradite Marc Emery to the United States .
If Marc Emery has broken the law in Canada , he should be charged here in Canada .
As a voter , I am asking you to not extradite Marc Emery .
Thank you .
" Please write a letter and print three copies to mail them directly to his offices .
There is no stamp / postage required for mail to the House of Commons address , but stamps are necessary for the other two addresses .
Mailing a letter is many , many times more effective than sending an email , so please be sure it gets to the Justice Minister through the mail .
We want him to get the message in all three offices !

Marc Emery has been a media figure for 20 years with regards to marijuana and drug law reform .
He is very well - known to Canadian , American and international news media organizations . •
Marc
Emery operated his business in full transparency and honesty since its inception in 1994 , even sending his marijuana seed catalogue inside his magazine " Cannabis Culture " to each Member of Parliament in Canada every two months for years . •
The US Drug Enforcement Administration admitted in a press release from Administrator Karen Tandy that his July 29th , 2005 arrest was based on drug legalization efforts -- a copy of the document can be viewed at http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/4685.html
--" Today 's DEA arrest of Marc Scott Emery , publisher of Cannabis Culture Magazine , and the founder of a marijuana legalization group -- is a signficant blow not only to the marijuana trafficking trade in the U.S. and Canada , but also to the marijuana legalization movement .
His marijuana trade and propagandist marijuana magazine have generated nearly $ 5 million a year in profits that bolstered his trafficking efforts , but those have gone up in smoke today .
Emery and his organization had been designated as one of the Attorney General 's most wanted international drug trafficking organizational targets -- one of only 46 in the world and the only one from Canada .
Hundreds of thousands of dollars of Emery 's illicit profits are known to have been channeled to marijuana legalization groups active in the United States and Canada .
Drug legalization lobbyists now have one less pot of money to rely on .
" Who is Marc Emery ?
Marc Emery is a Canadian businessman and political activist who owns and operates " Cannabis Culture Magazine " , " Pot - TV " , the " BC Marijuana Party " , and " Marc Emery 's Cannabis Culture Headquarters " ( previously " BC Marijuana Party Bookstore " and " Hemp BC " before that ) .
Marc also ran " Emery Direct Seeds " in a store in downtown Vancouver BC and through mail - order , for over ten years , with the goal to fund anti-prohibition and pro-marijuana activists and organizations across North America and the world -- a fact that DEA Administrator Karen Tandy crowed about in the press release about Marc Emery 's arrest .
( Numerous other seed - selling businesses operate in North America , some even on the same block as Marc Emery 's businesses today , but they are not seen as high - profile activists , so they are not targeted by the United States Government and law enforcement . )
Marc paid provincial and federal taxes on his income , had no business outlets in the USA , and never went to the USA to conduct seed transactions .
Everything was done openly and transparently , because Marc has always been honest and vocal .
He 's a political party leader and media magnet , always happy to explain how and why he did everything .
He spent the proceeds from all sales on ending the drug war in Canada , the USA , and all over the world : he financed numerous political parties , ballot initiatives , election campaigns , court challenges , medical programs , drug treatment centres , legal fees , conferences , organizations , events and more .
That 's what his mission was , and he even ran in provincial and municipal elections five times as a seed seller , gaining many votes and endless media coverage ....

A former homeless , self - trained musician has been hailed a genius after writing a symphony .
Stuart Sharp , 73 , saw a vision of the musical masterpiece in his mind after his baby son Ben died 41 years ago .
He could not read or write music at the time , but the melodies were so vivid he was determined to turn the ' imaginary ' orchestral sounds into a symphony in memory of his lost child .
Music genius : Stuart Sharp had a vision when his son died and later turned the imaginary sounds into a symphony despite having no musical training
Music genius : Stuart Sharp turned the imaginary orchestral sounds into a symphony despite having no musical training .
But the dream led to problems in his marriage and eventually divorce .
He ended up homeless and broke on the streets of London .
Stuart 's persistence eventually paid off and his musical masterpiece has now been recorded by The London Philharmonia Orchestra .
Stuart said : ' My son died in traumatic circumstances and on the night of his funeral , I heard soothing angelic music with a great choir of angels and it comforted me for a short while . '
His Angeli Symphony has been described as a work of ' genius ' by music experts .
' I could see the whole orchestra playing and as I watched I could see all the individual notes being played on the different instruments . '
' After that I would often hear the music and I could remember it all very vividly . '
' The melodies were always very real , very beautiful , sometimes as if the angels were really playing to me . '
' But I came to understand that it was music for my son and I could see it as a film one day . '
' The cold light of day was different however and I was numb with fear . '
Darker times : Stuart moving into a hostel for the homeless
The romantic symphony , which is filled with string instrumental sections , has astounded professional musicians .
' Stuart 's vision for his musical work was remarkable and it's quite astounding that a non-professional musician has come up with something of this quality , ' said Allan Wilson , conductor of The London Philharmonia Orchestra .
" As a pub cook my life hinged around alcohol and smoking that was impacting badly on my life .
Instead I wanted to follow my vision and create a great orchestral piece . "
Stuart left home and lived in his car for a time before moving around in squats , on the street and later a hostel for the homeless .
But he was determined to follow his dream and bought a cheap guitar from an antique shop called ' Miscellanea ' owned by the parents of ' The Who 's front man Pete Townshend .
He spent the following years learning to play the instrument until he could record the music in his head onto a second - hand tape recorder he bought for 50p .
One day outside the BBC's Television Centre he met jazz musician Anthony Wade , who offered him a place to stay and helped transcribe the music .
In the fifteen years that followed Stuart turned his life around and became a successful businessman through a career in sales and property .
' By 1994 I was able to buy my own home in London , hire great arrangers and the world 's best orchestras so I could finally realise my dream , ' he said .
' I tracked down Anthony and we worked together for five years to create an excellent demo of the symphony .
I felt it was good enough to hand over to conductor Allan Wilson for his opinion .
Two years later the big day came when The London Philharmonia Orchestra recorded my Angeli Symphony .
I truly thought I was back with the angels and the musicians gave me an ovation after they played it and I was finally happy .
I have never considered myself as composer , and although I have written and recorded three more symphonies , a theme song and a further thirty pieces , they are gifts I was given to share where I could .
With my success so far I have projects for the blind and disabled in Africa and am Patron of the Canaan Trust in Nottingham , which looks after many homeless people .
Stuart 's story was picked up by NPR in America and producers in LA have contacted him with a view to turn Stuart 's story into a cinema movie .
Recently Gold Circle Films have put the film into development .

Sí , así es , una encuesta del INEGI revela que ocho de cada 10 jóvenes ha sido agredido psicológicamente y que casi la mitad de ellos ha sufrido violencia física en el noviazgo
El amor los maltrata .
No se quejan , no es de hombres reconocer que las mujeres a veces ahogan .
“ ¿ Qué ya no me quieres ? ” , “ No me cae bien tu amiga ” , “ ¿Quién te llamó ? ” , “ ¿ Qué le ves ? ” , “ ¿Y ese mensaje ? ” , “ ¿ Quién es esa vieja del Facebook ? ” , “ Tú paga , yo soy la princesa ” , “ ¿Andas con alguien más ? ” .
Tal vez no saben que cada frase tiene su carga de control , de chantaje .
De la violencia hacia ellos poco se explora , pero tienen su apartado en las encuestas nacionales sobre violencia en el noviazgo .
Sus números , son sorprendentes : 78 % de los jóvenes que tienen entre 15 y 24 años y que están en una relación de noviazgo son violentados psicológicamente por sus mujeres .
Lo dijeron en la Encuesta Nacional de Violencia en las Relaciones de Noviazgo en 2007 .
El Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía ( INEGI ) les preguntó por primera vez a los jóvenes mexicanos sobre sus relaciones amorosas .
Los resultados arrojan violencia física , sexual , psicológica y también económica .
Ellas los controlan .
Revisan sus teléfonos celulares .
Les prohiben amigas .
Se encelan de las presentes .
Les cuidan la mirada .
Eso dicen las operadoras de la línea de ayuda que abrió el gobierno federal como respuesta a la violencia en los noviazgos mexicanos .
Sólo llama uno por cada cuatro de ellas .
Preguntan si el chantaje es violencia , si que los obliguen a casarse es violencia , si ser el único que saca la cartera es violento .
Así lo registra Diana Ramírez , supervisora de línea joven .
“ Los jóvenes que llaman nos preguntan qué es violencia .
Nos narran como son violentados , chantajeados , cómo les hacen sentirse insensibles , les generan culpa si no tienen sexo con ellas , los consideran menos hombres si no se quieren casar por que las embarazaron ” , dice .
La Encuesta Nacional de Violencia en las Relaciones de Noviazgo reporta que este tipo de violencia psicológica es entendido como el abuso emocional , verbal , maltrato y menoscabo de la estima hacia una o varias personas .
La guerra de los sexos
Los resultados de la encuesta en este rubro indican que la mayor incidencia de violencia psicológica se presenta en áreas urbanas : 76.3 % , a diferencia del área rural que es de 74.7 % .
La violencia física tiene su cifra : 46 % ; la sexual ni siquiera alcanzó porcentaje para incluir el dato en la encuesta .
A ellos los cachetean , los pellizcan cuando miran de más por la calle , los arañan si no responden rápido , pero esa violencia física no es un problema nacional porque está lejana de la que sufren ellas , es incomparable .
De cada 10 novias , a seis les pegan .
Cuando lo hacen leve , las cachetean , las empujan , les jalan el cabello .
Cuando la violencia es en grado mediano les dan puñetazos , las jalonean ; cuando es grave las amenazan con una pistola .
Aún así , las novias también tienen lo suyo .
Tienen socialmente permitido demostrar sus sentimientos y son fácilmente perdonadas si salen de control cuando demuestran sus emociones .
Pero ellos no corren con la misma suerte .
Siguen siendo vistos como los fuertes .
Los que no lloran .
Más de la mitad de las mujeres piensan que los hombres tienen que ser los proveedores y fuertes de la relación .
En la opinión de las y los jóvenes mexicanos , los roles femeninos y masculinos están estereotipados en situaciones tales como la agresividad , la infidelidad , cuidado del hogar , el rol con los hijos y la educación .
El papel de los hombres como proveedores principales de la familia y los que encabezan la toma de decisiones , sigue siendo para las mujeres como una ley , pues 59 % opinó que un buen hombre es el que provee económicamente a su familia .
No sólo golpes Y es que la violencia cubierta bajo el “ amor ” resulta casi invisible para el grueso de la población que mantiene una relación sentimental .
Los efectos y síntomas del maltrato durante el noviazgo son desconocidos para gran parte de las y los jóvenes mexicanos quienes ignoran que violencia no sólo son golpes .
Roberto García , subdirector de equidad y servicios a jóvenes del Instituto Mexicano de la Juventud ( Imjuve ) , señala que los jóvenes que sufren de violencia dentro de sus relaciones amorosas tienen antecedentes de violencia en sus hogares desde la infancia y conservan estereotipos de género .
Afirma que ante la problemática y después de los alarmantes datos que revelan la encuesta , el gobierno federal , a través del Instituto Mexicano de la Juventud , ha diseñado una serie de estrategias de prevención de la violencia .
“ Abrimos una línea de ayuda , un correo electrónico donde especialistas escuchan a los jóvenes y de ser necesario los conducen a psicólogos y a la policía en caso de que estén amenazados por sus parejas ” , indica .
Tienen dos meses operando la línea telefónica de ayuda .
Al día reciben unas 30 llamadas relacionadas con la violencia en el noviazgo .
Los hombres que llaman para pedir ayuda no llegan ni a cinco , “ pero porque no asumen que el control sobre ellos es violencia ” .
Para el psicólogo del instituto ningún joven tendría que estar pasando por una relación amorosa de control , chantaje y abuso hacia el otro .

The cells replicated to produce a new strain of Mycoplasma mycoides
In what has been described as a step towards the creation of a synthetic cell , scientists have created a new " engineered " strain of bacteria .
A team successfully transferred the genome of one type of bacteria into a yeast cell , modified it , and then transplanted into another bacterium .
This paves the way to the creation of a synthetic organism - inserting a human - made genome into a bacterial cell .
The team describe the work in the journal Science .
This advance , the researchers say , overcomes the obstacle of making a new inserted genome work inside a recipient cell .
The experiment was carried out by a team that included scientist J Craig Venter , a leading figure in the controversial field of synthetic biology .
Sanjay Vashee , a researcher at the J Craig Venter Institute in Rockville , Maryland , in the US , was one of the authors .
The resulting cell he and his team created went on to undertake multiple rounds of cell division , to produce a new strain of the modified bacteria .
Dr Vashee explained to BBC
News that the work overcame a hurdle in the quest to create a fully synthetic organism .
J Craig Venter is a leading figure in this controversial field " Bacteria have ' immune ' systems that protect them from foreign DNA such as those from viruses , " he explained .
He and his colleagues managed to disable this immune system , which consists of proteins called restriction enzymes that home in on specific sections of DNA and chop up the genome at these points .
Bacteria can shield their own genomes from this process by attaching chemical units called methyl groups at the points which the restriction enzymes attack .
The scientists modified the original genome of the bacterium Mycoplasma mycoides , whilst it was inside the yeast cell .
Then they either attached methyl groups to it , or inactivated the restriction enzyme of the recipient bacterium , before transplanting the genome into its new cell .
One of the team 's ultimate aims is to transplant a fully synthetic genome into a bacterial cell - creating bacteria that can be programmed to carry out specific functions - for example , digesting biological material to produce fuel .
Race for life Researchers at the same institute have already synthesised the complete genome of a bacterium called Mycoplasma genitalium .
Dr Vashee described this work as a " logical extension " of that .
He told BBC News that attempts to create a synthetic bacterium by transplanting M. genitalium into a cell were " ongoing " .
" We have as of yet no conclusive proof that we have obtained M. genitalium cells after its genome has been put into various recipient cells , " he said .
" [ But this ] is a major advance in our effort to create a synthetic cell . "
Dr Vashee continued : " We were very concerned that the differences between the modifications in ... bacterial DNA and [ yeast ]
DNA might be an insurmountable barrier , preventing transplantation into bacteria of genomes that were passed through yeast .
" Now we know how to do this . "
Critics have expressed reservations about synthetic biology , and the aim to create what has been widely referred to as artificial life .
Many are concerned that the technology to engineer organisms could end up in the wrong hands .
Dr Vashee concluded : " Dr Venter and the team at JCVI continue to work with bioethicists , outside policy groups , [ politicians ] , and the public to encourage discussion and understanding about the societal implications of their work and the field of synthetic genomics . "

If you ’re reading Pick the Brain , it ’s a fair bet that you have goals .
You might even have written them down .
Perhaps you read them every day , or have them pinned to a notice - board .
How many of those goals are materialistic ones ?
How many are focus on a dollar amount or a particular purchase ?
I ’ve been reading a book by Jack Canfield recently , and while I ’ve found plenty of good advice in it , I ’ve also been a little disturbed at times by his seeming equation of “ success ” with money and material goods :
Here are the life purpose statements of some of my friends .
It is important to note that they have all become self - made millionaires through the fulfilment of their life purpose .
( Jack Canfield , The Success Principles , pg30 in UK edition )
It ’s a common theme on blogs and forums , too : I ’ve come across a number of people who are creating “ vision boards ” for goals that all about having expensive items – from watches to yachts – and expensive experiences .
Now , I ’m not here to get judgmental .
Perhaps it ’s true that money really is going to bring happiness for those people .
But if you ’re finding it hard to pursue your goals , if you find that focusing on that stupendous salary or that huge house does n’t seem to touch you deep down , or if your goals seem to be draining you rather than giving you energy , then ask …
What ’s Behind the Money ?
We never really want money itself .
We want whatever it is that we believe money will bring us .
For many people , this is “ freedom ” … but it ’s worth asking yourself what price you ’re paying for that .
I was interested in time coach Mark Forster ’s explanation of why he abandoned his goal of earning a million dollars :
So did I have to wait until I had earned a million dollars before I could have freedom ?
Were n’t there things I could achieve in the shorter term , or perhaps even immediately , which would have the same effect ?
I began to realise that the goal of a million dollars was in itself a burden .
In order to reach freedom , I was proposing to enslave myself to a huge goal for an indefinite period of time .
( Mark Forster , How to Make Your Dreams Come True , p115 – currently out of print )
Even if your goals are objects or experiences , what ’s the actual motivation behind them ?
Do you want a yacht to “ prove that you ’ve made it ” ?
Is your desire for a big house really a desire for security ?
Do you want an expensive wardrobe so that you can attract the partner of your dreams ?
Once you ’ve figured out what your real goal or value is , it ’s worth taking a long hard look at whether your current actions are getting you any closer .
If what you really want is to meet a life partner , are your working hours making that hard ?
Will your kids really be happier if they have the latest and greatest toys each Christmas – or if you come home from work before bedtime once in a while ?
Alex Blackwell wrote movingly about what he’d do differently if he could have his time as a father over again :
I would stay at the dinner table 15 minutes longer and not feel compelled to rush to my office and dig into my work .
I would use those 15 minutes to ask one additional question about [ my daughter ’s ] day , to provide the nurturing she wanted and to offer my help in any matter my daughter requested .
( Alex Blackwell , Confessions from a Recovering Father , The BridgeMaker )
What Are You Being Sold ?
Marketers and advertisers play on our emotions .
Rather than selling us a watch , a car or a holiday , they sell us a particular feeling – perhaps even succeeding in getting to the heart of what we really want .
Next time you see an advert and think “ I want that ” , ask yourself what feeling or emotion you ’re being sold .
Security ?
Freedom ?
Escape from concerns ?
Our culture is increasingly materialistic .
Just pick up a magazine , watch television or catch a movie and you ’ll see that .
Even personal development gurus tell us to expect “ abundance ” and to “ raise our financial thermostat ” .
It ’s often worth taking a step back .
Ask yourself whether a new gadget or item will really make you happy .
If not … what will ?
More leisure time , the freedom to be creative , deeper relationships ?
That ’s what you should be pursuing .

Actually , hindsight and the Investment Grade Value Stock Index ( IGVSI ) Bargain Level Monitor tell us that it died early in March 2009 .
More realistically , however , corrections do n’t die quite so abruptly .
They are supplanted by rallies — and vice versa .
The IGVSI Bargain Stock Monitor tracks the price movements of an elite group of New York Stock Exchange equities .
Their “ eliteness ” is earned by a B + or higher S & P rating , a history of profitability , and the fact that they pay dividends to their shareholders .
Unfortunately , they are the same companies whose boards of directors allow senior executives to pillage treasuries with obscene salaries and bonuses — and elite does not mean invulnerable to the whims of markets and governments .
But , for Working Capital Model ( WCM ) equity investments , they are just perfectly less risky ( historically ) than the others .
An IGVSI equity becomes a bargain stock ( or “ OK to add to your portfolio if it meets strict WCM diversification and price standards ) when it falls at least 20 % from its 52 - week high .
From 15 % to 20 % down , it is held in a mental “ bull pen ” , getting ready for the “ bigs ” after a few more down - tics .
The fewer IGV stocks at bargain prices , the stronger the market , and the more profit taking WCM methodology investors should be experiencing .
The most important thing most investors fail to do during rallies is to prepare for their “ supplantation ” by the next correction .
Fewer equity bargains and higher prices should result in growing “ smart cash ” levels .
Smart cash results from dividends , interest , profit taking , and systematic portfolio contributions .
Why smart cash ?
Its not reallocated to other classes of securities , it anticipates the next turn in the market cycle , and it patiently waits for new ( and pre-defined ) opportunities .
Uh-uh , smart cash is never market - timing cash .
Here ’s what the Bargain Level Monitor has been reporting :
* The 2007 monitor showed a decreasing number of bargains through May , followed by rapidly increasing numbers through year - end when nearly half the population was down 15 % or more .
* The trend worsened in 2008 , and at the February 2009 month - end bottom , a dartboard stock selection approach would probably have worked fairly well .
* Second Quarter numbers were the best in nearly two years — meaning there were far fewer investment opportunities to choose from .
The Third Quarter figures surpassed them by 31 % .
* September was the best rally month since early in 2007 , with fewer than 8 % of the entire IGVSI selection universe qualifying as “ bargain stocks ” by month end .
Here ’s what the Bargain Level Monitor is telling you :
* The seven - month - old “ fat lady ” is signaling the death knell of the last stock market correction .
WCM portfolios should be within striking distance of the all time market value highs achieved 28 months ago .
* We are absolutely in a potent rally , in both equities and closed end income funds .
Profit - taking opportunities are staring you in the face , heckling , whispering to hold on for even greater returns .
* The last time we experienced six consecutive months with less than 20 % of the IGVSI population down 20 % or more from 52 - week highs ?
Yup , the third quarter of a 2007 .
So if you have not taken profits ( and realized a few not quite as bad as they might have been losses in your major “ thank you Mr. Congressman ” disasters ) , one of these things is happening :
* You are being greedy by ignoring the WCM profit taking guidelines .
* You have no profits because you believed “ the financial world is coming to an end thesis ” and kept your stash in some form of mattress .
* You do n’t want the tax burden associated with short - term gains or you think this new rally will actually last forever .
* You are waiting for the experts to pronounce that this upturn has become a new trend and that you may once again feel good about paying more for something than anyone else on the planet has ever paid — ever .
There is no question that we have experienced a powerful rally .
The only unknown is its duration .
So what do me do in rallies ?

The WSJ reports on one debt bubble that has yet to pop , and is still inflating at an insane rate :
New numbers from the U.S. Education Department show that federal student - loan disbursements — the total amount borrowed by students and received by schools — in the 2008 - 09 academic year grew about 25 % over the previous year , to $ 75.1 billion .
The amount of money students borrow has long been on the rise .
But last year far surpassed past increases , which ranged from as low as 1.7 % in the 1998 - 99 school year to almost 17 % in 1994 - 95 , according to figures used in President Barack Obama 's proposed 2010 budget .
The sharp growth is " definitely above expectations , " says Robert Shireman , deputy undersecretary of the Education Department .
" But we 're also in an economic situation that nobody predicted . "
The eye - opening increase in borrowing is largely due to the dire economic environment , which is causing more people to seek federal loans , he says .
Clearly this can't keep on going like this .
All this student loan debt is crazy , especially considering the likely earnings power of many of these graduates .
Despite the desire to see more subsidization of college , we suspect there will be a collapse in student loan debt availability and desire to take on new debt .
But !
It 's not all bad news .
A lot of people still have a conception of there being a handfull of elite , Northeast schools out there , followed by a whole mess of " safety schools , " that are only worth going to if you do n't get into your " reach schools . "
The reach schools are deemed to be worth it at any price , which explains the price inflation .
But when the air gets let out of the student loan market ( and students themselves come to their senses ) they 'll realize that there are tons more high - quality schools than there used to be .
State schools have gotten better and more competitive , as have a lot of smaller liberal arts schools .
This trend is n't new .
Vassar and Haverford were n't always seen as all that desirable , but now have high admissions standards , owing to the number of applicants .
When the information about the multitude of good schools gets out there , and the conventional wisdom starts to change , price competitiveness will become severe , and fast .
With debt exploading like this , it can't be that long before reality returns .

Last week , I conducted a curious experiment .
A friend at a brewery had sent me a Ziploc bag of American hops , the flower buds from the hop plant that are used to flavor beer .
I just went wild when I opened the bag — the scent was so intensely grassy , citrusy , and floral .
It was like inhaling what a well - balanced India Pale Ale ( IPA ) should smell like .
I took a glassful of these dried hops around the office to gauge reaction , and it was easy to spot the true sensualists in the crowd , of which there were many .
While that 's probably not a big surprise , what was fascinating was that several self - proclaimed non -beer drinkers went crazy for the intense hoppy bouquet .
After all , these intoxicating aromas are essentially what you should smell and taste if you sip a well - crafted American IPA , rapidly becoming one of the most popular styles of beer in the country .
The first IPAs were brewed in London in the 1700s and designed for export to English soldiers and merchants in India .
Thanks to the heady dose of hops , which served to preserve freshness and mask any staleness , these pale ales were excessively bitter , high in alcohol , and brewed to withstand anything a five - month sea voyage could throw at them .
Modern American IPAs are still characterized by the liberal use of hops ( when it comes to flavor , more is more ) and tend to be high in alcohol ( more than 5.5 percent ) , but other than that they show little resemblance to their imperial forebears .
For one thing , these modern incarnations are meant to be enjoyed fresh instead of aged .
And in true democratic form , American IPA styles vary greatly from West Coast to East .
The American versions , particularly those brewed on the West Coast , have been labeled " extreme beers , " owing to their amped - up use of hops .
And in turn , their devotees are appropriately called " hop heads . "
Take Lagunitas Brewing Company in Northern California , which helped pioneer the West Coast style in the mid '90s .
" In hops and alcohol , we 're bigger than the British , " says Tony Magee , founder of Lagunitas .
" We had to find ways to differentiate ourselves from traditional European styles .
We love the flavor of American hops — they 're so distinct with that resiny flavorful bitterness — so we took our pale ale and upped the malt by 35 percent and the hops by 40 percent .
We figured if some hops is good , then more is better . "
The Lagunitas IPA has a pleasant amount of bitterness , with an IBU ( International Bitterness Units ) of 45.6 .
To give you some means of comparison , British versions hover around 30 IBU .
Meanwhile in Minnesota , Omar Ansari at Surly Brewing Co. has turned up the dial on hops to a full roar for what he calls " a tempest on the tongue " with his Furious IPA , which has a whopping 99 IBU .
At the Maui Brewing Co. , the Big Swell IPA features a comparably modest 60 IBU , and is as refreshing as one might expect from a brewery in a tropical locale .
But whatever their flavor differences , one important commonality that all American craft IPAs have is that they go remarkably well with food , particularly spicy and fatty dishes .
Although the history of IPA does n't tie directly into Indian cuisine , IPAs are a surprisingly good match with the cooking of the subcontinent , as they are with Thai , Mexican , Chinese , and Cajun food , as well as classic American barbecue .
" The cutting power of the bitterness with spice or with oils and fats makes IPA a much better match with spicy cuisine or barbecue than wine , " says Garrett Oliver , author of The Brewmaster 's Table and editor of the forthcoming Oxford Companion to Beer .
Oliver is also brewmaster at Brooklyn Brewery , which turns out a traditional interpretation of British IPA .
" If you think of heat on a scale of one to ten , Alsatian GewÃ¼rztraminer can take you to three , German Riesling to about four , and after that you 're distinctly in IPA territory . "

Is banker compensation one of the root causes of last year ’s financial meltdown ?
The Epicurean Dealmaker says no .
A lot of things changed when investment banks evolved from moderate - size partnerships into gigantic public companies , but pay was n’t one of them :
Large public banks did retain much of the partnership compensation model , which deferred ever more of a banker ’s pay the higher up he got and the more he made .
But [ … ] deferred pay lost its effectiveness as a distributed risk management tool .
As investment banks grew ever larger and more complex , each banker had less and less impact on the overall results and health of his bank , almost no matter how much he made .
…. Notwithstanding what legions of indignant and self - righteous commentators contend , the incentive system currently in place operates exactly as most of them propose : a large portion of banker pay is deferred for years and is tightly tied to the overall health and success of the firm .
Bankers are not incentivized to print huge risky trades and run away as soon as they collect their bonus at the end of the year .
In fact , they are more closely tied to the long - term health of the firm and its stock price than any other stakeholder .
They just ca n’t do anything about it .
Unfortunately for them and for us , such a system does not seem to have prevented anything .
I basically believe this .
The problem was n’t so much that bankers did n’t care about long - term results as it was that they never realized they were taking on so much risk in the first place .
They thought they had safely hedged it all away .
Reining in compensation may still be a good idea , but it ’s just a backstop .
The real fixes to the system are deeper and more fundamental .

Advertisement Author Hilary Mantel has been named 2009 Man Booker Prize winner for her historical novel Wolf Hall .
Mantel , 57 , beat five other shortlisted authors , including Sarah Waters and JM Coetzee , with her book based on Henry VIII 's adviser Thomas Cromwell .
Judges praised the " extraordinary story - telling " of Mantel .
The author , who received the £ 50,000 prize at a ceremony at London 's Guildhall , said it had taken her about 20 years to decide to write the book .
" I could n't begin until I felt secure enough to say to my publisher - just what a publisher always wants to hear - ' this will take me several years you know ' .
But they took it on the chin , " she said .
Mantel , who is now working on a sequel , also beat AS Byatt with the novel The Children 's Book , Adam Foulds for The Quickening Maze and Simon Mawer for The Glass Room .
Waters was shortlisted for her book , The Little Stranger , and Coetzee had been in the running for his fictionalised memoir , Summertime .
" When I began the book I knew I had to do something very difficult , I had to interest the historians , I had to amuse the jaded palate of the critical establishment and most of all I had to capture the imagination of the general reader , " Mantel said .
We thought it was an extraordinary piece of story - telling
Chairman of judges James Naughtie Chairman of judges James Naughtie said : " Our decision was based on the sheer bigness of the book .
The boldness of its narrative , its scene setting .
" The extraordinary way that Hilary Mantel has created what one of the judges has said was a contemporary novel , a modern novel , which happens to be set in the 16th Century .
" We thought it was an extraordinary piece of story - telling . "
Despite that , he revealed it had not been an " unanimous decision , but it was a decision with which we were all content " .
Bookmakers favourite Mantel , who was made CBE in 2006 , saw her first novel , Every Day is Mother 's Day , published in 1985 .
Its sequel , Vacant Possession , followed a year later .

In 1989 she won the Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize for Fludd , then A Place of Greater Safety scooped the Sunday Express Book Of The Year award in 1993 .
Three years later Mantel was presented with the Hawthornden Prize for An Experiment in Love .
She was also shortlisted for the Commonwealth Writers Prize and the Orange Prize for Fiction , both in 2006 , for the novel Beyond Black .
Mantel had been the bookmaker 's favourite to win the award .
William Hill had offered odds at 10/11 - the shortest odds it has ever given a book to win the prize .
Ion Trewin , literary director of the Booker Prizes , said the last time a favourite walked off with the prize was Yann Martel 's Life of Pi in 2002 .
Naughtie was joined on the judging panel by biographer and critic Lucasta Miller ; Michael Prodger , literary editor of the Sunday Telegraph ; Professor John Mullan , academic , journalist and broadcaster ; and Sue Perkins , comedian , journalist and broadcaster .
The Man Booker Prize for Fiction , first awarded in 1969 , aims to promote the finest in fiction by rewarding what its judges believe is the best book of the year .

Lu Xun , An Outsider 's Chats about Written Language
Lu Xun1 ( 1881 –1936 ) is generally regarded as the greatest Chinese writer of the twentieth century .
He never produced a novel , but he wrote numerous memorable short stories and countless essays and letters that had an enormous impact on modern China .
Among his most celebrated works are " The True Story of Ah - Q " ( A - Q zhengzhuan ) , " Diary of a Madman " ( Kuangren riji ) , and " My Old Hometown " ( Guxiang ) .
Lu Xun was also a deeply learned chronicler and critic of Chinese literature ; his Brief History of Chinese Fiction ( Zhongguo xiaoshuo shilüe ) remains authoritative to this day .
Hawai'i Reader in Traditional Chinese Culture , edited by © 2005 by the University of Hawai'i Press .

Used with the permission of the University of Hawai'i Press .
This translation is by Victor H. Mair .
But Lu Xun was much more than an outstanding littérateur .
He was also a trenchant social commentator whose impassioned pleas for reform were instrumental in guiding China 's path toward progress — even for many decades after his death .
He made bitterly honest comments on virtually all aspects of Chinese institutions , culture , and customs .
Among the subjects that attracted Lu Xun 's attention was the Chinese script .
So deep were his feelings about the Chinese writing system that he was reported to have proclaimed shortly before his death , " Hanzi bu mie , Zhongguo bi wang " ( If Chinese characters do not fade away , China will perish ! ) .
While this is admittedly a radical formulation of the problem posed by China 's archaic script in the context of efforts to modernize the nation , Lu Xun was by no means the first Chinese scholar to blame the writing system for his nation 's backwardness .
Indeed , Lu Xun had been preceded by dozens of individuals from the late - Qing period onward who had devised simple and more efficient writing systems , including alphabets , for the various Chinese languages .
And , as early as the Song dynasty , the renowned and erudite polymath Zheng Qiao ( 1104 – 1162 ) had noted some of the deficiencies of the Chinese script .
Lu Xun returned to the subject of the Chinese writing system on numerous occasions throughout his career , but his most sustained and probing examination of the characters is to be found in the remarkable text translated here .
Because An Outsider 's Chats about Written Language ( Menwai wentan ) is both enormously informative and richly entertaining , we have chosen to present the text in its entirety .
It should be noted that the first word of the title , Menwai , is multivalent .
Among its applicable meanings here are " outdoors " and — with han ( man , fellow ) understood at the end — " novice , layman , greenhorn . "
Since Lu Xun was deeply familiar with the script , its nature , and history , he was obviously being polite in styling himself a menwai( han ) .
Menwai wentan first appeared in the pages of the " Free Discussions " ( Ziyou tan ) supplement of the influential Shanghai newspaper Shen bao , from August 24 through September , 1934 under the pseudonym Hua Yu .
This name may literally be rendered as " China 's Prison , " but it is also a perfect homophone for " China 's Language , " a pun that was almost surely in the back of Lu Xun 's mind when he chose it for this particular work .

1. Introduction
I 'm told that the heat in Shanghai this year has n't been equaled in the past sixty years .
During the day , we'd go out to grub for a living , and , in the evening , we 'd return with our heads hanging .
In our rooms it would still be hot , and , on top of that , there were mosquitoes .
At such times , paradise could only be found outdoors ( menwai ) .
Probably because [ Shanghai is ] next to the sea , there 's always a breeze so you do n't need to fan yourself .
The neighbors who lived in the flats and garrets in the vicinity would also sit outside .
Although we knew each other somewhat , we did n't often have a chance to meet .
Some of them were shop clerks , others were proofreaders in publishing houses , and still others were accomplished draftsmen .
Everybody would be totally exhausted and sighing over how hard life was .
But at least this was a time when we were free , and so we would talk freely .
The limits of our conversations were actually quite broad .
We talked about the drought , praying for rain , 2 picking up girls , 3 a three - inch shrunken mummy , 4 foreign rice , 5 naked gams , 6 and we also talked about classical writing , vernacular language , and colloquial speech .
7
Because I 'd written several pieces in the vernacular language , when it came to such subjects as classical writing , they were particularly interested in hearing what I had to say , and , to oblige them , I did speak a great deal .
In this way , we passed two or three nights before we were diverted by other topics and , at any rate , had exhausted the subject .
Little did I expect that , a few days later , several of my neighbors would ask me to write out what I had said .
Among them , there were those who believed me because I had read some old books , others who believed me because I had read a few foreign books , and still others who believed me because I had read both old books and foreign books .
But several of them , on the contrary , for these very reasons did not believe me and said that I was a " bat . " 8
When I touched upon classical writing , they would say with a smile , " You 're not one of the eight great prose stylists9 of the Tang and Song periods .
Can we believe you ? "
When I talked about colloquial speech , they again said with a smile , " You 're not one of the toiling masses .
What sort of big talk are you feeding us ? "
Yet there is some truth to this .
When we were discussing the drought , mention was made of an official who went to the countryside to inspect the drought conditions .
He claimed that there were some places that really would n't have had to experience the drought but were now experiencing it because the peasants were lazy and had not manned the irrigation pails .
But one newspaper carried a report about a sixty - year - old man who , because his son had died of exhaustion while manning the irrigation pails and , seeing that the drought continued as before , committed suicide since he had no other way out .
The views of the official and the country - folk are so far apart as this !
Such being the case , I 'm afraid that ultimately my evening chats are no more than the idle words of an outsider in his leisure .
After the tropical storm passed , the weather became a bit cooler ; but ( sic ) I finally fulfilled the wishes of those who had hoped that I would write out my opinions .
What I have written is much simpler than the words I had spoken , but the overall import differs little and may be considered a copy for my peers to read .
At the time , I simply relied on my memory to cite old books here and there .
The spoken word , like the wind , rushes past the ear , and so it is not important if you make some mistakes .
Committing it to paper made me hesitate , and , furthermore , I was stymied by not having the original texts to check .
All I can do is ask my reader to correct my errors as he encounters them .
Written and inscribed on the night of August 16 , 1934
2. Who Invented the Written Word ?
Who invented the written word ?
We are accustomed to hearing stories about how a certain thing was always invented by a sage of ancient times .
Naturally , we would ask the same question about the written word .
At once , there is an answer from some forgotten source : writing was invented by Cang Jie.10
This is what is advocated by most scholars , and naturally they have their sources for it .
I have even seen a portrait of this Cang Jie .
He was a monkish11 old man with four eyes .
It would seem that , if one is going to create writing , he 'd first off better have an unusual visage .
Those of us who have just two eyes are not only insufficiently talented ; even our features are unsuited for the task .
However , the author of the Book of Changes ( [ original note : ] I do n't know who he was ) was rather more intelligent .
He said , " In high antiquity , government was carried out with knotted cords12 [ to make records ] .
The sages of subsequent ages substituted [ written ] documents and contracts for these . "
He does not mention Cang Jie but only says " the sages of subsequent ages . "
And he does not mention " invented " but only speaks of an exchange .
He was really being very cautious .
Perhaps , without thinking about it , he did not believe that in antiquity there could have been a person who created a large number of graphs all by himself so he just gives us this one vague sentence .
But what sort of figure was responsible for replacing knotted cords with documents and contracts ?
Was he a writer ?
That 's not a bad answer , judged from the current reality of the so - called " writers " who are most fond of flaunting their writing skills but utterly inept when their pens are snatched away from them .
Indeed , one must first think of them , and , indeed , they ought to expend a bit of effort on behalf of their own bread - winning tool .
Yet this is not true .
Although people in prehistoric times sang songs when they worked and sang songs when they were wooing , by no means did they make drafts of their songs or keep manuscripts of them .
This is because , even in their dreams , they would n't have been able to conceive of selling manuscripts of their poems or of compiling their collected works .
Furthermore , in the society of that time , there were no newspaper publishers and bookstores , so writing was of no utility whatsoever .
According to what some scholars tell us , it would appear that those who devoted their labors to script must have been the historians .
In primitive society , at first there were probably only mages13 [ who were in charge of spiritual and ritual matters ] .
It was not until after a period of gradual evolution when things became complicated that there was a need to record such matters as sacrifice , hunting , war , and so forth .
The mages were then forced to think of a way to make records in addition to carrying out their basic duty of " inviting the spirits to descend .
"
14 This is the beginning of " the [ professional ] historian .
" 15 Moreover , as we can tell from the phrase " [ cause the exploits of the feudal lords to ] rise up to Heaven , " 16 another of their basic duties was to burn the booklets in which they had recorded the major events concerning their tribal chieftain and his administration so that god above could read them .
Consequently , they likewise had to write compositions , although this was probably something that occurred subsequently .
Still later , duties were divided up even more clearly , whereupon there came into being the historian , who specialized in keeping records of things .
Script is an indispensable instrument for the historian .
Some ancient has said , " Cang Jie was the Yellow Emperor 's historian .
" 17 We cannot trust the first part of the sentence , but the fact that it does point out the relationship between history and script is very interesting .
As for the later " men of letters " who used script to write such fine lines as " Oh , my love !
Ah , I am dying ! " they were merely enjoying the fruits of others ' labors and " do not merit consideration here . "
3. How Did the Characters Come into Existence ?
According to the Book of Changes , before there were documents and contracts , there clearly were knotted cords .
Whenever the country - folk where I 'm from have something important they want to do the next day and are afraid of forgetting it , they often say , " Tie a knot in your belt ! "
Then did our ancient sages also use a long cord in which they tied a knot for everything ?
I 'm afraid this would n't work .
If there were only a few knots you could still remember [ what they signified ] , but once there were many it would be hopeless .
Or perhaps that was precisely something like the eight trigrams18 of Emperor Fuxi,19 with three cords in each unit .
If all were unknotted that would be qian ( male , Heaven ) , but if all three had a knot in the center that would be kun ( female , Earth ) .
I 'm afraid this is n't right either .
If there were only eight units , you still might be able [ to get by ] , but if there were sixty - four units , it would be difficult to remember [ what they all stood for ] , much less if there were 512 units !
20
There still survives in Peru the quipu .
21
It uses a horizontal cord and a number of vertical strings hanging from it which , pulled back and forth , are knotted [ and unknotted ] .
Although it looks like a net without really being one , it seems as though it could actually be used to represent a relatively large amount of ideas .
I suspect that the knotted cords of our prehistoric ancestors were like this .
However , since they were replaced by documents and contracts and were not the direct ancestors of the latter , there 's no harm setting them aside for the moment .
The " Goulan Stele Inscription " 22 of Emperor Yu23 of the Xia dynasty was forged by Taoists .
The oldest characters that we can see on genuine artifacts are the oracle - bone inscriptions and bronze inscriptions of the Shang dynasty .
24
But these are already quite advanced , so it is virtually impossible to find a single primitive form .
Occasionally , however , one can glimpse a small amount of realistic pictography , for example a deer or an elephant .
From these pictographic shapes , one can discover clues related to script : the Chinese script is founded on pictography .
The buffalo painted in the Altamira Caves25 of Spain are famous remains of primitive man , and many art historians say that this is truly " art for art 's sake , " that primitive man painted them for amusement .
But this explanation cannot escape from being overly " modern , " 26 because primitive man did not have as much leisure as nineteenth - century 27 artists .
He had a reason for painting each buffalo , something that had to do with buffalo , whether it was hunting the buffalo or casting a spell on them .
Even now people gawk at the advertisements for cigarettes and movies [ posted ] on walls in Shanghai .
One can imagine what a commotion such an extraordinary sight must have caused in unsophisticated , primitive society !
As they looked at [ the paintings ] , they would come to know that this thing [ called ] a buffalo could , after all , be drawn on a flat surface with lines .
At the same time , it seems as though they came to recognize [ the drawing as a graph representing the word ] " buffalo . "
While admiring the artists ' ability , nobody invited them to earn some money by writing their autobiography , so their names have passed into obscurity .
However , there was more than one Cang Jie in [ ancient ] society .
Some of them carved designs on sword hilts ; others drew pictures on doors .
[ Such pictographic representations ] made an impression and were passed on from mind to mind , from mouth to mouth .
[ In this fashion , ] the number of characters increased [ to the point that ] , once the scribes collected them , they could make do to record events .
I suspect that the origins of Chinese writing are to be found within this sort of process .
Naturally , later on there must have been a continual increase in the number of characters , but this is something that the scribes could have managed by themselves .
By inserting the new characters — which , moreover , were pictographic — among the familiar characters , others would have easily guessed what they signified .
28 Even up to the present time , China is still producing new characters .
However , if anyone is intent on being a new Cang Jie , they will surely fail .
Zhu Yu29 of [ the southern kingdom of ]
Wu and Wu Zetian30 of the Tang [ dynasty ] both created bizarre characters , but all their efforts were wasted .
Nowadays , it is Chinese chemists who are the best at creating characters .
[ The characters they come up with for ] the names of many elements and compounds are very hard to recognize , and it is even difficult to read out their sounds .
To tell the truth , whenever I see [ such characters ]
I get a headache .
I feel that it would be far better and more straightforward to use the Latin names current in all other nations .
If you are incapable of recognizing the twenty - some letters [ of the Roman alphabet ] — please pardon me for speaking bluntly — then you probably wo n't be able to learn chemistry very well either .
4. Writing Characters
Is Like Drawing Pictures
In both the Rites of Zhou ( Zhouli ) 31 and the Explanation of Simple and Compound Graphs ( Shuo wen jie zi ),32 it is said that there are six different methods for forming characters .
33
Here I wo n't discuss [ all six ] , but will only say a few things related to the pictographs .
Pictographs may be " based upon the body which is close at hand or on objects that are far away . "
34 That is , by drawing an eye you have mu 目 ( eye ) and by drawing a circle and adding a few rays you get ri 日 ( sun ) .
Of course , that is very clear and convenient .
But sometimes you hit a brick wall .
For example , if you want to draw the edge of a knife blade , how do you go about it ?
If you do n't draw the back of the knife blade , you can't depict the edge of the blade .
At this stage , you have to come up with a novel idea , [ such as ] adding a short line along the blade edge to indicate " here ; this place , " thus creating the graph ren 刃 ( knife edge ) .
This is already getting to seem a bit troublesome to handle , and it is all the more so when you have something that has no form to represent .
In such cases , all you can do is come up with an " ideational " graph , which may also be called a " conjunct " graph .
A hand placed on a tree is cai 采 ( pluck ) , and a heart placed between a roof and a bowl yields ning 寍 ( peaceful , serene , tranquil ) because one is at peace when one has food and shelter .
However , if you want to write the ning of ningke 寧可 ( would rather ) , then you 've got to add a line beneath the bowl to show that this is [ a different character , which ] merely borrows the sound of ning [ meaning " peaceful , serene , tranquil " ] .
Conjunct graphs are more troublesome than pictographs , since you have to draw at least two components .
[ For a more complicated conjunct ] character like bao 寶 ( treasure ) , you have to draw a roof ( top ) , a string of jade ( middle left ) , a jar ( middle right ) , and a cowry shell ( bottom ) for a total of four components .
It looks to me as though the character for " jar " is actually a combination of the two forms for mortar and pestle , so all together there are five components .
35 Just for this one character bao you have expended a lot of effort .
But [ even this method ] wo n't [ always ] work , because there are some things that cannot be depicted and other things that one does not know how to depict .
For example , the leaves of the pine and the cypress are of different types , and it is possible to distinguish them .
But writing , after all , is writing ; it can not be as refined as painting .
When you come right down to it , you just have to stick it out .
To get us out of this sticky situation , along comes [ the principle of character formation called ] xiesheng ( symphonetic ) 36 in which meaning and shape part company .
37 [ With xiesheng characters , ] this is already [ to adopt the principle of ] recording the sounds [ of words for things instead of trying to draw their shapes ] .
Therefore , some people say that this was [ further ] progress for Chinese writing .
They 're right .
We may indeed call this progress , yet the foundation is still that of drawing pictures .
For example , cai 菜 ( vegetable ) is classified under the cao ( grass ) radical and has the sound of cai38 ( pluck ) .
[ To write this character , you must ] draw a clump of grass [ at the top ] , a claw [ in the middle ] , and a tree [ at the bottom ] : three components .
[ Another example , ] hai 海 ( sea ) is classified under the shui ( water ) radical and has the sound mei39 ( " each , every " ) .
[ To write this character , you must ] draw a river [ on the left side ] and a lady40 wearing a cap ( ? ) 41 [ on the right side ] : also three components .
To sum up , if you want to write [ Chinese ] characters , you are forever compelled to draw pictures .
But the ancients were by no means stupid .
They had long since simplified the pictographs so that they became distanced from realistic representations .
Seal 42 characters with their curved lines still bear the traces of picture - drawing .
But with the development of the clerical script43 up to the standard script44 of today , [ the characters have grown ] poles apart from [ the archaic ] pictographs .
However , the foundation has by no means changed .
Even after [ the characters had grown ] poles apart [ from their archaic ancestral forms ] , they became pictographs that no longer bore a resemblance to the objects they represented .
Although [ the characters were now ] simpler to write , they were exceedingly difficult to recognize .
[ You simply ] had to memorize them arbitrarily one by one .
Furthermore , there are still some characters that even today are by no means simple .
For example , if you ask a child to write luan 鸞 ( a mythical bird like the phoenix ) or zao 鑿 ( chisel ) , it 's very hard to fit inside a half - inch square unless he practices for five or six months .
Another complication is that , due to sound changes that have occurred between antiquity and the present , there are many symphonetic ( xiesheng ) graphs whose phonophores have gotten quite out of tune .
Nowadays , who still pronounces hua 滑 ( slippery ) as gu 骨 ( bone ) 45 or hai ( sea ) as mei ( each , every ) ?
46
The ancients handed down writing to us .
Admittedly , this is a tremendous heritage for which we should be thankful .
However , at the present time , when pictographs no longer resemble the objects they are supposed to represent , and when symphonetic graphs have gotten out of tune , our thanks cannot but be a bit hesitant .
5. Did Language and Script Coincide in Ancient Times ?
Having reached this point , I would like to speculate a bit on the question of whether or not language and script coincided in ancient times .
With regard to this question , although modern scholars have by no means come to a clear conclusion , it seems from listening to their manner of speaking that they probably consider them to have coincided , and the further back we go the more closely they coincided .
Nonetheless , I 'm rather doubtful of that , because the easier a script is to write , the easier it is to make what one writes coincide with speech .
But the Chinese pictographs are so hard to draw that I suspect that our forefathers all along stripped away unimportant words .
The Book of Documents ( Shujing ) 47 is so hard to read that it would seem it might well serve as evidence that it was based on spoken language .
But research has not yet precisely revealed the spoken language of the Shang and Zhou people [ whom it purports to be about ] .
Perhaps it was more prolix [ than the terse written language of the Book of Documents ] .
As for the ancient books of the Zhou and Qin , although their authors used a small amount of their local topolects , the writing was roughly the same [ regardless of what part of China and which speech community they hailed from ] .
And , even if it was fairly close to the spoken language , what they were using was a standardized Zhou - Qin vernacular , not at all a Zhou - Qin colloquial .
All the more it goes without saying for the Han dynasty that , although Sima Qian48 ( d. ca. 86 b.c.e. ) was willing to render [ a few of ] the hard - to - understand expressions of the Book of Documents into contemporary terminology .
Yet it was only in special instances that he adopted a bit of popular phraseology , such as when Chen Shĕ 's49 old friend sees that he has become king , he exclaims with surprise , " Wow !
Shĕ , you 're a splendacious guy as de facto king !
" 50 I suspect that the four words " as de facto king " in this sentence have undergone refinement by His Lordship the Grand Scribe .
Well , then , should n't the children 's rhymes , the proverbs , and the folk songs quoted in ancient books be authentic popular language of the time ?
In my estimation that 's hard to say too .
Chinese men of letters , by temperament , were quite fond of rewriting the compositions of others .
The most obvious example of this is that " The Song of the Prince of Huainan , " 51 though it was the same Han - period folk song from the same place , is recorded in two different versions in the History of the Han ( Hanshu ) and in the Annals of the Former Han ( Qian Han ji ) .
52
One goes :
A foot of cloth can yet be sewn ,
A peck of grain can yet be husked ,
But these two brothers cannot countenance each other .
The other goes :
A foot of cloth will make you snuggly warm ,
A peck of rice will stuff your tummy ,
But these two brothers do not countenance each other .
If we compare [ these two versions ] , it seems as though the latter is [ closer to ] the original , yet it 's possible that even [ in this version ] some things have been omitted and that it is merely a summary .
Later , the recorded sayings53 and the storyteller 's scripts54 of the Song period , [ as well as ] the spoken portions of Yuan drama55 and southern plays , 56 are also summaries .
It 's just that the language they used was relatively common and that the words they omitted were relatively few , so that people felt they were " clear as speech . "
My surmise is that Chinese language and script all along have not at all coincided .
The main reason for this is that the characters are difficult to write , so that the only recourse is to abbreviate somewhat .
The writing of the ancients was [ thus ] a digest of the spoken language of the time .
Therefore , when we write Classical Chinese , 57 we are using pictographs that no longer bear a resemblance to the objects they are supposed to represent and symphonetic graphs that are not necessarily in tune to limn on paper a digest of the spoken language of the ancients that no modern person would say and that few can understand .
Just think !
Would n't it be difficult ?
6. Consequently Literature Became a Rare Commodity
Writing had its inception among the people , but later it became the exclusive possession of the privileged .
According to the surmise of the author of the Book of Changes , " In high antiquity , government was carried out with knotted cords [ to make records ] . "
Thus , even knotted cords already belonged to the rulers .
By the time [ writing ] fell into the hands of the mages and scribes , it was even more so , inasmuch as they served under the chieftains and over the populace .
As society evolved , the scope of those individuals who learned to write expanded , but [ writing ] was largely still restricted to the privileged .
As for the common people , they were illiterate not because they lacked the tuition fees , but simply because they were considered unfit since [ writing ] was restricted only to those who qualified .
Furthermore , they were not even permitted to look at books .
Before woodblock printing developed in China , a good book would invariably be hidden away in the imperial libraries and depositories , so that not even scholars knew its contents .
Since writing belonged to the privileged , it was something dignified and mysterious .
Still today , Chinese characters are very dignified .
We often see hanging on the wall baskets with the maxim " Cherish paper that has characters on it . "
When it comes to written charms that can dispel evil and cure sickness , that is due to their mysteriousness .
Since writing possesses dignity , then whoever knows how to write will be dignified by his association with it .
If new dignitaries keep appearing day after day , this would not be beneficial to the old dignitaries .
What is more , once those who can write become numerous , the mysteriousness of writing would diminish .
The power of Taoist talismans , which seem to be made up of characters , is due to the fact that , aside from Taoist priests , nobody can read them .
Therefore , those who can write are certain to keep a tight grip on [ this skill ] .
In Europe , during the Middle Ages , all literature and learning were in the monasteries .
Literacy in Croatia was restricted to monks until the nineteenth century .
The spoken language of the people had deteriorated to the point that it was barely adequate for the old way of living .
When they wanted to carry out reform , all they could do was import a lot of new words from abroad .
In addition to the limitations of social status and economic means , our Chinese characters present another high threshold to the masses : their difficulty .
If you do n't spend ten or so years on them , it 's not easy to cross this threshold alone .
Those who cross over it are the scholar - officials , and these same scholar - officials do their utmost to make writing as difficult as possible because it makes them especially dignified , surpassing all other ordinary scholar - officials .
Yang Xiong58 of the Han dynasty , who had a fondness for strange characters , had this failing .
When Liu Xin59 wished to borrow the manuscript of his Regional Speech ( Fang yan ) ,60 Yang threatened to commit suicide .
61
In the Tang dynasty , Fan Zongshi's 62 essays were written in such a fashion that others could not punctuate them , and Li He63 wrote poems that were incomprehensible .
They all did this for the same reason .
Another method is to write characters that no one else knows .
A crude way of doing that us to look up a few old characters from the Kangxi Dictionary64 and insert them in your writing .
Another , more sophisticated , way is — like Qian Dian65 — to write out the whole of Liu Xi's Explanation of Terms ( Shiming ) 66 in small - seal script .67 Recently , Mr. Qian Xuantong68 copied out Taiyan 's69 " Catechism of Minor Learning " ( Xiaoxue wenda ) 70 in the [ smallseal ] graphs of [ Xu Shen 's ]
Shuo wen .
Chinese characters and the Chinese literary language are already difficult enough by their own nature .
On top of that , the scholar - officials have purposely devised all of these additional difficulties that get added on .
Such being the case , how could anyone hope that the masses would have any affinity for the Chinese writing system ?
But the scholar - officials precisely want it to be this way .
If the characters were easy to recognize and everybody could master them , then they would not be dignified , and the scholar - officials would lose their dignity along with them .
Those who say that the written vernacular is not as good as Classical Chinese take this as their starting point .
Nowadays , when those who talk about " the language of the masses " ( dazhong yu ) say that it is only necessary to teach the masses a " thousand - character curriculum , " 71 the roots of such thinking also lie in this .
7. Illiterate Authors
Our predecessors called the digest of ancient spoken language written out in such a difficult script wen ,72 while those today who are slightly more progressive call it wenxue .73
But this word wenxue was not adopted from [ the pronouncement of Confucius in the Analects ] : 74 " In wen xue , there are Zi You and Zi Lu . "
Rather , it was imported from Japan , where it was their translation of the English word " literature .
"
75 People who can compose this kind of wen ( refined writing ) — and nowadays it is permissible to write in the vernacular — are called " men of letters " or they are called " authors . "
The primary requirement for the existence of literature is the ability to write .
Therefore , of course , there can not be any " men of letters " among the illiterate multitudes .
But there are authors among them .
Do n't laugh until you hear the rest of what I have to say .
I believe that , before humankind had writing , there were already creative works .
Unfortunately , there was no one to record them , nor was there any way to record them .
Our earliest ancestors originally could n't even speak .
In order to work cooperatively , they had to express their ideas ; thus they gradually learned to produce complex sounds .
Suppose they were carrying wood and found it very difficult but did n't know how to express this .
If one among them called out , " Heave - ho ! Heave - ho ! " this is [ a kind of ] creation , and if everybody else — out of admiration — adopted this expression , then that was tantamount to publication .
And if it were preserved in some form of notation , that would be literature .
Whoever did so would be an author , a man of letters , and he would belong to the " Heave - ho School . " 76
We need not laugh , for although such a work may indeed be quite childish , there are many respects in which the ancients were not up to moderns , this being one of them .
Take , for example , these Zhou - dynasty lines :
Guan ! guan !
cry the ospreys
On an island in the river ;
Graceful is the fair maiden ,
A fit mate for the gentleman .
Since this is the first stanza [ of the first poem ] in the Poetry Classic ( Shijing ) , 77 we are so overawed by it that all we can do is kowtow submissively .
However , if such a poem had not been written in the past and a modern poet were to write a vernacular poem utilizing these ideas , I suspect that — no matter which newspaper supplement he submitted it to — chances are nine out of ten that it would be stuffed into the waste basket .
Ah , a pretty girl !
She 's a good match for the young lord .
What kind of talk is this ?
Even among the pieces in the " Airs of the States " ( Guofeng ) , 78 there are quite a few that were the creations of anonymous illiterates .
Because they were relatively outstanding , these were handed down by word of mouth .
The officials [ who were sent out to the various states ] selected and recorded these poems as reference materials for the government .
79
No one knows how many other poems must have disappeared .
The two great epics of the Greek poet Homer80 — let us assume for the moment that there actually was such a person — may also be considered as originally being oral recitations , while the extant texts were recorded by others .
Poems such as the " Midnight Songs " 81 and the " Songs without Accompaniment " 82 of the Eastern Jin through the Qi and Chen dynasties ,83 and the " Bamboo Branch Lyrics " and the " Willow Branch Lyrics " 84 of the Tang dynasty were all originally anonymous creations .
They were transmitted by literary men who selected and polished them .
While these polished verses have admittedly been preserved , it 's a pity that they surely must have lost a great deal of their original character .
Still today , there are ballads , rustic songs , fishermen 's songs , and so forth everywhere , and these are all the works of illiterate poets .
There are children 's tales and folk narratives which are the works of illiterate creators of fiction .
These are all illiterate authors .
However , because [ we are dealing with ] works that have not been recorded and that , moreover , are easily lost , the extent of their circulation can not be very wide , and the number of people who know about them will also be small .
Occasionally , when men of letters encounter a bit [ of this sort of oral literature ] , they are invariably surprised , and absorb it into their own works as new nourishment .
When an old literature deteriorates , a new transformation may be initiated by the adoption of folk literature or foreign literature .
Such examples are frequently to be seen in the history of literature .
Although illiterate authors may not be as refined as men of letters , they are solid and refreshing .
If we want their works to be enjoyed by everyone , we must enable such authors to write , and , at the same time , we must enable readers to be literate and even to be able to write themselves .
In a word , we must make writing accessible to everyone .
8. How to Make Writing Accessible to the Masses
There were already [ attempts ] to make writing accessible to the masses at the end of the Qing dynasty .
Do n't beat a drum , do n't strike a gong !
Listen to me sing a Grand Peace Song. . . .
This was an imperially issued ditty85 for instructing the masses .
Aside from this , the scholar - officials also published some vernacular newspapers , but their intention was only that the people should be able to understand them when they were read aloud , not that they should be able to write things out themselves .
86 The Thousand Character Textbook for Commoners presumes the possibility of [ teaching people ] to be able to write out a few things , but it 's only enough for writing accounts and letters .
If one wishes to write out whatever thoughts are in one 's mind , its limited number of characters is insufficient .
[ Such curricula ] are like a prison in which the prisoners are given a plot of land which , however , is restricted , so that all they can do is walk , stand , sit , and lie down in their closed quarters , but can definitely not run outside of the iron bars that have been erected .
Lao Naixuan87 and Wang Zhao88 both devised simplified characters which were quite progressive and whereby one could write words according to their sounds .
In the early years of the Republic , when the Ministry of Education wanted to devise an alphabet , these two men were members of the committee [ charged with that task ] .
89 Mr. Lao sent a representative , but Mr. Wang attended personally .
They had a great fight with Mr. Wu Zhihui90 over whether or not to keep the entering tones.91
The fight was so frantic that Mr. Wu 's padded trousers fell down when he sucked in his belly .
Nonetheless , after repeated deliberations they did come up with something that they called Letters for Annotating Sounds ( zhuyin zimu ) .
At the time , there were quite a few people who thought that zhuyin zimu could replace the characters .
In fact , however , this did n't work out because zhuyin zimu , after all , are nothing more than simplified tetragraphs , 92 just like Japanese kana.93
It 's all right if a few [ of these symbols ] are sandwiched [ between the characters ] or if they are [ attached as phonetic ] annotations to the sides of the characters , but if you want them to stand alone , they 're not up to it .
It 's easy to get them mixed up when writing , and they are readily confused in reading .
When the committee members called them Letters for Annotating Sounds , they were well aware of their limited capabilities .
If we look at [ the situation in ] Japan , there are those who advocate reducing [ the number of ] characters , there are those who advocate Romanization , but nobody advocates using only kana .
Somewhat better is to use [ National ] Romanization ( [ Guoyu ] Luomazi ) .94
I suppose that the person who did the most advanced research on this subject was Mr. Zhao Yuanren ,95 but I 'm not very clear about it .
[ National Romanization ] uses the internationally current roman letters for spelling — now even Turkey96 has adopted them — a string of letters [ are joined to form ] a word ; it 's exceptionally clear and good .
But , for an outsider like me , it seems as though that method of spelling is still too complicated .
Of course , if one wants to be precise , then one must be fastidious , but when something is excessively complicated , then it becomes difficult and constitutes an obstacle to popularization .
It would be better to have something else that is simple yet not crude .
Now let us examine the New Latinization for a moment .
The Daily International Digest97 has published a pamphlet titled " Latinization of Written Chinese , " and a supplement to the combined issues for June and July , 1934 of La Mondo ( The World ) 98 [ entitled ] " Lingva Scienco " [ Language Science ] also introduced this [ system of spelling ] .
These publications are so cheap that anyone interested may buy a copy to read .
The New Latinization uses only twenty - eight letters , and the spelling is easy to learn .
" Man " is rhen , " home " is fangz .
" I eat fruit " is Wo ch goz .
" He is a worker " is Ta sh gungrhen .
It is now being tried out among overseas Chinese and it has seen some success , but so far it 's only for the northern topolects .
99
But I suppose , after all , that most people in China speak one of the northern topolects — not Pekingese — so that if , in the future , there really is a kind of popular written language that can be used everywhere , it will likely be based mainly on the northern topolects .
For present purposes , so long as minor modifications are made after due consideration , enabling it to be compatible with various particular , local pronunciations , this spelling system can be used even in remote parts of the country .
Thus , provided that one recognizes twenty - eight letters and learns a few rules for spelling and writing , then anyone but a lazybones or an imbecile can read and write .
Moreover , Latinization has another advantage : one can write fast .
The Americans say , " Time is money . "
But I think that time is life .
To squander other people 's time for no reason is , in fact , no different than robbing and murdering them .
However , those like us who sit idly chatting in the cool [ evening ] breeze are exceptions !
9. Specialization or Popularization ?
Having come thus far , we run into a big problem : spoken Chinese languages are quite different in various parts of the country .
If we merely divide them up roughly , there are the five groups of the northern topolects , Jiangsu and Zhejiang topolects , the topolects of Hunan , Hubei , Sichuan , and Guizhou , the topolects of Fujian , and Cantonese .
Furthermore , there are also minor differences within these five groups .
Now , if we use Latinization to write , should we write in Standard Mandarin , or should we write in colloquial ?
If we write in Standard Mandarin , many people do not know it .
If we write colloquial , people from other places wo n't be able to read it , and this will cut them further off from each other , which would not be as good as the characters that circulate throughout the country .
This is a great defect .
In my opinion , let each locality write its own colloquial during the initial stage .
At the beginning , it is not necessary to be concerned whether people in other places understand the meaning .
Before the introduction of Latinization , our illiterates never used characters to exchange information anyway ; hence there are no new disadvantages .
On the contrary , there is at least the new advantage that people in the same district will be able to exchange ideas and absorb knowledge .
Of course , by the same token , we also need people to write some beneficial books .
Yet the question remains whether the language of the masses in various places should , after all , in the future turn toward the direction of specialization or popularization .
In the topolects and in colloquial speech , there are quite a few profound expressions .
Where I 'm from we call them " pithy expressions .
" 100 They are very interesting to use , much like allusions in Classical Chinese , and there is a distinct pleasure in hearing them .
Specialization would entail allowing the topolects from various places to develop more fully by refining their grammar and vocabulary .
This would be beneficial to literature , for it would be far more interesting than just using vague generalities in one 's writing .
But specialization has its own dangers .
I do n't know linguistics , but when we observe animals , we note that they are bound to perish whenever they become [ overly ] specialized .
Already before there were human beings , there were many animals and plants that died out because they became too specialized .
Thus , they lost their ability to evolve and were unable to adapt to changes in the environment .
Fortunately , we human beings cannot yet be said to be overly specialized animals , so please do n't worry .
The masses have [ their ] literature , but they should not sacrifice themselves for it .
Otherwise , that would be as ridiculous as the living sages who want to make martyrs of eighty percent of the Chinese people by keeping them illiterate in order to preserve the characters .
Therefore , I think that , during the initial period , we should use the topolects .
However , at the same time , common grammar and vocabulary should be brought in .
First use that which is innate ; this is [ the means to ] popularize writing in a given locality .
[ After that , ] add that which is new ; this is [ the means to ] popularize writing throughout the entire country .
Of course , a system devised by a few scholars in their study usually wo n't work , but just letting things take their own course is not a good approach either .
Today on the wharves , in public offices , and in universities there is already something like common speech ( putonghua ) .
When people speak , it is neither the National Language ( Guoyu ) , 101 nor is it the language of the capital ( Pekingese ) , with each person having their own local accent and intonation .
Yet neither is it a topolect , and even if they pronounce it with difficulty and must make an effort when listening , still — when all is said and done — they can speak and understand it .
If we regularize [ this language of the wharves , offices , and universities ] and help it to develop , it can become a part of the language of the masses , 102 or perhaps even the main force .
When I said that we should " add that which is new " to the topolects , the source of " the new " lies in this .
Once this language which stems from nature but has that which is man-made added to it becomes widespread , our common spoken and written language will have been largely unified .
After this , naturally there will still be more to do .
After many months and years , when the spoken and written language becomes even more unified , something that is as good as pithy [ local ] expressions and more lively than classical allusions will gradually take shape , making literature all the more brilliant .
This is not something that will happen immediately .
Just think of the characters which advocates of the " National Essence " 103 hold to be so precious .
Did n't it take three to four thousand years to end up with such a pile of bizarre achievements ?
As for who should take the initiative in this , that goes without saying : enlightened scholars .
Some may say , " The work of the masses must be done by the masses themselves .
" 104 Of course , that does make sense , but we must look at the role of the speaker .
If the speaker is one of the masses , then it is partially right , the right part being that [ the masses ] should take care of their own affairs , but the wrong part is refusing the help of others .
If , however , the speaker is a scholar , then it is completely different : he is using pretty phrases to monopolize writing and to protect his own dignity and honor .
10 . There 's No Need to Panic
However , without necessarily even taking any real action , the mere mention of this is enough to cause some people to panic .
First they say that those who advocate language and writing for the masses ( dazhong yuwen ) are " political propagandists in the literary realm like Song Yang , " 105 meaning that they are rebels .
Putting a red106 cap on them is the easiest way to oppose them .
Yet , at the same time , this means that , for their own peace of mind , they would rather that eighty percent of Chinese remain illiterate .
And , as for verbal propaganda , there ought to be eighty percent who are deaf and dumb .
But this is outside the framework of " chatting about written language , " so here I need n't say too much about it .
Of those who are particularly concerned about literature , I now see that there are two types .
One type is afraid that if the masses can all read and write , then everybody will become men of letters .
This is like the good man [ in the fable ] who was afraid that the sky would fall down .
I mentioned earlier that , among the illiterate masses , there have all along been authors .
I have n't been to the countryside for a long time , but in the past if the peasants had a bit of leisure — for example , if they were relaxing in a cool place — then somebody would tell stories .
But the storyteller was usually a special person who was relatively more experienced and a clever talker who could keep people listening , was easy to understand , and moreover was interesting .
This was an author and , if you copied down what he said , it would be literature .
If there were someone whose language was insipid , yet was excessively loquacious , nobody would want to listen to him and would even unleash many sarcastic remarks in his direction — satire .
We 've already been playing around with Classical Chinese for several thousand years and with written vernacular for ten - odd years ; but are all who can write men of letters ?
Even if we all become men of letters , this is not like being warlords or bandits since it would not be harmful to the people .
All we'd do is read each other 's works .
Another type is afraid that [ the quality of ] literature would be lowered .
The masses are not cultivated in the old literature .
Compared to the refined literature of the literati , perhaps they may appear to be " low , " but they have not been tainted by the chronic maladies of the old literature .
Therefore , what they compose is vigorous and fresh .
I 've already mentioned how anonymous literature such as the " Midnight Songs " ( Ziye ge ) can give new strength to the old literature .
Now there are also many folk songs and [ folk ] stories that have been introduced .
In addition , there are popular dramas , such as the autobiographical [ speech ] by the Ghost of Impermanence107 in " Mulian108 Rescues His Mother , " which I quoted in Dawn Flowers Plucked at Dusk ( Zhao hua xi shi ) .
109
He says that , because he sympathized with another ghost and let him temporarily go back to earth for half a day , he was unexpectedly punished by Yama .
110 From then on , [ he decided ] never to be lenient again ,
Even if you are [ protected by ] a wall of bronze or iron !
Even if you are a relative of the emperor !
How human , how conscience - stricken , how law - abiding , and how resolute !
Is this something that our men of letters could produce ?
This is the authentic work of peasants and craftsmen who perform such plays in their free time , borrowing the theme of Mulian 's travels to string together many tales .
Except for " The Young Nun Goes down the Mountain , " 111 they are completely different from the woodblock printed text of the " Record of Mulian Rescuing His Mother . " 112 Among the scenes there is one called " Wu Song Kills the Tiger " 113 in which two men — one strong and one weak — do the acting .
First the strong man takes the part of Wu Song and the weak man the part of the tiger .
The weak man complains when he is beaten roundly by the strong man who says , " You 're a tiger .
If I do n't beat you , wo n't you bite me to death ? "
All that the weak man can do is ask to exchange [ roles ] , but when he is bitten mercilessly by the strong man and grumbles , the strong man says , " You 're Wu Song .
If I do n't bite you , wo n't I be beaten to death by you ? "
I think that , compared to the fables of the Greek , Aesop , 114 or of the Russian , Sologub , 115 this is in no way inferior .
If we were to go out into every part of the country to collect them , I suspect that there would be many more works of this sort .
However , they naturally have their defects .
They have all along been cut off from modern thought by the shackles of our difficult script and difficult literary style .
Therefore , if we want Chinese culture to advance as one , we must promote the language of the masses and the literature of the masses .
All the more , our writing must be Latinized .
11 . The Masses Are by No Means as Stupid as the Scholars Imagine
But this time , no sooner were the language and writing of the masses mentioned than various valiant generals have taken advantage of the opportunity to join the fray .
Their backgrounds are not all of a kind , but they all attack the vernacular , translations , Europeanized grammar , and new terms .
They all fly the flag of the masses , saying that none of these things is understood by the masses , so they are unacceptable .
Among them are some who were originally classicists .
They avail themselves of this to assail the vernacular and translations that are right before them .
This is the old tactic of " making alliances with those who are distant while attacking those who are near .
" 116 Others among them are slothful persons who have never studied hard .
Before the language of the masses succeeds , they want the vernacular to fail , so that they will be left with an empty arena where they can boast wildly .
As a matter of fact , they are good friends of Classical Chinese , so I do n't want to say anything more about them .
What I want to talk about now are those well - intentioned but mistaken individuals who , either because they belittle the masses or because they belittle themselves , are prey to the same failing as the scholars of old .
117
Scholars often belittle others , thinking that sentences which are relatively new or relatively difficult must be thoroughly swept away for the sake of the masses , even though they themselves can understand such sentences , since the masses cannot understand them .
In speaking and writing , the more ordinary the better .
If these views develop further , they will imperceptibly become a new school of the national essence .
118 Sometimes , wanting the language and writing of the masses to spread quickly , they propose that everything should suit the taste of the masses , and they even go so far as to say that an effort should be made to " cater to the masses . "
They intentionally use a lot of swear words to ingratiate themselves with the masses .
Naturally , this shows that they are making extraordinary efforts , but if they keep on this way , they will end up becoming new buffoons for the masses .
Speaking of the term " masses , " it has a broad range of meaning , including various sorts and types of people .
But even if it's an illiterate who can't recognize the simplest character , to my mind they really are n't so stupid as the scholars think .
They want knowledge , new knowledge .
They want to learn , and they can pick things up .
Of course , if [ they 're confronted with ] a mouthful of new grammar and new vocabulary , they wo n't understand anything .
But if one picks out what is essential and gradually infuses them with it , they will be able to accept it .
Their ability to absorb [ new things ] may well exceed that of scholars with more preconceived ideas .
Newborn babies are all illiterate , but by the time they are two years old they understand many words and can say many words .
To them , these are all completely new terms and new grammar .
They do n't have to look them up in Mr. Ma's Grammar ( Ma shi wentong ) 119 or Fountain of Words ( Ciyuan ) , 120 nor do they need a teacher to explain them .
After listening to them a few times , they understand the meaning through comparison .
This is also the way that the masses can pick up new vocabulary and new grammar ; this is how they make progress .
Therefore , although the proposals of the new national essence school seem as though they were put forward for the masses , in actuality they have served to hold them back .
Nonetheless , we cannot adopt a laissez - faire attitude toward the masses either , since their understanding of things in some respects , after all , is still beneath that of those enlightened scholars [ who have their interests at heart ] .
If discrimination is not regularly exercised for them , they may mistakenly choose what is useless , or even what is harmful .
Therefore , the new buffoonery of " catering to the masses " is unacceptable .
[ Judging ] from the instruction of history , in the beginning all reforms are the duty of the enlightened intellectuals .
These intellectuals , however , must study , think hard , be decisive , and have perseverance .
They may also employ various expedients , yet without deceiving others .
They use inducements , but by no means do they cater [ to others ] .
They do not belittle themselves by acting as clowns for everybody , nor do they belittle others by treating them as their own underlings .
They are simply individuals among the masses .
I think that only in this way can the cause of the masses be carried out .
12 . Coda
I 've already said quite a lot .
In short , words alone will not suffice ; what 's important is action .
We need lots of people to act : the masses and the vanguard .
All sorts of people are needed to act : educators , men of letters , linguists .
. . .
This is an urgent necessity right now , even if it is like sailing against the current , when all you can do is tow the boat from the bank .
To be sure , sailing with the current is pleasant , but even then it is necessary to have a steersman .
Although we can discuss the best methods for towing and steering , in general the greatest benefit derives from practice .
No matter how we look at the wind or the water , our goal is always the same : Forward !
Everyone probably has his own opinion , so now let me hear what brilliant ideas each of you [ has to offer on this subject ] .
Translator 's Notes
First , let me say I think she 's a sociopath , at the very least , if not a psychopath .
She says the things she thinks she needs to say to get through whatever situation she 's in and does n't worry about matching that up with the facts or with consistency even to her own statements .
Lying at the epic level she 's done is a major red flag , as is the ruthlessness of her dealing with both opponents and supporters she no longer has a use for .
The bloggers and others who used her lies and hypocrisy and her lack of knowledge about national policy during the 08 campaign to destroy her credibility with mainstream voters did a pretty thorough job of it .
The only way she could possibly have come back from the drubbing she got was by going back to Alaska and showing herself to be a competent governor who eschewed drama and by spending the next couple of years heavily boning up on the issues .
Obviously , she decided not to do that , for whatever reason .
( I 'm not one who thinks she was incapable of it ; I think she 's actually quite intelligent ... as are many psychopaths . )
But then her real base has never been those who could be swayed by facts or rational argument .
She always appealed most strongly to the portion of the population that operates in a belief - based manner rather than on the basis of evidence , facts , and reason .
It 's the same demographic that finds Rush Limbaugh a compelling political pundit or Joe the Plumber an authoritative reporter on the Middle East .
If that 's the direction she chooses to go from here - a Fox News commentator , talk radio host , political columnist , author - she 'll be far more free to speak and act as she wishes than she is now , under the restrictions imposed by being an elected official .
Her power as the governor of such a relatively unpopulated and remote state was quite limited anyway , except for its usefulness in launching her onto the national stage .
As a politico - cultural commentator she 'll have more credibility than Limbaugh ( as a major party 's VP nominee just a few short months ago ) and certainly more attractiveness , especially to a politically naive audience , among which I 'd count a large portion of the American electorate , who are more swayed by a politician 's individual characteristics such as perceived integrity and personal attractiveness and by a shared tribal identity than by an understanding of their political ideology or its implications .
Obama hopes to heal the political polarization that is destroying the country , and he 's willing to compromise his agenda , even health care , one of his top domestic priorities , to get the bipartisanship he thinks is needed to overcome the polarization .
I think he 's wrong on that - success in his policies and showing that progressive solutions are the ones that have the most benefit to people in their everyday lives are what will end this cycle of polarization .
What concerns me is that while Sarah Palin was not very good as a national - level politician , she is likely to be very good as a full - time political culture warrior and rabble rouser who will dial up the level of polarization for all she 's worth .
Her content - impaired jingoism will fit right in with national media that already accepts the likes of Limbaugh , Beck , Coulter as worthy of being given access to national audiences instead of marginalized as the fascist monsters that they are .
She 'll be given ongoing support on the national stage by a cynical ratings - seeking and braindead celebrity - worshipping media .
It will be one more circus with a new loudmouth star clown in the ring .
CCP Games , the developer behind space MMORPG EVE Online , made waves in August when they announced DUST 514 , a console MMOFPS which will tie into the EVE universe .
Eurogamer is now running a preview of the new MMO , providing more information on how it will work and the way in which it will interact with EVE and its players .
Quoting : " ... battles take place on dynamic battlefields about 5 kilometers across .
Unlike EVE itself , there will be a cap to the number of players per battle — CCP is ' still playing with numbers ' ( and presumably watching the development of 256 - player MAG with interest ) , but assures us that this will not be less than 64 players .
There will be a command structure , with infantry and squadron leaders on each side led by a player - commander on board the hulking Mobile Command Center airship .
The commander will effectively be playing a real - time strategy game with living units , and will have an RTS - style view of the battlefield .
He 'll be dependent on the situational awareness of infantry players to clear the fog of war .
He 'll also be the target , with the ultimate aim of a battle — after several , varying sub - objectives — being to destroy the opposing side 's MCC . "
The kidney - shaped feature in this image of Titan ’s south polar region is Ontario Lacus , which is thought to be filled with liquid hydrocarbons ( Image : NASA / JPL / Space Science Institute )
The largest lake on Saturn ’s moon Titan is as smooth as a mirror , varying in height by less than 3 millimetres , a new study shows .
The find , based on new radar observations , adds to a deluge of evidence that the moon ’s lakes are indeed filled with liquid , rather than dried mud .
“ Unless you actually poured concrete and spread it really , really smoothly , you ’d never see something like that on Earth , ” says team member Howard Zebker of Stanford University .
Astronomers have waffled on whether Saturn ’s largest moon is dry or wet , but the bulk of the evidence points to liquid lakes .
Advertisement
The radar on the Cassini spacecraft , which arrived at Saturn in 2004 , turned up dark splotches at Titan ’s poles .
The darkness in radar indicates those regions are very smooth , like the signal expected from the surface of a liquid lake .
Converging evidence
Spectral data also showed that the apparent lakes seem to be filled with methane and ethane , which would be liquid on Titan ’s frigid surface .
And “ geomorphologically , they just look like lakes “ , Zebker says .
But previous radar observations viewed the apparent lakes at an angle , and therefore did not see bright radar glints reflected back from their surface , leaving open the possibility that the features were dry lake beds or patches of soot .
Now , researchers report seeing just that signal .
In December , Cassini pointed its radar straight down over Titan ’s largest lake , Ontario Lacus , which spans 235 kilometres at the moon ’s south pole .
The reflected signal was so strong , it maxed out the probe ’s receiver .
“ It ’s like if you had a flashlight and you shined it straight down at a mirror , and it blinds you when you look down at it , ” says lead author Lauren Wye of Stanford .
Weather cycle
The radar echoes revealed a surface covering thousands of square metres whose height varies by less than 3 millimetres – 10 times as flat as previous measurements were able to reveal .
“ It ’s very hard to imagine a solid surface that is smooth on the order of millimetres , ” Wye told New Scientist .
This provides strong evidence that the lake is currently liquid , not dried mud .
“ If you ’ve ever walked outside and seen an area on the ground where there ’s mud and the water dries up , even that is pretty flat – but you get cracks in the mud and pieces that curl up , ” Zebker says .
“ You never see anything as smooth as what we ’re inferring for Titan ’s surface . ”
Confirming the presence of liquid on Titan adds to the long list of similarities between Titan and Earth .
Titan is the only other body in the solar system to show evidence of an active weather cycle , where liquid evaporates from lakes to form clouds , and rains back down to the surface , forming rivers and channels .
This makes Titan one of the best candidates in the solar system for supporting extraterrestrial life .
Skipping rocks
But if it is liquid in the lakes , the winds must be unusually still .
Earlier computer simulations predicted that waves on Titan would be seven times as high and long as those on Earth .
“ This runs counter to that , ” Zebker says .
“ In this one particular lake , the largest lake on Titan and therefore likely to be the roughest , we see no evidence whatsoever of big waves .
You could skip rocks really well . ”
It could be that the liquid is thick and viscous , like honey , though the material properties of methane and ethane at low temperatures are not well known .
Calm weather
It could also be that changing seasons have calmed the weather at Titan ’s poles .
The seasons change slowly – Titan ’s year is 30 Earth - years long – and Titan ’s south pole is currently shifting from summer to fall .
“ This is the time of year that we would expect the polar regions to be quiescent , ” says Jonathan Lunine of the University of Arizona .
Taken together , the evidence for liquid is convincing , Lunine adds .
“ I think Ontario is filled with liquid , ” he told New Scientist .
“ Liquid is the simplest , most consistent explanation for all the data sets . ”
But Zebker cautions that the only way to know for certain is to jump in .
“ You want to have your next probe plunk down in the middle of a lake , ” he says .
“ Anything else is an indirect measurement and some kind of a model . ”

Between long delays , the lousy food and the even lousier in - flight movies , airline travel could n't get much worse , unless you happen to be going through Miami , where TSA workers charged with making our skies safer have instead turned to pilfering passengers ' luggage .
" I was outraged at the time .
It 's like I felt really violated , " said Lisa Manley , one of the several victims of the TSA 's ring of thieves .
Manley had a wonderful vacation until she got off her Air Tran flight from Miami to Atlanta , only to find expensive items , including a $ 3,500 Roberto Cavalli purse and $ 5,500 dollars worth of jewelry gone , into thin air .
Miami-Dade Airport Detectives have spent months trying to break up the theft ring , already making several arrests and confiscating dozens of pricey stolen items .
Among the arrests are TSA workers Tony Defelis and Lithania Noukeo , both charged with grand theft after breaking the TSA 's cardinal rule : serve and protect passengers , do n't steal from them .
Recently added to the list was TSA worker Abigail Urbizo , accused of taking a passenger 's cellphone out of the lost and found and fired under the zero tolerance TSA policy .
" We all , you know , swore to protect and we definitely feel that persons who have been given a position of trust that are supposed to be looking out for our good are doing so , " said Sgt. Ariel Rodriguez , with the Miami - Dade Airport Police .
" We have a dedicated team of detectives who follows up on these cases . "
Sources say six TSA employees , two men and four women , were fired weeks ago for running the organized operation .
One returned 31 passenger items , including an iPod , another brought back 25 stolen items , including jewelry and a camera after both were discovered .
Now detectives are trying to find more suspects while finding the rightful owners of the items , which include expensive watches , jewelry , cameras and other goods .
They 'll be prosecuted once the victims identify their belongings .
Little consolation for weary travellers made wearier by the thefts .
" That would be outrageous , that would be really bad if they take my things away , " said MIA passenger Ignatio Navas .
" I really expect them to only check though and protect myself , protect the airport . "
Sgt. Rodriguez said the solution is simple .
" We just need to have people who are going to be honest and not take things from the bags , " he said .
TSA spokesperson Sari Koshetz said that the administration has a zero tolerance for such behavior , and that " the action of a few individuals in no way reflects on the outstanding job our workforce does every day to ensure the safety of the traveling public . "
Anyone who may have been a victim of theft at MIA is urged to call the Miami - Dade Police Department at 305-876-7500 .

Lawmakers began an intensive push to pass the most sweeping revision of financial regulations since the Great Depression , but the Obama administration ’s proposed overhaul might undergo an overhaul itself along the way .
The congressional committee chairmen handling the administration ’s 600 - page proposal weighed in this week with significant changes as they tried to meet the president ’s deadline for action by the end of the year .
On Wednesday , Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner backed down on a key component that has stirred opposition -- a requirement that companies providing financial products offer a “ plain vanilla ” option , such as fixed - rate mortgages or no-frills credit cards .
His retreat came after Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass. ) , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , floated details of his own version of regulatory legislation that eliminated the requirement .
Advertisement
Geithner ’s move showed that , just as with healthcare legislation , the administration is willing to accept significant revisions to get its plan passed .
“ As the president likes to say , we do n’t have a monopoly of wisdom on these things , ” Geithner told Frank ’s committee , adding that the administration was generally “ very supportive ” of the changes .
“ Our test is , what is going to work ? ”
Congressional and industry leaders now expect significant revisions to be made to the administration ’s plan .
However , any bill is still likely to contain key components that give the government greater power to oversee the financial system for major risks , a new ability to seize and dismantle large financial institutions , and the authority to create a new agency to look out for consumer interests .
“ I think there ’s still more changes to come , ” said Scott Talbott , the chief lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable , which represents large financial institutions .

The industry has objected strongly to parts of Obama ’s plan , particularly the creation of a Consumer Financial Protection Agency to be the people ’s watchdog over financial products that companies offer .
Frank , promising to push forward aggressively , has scheduled 11 hearings through early next month and said the House would vote in November on the legislation his committee produces .
After discussions this week with Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher J. Dodd ( D - Conn . ) , Frank said he expected the Senate to act this year as well .
Obama used a major speech last week on Wall Street to try to jump - start momentum for his regulatory overhaul , which was unveiled in June .
On Wednesday , Geithner warned lawmakers who wanted to take more time to consider proposals that “ it ’s a huge risk ” to put off the legislation .
Dodd , who is drafting his own legislation , said he would propose a major departure from the administration plan -- merging the four existing bank regulatory agencies into a single national bank regulator .
The Obama plan did not go so far in that regard , proposing only to merge two of the agencies , the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency .

Dodd and Frank are strong supporters of a consumer agency that would have the ability to draft rules as well as inspect financial institutions for compliance .
The heads of the OTS , the OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. reiterated their opposition Wednesday to a provision that would move consumer enforcement powers from them to the new agency .
“ We care about consumer protection , ” said FDIC Chairwoman Sheila C. Bair .
In a two - page memo this week , Frank offered several changes for the consumer agency .
He would eliminate the plain - vanilla requirement for financial products , which has drawn criticism because the government would dictate what products companies could offer .
Frank also wants to exempt nonfinancial businesses from the agency ’s oversight even if they offer financial products .
That would include retailers who have credit or layaway plans and auto dealers who offer loans to buy vehicles .
Advertisement
Even with those changes , the Financial Services Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said they still opposed creating the agency .
Frank also said it was crucial to deal with institutions deemed “ too big to fail . ”
The administration wants tougher oversight and the ability to seize and dismantle them if they ’re on the verge of collapse .
Regulators now can do that with banks , but not with other financial institutions such as insurance companies .
Frank opposed the administration ’s plan to identify those firms , which some argue would imply the government ’s willingness to bail them out .
Geithner said the firms would be held to tougher standards to reduce risk , such as keeping a larger amount of money in reserve to handle losses , and that would be impossible to do without identifying them .
“ But you have to do it in a way that does n’t . . . create an expectation that the government will be in there if they fail , ” Geithner said .

Our mismanaged world economy today has many of the characteristics of a Ponzi scheme .
A Ponzi scheme takes payments from a broad base of investors and uses these to pay off returns .
It creates the illusion that it is providing a highly attractive rate of return on investment as a result of savvy investment decisions when in fact these irresistibly high earnings are in part the result of consuming the asset base itself .
A Ponzi scheme investment fund can last only as long as the flow of new investments is sufficient to sustain the high rates of return paid out to previous investors .
When this is no longer possible , the scheme collapses — just as Bernard Madoff ’s $ 65 billion investment fund did in December 2008 .
Although the functioning of the global economy and a Ponzi investment scheme are not entirely analogous , there are some disturbing parallels .
As recently as 1950 or so , the world economy was living more or less within its means , consuming only the sustainable yield , the interest of the natural systems that support it .
But then as the economy doubled , and doubled again , and yet again , multiplying eightfold , it began to outrun sustainable yields and to consume the asset base itself .
In a 2002 study published by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences , a team of scientists concluded that humanity ’s collective demands first surpassed the earth ’s regenerative capacity around 1980 .
As of 2009 , global demands on natural systems exceed their sustainable yield capacity by nearly 30 percent .
This means we are meeting current demands in part by consuming the earth ’s natural assets , setting the stage for an eventual Ponzi - type collapse when these assets are depleted .
As of mid-2009 , nearly all the world ’s major aquifers were being overpumped .
We have more irrigation water than before the overpumping began , in true Ponzi fashion .
We get the feeling that we ’re doing very well in agriculture — but the reality is that an estimated 400 million people are today being fed by overpumping , a process that is by definition short - term .
With aquifers being depleted , this water - based food bubble is about to burst .
A similar situation exists with the melting of mountain glaciers .
When glaciers first start to melt , flows in the rivers and the irrigation canals they feed are larger than before the melting started .
But after a point , as smaller glaciers disappear and larger ones shrink , the amount of ice melt declines and the river flow diminishes .
Thus we have two water - based Ponzi schemes running in parallel in agriculture .
And there are more such schemes .
As human and livestock populations grow more or less apace , the rising demand for forage eventually exceeds the sustainable yield of grasslands .
As a result , the grass deteriorates , leaving the land bare , allowing it to turn to desert .
In this Ponzi scheme , herders are forced to rely on food aid or they migrate to cities .
Three - fourths of oceanic fisheries are now being fished at or beyond capacity or are recovering from overexploitation .
If we continue with business as usual , many of these fisheries will collapse .
Overfishing , simply defined , means we are taking fish from the oceans faster than they can reproduce .
The cod fishery off the coast of Newfoundland in Canada is a prime example of what can happen .
Long one of the world ’s most productive fisheries , it collapsed in the early 1990s and may never recover .
Paul Hawken , author of Blessed Unrest , puts it well : “ At present we are stealing the future , selling it in the present , and calling it gross domestic product .
We can just as easily have an economy that is based on healing the future instead of stealing it .
We can either create assets for the future or take the assets of the future .
One is called restoration and the other exploitation . ”
The larger question is , if we continue with business as usual — with overpumping , overgrazing , overplowing , overfishing , and overloading the atmosphere with carbon dioxide — how long will it be before the Ponzi economy unravels and collapses ?
No one knows .
Our industrial civilization has not been here before .
Unlike Bernard Madoff ’s Ponzi scheme , which was set up with the knowledge that it would eventually fall apart , our global Ponzi economy was not intended to collapse .
It is on a collision path because of market forces , perverse incentives , and poorly chosen measures of progress .
In addition to consuming our asset base , we have devised some clever techniques for leaving costs off the books — much like the disgraced and bankrupt Texas - based energy company Enron did some years ago .
For example , when we use electricity from a coal - fired power plant we get a monthly bill from the local utility .
It includes the cost of mining coal , transporting it to the power plant , burning it , generating the electricity , and delivering electricity to our homes .
It does not , however , include any costs of the climate change caused by burning coal .
That bill will come later — and it will likely be delivered to our children .
Unfortunately for them , their bill for our coal use will be even larger than ours .
When Sir Nicholas Stern , former chief economist at the World Bank , released his groundbreaking 2006 study on the future costs of climate change , he talked about a massive market failure .
He was referring to the failure of the market to incorporate the costs of climate change in the price of fossil fuels .
According to Stern , the costs are measured in the trillions of dollars .
The difference between the market prices for fossil fuels and an honest price that also incorporates their environmental costs to society is huge .
As economic decisionmakers , we all depend on the market for information to guide us , but the market is giving us incomplete information , and as a result we are making bad decisions .
One of the best examples of this can be seen in the United States , where the gasoline pump price was around $ 3 per gallon in mid-2009 .
This reflects only the cost of finding the oil , pumping it to the surface , refining it into gasoline , and delivering the gas to service stations .
It overlooks the costs of climate change as well as the costs of tax subsidies to the oil industry , the burgeoning military costs of protecting access to oil in the politically unstable Middle East , and the health care costs of treating respiratory illnesses caused by breathing polluted air .
These indirect costs now total some $ 12 per gallon .
In reality , burning gasoline is very costly , but the market tells us it is cheap .
The market also does not respect the carrying capacity of natural systems .
For example , if a fishery is being continuously overfished , the catch eventually will begin to shrink and prices will rise , encouraging even more investment in fishing trawlers .
The inevitable result is a precipitous decline in the catch and the collapse of the fishery .
Today we need a realistic view about the relationship between the economy and the environment .
We also need , more than ever before , political leaders who can see the big picture .
And since the principal advisors to government are economists , we need either economists who can think like ecologists or more ecological advisors .
Otherwise , market behavior — including its failure to include the indirect costs of goods and services , to value nature ’s services , and to respect sustainable - yield thresholds — will cause the destruction of the economy ’s natural support systems , and our global Ponzi scheme will fall apart .

Fräulein Seeligers Gespür fürs existente Problem
von André F. Lichtschlag
Julia Seeliger , Bloggerin und Grünen - Politikerin , die sich eine politische Auszeit bei der „ taz “ als Schreibkraft gönnt , war so stolz auf ihre beiden ersten Artikel in der gedruckten Zeitung .
Schließlich hatte sie laut alarmgeschlagen und „ aufgedeckt “ , dass der stellvertretende Vorsitzende der Piratenpartei , Andreas Popp , der konservativen Wochenzeitung „ Jungen Freiheit “ ein Interview gegeben hatte .
Das war Autobahn , das geht doch nicht !
Doch dann kam alles furchtbar anders .
Statt der erwarteten politisch korrekten Empörungswelle auf allen Kanälen stellte sich plötzlich heraus , dass nicht nur der stellvertretende
Chef mit der „ JF “ gesprochen hatte , sondern gleich auch noch der erste Vorsitzende Jens Seipenbusch .
Klein - Julia kommentierte da noch trotzig : „ Unglaublich , wie dumm von denen ! “
Doch dieser Vorsitzende stand auch noch zu seinem Interview und findet selbst im Nachhinein nichts dabei .
Schlimmer noch , das Fußvolk der Piraten meuterte weit stärker gegen Julias Artikel als gegen die beiden vermeintlich so bösen Gespräche mit der Presse , an deren I nhalt nicht einmal Julia etwas auszusetzen hatte , außer , „ dass man das nicht tut “ .
Und dann kam es ganz schlimm für die junge Sittenwächterin , denn nicht nur bei Mitbloggern im Internet wurde Julia zum Gespött .
Selbst linke Profi-Kollegen begannen zu lästern .
Peter Mühlbauer etwa schrieb ausgerechnet im linksliberalen Online - Magazin „ Telepolis “ , der „ Text der Grünen - Politikerin Julia Seeliger in der ‚taz ’ “ mache „ ungewollt darauf aufmerksam , dass es Zensurextremisten nicht nur in der Union gibt “ .
Auch in der SPD , so Mühlbauer , „ schützten in der jüngsten Vergangenheit Politiker wie Sebastian Edathy und Brigitte Zypries immer öfter den Bequembegriff ‚rechts ’ vor , wenn es um die Rechtfertigung von Grundrechtseinschränkungen ging .
Das praktische an diesem Begriff ist , dass er in den letzten Jahren so inflationär verwendet wurde , dass sich mittlerweile politisch Unliebsames fast jeder Richtung mit ihm bedenken lässt . “
Der Piratenpartei rät Mühlbauer im einflussreichen Magazin des Heise - Verlages : „ Gerade angesichts von derart dreist zur Schau gestellter Dumm - und Grobheit wäre es keineswegs verabscheuungswürdig , wenn Grundrechtsschützer so viel Abstraktionsvermögen aufbringen , dass sie auch den eigenen Feinden das Recht auf Meinungs - und Redefreiheit nicht absprechen , sondern es stattdessen verteidigen – in jedem Medium , das ihnen die Möglichkeit dazu bietet . “
Und Mühlbauer steht nicht alleine .
Auch der Linksaußen - Autor und Journalist Jürgen Elsässer schreibt mit wuchtigen Worten gegen Seeligers Anmaßungen in der „ unvermeidlichen ‚taz ’ “ an : „ Ich habe fast zwei Jahrzehnte in linken Redaktionen gearbeitet und weiß , wie verheerend diese Gehirnfäule gewütet hat und immer weiter wütet . “
Auch Elsässers Rat an die Piraten ist eindeutig : „ Ihr müsst Euch nicht ducken und verteidigen !
Seid Ihr Piraten oder seid Ihr Memmen ?
Heraus mit dem Säbel – und dann die Angreifer an die Planken genagelt !
Oder schmeißt sie über die Reling – zurück in den politisch - korrekten Schlick , aus dem sie gekrochen kamen !
Denn eines dürft
Ihr nie vergessen : Die Antifaschisten , das seid Ihr !
Ihr kämpft doch gegen die neue Form des Faschismus , gegen den totalen Überwachungsstaat , gegen die Orwell - Diktatur , gegen Schäubles Stasi 2.0 – oder etwa nicht ? “
Der Kulturjournalist Torsten Uhrhammer darf ausgerechnet in der „ Jungen Freiheit “ mit einiger Berechtigung feststellen : „ Die von linken Gesinnungswächtern aufgestellten Ver- und Gebote “ werden plötzlich zunehmend „ in Frage gestellt und als das erkannt , was sie sind : Autoritäre Maßnahmen zur Sicherung der Machtfunktion . “
Während nämlich nur wenige Mainstreammedien über Popp und Seipenbusch herfielen , so Uhrhammer , „ ist der Rest des Netzes schon weiter und führt die eigentlich interessante Debatte .
Wer darf eigentlich mit wem worüber sprechen ?
Und wichtiger : Wer bestimmt das eigentlich und warum ? “
Die Piratenpartei beschreibt Uhrhammer sehr realistisch : „ Noch sind die Piraten nicht mehr als eine Ein-Thema - Partei mit lustigem Namen , der auch Spaß - Wähler in der Wahlkabine anzieht , deren parlamentarische Relevanz aber auch zukünfig mehr als ungewiss erscheint .
Was die Nerds aber draufhaben ist , dass sie schon auf dem Schulhof gelernt haben , sich nicht um die Bestimmer und deren Denk - und Kleidungsgebote zu kümmern .
So geschult , könnten sie sich auch den Bestimmern von links und deren Gedanken - und Sprechverboten entziehen . “
Arme Julia .
Da hat sie einiges angerichtet : Die Piratenpartei ist in aller Munde und wird bestärkt , für Meinungsfreiheit einzutreten .
Und , schlimmer noch , die linke kulturelle Hegemonie und ihre Ausgrenzungspolitik stehen plötzlich zur Diskussion .
Das hatte sie nicht gewollt !
Seither fand man kein
Wort mehr von ihr in der „ taz “ .
Denkt sie nach ?
Geht sie in sich ?
Oder haben die „ taz “ - Verantwortlichen ihr ganz antiautoritär eine journalistische Auszeit von der politischen Auszeit verordnet ?
Ihr letzter Kommentar auf ihrer eigenen Homepage lässt eher zweites vermuten : Ob des Gespräches von Politikern konkurrierender Parteien mit Zeitungen konkurrierender Verlage nämlich „ finde ich , dass man aufhören sollte , das offenbar existente Problem weiter zu relativieren . “
Internet
Jürgen Elsässer : „ Zieht die Säbel , Piraten ! “
Peter Mühlbauer : Freiheit des Andersdenkenden
Vorgeschichte : Die Piratenpartei , die „ taz “ und die „ Junge Freiheit “ : Jehova , Jehova !
Torsten Uhrhammer : Linker Trend : Nerds schubsen
Julia Seeliger : Die Freiheit nehm ich mir
I guess you could build a house with practically any material .
But I never thought you could actually build one from LEGO pieces .
So James May , a toy fanatic from the UK surprised me , by building a real house from one of my favorite toys as a child .
The two - story Lego palace is located in the middle of a vineyard and has a working bathroom .
James used bricks pieced together by 272 Legos .
Over three million bricks were used so that ’s about 816 million Lego pieces .
Quite an amazing job .

As Muslims , we are asked about the details of our personal lives , and our relationship to what happens on the global stage .
Because Islam does not have an official spokesperson , there is a relentless curiosity about our voices .
Almost like a horrible reality show , many scramble for the role of spokesperson .
Therefore , when a prominent Muslim scholar or figure makes a statement , it is not only interesting for non-Muslims to watch , but also for Muslims themselves .
Imam Tantawi , a prominent scholar within Egypt , has a track record for making incredibly polarizing religious rulings .
His position is not only religious , but also a political one .
In a recent visit to a girl ’s school , Tantawi met with a young woman who had covered her face with a niqab ( face veil ) in honor of his visit .
Tantawi scolded her , and spoke of issuing a fatwa against the niqab , calling it a cultural invention rather than a religious one .
The media coverage , including the response by bloggers , has created an interesting conversation .
Accompanied by photographs of women swathed in black , the primary focuses of debate has been upon the religious legitimacy of Tantawi ’s argument or the issue of choice .
There are two main interpretations of the incident .
There is the story of a brave young girl who stood up to a treacherous religious fraud , or that of a pious religious scholar standing up to an ominous and expanding population of blood - thirsty extremists .
In the BBC ’s coverage of the story , it claims the niqab has become “ increasingly popular with Egypt ’s Muslim radicals . ”
Egyptian officials are concerned with the rise in niqab because it is seen as a mark of ignorance .
Thus , the debate becomes about extremism , symbolism , and identity .
In oversimplifying the phenomenon of niqab , the real issue at hand is marginalized .
It is also interesting to look at these two perspectives while considering the hypocritical tendencies of Egypt ’s government , and ultimately , a contradictory attitude toward the way in which women dress .
What is most intriguing is an obsession with not only physical appearance , but a distortion of the purpose of covering .
If the purpose is to protect women , women should ultimately make the decision of how they feel safest .
The idea of sexual harassment is also completely ignored within this debate .
According to a study conducted by Egypt ’s Centre for Women ’s Rights , in 2005 , 82 % of women interviewed said that they had experienced sexual harassment .
Despite being conservatively dressed , women are still harassed , and the increased observances of niqab do not necessarily coincide with a heightened sense of religious extremism , but rather a growing feeling of discomfort for women .
Recently , the government passed out pamphlets at mosques to deter sexual harassment , attributing it to revealing clothing worn by women and unemployment .
Focusing the solution ( not to mention the blame ) on women dodges the real issue .
The real question is , what does the niqab symbolize that the hijab does not ?
If both aim to protect women within the realm of public spaces , what makes the niqab a more “ extreme ” expression of devotion ?
While the idea of niqab may be off - putting , the concept of hijab flourishes within Egypt .
In fact , recently there was a design competition held for hijabs .
In a report about the contest , one of the competition ’s panelists stated that she wanted to show that women could be “ beautiful ” while being pious .
Interesting that one still has to be “ beautiful ” to show that Islam is a modern religion .
A woman must balance not only piety , but also the burden of beauty and the appearance of chastity .
However , there seems to be a fine line between what is acceptably pious and what is considered “ too extreme . ”
Niqab and hijab come from some of the same cultural traditions , so why is Egypt willing to challenge the niqab , but not the hijab ?
Add to this the fact that a woman who is not veiled at all is thought to have been swept up in a tide of western decadence , and hijab becomes the middle - ground - mascot of Islam .
The problem at hand is not one of extremism , but actually one of Muslim women ’s representation .
While there may not be a correlation between the number of women wearing niqab and a rise in extremism , there is a correlation in the amount of pressure placed on women in the Islamic world to portray a certain image .
Why is it that piety can only be expressed through a specific clothing code ?
Who decides what piety looks like ?
Whether or not there is legitimacy in the niqab or hijab , women should be able to make these choices for themselves .
Enough orders and edicts from men , and enough hyper - focusing Muslim women ’s issues around a piece of fabric !
Why is this the determinant of the religious climate of a nation ?
Ultimately , all this push - and - shove about the niqab amounts to a mythical theological battle , and takes away from discussing women ’s place and their representation within the public sphere in Egypt .
Healthcare overhaul legislation moving through the Senate Finance Committee would put crucial rule - making authority in the hands of a private association of state insurance commissioners that consumer advocates fear is too closely tied to the industry .
The National Assn. of Insurance Commissioners currently writes model laws and regulations that individual states are free to accept or discard .
Under the bill by Sen. Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) , it would craft a model rule governing “ health insurance rating , issuance and marketing requirements ” that would become “ the new federal minimum standard without any further congressional action . ”
States would be permitted to deviate from the standards only by appealing to the Department of Health and Human Services .
In effect , the bill would allow the group to write many of the new rules on issuing and marketing insurance to millions of uninsured Americans who would be required to purchase policies .
“ The NAIC is clearly an organization that is dominated by the insurance industry , ” said California Lt. Gov. John Garamendi , a former state insurance commissioner .
Advertisement
“ I think the NAIC has an important role to play .
They have a lot of knowledge , but I would be concerned about giving them authority to set the rules . ”
The group ’s 56 members are public officials -- the elected or appointed chief insurance regulators of the states , the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories -- responsible for enforcing laws that vary widely in rigor depending on jurisdiction .
But the association itself is a private organization not subject to open meetings and public records law , noted J. Robert Hunter , insurance director of the Consumer Federation of America and a former Texas insurance commissioner .
“ They have no transparency , ” he said .
Advertisement
Sandy Praeger , insurance commissioner of Kansas and chairwoman of the National Assn. of Insurance Commissioners ’ healthcare committee , defended the association ’s proceedings as “ deliberative and open ” and brushed off concerns about its ties to insurers .
“ I do n’t view our position as too close to the industry , ” she said .
“ It ’s tapping existing expertise . ”
In giving rule - writing authority to the association , Baucus would avoid creating a new federal bureaucracy , potentially heading off a source of opposition to the bill .
A Senate Finance Committee aide said in an e-mailed statement that “ Sen . Baucus believes keeping all stakeholders at the table will result in passing the best bill possible , and he worked with the NAIC as well as a wide variety of other stakeholders . ”
Advertisement
A rival , costlier bill advanced by Rep. Henry A. Waxman ( D - Beverly Hills ) would establish a “ health choices ” commissioner ’s office .
Putting the rule - writing pen in the association ’s hands would be “ totally inappropriate , ” said the Consumer Federation ’s Hunter .
“ The NAIC is not accountable .
[ Federal lawmakers ] do n’t have any control over them . ”
Much of the criticism , particularly from consumer groups , stems from the departure of top association officials for plum industry jobs .
In 2004 , the president of the National Assn. of Insurance Commissioners quit midterm to head the Property & Casualty Insurers Assn. of America .
Advertisement
Last year , one official left to become chairman of Swiss Re America Holding Corp. , a division of global reinsurance giant Swiss Re. Another left to lead the Insured Retirement Institute , a Washington - based trade group that promotes the use of insurance in retirement portfolios .
Praeger said she saw benefits in such mobility .
“ I kind of look at it as seeding the industry with good regulators , ” Praeger said .

Update :
Thanks to the commenters on this blog and on Reddit , I 've got a much improved and more readable Haskell port of the spelling corrector .
On Wednesday I attended the StackOverflow DevDay in London , which was a day of excellent talks by engaging speakers .
Michael Sparks gave a talk on Python , where he built up Peter Norvig 's spelling corrector line by line as we watched .
I was impressed by how easy it was to understand the source code , and the style struck me as being particularly functional .
So , I was compelled to translate the Python source into Haskell .
This post is also a Literate Haskell program , meaning that you should be able to copy the text from the page , paste it into a .lhs file , and compile it .
Snippets starting with > are Haskell ; in between is Peter 's original program , and my commentary on the differences .
# Python region looks like this : import re , collections > --
Haskell region looks like this : > module Main where > > import Char > import qualified Data .
List as List > import qualified Data .
Map as Map > import qualified Data .
Set as Set > import Data .
Ord > import IO > import List
Every language needs some imports .
The Python program only has two ; we 're using a scattering of functions outside of the prelude ( Haskell 's standard library ) , so we need to import a bit more :
Char gives us toLower and isAlpha
gives us and Data .
List gives us foldl '
gives us Data .
Map gives us the Map type
gives us the type Data .
Set gives us the Set type
gives us the type Data .
Ord gives us the comparing function
gives us the function IO gives us isEOF
gives us List gives us maximumBy
def words ( text ) : return re.findall ( '[ a - z ] +' , text.lower ( ) ) > lowerWords = filter ( not . null ) . map ( map toLower . filter is Alpha ) .
words
The Haskell prelude already has a function called words , which splits a string by spaces .
filter is Alpha and filter ( not . null ) approximate the Python regular expression :
filter is Alpha drops all characters outside of a-z
drops all characters outside of a -z filter ( not . null ) excludes any empty strings ( such as sequences of numbers or punctuation in the original text )
def train ( features ) : model = collections.defaultdict( lambda : 1 ) for f in features : model[f ] += 1 return model > train = List.foldl ' ( \dict word -> Map.insertWith ' (+ ) word ( 1:: Int ) dict ) Map.empty
Haskell does n't need an explicit loop here : we use foldl ' to iterate over the list of words and add each one to a map .
The Map.insertWith ' function either inserts a value ( if missing ) , or extracts the existing value , applies it to a function , and inserts the result back in the map .
NWORDS = train ( words ( file ( ' big.txt ' ) .read ( ) ) ) > readNWORDS = readFile " big.txt " >>= return .
train .
lowerWords
A big difference in the Haskell version is that file I/O is encapsulated in an IO monad .
So whereas Python 's NWORDS variable is an actual dictionary , readNWORDS is a I / O value that , when executed , reads and parses a file and yields a dictionary .
alphabet = ' abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ' > alphabet = [ ' a ' .. ' z ' ]
I put a cheeky shortcut in the Haskell version .
( It makes no difference to the line count . )
def edits1 ( word ) : s = [ ( word [ : i ] , word [ i : ] ) for i in range ( len ( word ) + 1 ) ] deletes = [ a + b [ 1 : ] for a , b in s if b ] transposes = [ a + b [ 1 ] + b [ 0 ] + b [ 2 : ] for a , b in s if len ( b ) > 1 ] replaces = [ a + c + b [ 1 : ] for a , b in s for c in alphabet if b ] inserts = [ a + c + b for a , b in s for c in alphabet ] return set ( deletes + transposes + replaces + inserts ) > edits1 word = > let s = [ ( take i word , drop i word ) | i <- [ 0 .. length word ] ] > deletes = [ a ++ tail b | ( a , b ) <- s , not $ null b ] > transposes = [ a ++ b!!1 : b!!0 : drop 2 b | ( a , b ) <- s , not $ null b , not $ null $ tail b ] > replaces = [ a ++ c : tail b | ( a , b ) <- s , c <- alphabet , not $ null b ] > inserts = [ a ++ c : b | ( a , b ) <- s , c <- alphabet ] > in Set.fromList ( deletes ++ transposes ++ replaces ++ inserts )
The Haskell and Python versions of this function are fairly close .
The main differences :
Haskell uses the let ... in keywords to declare values
... keywords to declare values
List comprehension syntax is very similar , if you replace Python 's for and in with Haskell 's | and <- .
( Recurring theme : Haskell prefers symbols to keywords . )
and with Haskell 's and .
( Recurring theme : Haskell prefers symbols to keywords . ) [ start .. end ] is Haskell 's built - in range syntax .
It 's lazy , and generates elements only on demand , which means it 's fine to construct an infinite list like this : [ 1 .. ]

Remember Haskell 's strings are lists of characters , not arrays ( although see Data .
ByteString ) .

Python 's if keyword maps to different things depending on the context .
Here it 's used to ask ' is the string empty ? ' , and we replace it with the not and null functions .

Here it 's used to ask ' is the string empty ? ' , and we replace it with the and functions .
++ and : stand in for Python 's + operator , depending on whether we 're concatenating two lists ( a ++ b ) or pushing a single element onto the start of a list ( head : tail )
I 'm not totally convinced about the performance of the Haskell version , since take and drop are O ( N ) and not O ( 1 ) .
However , N is small here , being the length of a word .
If it 's a problem we could use ByteString instead for O ( 1 ) complexity at the price of having to copy strings .
def known_edits 2 ( word ) : return set ( e2 for e1 in edits1 ( word ) for e2 in edits1 ( e1 ) if e2 in NWORDS ) > known_edits2 knownWords = Set.unions .
Set.elems .
Set.map ( Set.intersection knownWords . edits1 ) .
edits1
Here I replaced the Python list comprehensions with Haskell 's built - in set functions .
We can't iterate directly over a set in Haskell , so if we used a list comprehension here , we'd to use elems to produce a list from the set and fromList to turn the result into a set again .
Here I feel that the Python version demonstrates the intent more clearly , which is to produce a set of edits from edit1 , then run those through edit1 again , and keep only the edits that turn out to be real words .
Read from right to left , what the Haskell version does is :
Produces a set of edits to a word using edit1
For each edit in the set , produce another set of edits using edit1 , and keep only those edits - of - edits that can be found in knownWords .
We now have a set of sets .
, and keep only those edits - of - edits that can be found in .
We now have a set of sets .
Turn a set of sets into a list of sets , using elems
Collapse that list of sets into a single set of words using unions
def known ( words ) : return set ( w for w in words if w in NWORDS ) > -- no Haskell equivalent
The known function actually disappears in the Haskell version .
Because it takes a set of known words instead of a map of word frequencies , it turns into a direct call to intersection lower down .
def correct ( word ) : candidates = known ( [ word ] ) or know n ( edits1 ( word ) ) or known_edits 2 ( word ) or [ word ] return max ( candidates , key=NWORDS.get ) > correct nwords word = > let knownWords = Map.keysSet nwords > candidates = Set.elems > $ head > $ filter ( not . Set.null ) > $ [ Set.intersection knownWords $ Set.singleton word , > Set.intersection knownWords $ edits1 word , > known_edits2 knownWords word , > Set.singleton word ] > in maximumBy ( comparing ( \w -> w ` Map.lookup` nwords ) ) candidates
Python has a magic short - circuiting or operator , which we have to fake by putting together a list of sets and finding the first non-empty one .
Because Haskell is lazy this does in fact short - circuit : for instance , we never make a call to known_edits 2 if we can already find word in knownWords .
I 'm not a fan of maximumBy in Haskell , which makes you compare two items yourself ; I prefer the Python version , which is similar to .
NET 's OrderBy function .
Here , though , the comparing function in Data .
Ord makes the code a little less verbose .
Finally , here 's a little command - line demo that corrects words the user types in .
It 's only at this point that the Haskell version touches the text file that the Python program encapsulates in the NWORDS variable ; the Haskell version passes the dictionary through each function that needs it .
I could have done a direct translation of the Python , but this would have meant writing most of the program as imperative IO monad code , which was n't really the point of the Haskell translation .
Okonomiyaki is a classic Japanese dish .
It is made out of batter and contains anything you want to add like vegetables , meat , seafood , and then topped with sauce and mayo , sprnkled with green nori and sometimes bonito flakes .
I was first introduced to it when I visited Japan in the 80’s and stayed with a family in Kanazawa - shi , Ishikawa - ken , home of Kenrokuen gardens .
It was described to me as a Japanese pancake .
I have also heard it called a Japanese pizza , but it really is unique and quite different to either a pancake or pizza .
While I am in Australia some of the foods from Japan I am missing are tonkatsu ( particularly from Wako ) , okonomiyaki ( from any store , anywhere ) and a decent umeboshi ( not from the convenience store ) .
Rice is easy to get in Australia and my family has a rice cooker so that is good news at least .
I remember traveling to Europe years ago and having to search for Japanese restaraunts just so I could eat some curry rice .
What Japanese food do you crave the most when not living in Japan ?

What if all the Large Hadron Collider 's recent woes are more than bad luck and technical problems ?
Two noted physicists speculate that the future may be pushing back on the LHC to avert the disaster of observing the Higgs boson .

The quest to observe the Higgs boson has certainly been plagued by its share of troubles , from the cancellation of the Superconducting Supercollider in 1993 to the Large Hadron Collider 's streak of technical troubles .
In fact , the projects have suffered such bad luck that Holger Bech Nielsen of the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen and Masao Ninomiya of the Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics in Kyoto wonder if it is n't bad luck at all , but future influences rippling back to sabotage them .
In papers like " Test of Effect From Future in Large Hadron Collider : a Proposal " and " Search for Future Influence From LHC , " they put forth the notion that observing the Higgs boson would be such an abhorrent event that the future is actually trying to prevent it from happening .
" It must be our prediction that all Higgs producing machines shall have bad luck , " Dr. Nielsen said in an e-mail message .
In an unpublished essay , Dr. Nielson said of the theory , " Well , one could even almost say that we have a model for God . "
It is their guess , he went on , " that He rather hates Higgs particles , and attempts to avoid them . "

Nielsen and Ninomiya recognize that the theory sounds pretty crazy and that other projects involving a lot of delicate technology — such as the Hubble Telescope — have gone through their own periods of apparent bad luck .
But their theory — wild as it is — is situated in current research in theoretical physics and time travel .
If the observation of the Higgs boson would result in calamity , they claim it is n't outside the realm of possibility that someone from our future might exert influence on our time to stop it :
While it is a paradox to go back in time and kill your grandfather , physicists agree there is no paradox if you go back in time and save him from being hit by a bus .
In the case of the Higgs and the collider , it is as if something is going back in time to keep the universe from being hit by a bus .
Although just why the Higgs would be a catastrophe is not clear .
If we knew , presumably , we would n't be trying to make one .

The Veterans ’ Administration should expect a high volume of Iraq veterans seeking treatment of post traumatic stress disorder , with researchers anticipating that the rate among armed forces will be as high as 35 % , according to the Management Insights feature in the current issue of Management Science , the flagship journal of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences ( INFORMS ® ) .
" Management Insights , " a regular feature of the journal , is a digest of important research in business , management , operations research , and management science .
It appears in every issue of Management Science .
The article “ A Dynamic Model for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Among U.S. Troops in Operation Iraqi Freedom ” is by Michael P. Atkinson of the Naval Postgraduate School and Adam Guetz and Lawrence M. Wein of Stanford University .
The tempo of deployment cycles in the Iraq War is higher than for any war since World War II , the authors write , and military survey data suggest that posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) is common among service members .
To assure ample mental health resources to care for returning troops , the authors argue that it is important for the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) to forecast the timing and number of new PTSD cases over the coming years , which is complicated by the fact that many cases have delayed onset .
The authors combine a dynamic mathematical operations research model with deployment data and PTSD data from the Iraq War , and estimate that the PTSD rate among Iraq
War veterans will be approximately 35 % , which is roughly double the rate from the raw survey data .
This doubling is due to the time lag between the PTSD - generating event and the onset of symptoms and to the fact that many surveyed troops will do subsequent deployments .
Consequently , the authors write , the VA system , which is already experiencing significant delays for PTSD treatment provision , urgently needs to ramp up its mental health resource capacity .

Given his support of the ascendancy of pirate culture , it should come as no surprise that Matt Mason began his career as a pirate .
“ I grew up in London , where pirate radio stations — which broadcast illegally or without a license , sometimes from offshore ships and oil rigs — were in abundance , ” he said in a recent telephone interview with strategy + business , “ and I was a DJ on pirate radio for many years .
So I always had this very different idea about what piracy meant and what piracy could be , and the kind of value it could add to society . ”
In Mason 's view , piracy has gone far beyond teenagers illegally downloading copyrighted music to become a part of our culture and a successful business model in its own right , one that legitimate businesses would do well to learn from .
Since his radio days , Mason completed a degree in economics and economic history at the University of Bristol in the U.K. , worked for Atlantic Records in the press department and in advertising at Saatchi & Saatchi , and then founded the urban music magazine RWD ( pronounced “ rewind ” ) .
His first book , The Pirate ’s Dilemma : How Youth Culture Is Reinventing Capitalism ( Free Press , 2008 ) , examines how interconnected cultural pursuits such as piracy , hip hop , remixing music to make new songs , graffiti , and open source have transformed how we think about using and reusing information .
Mason ’s premise :
Thanks in great part to the Internet , piracy is becoming more firmly established in our culture and economy .
Consequently , it is incumbent on every industry — not just media and entertainment — to come to terms with that reality or at least to try to understand how piracy delivers value , in order to compete with or perhaps even benefit from it .
S+B : In your book , you quote the co-chair of Disney as saying , “ Piracy is just another business model . ”
What does that mean ?
MASON : Look at the DVD pirates on Manhattan ’s Canal Street .
They release films on DVD for US $ 5 just as Hollywood releases the films in theaters .
That business model is in direct opposition to the way Hollywood set up the system .
Hollywood ’s model depends on exclusive release of films to theaters , followed months later by a DVD release .
Yet despite the activity of the pirates , the summer of 2007 was Hollywood ’s biggest ever , with movies taking in $ 4 billion at the box office .
That does n’t add up ; if piracy is such a problem , then you would think it would have a negative impact on the box office .
Hollywood has simply refused to acknowledge the idea of simultaneous release because they ’re so worried about the effect it will have on theater revenues .
But according to the evidence , movies in the theater and movies on DVD are two different products .
That tells me that if Hollywood accepted the presence of the pirates ’ business model , as Disney ’s co-chair seems to have , the movie companies could actually learn how to compete with them .
Every company is capable of having its business model turned upside down by piracy , but every business is also capable of competing with that model .
The people I refer to as pirates in the book are all people who use information in really unconventional ways .
So rather than thinking about how we can stop piracy , let ’s consider how we can come up with better ideas by thinking in the same way as the pirates .
S+B : You have said that there are going to be more and more instances of companies encouraging us to share , use , and disseminate information and content more freely .
But why should companies be willing to allow people to share ?
MASON : The kind of boundaries that used to exist in capitalism are breaking down .
Capitalism used to be about whoever owns the means of production calls the tune .
Now , it ’s about the quality of the ideas you produce .
It ’s about creativity .
That fact is causing a shift whereby companies are reluctantly starting to compete with piracy because they have to .
As more people do that , I believe the benefits of making content more freely available and working out other ways to make consumers pay for it are going to become more obvious .
But this shift wo n’t be easy .
Ten years ago , all of the major music labels knew they could sell music online , but they did n’t want to — it was n’t in their interest .
It took an outsider , Steve Jobs , to force the labels to act together and agree to do this .
But now , Jobs and iTunes are in the same boat .
A licensing model in which people were charged a small fee each time they listened to a song , for instance , would suddenly put iTunes in a much more competitive marketplace .
And the notion of licensing copyrighted material would disrupt a lot of other incumbents , even the new ones .
It would be really bad for Google , for example , which makes its money by collecting and disseminating other people ’s information and putting its own ads around it .
But in a licensing model , Google would have to pay for that information , too .
S+B : Have you tried to adopt content - sharing ideas in your own work ?
MASON : I ’m talking to my publishers about giving away a free e-book version of The Pirate ’s Dilemma , which I think would be a really great marketing strategy and would actually help us sell more physical copies of the book .
But they ’ve been very cautious about doing that because it ’s a huge change for them in terms of how they think about what they sell and what they do .
In fact , book publishing is a really good example of the pirate ’s dilemma .
From the author ’s point of view , the threat really is n’t piracy ; it ’s obscurity .
Two hundred thousand books are published every year , and the average book sells 500 copies .
Against those odds you need as many people reading your book as possible .
One of the best ways to do that is to give away an electronic copy in the hopes that people will read it and talk about it , and that it will generate a buzz that leads to the sale of physical copies .
When authors offer free versions of their books , one of two things typically happens .
Either people like the book and the pirate copy helps sell print copies or people do n’t like the book and so they do n’t pay to download it or buy the print version .
What is lost by downloading a free version of the book ?
Paulo Coelho , author of The Alchemist , recently said that he had been leaking his own books to BitTorrent ( a peer - to - peer downloading site ) behind his publisher ’s back , and that this had been helping him sell books .
He has since created a Web site where his books can be downloaded for free .
In Russia , after he made a Russian translation of The Alchemist available on his Web site , Coelho went from selling 1,000 physical copies of The Alchemist a year to selling 1 million copies of all of his books within three years .
Now he sells 10 million books a year in Russia .
S+B : Are there any industries that you believe are adapting well to the threat from piracy ?
MASON : Yes , the fashion industry .
In 2006 , Congress began considering extending copyright protection to fashions — which had never before been protected — to try and bring them more in line with European laws , which are designed to protect smaller companies from having their designs stolen immediately by large retailers .
Yet even during this reevaluation it was universally accepted that piracy is literally how the fashion industry innovates .
Because people are able to copy the 3 - D design of garments , they can create trends .
And because those trends can be disseminated so quickly and the new rapidly becomes old , we have seasons in fashion .
This allows the fashion industry to sell more clothes than if individuals could protect their designs for a long time and trends lasted a couple of years rather than a couple of months .
The problem now is that copying is happening so fast in fashion that people are losing sight of the original .
The legal question facing Congress was how to protect the small designer from the potential losses from the copying of their designs .
But what was so amazing to me was that everybody involved — the largest companies , the smallest designers , Congress itself — were all in agreement that the ability for people to be able to copy each other to a reasonable degree has to be preserved .
You never hear anything remotely like that in the movie or music industries , or in any other industry that involves intellectual property .
S+B : What makes the culture of piracy so effective ?
MASON : When you think about the effectiveness of piracy , you also have to consider the impact of remix culture and the open source movement .
All three are based on sharing and , ultimately , they ’re more powerful than most intellectual property laws because they operate in the public domain , which is indefinable and mutable .
The public domain may be defined legally , but where it begins and ends must be viewed culturally .
For example , most remixes fall on the wrong side of copyright laws because they involve pirated samples , film clips , music clips , designs , and trademarks that are mashed up and reused .
And the average person in the U.S. , even if he or she does n’t illegally download music or movies , violates copyright laws so many times a day , according to John Tehranian , a law professor at the University of Utah , that if he or she were sued for just one day ’s worth of violations , the damages would amount to about $ 12.45 million .
It involves everything from forwarding an e-mail with another e-mail or a photo attached to taking a photograph with a TV on in the background .
All these activities are technically illegal .
But humans are copying machines .
We learn by imitating one another .
That ’s how we learn to speak .
That ’s how we learn social norms .
That ’s how culture happens .
Everything we do is an invitation to copy .
And now , thanks to digitization and the Internet , we can express that in ways that we could n’t before .
The Internet is the ultimate copying machine , and it ’s affecting many business models .
There are times when piracy is a great idea and there are times when it ’s not ; that ’s why I call it a dilemma .
The point is , though , it is not a dead end .
It ’s in the interest of all who deal with the buying and selling and sharing of ideas to confront piracy and its implications now — that is , to reevaluate their business models so they include ways to capitalize on a freer flow of ideas and on more sharing of information and content .

I was going to write ‘ Keep Howard ’s hands off my game ’ as the headline .
But rugby league has n’t been my game for decades .
This is not because I have rejected it .
I have been a Dragons supporter since I was two years old and 54 years later still am one .
It is because the game has been stolen from me , and the millions of others who play or follow it .
The game is about money for big business now , not ordinary workers .
It ’s all about profit , not people .
The commodification of sport over the last forty years has mirrored the decline in profit rates as the long post war boom ended .
The new colonialists – in Australia people like Kerry Packer in cricket – searched within existing society for new areas from which to extract profit .
While entertainment adds no extra value , Packer and others got in first and diverted profit to themselves at the expense of other industries .
Much of this commodification of sport was also linked to television , so that the profit comes not from attendance at the games but from advertising during the telecast .
Rugby League in Australia is a minority sport .
It dominates in Queensland and New South Wales , although Australian Rules , Soccer and Rugby Union are serious competitors at varying times and to varying degrees to its dominance .
In the mid-1990s another media mogul – Rupert Murdoch – tried to do a Packer to Rugby League in Australia .
The game split into two competitions .
Neither was tenable in the long term and the two sides – News Ltd and the Australian Rugby League backed by Packer - formed an alliance , with TV rights shared between Packer ’s channel 9 and Murdoch ’s part - owned Fox Sport ( but more Packer than News ) .
The relationship is an uneasy one , and if we throw in each of the 16 clubs and the state and country leagues , the result is a messy administrative structure for the game .
It is , to use a quote from Lenin , a Thieves ’ Kitchen .
This just means that all the thieves sit around the table discussing how to rob the rest of us , and thinking if and how they can rob each other .
This structure of entrenched factionalism has made decision making difficult .
So now some sections within the sport are floating the idea that former Liberal ( Conservative ) Prime Minister John Howard head a new administrative body to run rugby league .
Let me get this right .
The biggest factional player in the Liberal Party over the last 35 years is being appointed to .. overcame factionalism in rugby league .
I am not a Howard - hater .
He at least is honest about his ruling class politics , unlike Labor .
In power he was of course deceitful , underhand , mendacious , mean - spirited , racist and completely untrustworthy .
But we knew that .
But to put this arch apologist for capital in charge of the working class game ( or what was a working class game ) is a travesty .
For a start Howard ’s treatment of aboriginal people when he was a Prime Minister was a disgrace .
With him in charge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders might just decide Rugby League is not the game for them .
If Rugby League needs a new group to administer it – like a Napoleon managing capitalism in the interests of capital , not particular capitalists – then let it come from the players and supporters , not the ruling elite .
And let it be democratic , not dictatorial .
That wo n’t happen and instead we could end up with the most divisive politician in Australia in years running our game in the interests of the bosses , not us .
His Workchoices laws were an attack on ordinary working people for the ruling class .
His management of rugby league will be the same – for the big businesses that run the sport , not the supporters or players .
Do n’t let John Howard workchoice rugby league .
Let ’s organise now to stop him destroying our game .
A political earthquake is rumbling in the Central Valley over water , and it could cause a real tsunami for the Democrats in the 2010 elections if they do n't handle it well .
That 's the message I 'm getting from my Blue Dog Democrat friends in farm country .
Rep. Jim Costa , D - Hanford ( Kings County ) , told me unemployment in his district is running at 35 to 45 percent .
The once - fruitful federal farm subsides are drying up and so is the water , with people blaming the Democrats on both counts .
The perception is that folks like Rep. George Miller , D - Martinez , and environmental activists are orchestrating a policy out of Washington that says " yes " to water for the delta smelt and " no " to water for crops .
Anger over putting fish before jobs in these lean times is running as strong as any anti-war , anti-Enron feeling we had up here in the Bay Area during the Bush years .
Not only could the fish fight lead to a split within the Democratic Party , it could also be just the issue Republicans are looking for when the environmentalists ' best friend in the Senate , Barbara Boxer , faces re-election in 2010 .
Speaking of the 2010 races , I called Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Campbell to invite him to the Willie Brown Institute breakfast Nov. 3 .
He was at a Denny 's somewhere in the valley , having breakfast with a would - be supporter .
" Now let me understand this , " I said .
" You 're in a Denny 's for a one - on - one ?
How important can that person be if you 're in Denny's ? "
I had to compliment him , however .
Whatever you think of Tom 's politics , he is the only candidate for governor who has clearly spelled out his agenda for the state .
The rest are still talking in feel - good generalities .
I took a walk through downtown Thursday night and once again was reminded what a fascinating city San Francisco is .
I started off down around the Embarcadero , where there were more homeless than I could have imagined camping under the freeway ramps .
But they were all arranged in order , as if they were condo owners or something .
Over on Market Street , where the brick sidewalks were still wet from being washed and reflecting the light , I struck up conversations with security guards and the like .
All the while I kept my cell phone open - just in case .
As I passed by two ladies of the night , one asked me , " Who you talking to ? "
" My buddy at Central Station , " I replied , and with that they were gone .
I do n't know about you , but I 've absolutely had it with this laptop business .
I was leaving the restaurant at W recently and there were four people having breakfast at a table , each one with a laptop .
I went into Starbucks and everyone in the place was staring at computer screens .
Not one soul was talking .
It was as if they were all isolating themselves from the outside world .
I decided to sit next to one guy and see what he was looking at .
He was n't checking anything .
There was not a damn thing on that screen .
The new hot spot has opened , or should I say reopened .
It 's the Quince on Pacific at Montgomery .
It is at least twice the size of the old one , but the food and service are as impeccable as ever , right down to the marble butter dishes .
As I told the owner , Lindsay Tusk , " You did the ultimate remodel .
You have a new house in an old kitchen . "
Dick Blum was there working the place , as if he were the politician in the family .
I got into a cab the other night and the first thing the driver wanted to talk about was Mayor Gavin Newsom naming his baby Montana .
" It could have been a lot worse for the little girl , " the cabbie said .
" He could have picked Idaho . "
Is the Last Emperor coming to town ?
ESPN Chicago reports :
“ The mixed martial arts promotion Strikeforce is in talks with Illinois ’ athletic commission to sanction its Nov. 7 bout featuring Fedor Emelianenko , according to sources close to the negotiations .
The bout , which will be nationally televised by CBS , would be held at the Sears Centre in Hoffman Estates .
A decision from the commission could come as soon as Friday . ”
The Sears Centre has hoted MMA events before .
Adrenaline has been there , as has the IFL .
It ’s a solid venue for the event .
It ’s a fairly new building , easily accessible , no downtown traffic to worry about it and plenty of parking .
Needless to say that we will be all over this story .
The bigger question : will other local media ?
We worked for a local TV station when the IFL was here in May of 2007 and we did a piece on it .
Most recently CLTV ( local cable news ) did a piece on Chicago cop Mike Russow and his UFC debut victory .
But when Anderson Silva was in Chicago fighting at UFC 90 in October of 2008 , the local media gave it a huge collective yawn .
If Fedor comes to town for a nationally - televised bout , will their be any coverage ?
We know of one place there will be local coverage : CBS .
That ’s who will be televising the Strikeforce event .
There are many obstacles to taking action on climate change .
Most of those obstacles have deep roots : there are powerful interest groups that do n’t want market prices to reflect true costs , and there are ideologues — financially supported by these interest groups — who do n’t want to admit that sometimes the government has to intervene .
But there ’s also , it seems , growing opposition to cap - and - trade from people who should be on the side of progress — but whose reaction is basically “ Eek ! Markets !
Wall Street !
Speculation ! Bad ! ”
We do n’t need this .
So let me talk a bit about why this reaction is 99 % wrong , and bad for the planet .
Any time you have a market , there ’s some opportunity for speculation .
Even if the good being traded is n’t storable , there may be a futures market , so you can bet on the future price .
If the good is storable , the spot price may be moved by the futures market , since high futures prices may provide an incentive for stockpiling .
For example , the fact that wheat is traded means that there ’s also a wheat futures market ; and because wheat can be stored , futures prices affect spot prices .
So , should fear of speculation lead us to ban trading in wheat ?
Nobody would say that .
Yes , sometimes speculators will get it wrong — but the advantages of having a wheat market vastly overshadow the possible harm that may sometimes come from speculation .
Now substitute “ emission permits ” for wheat .
It ’s exactly the same story .
Why should you address it any differently ?
Yet as Joe Romm tells us , Sen. Byron Dorgan — who I suspect kind of favors allowing the market in wheat to operate — warns against cap and trade because it would offer too many opportunities to the “ Wall Street crowd . ”
And that same line is , unfortunately , being echoed by a number of progressives .
This is really bad — it ’s not a case of the perfect being the enemy of the good , it ’s a case of the perfect being an enemy of the planet .
But wait — do n’t we have examples of energy markets being manipulated by speculators ?
Yes — but the proposed cap - and - trade system would NOT reproduce the conditions of those markets .
The prime example of an energy market gone bad is the western electricity market in 2000 - 2001 ; and let me say that I have some moral authority here , since I called it when it was happening .
That was the real thing — but what made it possible was a combination of at least two factors .
First , the demand for electricity was highly unresponsive to prices ; second , the relevant markets were fairly small ( northern and southern California were isolated both from the outside world and from each other by transmission bottlenecks ) .
In the case of emission permits , demand will probably be quite responsive to prices — and the market will , as Joe Romm says , be huge .
What about the 2008 surge in commodity prices ?
Actually , I ’m still of the view that speculation did n’t drive that episode — a view backed by serious research .
But even if you think that there was a speculative bubble , would that lead you to propose shutting down the market for crude oil ?
By all means keep a watchful eye on speculators and regulate derivatives — and make market manipulation illegal , as Waxman - Markey does .
But do n’t apply standards to emissions trading that you do n’t apply to any other market .
The solution to climate change must rely to an important extent on market mechanisms — it ’s too complex an issue to deal with using command - and - control .
That means accepting that some people will make money out of trading — and that yes , sometimes trading will go bad .
So ?
We ’ve got a planet at stake ; it ’s crazy to cut off our future to spite Goldman Sachs ’s face .
First the government went after Ruth ’s shoes .
Then it was Bernie ’s “ tasteful ” Montauk pad .
Now they 're are now going after the offspring .
The two Madoff sons as well as the fraudster ’s brother , who ’ve all had it pretty sweet so far all things considered , will soon be facing civil charges from the court - appointed trustee .
The trustee , Irving Picard , is seeking $ 50 million , including $ 30 million in loans , CBS News reports .
He also wants Mark , Andrew , and Peter to unveil all their assets , including a $ 6.5 million Nantucket house one of the sons bought in cash with money directly transferred in June of 2008 from the bank account of Bernie Madoff Investment Securities .
The brothers are still standing by the “ we knew - nothing - we - are - the - ones - who - turned - him - in ” argument , but this latest move might prove otherwise .
NEW DELHI : The Maharaja witnessed his first in - flight Mughal - e - Azam at 30,000 feet above sea level on Saturday , as two members of the cabin crew���one male and one female���slugged it out with the pilot and co-pilot .
( Watch Video )
Endangering the lives of 106 passengers and grossly violating safety norms , the airline staffers came to blows in the cockpit and galley of the Indian Airlines Airbus A - 320 as the aircraft cruised over Pakistan en route to Delhi via Lucknow from Sharjah .
The cabin-vs - cockpit tiff originated on the ground in Sharjah itself and then turned into a full - blown fight once IC 884 took off soon after midnight .
The cabin crew alleged that pilots harassed a 24 - year - old female colleague who later filed a molestation complaint against them with the cops after the flight landed in Delhi .
The pilots , on the other hand , accused a male flight purser of misconduct that seriously compromised flight safety , and said the accusation of molestation aimed to protect the complainant 's purser friend�� �who has a commercial pilot licence ( CPL ) ���from facing action .
No party denied that blows and abuses were exchanged as bewildered passengers looked on .
Sources said that the female cabin crew member and the co-pilot sustained bruises .
Confirming the in - flight fight , Air India said it had ordered an inquiry and had grounded the staff members involved .
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation has also ordered a probe .
There were unconfirmed reports that at one stage the cockpit was unmanned , as the crew was busy fighting outside .
Things allegedly degenerated to the point where the captain threatened to divert the plane to Karachi , likening the situation , sources said , to a " hijack " .
In Sharjah , the cabin crew went to meet Captain Ranbir Arora and co-pilot Aditya Chopra for the pre-flight briefing .
Both sides give different versions of what happened after this .
The cabin crew lobby said that after the initial tension on the ground in Sharjah , when the woman crew member went into the cockpit , one of the pilots held her hand and then pushed her out of the cockpit .
" She hit the cockpit door with such force that she started bleeding .
When Amit Khanna , the purser , saw her in this condition , he went to the cockpit to ask what was happening .
At this point , the pilots got abusive and started a fight with him , " said a representative of the IA cabin crew , who added that the actual fight took place on the Lucknow - Delhi segment .
Pilot sources claimed that despite his CPL , Khanna could not get a pilot 's job due to the downturn .
" The airhostess had announced flying time from Sharjah to Lucknow as per the schedule , and not the actual one that the commander gives .
After taking off , the pilot scolded the airhostess and then called Amit to the cockpit , " said a source .
Khanna , the source added , entered the cockpit angrily and that 's when the fight started .
" He became abusive , and tempers ran high in the cockpit .
Given the highly unsafe situation there , the commander said he would divert to Karachi , to which Amit retorted , ' Jahan le jaana hai , le jaao , is aircraft ko main bhi uda loonga ( take it wherever you want to , I can also fly ) ' , " a pilot representative said , adding that the fight occurred over Pakistan , while the plan was flying from Sharjah to Lucknow .
The woman crew member , the source explained , got bruised when she entered the cockpit in the melee .
The cockpit was cleared , with pilots pushing out Amit and then locking the door .
After that , the plane landed in Lucknow at around 4.30 am .
" Amit then apologized to the pilots , and they took off for Delhi so that the flight was n't delayed .
He later got the woman crew member to level charges of molestation to avoid action for making a hostile entry into the cockpit , " said a source speaking on behalf of the pilots .
The police are investigating the woman 's complaint and have registered a case against the pilot and co-pilot .
" There are several eyewitnesses and we are recording their statements , " said joint CP ( operations ) Satyendra Garg .
The police had the victim examined at Safdarjung Hospital , where her bruises were confirmed .
A case was registered , among others , under Section 354 for outraging the modesty of a woman .
The DGCA is fuming at the gross violation of safety norms on IC 884 .
" The airline did n't even inform us of this incident in time .
We 're going to summon the crew members on Monday .
This incident is shocking and we may need to take exemplary action , " said a senior official .

Frank Miller ’s
The Dark Knight Returns played a major part in introducing mature themes to mainstream comic books .
Trust me , comics needed that .
Up to this point comics mostly focused on silly ideas such as needle - spitting cacti and Green Arrow ’s sidekick becoming addicted to heroin .
With this graphic novel however , comics finally became bold enough to explore the really challenging issues ( which reminds me — stay tuned this week for a very poignant story about Sinestro ’s love of yellow leading him to water sports ) .
Now that comic books have become a respectable format for dramatic storytelling , it ’s only natural that we do the same to picture books .
After all a picture book is sort of like a comic book for young readers .
By using them to communicate important issues , we ’ll be able to teach our children about the violence , crime , and weird fetishes they need to know about .
After all , how can you truly love someone if you do n’t eat their poop ?
I figure it wo n’t be long until we ’ll see mature re-imaginings of our favorite picture books .
To that end , I ’ve gone ahead and rewritten bits from three classic picture books to give you an idea of what to expect .
Feel free to read this with your children , and be prepared to use props to explain concepts they may not understand like “ pimp ” and “ Myspace angle ” .
Clifford ’s Good Deeds
It ’s been happening for a while now .
Major criminals in the underworld are suddenly found dead , buried underneath a pile of shit so big that even Aunt Myrtle would have second thoughts about chowing down .
Someone , something , was cleaning up the city .
What though ?
Emily Elizabeth had no clue — and at four in the morning , she was too shit - faced to care .
She was driving to the scene of the crime when she realized she had brought last night ’s date with her — a now empty bottle of Jack Daniel ’s , laid to bare on the passenger seat .
She gave it a glance , a “ what - the - fuck - are - you - looking - at ” kind of glance , and pulled a fresh toothpick out of her shirt pocket .
Trying to quit smokes was hell on high water , but with the patch and the wood she ’d live to tell the tale .
She spat the old ‘ pick over at the bottle and slid the new one between her teeth .
She saw Charley standing by the pile even as she parked .
Only the street lamps and whirling red-and - blue of the fuzz ’s cars lit him up .
Otherwise , he was so black that she ’d lose him in a licorice factory .
“ Hey , ” Emily Elizabeth said as she walked up to the latest victim .
“ When did they find him ? ”
“ Thirty minutes ago , ” Charley said .
“ Who called it in ? ”
“ Every old lady on the block who smelled shit all at the same time . ”
Charley took a bite out of his massive beef sandwich .
Even now , the asshole was eating something greasy .
“ Looks like our vigilante has struck again . ”
“ He ’s a fuckin ’ criminal , ” Emily Elizabeth said .
“ When I catch him I ’ll let him know that you do n’t shit on people in my city .
Not until you ’ve been paid by the manager . ”
She pinched the toothpick with two fingers and looked at the sandwich again .
“ How the hell can you eat and look at that thing at the same time ?
It ’s disgusting . ”
“ I ’ve seen worse . ”
“ ‘ Nam , Gulf War , Desert Storm … I should ’ve figured . ”
“ Jake should ’ve figured that he was n’t playing fuckin ’ Nerf tag , ” Charley said .
“ That was war .
All my life I ’ve been at war and I never had a chance to rest .
Jake did .
And look what happened to him . ”
“ Best toy store in the city , ” Emily Elizabeth said .
“ I buy doll clothes from him all the time . ”
“ Yeah . ” Another sloppy bite .
“ In any case , it looks like the mayor ’s gettin ’ some help to clean up this city once and for all . ”
“ If you ’re gonna fight crime , ” Emily Elizabeth said , “ do it the right way .
Kill ’em , burn ’em , stick ’em in an ice box , and ship it to Alaska where you paid a bunch of Eskimos to throw harpoons at him until he falls into a pool full of rare Alaska tiger sharks .
This ?
This is too far . ”
Charley finished his wrapper and bundled it up , sliding it into his pocket to throw away later .
“ So what do you want to do ? ”
“ Book it , ” Emily Elizabeth said .
“ When I ’ve got time I ’ve got a few leads to look into .
Tony Morocco , Vince the Shitter — there ’s also this dog named Clifford who ’s two stories tall and eats seven hundred pounds of dog food a day . ”
“ Does he like to fetch the frisbee ? ” Charley asked .
“ That and a side of bacon . ” Emily Elizabeth signed off with two fingers and a little salute .
“ I ’ll see you later with whatever I can find .
I need some sleep ; I gotta get to school in a few hours . ”
“ What ’re you learnin ’ today ? ” Charley asked .
Emily Elizabeth stopped walking away for a moment , looked over her shoulder at him .
“ Fractions .
God damn fractions . ”
If You Give a Mouse a Cookie
If you give a mouse a cookie , he ’s gonna want something to wash it down .
You figure he wants milk , but no , he does n’t want that — he wants the bourbon in your cabinet .
At this point you ’re not reading too much into it .
He ’s just a mouse and you figure he ’ll do something funny like on Tom and Jerry .
You hate cats and want them to die so you think this is the hookup if he gets what he wants .
You give him the shot .
He washes it down and takes a big look around , and then he says that he wants your kitchen .
You ’d like to give it to him , sure , but you can ’t .
It ’s a kitchen .
It ’s a part of your house , part of the whole housing package .
If you give it away the old maid would never stop bitching about it .
Not like it would n’t be a change from her current bitching though .
The bitching would just jump circuits — Channel 3 local news bitching to Channel 60 big breaking news bitching .
You have to admit it ’d add variety .
But you need the kitchen .
You tell him that — sorry , he ca n’t have the kitchen .
He figures okay , it ’s cool .
Kitchens are n’t exactly free , so fair enough .
So instead he asks to borrow a knife .
God only knows why he wants a knife , but you figure you need to keep making him happy .
Maybe it ’s to slice that cat in half , and both pieces will flop apart like rubber .
That ’d be really funny right now .
So you give him the knife , and when he holds it against your neck you realize that something is n’t quite right .
You ask him what ’s wrong , and he says that he ’s going to get what he deserves ; that mice have to scavenge whatever they can unlike humans who can get all the big , human - sized food and things they want because they ’re the only ones who know where money grows .
You say that money does n’t work like that .
He says that money knows when to shut up , and he smacks you .
Then he says that he ’s had enough handouts from people with cookies , and that he ’s going to take matters into his own hands .
He says that he ’s going to kill you and take your place so he can enjoy what you have .
You tell him that he ’s a mouse and everyone would notice .
He says that he ’d keep your body around , but he ’d just control it from a distance .
Maybe with some kind of pulley system or something , he has n’t really thought it out that much , but after he ’s killed you then he ’d have a brainstorm session .
Now while he ’s distracted you see your chance .
You hit the knife away and wrestle the mouse for the fate of the kitchen .
This takes about six seconds before you kill him with a body slam , because he ’s a mouse and you ’re like ten million mouses overweight compared to him .
Now he ’s dead and you ’ve got blood all over your shirt , and it ’s going to be very hard to explain this to the old maid when she gets home .
Then again , it ’s hard to talk to her at all before she starts bitching about everything under the sun .
That ’s why the sun sets , you know .
To get away from all the bitching .
He and the moon take shifts so someone can get some relief .
So that ’s the lesson here .
Do n’t give mice cookies .
Or knives — you probably should n’t give them knives either .
That ’s a high entry on the list of things you should n’t do .
Arthur ’s Eyes
“ Hey . ”
Arthur looked up .
It was Buster .
Arthur pulled aside the bagged bottle of whiskey , and Buster sat down on the now empty park bench space .
“ How ’s it going ? ” Buster asked .
“ It ’s okay , ” Arthur said .
They watched the children swing .
“ Have n’t seen you around in a while , ” Buster finally said .
“ Anything wrong ? ”
“ Everything ’s wrong , ” Arthur said .
“ Ever since I got them , everything ’s gone wrong . ”
“ The glasses ? ” Buster asked .
“ The glasses . ”
“ They do n’t look so bad on you . ”
“ Bullshit . ”
Arthur took a swig .
“ Everyone hates them .
Ever since I got them I ’ve been getting shit from everyone .
Everyone ’s calling me names like ‘ four - eyes , ’ saying things like ‘ Why is n’t your nose as big as other aardvarks ? ' ”
“ Even Francine ? ” Buster asked .
“ Even Madame Bitch herself . ”
“ Why do n’t you just ignore them ? ”
“ Buster , we ’re in the fucking third grade , ” Arthur snapped .
“ I ca n’t just blow them off . ”
“ You ’re right .
I ’m sorry .
I forgot how serious this is . ”
Arthur buried his face in his hands .
“ I do n’t know what to do , man .
I ca n’t go back .
Not if they ’re gonna be there . ”
Buster rested a hand on Arthur ’s shoulder .
“ You gotta face them soon .
We ’re having pizza and milkshakes on Thursday .
You ca n’t miss that . ”
“ You ’re right .
I fucking love milkshakes . ”
Arthur sniffed loudly , drawn out .
“ But … I do n’t know if I ’m strong enough . ”
“ You have to be , ” Buster said .
“ Ever since your sister passed away , you have to be the one to carry the Read name .
You ca n’t do that if you ’re weak . ”
“ If only I told her what rabies were before she rode that pony , ” Arthur muttered .
“ If only I shot that damn pony .
She would ’ve gotten over it .
I could ’ve just shown her lolcats .
They ’re just as cute . ”
“ I know . ”
Children slid down the slide , and they both wanted to join them .
They could n’t .
That was a baby ride .
And , if anything , they were n’t babies anymore .
“ I ’ll do it , ” Arthur finally said .
He stood , took one last drink , and tossed the bottle into the nearby recycling bin .
“ I ’ll do it , but you have to help me out .
I wo n’t do it alone . ”
“ You wo n’t be alone , ” Buster said .
“ I promise . ”
“ Thanks , ” Arthur said .
Buster stood and they briefly embraced .
“ Come on .
Let ’s go work on our book .
I want to write a scene where a ninja flies in on a dragon and burns a village of evil peasants . ”
“ Sure . ”
“ And all the peasants are wearing glasses . ”
“ Whatever you want , buddy . ”
This episode reminded me why I love NCIS so much .
There was a solid blend of humor and deadly seriousness that is unprecedented in any crime procedural out there .
I also liked how the formula can be shifted a bit to created a great episode .
After Ziva 's capture , we all expected her to be the prisoner in the opening , but no , it 's Tony !
The narrative is told by Tony to the same terrorist that interrogated Ziva .
He uses a truth serum on Tony was recaps the past few months .
I liked how there was still a backdrop crime to be solved albeit the simplest thing ever .
Gibbs lets
Tony look for replacements , most of which do n't work out .
Tony , McGee , and Abby track down the terrorists through an unlikely source : Caf - Pow .
The plan is for Tony and McGee to go to the region .
When they get there , they get captured inexplicably by the same person who captured Ziva .
The big kicker is when the terrorist tries to get Tony to spill secrets by bringing out Ziva who everyone thinks is dead .
She wants to sacrifice herself , so Tony and McGee wo n't die , but everyone lives after Gibbs and a special forces team saves them .
Excellent acting by Cote de Pablo and Michael Weatherly and the dialogue between them felt very real .
Hopefully we 'll learn more of what happened to Ziva as the season progresses , and from the promo for next week , all is not well at NCIS .

Liz Cheney , daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney , told Fox News ’ Chris Wallace that President Barack Obama should not travel to Oslo in December to accept the Nobel Prize .
Cheney called the prize a “ farce ” that could only be legitimized if the family of a US military member accepted it .
“ I think the president himself understands he did n’t earn this prize and therefore the notion that this White House has said he would go to Oslo to accept the prize would add to the farce , ” said Cheney .

She offered the following proposal : “ I think what he ought to do , frankly , is send the mother of a fallen American soldier to accept the prize on behalf of the US military .
Frankly , to send the message to remind the Nobel committee that each one of them sleeps soundly at night because the US armed forces , because the US military is the greatest peacekeeping force in the world today . ”
It should come as no surprise that neoconservative columnist Bill Kristol disagrees with the Nobel committee .
He responded to the award with sarcasm .
“ It ’s hard for me to be objective about this because I ’m so disappointed personally , ” he said .
“ I was up early Friday morning .
I thought the phone might ring , you know .
Pundits for peace .
I deserve it pretty much .
President Obama and I have done about the same amount to bring about world peace , I think . ”

So much of the wailing and gnashing of teeth around the climate bill in Congress revolves around the costs of curbing greenhouse - gas emissions .
What about the benefits ?
That is , seemingly everybody — the Environmental Protection Agency , the Congressional Budget Office , the Energy Information Administration , not to mention private - sector lobbies — has tried to tally how much it will cost to nudge America toward cleaner energy and fewer greenhouse - gas emissions .
None have sought to figure out what kind of benefits the bill could ...

Just because the 2009 season has not officially wrapped up does not mean that it ’s too early to start looking towards 2010 .
First up in our early positional rankings are the catchers , so let ’s get right to it and take a look at the Top 15 ( keep in mind that these are going to be fluid throughout the offseason based on news , transactions and further research ) :
Joe Mauer – Minnesota Twins Brian McCann – Atlanta Braves Victor Martinez – Boston Red Sox Ryan Doumit – Pittsburgh Pirates Miguel Montero – Arizona Diamondbacks Jorge Posada – New York Yankees Kurt Suzuki – Oakland Athletics Matt Wieters – Baltimore Orioles Mike Napoli – Los Angeles Angels Bengie Molina – San Francisco Giants Geovany Soto – Chicago Cubs Buster Posey – San Francisco Giants A.J. Pierzynski – Chicago White Sox Russell Martin – Los Angeles Dodgers Chris Iannetta – Colorado Rockies
Thoughts :
Jorge Posada not only has the advantage of playing in the new Yankees Stadium , but it is expected that he is going to spend a decent amount of time as the DH next season .
That should offer him additional opportunities to contribute and with his renaissance 2009 campaign he ’s going to be among the top catcher ’s off the board .
Kurt Suzuki is among the biggest surprises behind the plate in 2009 and his numbers appear in line for an improvement next season .
He hardly ever strikes out ( 10.3 % ) , which helped him to his .272 average despite a .281 BABIP .
Assuming improved luck , if he gets any additional power to go along with his stolen base potential , he could propel himself among the top catchers in the league .
Ryan Doumit or Miguel Montero ?
That ’s going to be an interesting debate later on in the offseason .
In Bengie Molina , a lot of use value is going to depend on where he ends up .
We ’ll have to monitor his situation closely .
Maybe Wieters is a bit too high , but he ’s shown signs these past few weeks of just how good he could be .
Through Monday he was hitting .360 with 3 HR , 14 RBI and 13 R in September .
We all know how bad Geovany Soto was this season , but we ’ve also seen how good he could be .
He had little luck ( .251 BABIP ) and the power still showed signs of being present .
He ’s a risk , but one I ’d be willing to take .
Will Tyler Flowers get some time behind the plate , eating into A.J. Pierzynski ’s playing time ?
That certainly plays a role in his current ranking , but more light will be shed on it as the offseason progresses .
Yes , right now Buster Posey is ranked as # 12 and I hope everyone learned from Matt Wieters struggles this season not to reach to high for Posey .
If Molina does leave , Posey ’s stock may rise a bit , or it could easily fall as well if Molina ends up resigning .
He ’s certainly a player of interest in the coming months , and one we will be profiling in detail .
What are your thoughts on the early rankings ?
Who is too high ?
Who is too low ?
Who was omitted that should n’t have been ?

‘ So much for change , ’ ‘ Hitler ’ says in video
After calls from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the president of the National Jewish Democratic Council for the removal of a post on the account of the National Republican Congressional Committee on the social networking site Twitter linking House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Hitler , the Republicans ’ campaign committee has pulled the ad .

And apologized : Sort of .
Politico reported today on Randall ’s statement , “ We saw the video this morning and thought , like other parodies , that it was funny , ” Randall just told me .
“ In 20 - 20 hindsight , we realized it was in poor taste and pulled it down … I do n’t want anyone to think we ’re comparing Democrats to Nazis and to Hitler . ”
In the video clip , phony subtitles attached to a scene from the 2004 Hitler biopic Der Untergang ( The Downfall ) have Hitler praising Pelosi and voicing disappointment with President Barack Obama ’s revisions for his health care reform plan .
The movie recounts the last days of Hitler ’s life in his Berlin bunker .
The scene in question has been posted online countless times using a variety of topics as the subject matter , and depicts Hitler , pointing to a map , surrounded by his generals who are afraid to tell him the truth regarding his situation .
In the film , it ’s in this scene that Hitler realizes he has lost the war .
In the RNCC video , Hitler becomes angry and screams “ What the hell are the Democrats doing ? ”
“ At least I have Pelosi on my side .
What ’s wrong with them ?…
I socialized medicine overnight and everything ’s going great …
Like Pelosi , I do n’t give a shit about the American people . ”

‘” We ’ve tracked at least 40 examples of use of the Holocaust analogies and this deeply offensive portrayal of the Democratic Party leadership as Nazis by some prominent Republican figures .
This rhetoric reached unprecedented level of bad taste , like the recent ‘ tweet ’ that shows Speaker Pelosi and Hitler as buddies , ” Harris added . ”
The following YouTube video titled “ Funny Video : Moonbattery : Hitler Reacts to ObamaCare Maneuvers ” was posted on Twitter by the NRCC .
can Windows 7 be a Threat to Linux ?
please read this article ..
There 's been a recent spate of predictions that Windows 7 will kill off the Linux desktop , especially on netbooks .
My favorite title so far is Windows kicks Linux to the curb , which provides a nice visual .
Well , I 'm not actually going to disagree , at least as far as traditional desktop Linux and netbooks go .
But first , a question to drive a point home .
Have you ever used a version of OpenOffice Cloud ?
Neither have I , because it does n't exist .
The closest you can come is to use Ulteo , a virtualized Linux provider service , started by a previous Mandriva founder -- then everything is running on a VM in the cloud including OpenOffice .
If you want to go cloud , you have to use something like Google ( GOOG ) Docs .
And is n't a netbook about the cloud ?
Microsoft ( MSFT ) has n't been sleeping while the cloud trend has been developing .
A few months ago they announced they 're extending Office to the browser , with lightweight versions of Word , Excel , PowerPoint and OneNote .
And they also announced Azure , their vision of an OS for the cloud .
Now , a Linux vendor could pray that a move from XP to Windows 7 on netbooks would mean a return to the days of high priced BOM - based sales ( and thus an opportunity for Linux to compete more favorably again ) .
But the reality is , Microsoft will charge whatever the market will bare for netbook platforms , and move the rest of the business to chase the after - market revenues that cloud computing offers .
That 's something very hard to compete with , for desktop Linux distros which often struggle to stay afloat .
This was why I wrote the article about how to make the Linux desktop profitable .
The reality is that , in my humble opinion , the Linux distros will never compete well with Windows on BOM - based sales .
So who is the one company who really gets cloud computing , has the infrastructure for it , and an interest in Linux ?
Google .
My take is Windows 7 is a threat to the classic Linux desktop distros .
And that Google is the future of the Linux desktop , with Android pushing up the food - chain , and many of Google 's infrastructure bits pervading the desktop .
Note to distros , belly up to Google ...

' Freaky ' Ghostshark discovered with sexual organ on its head
Experts have discovered a new strange species of ghostshark ... that has a sexual organ on its head .
The bizarre looking creatures are a type of chimaera - an ancient and bizarre group of fishes distantly related to sharks .
Found in deep waters off the Californian coast , the males have a sexual organ on their foreheads known as a tentaculum .
The ghostshark is found in deep waters off the coast of southern California
The new species , the Eastern Pacific black ghostshark ( Hydrolagus melanophasma ) , was described in the international journal Zootaxa .
' It ’s a big weird looking freaky thing , ' said co-author Doug Long of the California Academy of Sciences .
' They have this club on the top of their head with spikes .
People think it ’s used for mating .
' It ’s like a little mace with little spikes and hooks and it fits into their forehead .
It ’s jointed and it comes out .
We ’re not sure if it is used to stimulate the female or hold the female closer . '
Experts believe the 3ft male has a sexual organ on its head
Specimens of the 3ft long fish have been found since the 1960s , but it ended up nameless in museum collections around the world .
It was n't until an American team precisely measured a pickled example of the blackish - purple fish that it was recognised as its own species .
Chimaeras were once a very diverse and abundant group , as illustrated by their global presence in the fossil record .
Their closest living relatives are sharks , but their evolutionary lineage branched off from sharks nearly 400 million years ago , and they have remained an isolated group ever since .
They survived through the age of dinosaurs mostly unchanged , but today these fishes are relatively scarce and are usually confined to deep ocean waters , where they have largely avoided the reach of explorers and remained poorly known to science .
This new species belongs to the genus Hydrolagus , Latin for ' water rabbit ' because of its grinding tooth plates reminiscent of a rabbit 's incisor teeth .
Renewed exploration of the world 's deep oceans and more extensive analysis of chimaera specimens in museum collections have led to a boom in the number of new chimaera species discovered worldwide in the last decade .
CLEVELAND --
Poverty did not grow in Northeast Ohio last year , but the specter of poverty spread .
Thousands of people found themselves pulled ever closer to a desperate edge .
The number of near - poor has climbed steadily in the region in recent years , according to an examination of census data by The Plain Dealer .
People living on incomes just above the poverty line grew by 10 percent between 2000 and 2008 .
Theirs is now a community of nearly a quarter of a million people .
The U.S. Census Bureau will announce today that 13 percent of residents in the Cleveland - Akron metro area were poor in 2008 , a rate virtually unchanged from 2007 .
But the number of people with a new fear of poverty is growing in city and suburb .
" Right now , what is poverty ? " asked Stacey Miller , the food pantry coordinator at Affinity Baptist Church in Cleveland 's Lee-Miles neighborhood .
" I think we all feel it a little bit . "
Her pantry in a largely working - class neighborhood has seen its lines grow in recent months , often with people who never before visited a hunger center .
" Most of them do work , " Miller said .
" But they need to pay for a medication .
Or the rent went up .
Or their hours got cut .
Everything has increased but their income .
They need a little help making ends meet . "
According to The Plain Dealer analysis , nearly 224,000 people in the region are treading anxious waters .
They are not officially poor but stand too close to the abyss for comfort .
The federal government set the poverty line at $ 17,330 for a family of three in 2008 .
If the family earned less than that , the government defined them as poor .
About 13 percent of America was poor last year , 13.4 percent of Ohio and 13.1 percent of Northeast Ohio .
The near - poor are often defined as people living on less than 150 percent of the federal poverty level .
That income topped out at $ 25,995 for a family of three in 2008 .
At the start of the decade , the near - poor numbered about 200,000 people in the eight - county region .
By July of 2008 , another 23,000 people had joined an income group especially vulnerable to layoffs , pay cuts , forced furloughs and other ravages of recession .
" When you 're working at the bottom rung of the ladder , any kind of drop in your income is a disaster , " said Elliott Huff , who helped launch the food pantry at Affinity Baptist in August 2007 .
Since then , the numbers of families served by the pantry has grown from about 40 to more than 150 three Saturdays a month .
A rising class of near - poor , while the poverty rate remains constant , is a hallmark of recession , said Claudia Coulton , co-director of the Center on Urban Poverty and Social Change at Case Western Reserve University .
" A recession hurts people who were working , " she said , " especially people in the lower - middle income range . "
The danger is that near - poor families can easily tumble into the ranks of the poor , as they are now more susceptible to the primary causes of poverty , Coulton said .
Stress could fracture a family , for example , or a worker could find they no longer possess the job skills needed in the regional economy .
From such afflictions come an underclass .
In 2008 , 30.5 percent of Cleveland residents lived in poverty , up from 29.5 percent in 2007 and 26.9 in 2006 .
The recent data comes from the 2008 American Community Survey , which provides a snapshot of American life from July 2007 to July 2008 .
Among America 's 71 major cities -- those with more than 250,000 people -- Cleveland ranked second poorest behind Detroit for the second straight year .
Among cities with populations greater than 65,000 , Cleveland was America 's 15th poorest city last year , behind Greenville , N.C .
Ohio had six cities among the nation 's poorest .
Youngstown ranked eighth nationally and first in Ohio with a 33.5 percent poverty rate .
It was followed in Ohio by Cleveland , Dayton , 29.2 percent , Canton 27.3 percent , Lorain , 25.4 percent , and Cincinnati .
While the census survey captures part of the current recession -- which officially began in December 2007 -- much of urban poverty is not affected by economic cycles , experts say .
Rather , high rates of single parenthood and low levels of education guarantee high poverty rates in many cities .
One - third of the region 's single - parent families were poor in 2008 , The Plain Dealer found .
Among married couple families , less than 4 percent were poor .
" The bulk of poverty is a long - term , structural problem , " Coulton said .
" When you have a modest education , you need two workers in the labor force to get above the poverty line . "
The Rights of Man by Thomas Paine
Applying Principle to Practice , Chapter 5 - Ways and Means of Improving the Condition of Europe Interspersed with Miscellaneous Observations , Part 5 of 8
The number of children under fourteen years of age , in each of those families , will be found to be about five to every two families ; some having two , and others three ; some one , and others four : some none , and others five ; but it rarely happens that more than five are under fourteen years of age , and after this age they are capable of service or of being apprenticed .
Allowing five children ( under fourteen years ) to every two families ,
The number of children will be 630,000
The number of parents , were they all living , would be 504,000
It is certain , that if the children are provided for , the parents are relieved of consequence , because it is from the expense of bringing up children that their poverty arises .
Having thus ascertained the greatest number that can be supposed to need support on account of young families , I proceed to the mode of relief or distribution , which is ,
To pay as a remission of taxes to every poor family , out of the surplus taxes , and in room of poor - rates , four pounds a year for every child under fourteen years of age ; enjoining the parents of such children to send them to school , to learn reading , writing , and common arithmetic ; the ministers of every parish , of every denomination to certify jointly to an office , for that purpose , that this duty is performed .
The amount of this expense will be , For six hundred and thirty thousand children at four pounds per annum each £ 2,520,000
By adopting this method , not only the poverty of the parents will be relieved , but ignorance will be banished from the rising generation , and the number of poor will hereafter become less , because their abilities , by the aid of education , will be greater .
Many a youth , with good natural genius , who is apprenticed to a mechanical trade , such as a carpenter , joiner , millwright , shipwright , blacksmith , etc. , is prevented getting forward the whole of his life from the want of a little common education when a boy .
I now proceed to the case of the aged .
I divide age into two classes .
First , the approach of age , beginning at fifty .
Secondly , old age commencing at sixty .
At fifty , though the mental faculties of man are in full vigour , and his judgment better than at any preceding date , the bodily powers for laborious life are on the decline .
He cannot bear the same quantity of fatigue as at an earlier period .
He begins to earn less , and is less capable of enduring wind and weather ; and in those more retired employments where much sight is required , he fails apace , and sees himself , like an old horse , beginning to be turned adrift .
At sixty his labour ought to be over , at least from direct necessity .
It is painful to see old age working itself to death , in what are called civilised countries , for daily bread .
To form some judgment of the number of those above fifty years of age , I have several times counted the persons I met in the streets of London , men , women , and children , and have generally found that the average is about one in sixteen or seventeen .
If it be said that aged persons do not come much into the streets , so neither do infants ; and a great proportion of grown children are in schools and in work - shops as apprentices .
Taking , then , sixteen for a divisor , the whole number of persons in England of fifty years and upwards , of both sexes , rich and poor , will be four hundred and twenty thousand .
The persons to be provided for out of this gross number will be husbandmen , common labourers , journeymen of every trade and their wives , sailors , and disbanded soldiers , worn out servants of both sexes , and poor widows .
There will be also a considerable number of middling tradesmen , who having lived decently in the former part of life , begin , as age approaches , to lose their business , and at last fall to decay .
Besides these there will be constantly thrown off from the revolutions of that wheel which no man can stop nor regulate , a number from every class of life connected with commerce and adventure .
To provide for all those accidents , and whatever else may befall , I take the number of persons who , at one time or other of their lives , after fifty years of age , may feel it necessary or comfortable to be better supported , than they can support themselves , and that not as a matter of grace and favour , but of right , at one - third of the whole number , which is one hundred and forty thousand , as stated in a previous page , and for whom a distinct provision was proposed to be made .
If there be more , society , notwithstanding the show and pomposity of government , is in a deplorable condition in England .
Of this one hundred and forty thousand , I take one half , seventy thousand , to be of the age of fifty and under sixty , and the other half to be sixty years and upwards .
Having thus ascertained the probable proportion of the number of aged persons , I proceed to the mode of rendering their condition comfortable , which is :
To pay to every such person of the age of fifty years , and until he shall arrive at the age of sixty , the sum of six pounds per annum out of the surplus taxes , and ten pounds per annum during life after the age of sixty .
The expense of which will be ,
Seventy thousand persons , at £ 6 per annum £ 420,000 Seventy thousand persons , at £ 10 per annum 700,000 £ 1,120,000
This support , as already remarked , is not of the nature of a charity but of a right .
Every person in England , male and female , pays on an average in taxes two pounds eight shillings and sixpence per annum from the day of his ( or her ) birth ; and , if the expense of collection be added , he pays two pounds eleven shillings and sixpence ; consequently , at the end of fifty years he has paid one hundred and twenty - eight pounds fifteen shillings ; and at sixty one hundred and fifty - four pounds ten shillings .
Converting , therefore , his ( or her ) individual tax in a tontine , the money he shall receive after fifty years is but little more than the legal interest of the net money he has paid ; the rest is made up from those whose circumstances do not require them to draw such support , and the capital in both cases defrays the expenses of government .
It is on this ground that I have extended the probable claims to one - third of the number of aged persons in the nation . -
Is it , then , better that the lives of one hundred and forty thousand aged persons be rendered comfortable , or that a million a year of public money be expended on any one individual , and him often of the most worthless or insignificant character ?
Let reason and justice , let honour and humanity , let even hypocrisy , sycophancy and Mr. Burke , let George , let Louis , Leopold , Frederic , Catherine , Cornwallis , or Tippoo Saib , answer the question .
[ NOTE 1 ] I .
The sum thus remitted to the poor will be ,
To two hundred and fifty - two thousand poor families , containing six hundred and thirty thousand children £ 2,520,000
To one hundred and forty thousand aged persons 1,120,000 £ 3,640,000
There will then remain three hundred and sixty thousand pounds out of the four millions , part of which may be applied as follows : -
After all the above cases are provided for there will still be a number of families who , though not properly of the class of poor , yet find it difficult to give education to their children ; and such children , under such a case , would be in a worse condition than if their parents were actually poor .
A nation under a well - regulated government should permit none to remain uninstructed .
It is monarchical and aristocratical government only that requires ignorance for its support .
Suppose , then , four hundred thousand children to be in this condition , which is a greater number than ought to be supposed after the provisions already made , the method will be :
To allow for each of those children ten shillings a year for the expense of schooling for six years each , which will give them six months schooling each year , and half a crown a year for paper and spelling books .
The expense of this will be annually £ 250,000 .
[ NOTE 2 ]
There will then remain one hundred and ten thousand pounds .
Notwithstanding the great modes of relief which the best instituted and best principled government may devise , there will be a number of smaller cases , which it is good policy as well as beneficence in a nation to consider .
Were twenty shillings to be given immediately on the birth of a child , to every woman who should make the demand , and none will make it whose circumstances do not require it , it might relieve a great deal of instant distress .
There are about two hundred thousand births yearly in England ; and if claimed by one fourth ,
The amount would be £ 50,000
And twenty shillings to every new - married couple who should claim in like manner .
This would not exceed the sum of £ 20,000 .
Also twenty thousand pounds to be appropriated to defray the funeral expenses of persons , who , travelling for work , may die at a distance from their friends .
By relieving parishes from this charge , the sick stranger will be better treated .
I shall finish this part of the subject with a plan adapted to the particular condition of a metropolis , such as London .
Cases are continually occurring in a metropolis , different from those which occur in the country , and for which a different , or rather an additional , mode of relief is necessary .
In the country , even in large towns , people have a knowledge of each other , and distress never rises to that extreme height it sometimes does in a metropolis .
There is no such thing in the country as persons , in the literal sense of the word , starved to death , or dying with cold from the want of a lodging .
Yet such cases , and others equally as miserable , happen in London .
Many a youth comes up to London full of expectations , and with little or no money , and unless he get immediate employment he is already half undone ; and boys bred up in London without any means of a livelihood , and as it often happens of dissolute parents , are in a still worse condition ; and servants long out of place are not much better off .
In short , a world of little cases is continually arising , which busy or affluent life knows not of , to open the first door to distress .
Hunger is not among the postponable wants , and a day , even a few hours , in such a condition is often the crisis of a life of ruin .
These circumstances which are the general cause of the little thefts and pilferings that lead to greater , may be prevented .
There yet remain twenty thousand pounds out of the four millions of surplus taxes , which with another fund hereafter to be mentioned , amounting to about twenty thousand pounds more , cannot be better applied than to this purpose .
The plan will then be :
First ,
To erect two or more buildings , or take some already erected , capable of containing at least six thousand persons , and to have in each of these places as many kinds of employment as can be contrived , so that every person who shall come may find something which he or she can do .
Secondly ,
To receive all who shall come , without enquiring who or what they are .
The only condition to be , that for so much , or so many hours ' work , each person shall receive so many meals of wholesome food , and a warm lodging , at least as good as a barrack .
That a certain portion of what each person 's work shall be worth shall be reserved , and given to him or her , on their going away ; and that each person shall stay as long or as short a time , or come as often as he choose , on these conditions .
If each person stayed three months , it would assist by rotation twenty - four thousand persons annually , though the real number , at all times , would be but six thousand .
By establishing an asylum of this kind , such persons to whom temporary distresses occur , would have an opportunity to recruit themselves , and be enabled to look out for better employment .
Allowing that their labour paid but one half the expense of supporting them , after reserving a portion of their earnings for themselves , the sum of forty thousand pounds additional would defray all other charges for even a greater number than six thousand .
The fund very properly convertible to this purpose , in addition to the twenty thousand pounds , remaining of the former fund , will be the produce of the tax upon coals , so iniquitously and wantonly applied to the support of the Duke of Richmond .
It is horrid that any man , more especially at the price coals now are , should live on the distresses of a community ; and any government permitting such an abuse , deserves to be dismissed .
This fund is said to be about twenty thousand pounds per annum .
Footnotes :
Last month , when Zack Ajmal was planning a vacation to Italy , he set out to find the first thing that a traveler would need in a foreign land : a map .
But digital maps of Rome and Venice for his Garmin GPS device cost almost $ 100 .
So instead , Ajmal turned to OpenStreetMap , a community - driven maps database .
" It worked out pretty well , " the Atlanta - based engineer says .
" I found Open MTB , which had outdoor hiking and cycling maps with not just roads information , but also trails , short cuts and little known routes . "
Ajmal is among roughly half a million users who are eschewing proprietary maps information from GPS companies and instead going with crowdsourced versions , which they then load onto their GPS devices and smartphones .
The key to these map hacks is OpenStreetMap .
Founded in 2004 , OSM is to maps what Wikipedia is to encyclopedias .
The site offers maps that can be edited , customized and loaded on to devices for free .
Want to go whitewater rafting but need to know where the rapids are ?
There 's a map for that .
Or to know all the interesting points along the river Nile ?
There 's a map for that .
And it's all based on the OpenStreetMap data .
" The value is that it is richer map with more up - to - date information because anyone can fix things , " says Steve Coast , founder of OpenStreetMap .
" Users get access to the underlying data and not just a picture of the maps . "
Consumer map data is currently a duopoly split between two mapping providers : Nokia 's Navteq and TomTom 's Tele Atlas .
The two provide the mapping data that powers almost all commercial map applications and devices .
But maps from these providers are extremely restrictive in how they can be used .
Want a map of the best hiking trails in the country or a walking tour of Rome ?
Traditional GPS services can't offer that .
For adventurous geeks that calls for a DIY fix .
" OSM maps are a little new on the scene , " says Rich Owings , who runs the GPStracklog.com website and is the author of the book GPS Mapping .
" Most people in the U.S. were not using them until recently , but now there are iPhone apps based on it . "
Getting OpenStreetMap is easier on some devices than others .
In Garmin systems , it 's as simple as taking one of the available maps and dropping it into a folder on the device .

* OpenStreetMap Project for TomTom : * TomTom 's proprietary file format makes it difficult to get open maps on the device .
But a wiki suggests a fix for OpenStreetMap and TomTom .
Other OpenStreetMap projects : A complete list of OSM projects by country and special projects like mapping the Nile are available .
" It 's really hard to mess up your GPS doing this , " says Owings .
" And if you have questions you can always ask the community to help you out . "
Owings says he loaded maps of Ecuador on his Garmin unit in about 30 minutes .
" It 's not as clean of a map as one you can get from the Garmin store but they are pretty wonderful and have very good coverage . "
For TomTom systems , getting OpenStreetMap can be a more difficult process .
TomTom uses a proprietary mapping format , says Coast .
That means a tricky process of converting OpenStreetMap into a TomTom - compatible format .
OpenStreetMap has also been used to create iPhone apps such as MotionX , which is targeted at hikers , skiers and bikers ; B.iCycle , a cyclometer that shows burned calories , trip distance and trails ; and ATM@UK , which shows all ATM locations in Great Britain .
The OpenStreetMap project is a cartographer 's dream come true , says Randal Hale , who has a GIS consulting business .
Hale has created custom maps for a few clients using OpenStreetMap and has put OSM - generated maps on his Garmin unit .
" With the professional mapping software , I have to purchase a license to use their version , which is expensive and I can't use the data for analysis , " says Hale .
" With OpenStreetMap , I download it , make cartographic edits and hopefully I have made it better for the next user . "
Meanwhile , traditional navigation companies are also reaching out to users for help on data .
For instance , Nokia kicked off a pilot project at the University of California at Berkeley to collect traffic information through GPS - enabled cellphones .
Users could download the software for free and use it to check on road conditions on their phones .
At the same time , the software would report data about its users ’ positions to a central database , enabling the researchers to assemble traffic data in real time .
Google has also said it will add nationwide real - time traffic data to its maps by collecting anonymous location data from Google Maps users .
Still , community - created maps and navigation information remains a small niche , appealing only to " GPS techies " who are willing to take risks , says Owings .
" There 's not a lot of public awareness because many people do n't even know they can do this with their Garmin or cellphone , " he says .
But if you are planning to go to Berlin later this year , take a look at the OpenStreetMap site .
Germany is expected to become the first country in the site 's database to be fully mapped by contributors .

One of the top US commanders in Iraq , MNF - I Chief of Staff Brigadier General Peter Bayer Jr. publicly chastised the top US adviser in Baghdad , Colonel Timothy Reese , and rejected Col .
Reese ’s call for a rapid withdrawal from the ongoing war .
Brig .
Gen. Bayer
In his now famous memo , Col .
Reese bluntly declared that the US military presence in the nation “ is n’t yielding benefits commensurate with the effort and is now generating its own opposition . ”
The memo also went on to remind readers that US forces are supposed to be guests in Iraq and that “ guests , like fish , begin to smell after three days . ”
Brig .
Gen .
Bayer condemned Reese as “ uninformed ” and insisted the memo just amounted to “ one officer ’s view , written fairly early after June 30 , who has a limited viewpoint . ”
He went on to insist that Iraq remained vulnerable and that the military would have to continue its commitment with the elections coming in January .
The “ one officer ’s view ” in this case , however , is the view of the chief of the Baghdad Operations Command Advisory Team , and previously was director of the Army ’s Combat Studies Institute .
Though Bayer ’s harsh criticism , and Gen. Odeirno ’s comments before him suggest that the Obama Administration is going to ignore the memo and continue fighting the war , it seems at best they are doing him a great disservice to the case for withdrawal by labeling Col.
Reese “ uninformed ” and at worst revealing that the war is so haphazardly managed that they can’t even keep their top adviser apprised of the situation on the ground .
" These buildings owned as much by us as those we share them with ! "
From what I 'm hearing , there are at least 150 - 200,000 people at the march , although that 's not an official count .
The ClusterFox - induced 9/12 effort garnered , generously speaking , about 70,000 , with a major push from nearly every cable network , but especially Fox .
One quote from Robin McGehee
That sentence should never have had to be uttered .
Mario had super mushrooms he could use in the Mario Kart games to blast past his opponents and take the lead .
Now , drivers in the Indy Racing League have them too .
The cool new power up is a " push to pass " or " overtake assist " button on the steering car of every Indy Racing League car .
Mashing it unleashes a sudden jolt of horsepower , giving drivers a strategic edge that 's brought back some of the side - by - side racing excitement from the Indycar racing of old .
The technology made its debut Aug. 1 at the Kentucky Speedway Meijer Indy 300 .
It already has reinvigorated racing and brought a measure of suspense to what used to be little more than high - speed parades .
The Indy 300 turned into a nail - biter as Penske Racing ’s Ryan Briscoe fought alongside Vision Racing ’s Ed Carpenter for the last 10 laps before beating him by just 0.0162 seconds .
It was one of the closest finishes ever .
" It was what we expected and hoped for , " Brian Barnhart , president of the Indy Racing League , said of the technology .
“ It certainly feels like the IRL is back . "
Push - to - pass was born of last year 's marriage of the Indy Racing League and Champ Car , which brought open - wheel oval - and road - racing together .
Champ ditched the 2.65 - liter turbocharged Cosworth engines it was running in favor of the normally aspirated 3.5 - liter Honda V8 engines the Indy Racing League is using .
Roger Griffiths , Honda 's Performance Development race team manager , and Dan Layton , the company 's PR director , knew turbocharging could bring some excitement back to the IRL , but that was n't an option because they had to work with what they had .
They settled on push - to - pass in April and fast - tracked the project .
Some Formula 1 cars achieve a short - term burst of power using a kinetic energy recovery system , which captures energy during braking and stores it in a battery .
The juice is used in a hybrid system of sorts that provides an on - demand power boost of 80 horsepower .
The technology has met with mixed results , and some teams have abandoned it .
Honda devised a more elegant solution using software to increase speed without mechanically altering the engine or increasing fuel consumption – a key consideration because teams are given a specific allotment of fuel for each event .
The software directs the engine 's electronic control unit to goose power by increasing the RPMs .
More specifically , it shuts off the alternator so the engine spins faster and alters the fuel map so the engine gets more fuel .
The result is a " goes to 11 " boost of five to 20 horsepower .
" Drivers get an additional 200 rpm – from 10,300 rpm to 10,500 rpm – before the engine rev limiter activates , " Griffiths said .
The technology was easy to adopt because the 16 teams in the Indy Racing League lease their engines from Honda .
Griffiths customizes and allots the " push times " – the frequency and duration of the boosts drivers are allowed – based on the length of each track 's straight sections .
At Kentucky Speedway , an oval , drivers were given 12 pushes of the button , each lasting no more than 10 seconds .
At Mid-Ohio , a road course , drivers got 15 pushes lasting 20 seconds each .
After every push , there is a 10 - second recharge blackout to prevent drivers from mashing the button nonstop .
" I was pushing it .
I was just pushing it in that 10 - second window that it would n't work , waiting for it to come back on , " Ed Carpenter said .
Ryan Briscoe did the same thing , admitting that he was " on the button the whole time " as he and Carpenter duked it out to the end of the Meijer 300 .
" I do n't know if I 've ever been so excited crossing a finish line , " Carpenter said .
The fans were on their feet , cheering the whole time .
Turns out the drivers love push - to - pass as much as the fans .
" We need to be able to race side by side , something that we did n't approve of before – we thought it was kind of dangerous – but right now we 're racing for the fans , " said Tony Kanaan , who drives for Andretti-Green Racing and posted his first Top 5 finish this year .
" It was a helluva race . "
By this point you 're probably thinking , " This is dream technology .
I could really make some jerk eat my dust . "
That 's exactly why you 'll probably never see push - to - pass on a road car .
" If two American cars both had this feature , we would unleash too much road rage , " Griffiths said .
Ah , but picture this , Mr. Griffiths :
You 're cruising the highway at top speed and some moron is about to sideswipe you .
You hit that push - to - pass button and hightail it out of the way , averting an accident .
Still think we 'll never see that button on our steering wheels ?
Griffiths paused to reconsider , then said , " Never say never . "
UPDATE , 1:15 p.m. Monday , Aug. 24 : Honda offered the following response to a comment left by DirtyRotten Yankee , who wondered how it is possible to increase speed and alter the fuel map without increasing fuel consumption :
Briefly , the length of time the fuel flow is increased is so brief it is balanced out by the increase in horsepower ( speed ) , so there is no effective change in the average fuel consumption ( mpg ) from the normal " full rich " position .
In everyday terms , if you give the throttle of your passenger car a brief , sharp jab to pass someone ( i.e. " press the button " ) , then let off the throttle to resume your normal speed , your average mpg does not change .
It 's kinda like quantum mechanics , where you learn that your fingers are n't really touching , even when you think they are , because there 's more space than matter in each individual atom ....

Republican group says ' armed struggle is over ' and announces start of decommissioning on eve of Hillary Clinton visit
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The republican paramilitary group that assassinated the Tory MP and Margaret Thatcher ally Airey Neave is to give up its weapons and pursue purely peaceful politics .
The Irish National Liberation Army announced today it will begin discussion with General John de Chastelain 's disarmament body and move towards decommissioning its guns and bombs .
During the Troubles the INLA murdered 113 people including 15 of its own members during several brutal internal feuds in the 80s and 90s .
Among its most infamous members was Dominic " Mad Dog " McGlinchey , once Ireland 's most wanted men , who led INLA during the mid-80s .
The announcement was made at the Seamus Costello Commemoration in Bray , County Dublin .
Costello founded the INLA after a split within the IRA in 1974 .
Three years later the IRA shot him dead in central Dublin .
" The armed struggle is over , " the INLA statement said .
The movement 's political wing , the Irish Republican Socialist Party , told the graveside gathering that the best way to achieve a united socialist Ireland is " through political , peaceful means " .
The British and Irish governments have been briefed about the INLA move .
The road to INLA decommissioning has been going on for several years through internal discussions .
Despite a ceasefire since 1998 , the group has been responsible for a number of subsequent killings on both sides of the border including the murder of a man in Derry , who intervened to help another man being attacked by INLA members .
A small number of members , opposed to the ceasefire , have already defected to the Real IRA and Continuity IRA .
The majority of the movement , however , are understood to be solidly behind the decision to wind up its paramilitary machine .
The news that another armed republican group is moving towards disarmament comes on the eve of Hilary Clinton 's visit to Belfast .
The US secretary of state will hold talks with the leaders of Northern Ireland 's political parties .
They will discuss potential new US investment and progress towards a deal on devolving policing and justice to the Stormont assembly .
Is virtualization THE killer app for Linux ?
Will it become the application ( like Lotus 123 and WordPerfect were for the PC and MS - DOS back in the day ) that puts Linux into every office ?
If you follow computer news at all , you have no doubt been inundated recently with story after story about virtualization and how it will soon impact your server room .
But if you look a little deeper into what virtualization is offering , I think it has the POTENTIAL to be the next big thing ; for both servers and desktops .
While I think it is fair to say that the jury is still out on whether the Linux / OSS community or Microsoft ( as the standard - bearer for traditional , proprietary , closed - source software ) offers the best model for a " secure " operating system , I think everyone has to admit that Linux is ; a ) in the game , and b ) orders of magnitude more configurable than Windows is or will be in the immediate future .
For these reasons , here is what I foresee as a POSSIBLE outcome of " virtualization mania " ; the desktops ( in addition to the servers ) in a typical MS Windows shop will run Linux on the bare metal and Windows in some sort of virtual machine .
The benefits to virtualizing servers are fairly obvious and have been discussed at length for some time , but why would ( should ) you virtualize a desktop computer that only needs to run one instance of Windows ?
Here are my ideas :
1. Convenience -
The average office sets up a handful of preconfigured desktop images ( accounting , admin , engineering , sales , etc. ) that can be loaded and copied as needed .
2. Security -
In light of the ever increasing threat of malware , you can run a lean , stripped - down , locked - down version of Linux on the bare metal , minimizing outside access to your machine .
3. Recoverability - According to Microsoft (
http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1945782,00.asp
) , security issues are serious enough to require an established worst - case - scenario recovery plan .
See # 1 above .
I know MS has its own virtualization hypervisor , and that they are giving it away a la early Internet Explorer , but in the long run I think the sheer size and complexity of MS code will preclude it from becoming a successful virtualization - host OS .
I am sure MS will control a significant portion of the virtualized servers running instances of Windows Server , but for the type of desktop virtualization I am thinking about , you will want the host OS to be as small ( disk and memory footprint ) and fast as possible .
I just think that Linux has too much to offer as a configurable OS for it not to fill this niche .
I think that running user applications within a virtualized OS environment , separated from the physical machine , is the wave of the future for all business computers ( servers and desktops ) , and I think this move toward virtualization will drive Linux onto the vast majority of these machines .
