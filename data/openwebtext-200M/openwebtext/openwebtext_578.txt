Rocky Mountain News :
Planned Parenthood is suddenly a lot richer because of Sarah Palin .
And the Republican vice presidential nominee will soon be receiving tens of thousands of thank - you notes .
A three - week - old Internet campaign is asking abortion - rights activists to send donations to Planned Parenthood in honor of the Alaska governor .[.. ]
One e-mail making the rounds on the Internet says : " Instead of ( actually , in addition to ) all of us all sending more e-mails about how absolutely horrible she is , let 's all make a donation to Planned Parenthood in Sarah Palin 's name . "
The folks at 280 slides.com announced their Objective - J framework Cappuccino which “ aims to fundamentally change the way applications are written on the web , ” and I ’ve no doubt it ’ll do just that – but does that mean you should use it ?
There are as many tools to build web applications as there are developers in this world – Ruby , PHP , Java , JavaScript , jQuery , Prototype , Python , Lisp , SproutCore , Flash , Silverlight , Flex – and now Cappuccino ’s Objective - J.
So what makes it different , where does it fit in , is all the hype true , and is Cappuccino right for you ?
These are all questions I hope this post will help you answer , and to start out , let me explain the title of this post …
Taking the “ Web ” out of Web Development
A quote from Cappuccino ’s site :
With Cappuccino , you do n’t need to know HTML .
You ’ll never write a line of CSS .
You do n’t ever have interact with DOM .
We only ask developers to learn one technology , Objective - J , and one set of APIs .
If you ’re anything like me – a million red flags just shot high into the air .
If you ’re building a web application , I sincerely hope that you do know HTML and CSS and JavaScript and how to interact with the DOM .
But Dion Almaer of Ajaxian gives us a bright side :
they are abstracting developers high up , so you do n’t have to deal with [ cross browser issues ] .
Now that does n’t sound half bad at all !
It ’ll take more than a promise to convince me that Objective - J is n’t the FrontPage of web languages , but if they can keep that promise , then this could be a game changer indeed .
What Makes It Different ?
So how does this work ?
Cappuccino was implemented using a new programming language called Objective - J , which is modelled after Objective - C and built entirely on top of JavaScript .
Programs written in Objective - J are interpreted in the client , so no compilation or plugins are required .
To clarify , there are two new things here : Objective - J and Cappuccino .
Objective - J is a new language with it ’s lexer , parser , and interpreter written entirely in traditional JavaScript .
Cappuccino is a essentially Cocoa ported to Objective - J. Both of these together let you write new applications entirely in Objective - J on the Cappuccino framework .
There are a few things that come out of this , the first of which is that JavaScript does a lot of extra work .
All of your Objective - J code will be tokenized , parsed , and interpreted entirely in JavaScript .
Hopefully , with new JavaScript engines ( and browsers like Chrome that actually compile JavaScript ) , speed will become less of an issue – but in the short term this is very much a concern .
Second , developers only need to learn 1 programming language , and Cocoa developers already have a head start with this new framework !
This almost almost makes me wish I ’d been building Mac apps for the past few years instead of web apps – but not quite
In fact , Dion ’s interview with 280 North a few months ago had some interesting tidbits about just that :
The guys talk a little about the toolchain an why they did this , and even how it enables future cool things such as generating a native Mac application from the same code .
That ’s a future I want to live in .
Is the Hype True ?
And now the fun part : 280 North make some bold statements with Cappuccino .
Let ’s take a look at the highlights :
Cappuccino is not designed for building web sites , or making existing sites more “ dynamic ” …
Projects like Prototype and jQuery are excellent at those tasks , but they are forced by their nature to make compromises which render them ineffective at application development …
and
j Query , Prototype , and others do a great job of making static web pages a little more interactive , but they were n’t designed for building full fledged applications .
Lies .
Filthy lies .
Ben Sargent provides a fantastic counter - example to this exaggeration in the form of a re-implementation of Cappuccino ’s sample Flickr app in only 45 lines of jQuery .
Cappuccino ’s code was hundreds of lines of Objective - J for the same ( if not poorer ) result .
( Notice zooming photos in the jQuery version runs much smoother than in Cappuccino ) .
To be fair , the Flickr sample app is a very small application .
So does jQuery fall apart with larger applications ?
Of course not !
Especially since you ’re already using a Model - View - Controller , right ?
Comparing Cappuccino to jQuery is beginning to look like comparing Java to C. Each can be used with great effectiveness – and each for its own reasons : Java for abstraction and portability , and C for speed .
This may be the beginning of similar arguments for and against Cappuccino and jQuery : Cappuccino for new language features , and jQuery for speed .
Which brings us to the next statement :
the real beauty of Objective - J is that it already works in every major browser and it is completely extendable at our descretion
This is mostly true , but not entirely .
In their announcement post , they provide their motivation for building Objective - J vs waiting on the next - gen JavaScript :
Most JavaScript programmers today could list a number of features and bug fixes they ’d like in JavaScript , such as classical inheritance , better media support , and access to the webcam .
And while Objective - J does solve some problems ( classical inheritance ) it does not and cannot solve others ( better media support and access to the webcam ) .
A new language that ’s built in and runs in JavaScript cannot and will never provide more than what JavaScript provides .
Features like media and webcam support , offline access , persistent data storage , etc , will always be dependent on JavaScript ’s foundation .
Cappuccino can change how you accomplish things in JavaScript with new syntax and semantics , but can not change what you accomplish in JavaScript .
Performance
As I mentioned above , Ben ’s Flickr app suggests that Cappuccino ’s performance leaves a bit to be desired .
To compare , load each app ( link to jQuery and Cappuccino versions ) and note how quickly the photos scale when using the slider – the jQuery version wins hands down .
In Cappuccino ’s defense , the incredible speed improvements made by browsers will hopefully make this a non issue relatively soon .
This should n’t be too surprising .
After all , a lot of work has to be done to transform all of the Objective - J code into JavaScript , and that clearly adds extra weight to your application .
Alternatives
Lightweight alternatives include jQuery , Prototype , and YUI , among others .
Each of these can be used to build incredibly rich applications – especially if you follow the correct methodology
Sproutcore is another option , although it ’s certainly my least favorite of all of them , and for the same reasons as Cappuccino provides :
While SproutCore set out with similar goals to Cappuccino , it takes a distincly different approach .
It still relies on HTML , CSS , JavaScript , Prototype , and an entirely new and unique set of APIs .
It also requires special development software and a cumbersome compilation step .
We think this is the wrong approach .
And last ( and least preferred ) , you can roll your own foundation for your web app , as Buck and I did with Jotlet before there even were frameworks .
( Well , we did use X , but Mike himself wo n’t call it a framework ) .
Is It the Best Option ?
If you ’re a Cocoa developer who wants to make apps on the web , this is a no brainer – Objective - J is a fantastic choice .
There is a dark side though : at the cost of a graceful learning curve you ’ll likely have to sacrifice some performance and optimization .
If you ’re well established in jQuery ( or similar library ) and building with good methodolgy , then Objective - J may mean slower development cycles , more lines of code , and poorer performance .
No one ( certainly not me ) will chastise you for staying with the proven ridiculously fast jQuery .
One thing is for certain , Cappuccino will change web development .
This opens a huge door for Cocoa developers in particular to begin writing solid web apps in a comfortable developer environment .
And another thing is certain , Cappuccino is not the only framework for building web applications – so do n’t believe their lies .
[ # ] Johnny Rotten is like butter October 1st , 2008 under Ads
I had heard a few weeks ago that Johnny Lydon aka Johnny Rotten was doing for an ad for Country Life Butter and let me tell the commercial is better and cheesier than I ever thought it could be .
But I wonder what has happened to the state of Punk music that he is actually doing ads like that .

Winston Churchill once said that the best argument against democracy is a five - minute conversation with the average voter .
A conversation with just about any voter would work as well .
Hans - Hermann
Hoppe points out that democracy promotes ' the ' infantilization ' of society , ' resulting in ' continually increased taxes , paper money and paper money inflation , an unending flood of legislation , and a steadily growing ' public ' debt . '
Under democracy , he says , we 've witnessed the limited war of kings give way to total war , in which the ' distinction between combatants and non-combatants becomes fuzzy and ultimately disappears . . . .'
Furthermore , democracy has served as ' the fountainhead of every form of socialism : of ( European ) democratic socialism and ( American ) liberalism and neo-conservatism as well as of international ( Soviet ) socialism , ( Italian ) fascism , and national ( Nazi ) socialism . '
And given that the modern welfare state is economically unstable , it 'is bound to collapse under its own parasitic weight , much like Russian - style socialism imploded ' in 1991 .
It is frequently argued that if only we could return to constitutional government , many of the abuses we find in democracy would vanish .
But even a minimalist constitution is vulnerable to a coup .
John C. Calhoun 's Disquisition on Government , written in the late 1840s when the government 's assault on liberty was still in its infancy , identified the inescapable nature of a democratic society .
As Thomas DiLorenzo noted in a recent article , Calhoun saw the folly in believing that an organization in control of the ballot box and the military could be overcome 'by an appeal to reason , truth , justice , or the obligations imposed by the constitution . "
Calhoun maintained that democracy consists of a war between net taxpayers and net tax consumers , and that the war 's end would be the ' subversion of the constitution ' in which all restrictions on state power would be annulled .
And today 's Republicrats know the end is near , if it has n't already arrived .
Both McCain and Obama talk like they 've never heard of the Constitution .
If they occasionally speak with deference to a higher authority , it 's to keep the voters inert .
In an attempt to reverse the statist onslaught , libertarians try to educate the public .
But the libertarian message depends on the public taking the initiative .
They have to look for it and find it ' it is n't poured on them from mainstream outlets .
And the Establishment will have it no other way .
While the odds against getting a message out may seem insurmountable , there 's always the possibility of hacking the Establishment .
It 's more a fantasy than a possibility , but let 's indulge .
In this case , the hack would consist of taking control of that portion of viewers ' TV screens normally reserved for stock quotes and sports scores .
All TVs , everywhere .
Imagine politically incorrect messages rolling along the bottom of America 's TVs while talking heads ramble tediously about the latest statist proposals .
' Braves 6 , Phillies 3 ' gives way to ' Why should democracy rise against bribery ?
It is itself a form of wholesale bribery . '
As the above quote suggests , the hacker could achieve brilliance by drawing on the writings of H. L. Mencken .
Dissident Books will soon release a new edition of Mencken 's 1926 classic , Notes on Democracy .
It is nicely packaged , with an introduction by Mencken biographer Marion Elizabeth Rodgers and an afterword by two - time Pulitzer Prize winner Anthony Lewis .
Very importantly , it also includes an Annotations section to clarify some of Mencken 's allusions , making the text more accessible to young readers .
But for the most part , a rapier wit such as Mencken 's needs no translating , as the bribery quote shows .
Though Mencken was one of the most prolific journalists of his day , Notes on Democracy alone could provide antidotal wisdom for an entire election season .
Democratic Man
Mencken tells us that democratic man ' originated in the poetic fancy of gentlemen on the upper levels ' sentimentalists who , observing to their distress that the ass was over - laden , proposed to reform transport by putting him into the cart . '
It took awhile for this democratic man to adjust to the idea that he was special by virtue of his inferiority , but gradually
his wishes . . . began to take on the dignity of legal rights , and after a while , of intrinsic and natural rights , and by the same token the wishes of his masters sank to the level of mere ignominious lusts .
By 1828 in America and by 1848 in Europe the doctrine had arisen that all moral excellence , and with it all pure and unfettered sagacity , resided in the inferior four - fifths of mankind .
To Mencken , what is most curious about democratic man is , though he reaches his capacity for absorbing knowledge quickly , he
remains capable for a long time thereafter of absorbing delusions .
What is true daunts him , but what is not true finds lodgment in his cranium with so little resistance that there is only a trifling emission of heat .
The process of education is largely a process of dispelling childhood fears and illusions with knowledge .
Under democracy , though , education is sentenced to futility because the
vast majority of men are congenitally incapable of any such intellectual progress .
. .
They are unable to reason from a set of facts before them , free from emotional distraction .
But they also lack something more fundamental : they are incompetent to take in the bald facts themselves .
Given the nature of democratic man , what does democracy become in practice ?
A witch hunt .
The whole history of the country has been a history of melodramatic pursuits of horrendous monsters , most of them imaginary . . .
He cites the example of World War I. Before the U.S. joined the blood - fest , the mob 's only concern was to stay out of danger , reflected in the most popular song of 1915 , ' I Did n't Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier . '
In 1916 , Wilson was re-elected on his fraudulent promise to keep that boy from danger .
On the morning after Election Day , the demagogues shifted gears .
They had to generate a new fear even greater than the fear of going to war , and they succeeded by demonizing Germans and a possible German victory .
The whole power of the government was concentrated upon throwing the plain people into a panic .
All sense was heaved overboard , and there ensued a chase of bugaboos on a truly epic scale .
By the end of 1917 , the American people were in a state of terror about a foe 3,000 miles away and without the means to harm them .
Liberty and Democratic Man
Democratic man is an enemy of liberty because his greatest concern is not freedom but safety .
He is a natural slave .
Genuine liberty requires courage , a quality he lacks .
Even the concept of liberty is beyond the reach of his limited understanding .
He can imagine and even esteem , in his way , certain false forms of liberty ' for example , the right to choose between two political mountebanks , and to yell for the more obviously dishonest -- but the reality is incomprehensible to him .
Further on , Mencken says ,
The great masses of men , though theoretically free , are seen to submit supinely to oppression and exploitation of a hundred abhorrent sorts .
Have they no means of resistance ?
Obviously they have .
The worst tyrant , even under democratic plutocracy , has but one throat to slit .
In prosperous times ,
the typical democrat is quite willing to exchange any of the theoretical boons of freedom for something that he can use . . . .
He will sell it very willingly for a good job or for some advantage in his business .
Offering him such bribes , in fact , is the chief occupation of all political parties under democracy , and of all professional politicians .
And do n't talk to democratic man about taking up arms against the state .
He can get anything he wants through conventional means .
If he 's concerned about the Constitution , it can always be amended , if necessary .
And by ' anything , ' Mencken meant anything , even legalizing the president 's assassination for malfeasance .
Democratic man could
abandon the writ of habeas corpus , authorize unreasonable searches and seizures , legalize murder by public officers . . .
The Politician Under Democracy
The politician is democracy 's courtier .
' His business is never what it pretends to be , ' Mencken says .
Though he comes across as a whole - hearted devotee to the service of his fellow man , he is actually 'a sturdy rogue whose principal , and often sole aim in life is to butter his own parsnips .
His technical equipment consists simply of an armamentarium of deceits . '
Where do his powers lie ?
They lie , obviously , in the gross weaknesses and knaveries of the common people ' in their inability to grasp any issues save the simplest and most banal , in their incurable tendency to fly into preposterous alarms , in their petty self - seeking and venality , in their instinctive envy and hatred of their superiors . . .
He goes on :
The inferior man cannot imagine himself save as taking orders ' if not from the boss , then from the priest , and if not from the priest , then from some fantastic drill - sergeant of his own creation .
Demagoguery is the hallmark of democracy .
And the demagogue
is one who preaches doctrines he knows to be untrue to men he knows to be idiots . . . .
The whole process [ of seeking office ] is one of false pretences and ignoble concealments .
Dishonorable men tend to gradually ' monopolize all the public offices .
Out of the muck of their swinishness the typical American law - maker emerges . '
He has taken orders from his superiors in knavery and he has wooed and flattered his inferiors in sense . . . .
He is willing to embrace any issue , however idiotic , that will get him votes , and he is willing to sacrifice any principle , however sound , that will lose them for him .
Democracy and Liberty
The average man , Mencken tells us , does n't like liberty .
It alarms him and leaves him feeling lonely .
He longs instead for ' the warm , reassuring smell of the herd , and is willing to take the herdsman with it . '
He does n't want to be free .
He wants to be safe .
The greatest threat to democracy is not a tyrant but a free spirit .
Democracies ' are in vast dread of heresy , as a Sunday - school superintendent is in dread of scarlet women . . . .'
The aim of all democracies is to crush the free spirits , ' to make docile John Does of them . '
The inferior man , he says , resents and envies the superior man .
Such an attitude , of course , is not unique to democracy .
But it is only under democracy that it is liberated ; it is only under democracy that it becomes the philosophy of the state .
The democratic state shows a strong tendency to become a Puritan state .
Puritans want to bring the other fellow down to their level .
So it is with democratic man .
Both make the same error : they mistake a weakness for a merit .
Both are docile , cowardly , and lacking in enterprise and originality .
As for democracy 's future , Mencken can not say .
His purpose in Notes is not prognosis but diagnosis .
He is engaged in pathology , not therapeutics .
Yet he admits
To lack a remedy is to lack the very license to discuss disease .
The causes of this are to be sought , without question , in the nature of democracy itself .
It came into the world as a cure - all , and it remains primarily a cure - all to this day .
Any boil upon the body politic , however vast and raging , may be relieved by taking a vote . . . .
Regarding democracy 's blind optimism , he says
The man who hopes absurdly , it appears , is in some fantastic and gaseous manner a better citizen than the man who detects and exposes the truth .
Bear this sweet democratic axiom clearly in mind .
It is , fundamentally , what is the matter with the United States .
Notes on Democracy is strong medicine for the politically na've , though it may require more than one reading to keep the malady in remission .
It is the perfect tonic for surviving our politicized culture .
For the better part of a century , Americans have assumed we would always remain the world ’s greatest power , regardless of which party or president occupied the White House .
We were too important , rich and strong to falter , our democracy too wise to fail .
The economy ’s unraveling this fall is but the latest grave reminder that nothing is guaranteed .
In a few short years , we have squandered our resources and international prestige on an ill - advised war .
Through blind faith in deregulated markets , our leaders have undermined the nation ’s economic stability while recklessly creating a national debt of $ 10 trillion .
Americans need a clean and dramatic break from the derelict policies of George W. Bush .
We desperately need a president who will restore our standing in the world and re-energize us at home by turning attention to issues that Bush ignored : the need for energy independence , the stagnant wages of the middle class and the lack of affordable health care .
Barack Obama will be such a president .
He speaks to Americans ’ yearning for renewal .
He has the ability to restore America ’s confidence and guide this country toward a more stable and secure future .
Not since John F. Kennedy has a presidential candidate so moved a young generation .
His election would be historic .
It would alter the perception that minorities are limited in what they can achieve ; the world would see an America that not merely preaches racial equality but lives by it .
No candidate is perfect .
Obama , 47 , is a first - term U.S. senator .
He has detailed positions on important issues but not sponsored much important legislation .
He has never run an organization , although neither has Republican John McCain .
But those who dismiss his experience sell short a strong résumé and record of leadership .
Obama combines Bill Clinton ’s intellect and capacity to grasp complex issues with the focus that Clinton lacked .
He would run the White House with the discipline of his campaign , assembling around him smart advisers , starting with vice - presidential nominee Joe Biden .
In the Senate , he has served on the Foreign Relations Committee .
As a state senator in Illinois , he represented a large and diverse constituency .
As a community organizer , he helped solve problems facing working Americans .
At Harvard Law School , where he was a brilliant student , and as a law professor , he developed impressive analytical and oratory skills .
Obama grew up in a multiracial household and came of age in a different generation from McCain .
He has an intuitive understanding of a rapidly changing , interconnected world .
McCain ’s world view was shaped by the Cold War and Vietnam .
That is why Obama has been right , and McCain wrong , on national security issues such as opposing the Iraq war and now advocating a timed withdrawal .
The difference between them is not , as McCain claims , one of resolve but of judgment .
McCain , 72 , says he will better protect America from foreign threats .
But his first major decision , choosing Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for vice president , was reckless and put ambition ahead of national security .
Palin is unqualified for the office ; her folksy but not embarrassing showing in the vice - presidential debate does n’t change that fact .
Scratch the surface of McCain ’s populism , and you get a 26 - year Washington politician whose views mirror Bush ’s .
He would name like - minded judges to the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade .
While he talks about energy independence and environmental protection , his record belies his words .
He would continue a national addiction to oil .
He would make permanent Bush ’s tax cuts for the few ; Obama would aim tax cuts at the middle class .
Economics is not McCain ’s strong suit , as he has acknowledged and lately proven .
The nation needs a president willing to curb derivatives ( and a vice president who knows what they are ) .
Given a voting record supporting deregulation , McCain would not change course .
Obama will rebuild the economy by investing in the right priorities : green technology , scientific research , education and health care .
Some proposals need more thought .
For example , raising the Social Security payroll tax on higher - income workers could stifle job growth because employers would have to match it .
But his overall vision plays to Silicon Valley ’s strengths and America ’s ideals .
The differences between Obama and McCain are stark .
Only Obama has the temperament , intelligence and ideas to set America right .
We enthusiastically urge his election Nov. 4 .
When we wrote 14 Ways to Affair Proof Your Marriage , several people rightly pointed out that the best way to obtain a happy and faithful marriage is to marry the right person .
But how do you know when you ’ve found the right woman to settle down with ?
When it is comes to getting hitched , guys get cold feet for two reasons .
Some guys are uber - picky .
They have a list in their minds of their perfect wife characteristics : hot but not slutty , smart but not nerdy , skinny but a good cook , etc .
Unfortunately , no real woman can live up to the fantasy , and these guys stay perpetually single .
The second type of guy looks at others ’ failed marriages , particularly his own parents , and wo n’t get married because of the fear of choosing the wrong woman .
The truth is that knowing you ’ve found the right woman to marry is not rocket science .
The decision to marry my wife was the easiest decision I ’ve ever made in my life .
Here are five guidelines that guided me on deciding my wife was the one for me :
1 . The relationship goes smoothly from the beginning .
The best relationships I have seen , including my own , happened completely naturally from start to finish .
The couple meets , they get along swimmingly , they start dating , and then they get married .
My wife and I never had a single dreaded “ DTR ” ( Define the Relationship ) during our courtship .
Everything about our relationship felt like the most natural thing in the world .
We never broke up and got back together .
Or even considered doing so .
In contrast , many couples break up and get back together numerous times .
They fight and then make up and then fight again .
I ’m not saying that men in such volatile relationships should not get hitched .
But the volatility will inevitably continue into the marriage .
Whether that volatility is acceptable is up to each individual man and their sense of the strength of that relationship .
2 . She gets along well with your family and friends .
Now there may be exceptions to this rule : your girlfriend and one of your friends or family members may simply have clashing personality traits .
But in general , it is a red flag if your girlfriend does not mix well with your loved ones .
Think about it — your family raised you and made you who you are , and you picked your friends based on your common interests and values .
If she does n’t like them and they do n’t like her , then it may mean you are not seeing something important about your girlfriend that they see .
When you are in love , it often blurs your vision and judgment .
Your loved ones have an outsider ’s perspective on the relationship .
This does n’t mean you should break up with a woman just because your friends and family do n’t like her .
If you are sure of your relationship , be confident in moving forward with it .
But it is wise to seek honest feedback from others .
3 . There is nothing major you want to change about her .
There will always be differences and conflicts in a relationship .
But if there is something truly significant about your girlfriend that you wish she would change , then that is a red flag .
In the initial stages of a relationship , when your brain is bathed with love chemicals , you may be willing to overlook the flaw or even find it strangely endearing .
But after several years , when the love chemicals have ebbed , this flaw may begin to grate on your soul .
Remember , people seldom change , and marriage wo n’t make her change either .
If there ’s something about your girlfriend that you know deep down you can’t live with , than it ’s time to move on .
You ’re wasting both of your times .
4 . She ’s your best friend .
Physical attraction and chemistry are obviously crucial to any relationship .
But at the core of the relationship should be a strong and deeply rooted friendship .
Forty years down the line you ’re both going to be soft , wrinkly , and saddled with low libidos .
What ’s going to hold your marriage together when you are old and gray is your friendship .
Therefore , if you feel like your girlfriend is your best friend in the world , there is a very good chance that she is the one for you .
Do you want to spend all your time with her ?
Does she make any situation from going to a ballgame to doing your taxes more enjoyable ?
Do you feel like you could tell her anything and that she knows more about you than anyone in the world ?
Yes ?
Well then , she ’s a keeper .
5 . The thought of marrying her does n’t scare you in the least .
While the image of a man shaking in his boots and having second thoughts the night before his wedding makes for good TV and movie plots , the reality is that when you are marrying the “ one , ” you wo n’t be scared at all .
Throughout the entire period of dating and being engaged , up until the night before my wedding , I never had a single second thought about my impending nuptials .
The only thing I felt was happiness and excited anticipation .
Like all of these tips , your mileage on this one may vary .
I ’m not saying that if you are nervous you should n’t get married .
But if you go back and forth every week about whether you have made the right decision , you may want to do some serious soul searching .
At my wedding my father - in - law said , “ Marriage is not about finding a person you can live with , it ’s about finding the person you ca n’t live without . ”
When you find that woman , you can be sure she ’s the one .

SQL Injection seems to be a pretty common theme around here on TDWTF .
It 's not so much pointing out SQL Injection vulnerabilities ( aside from that one state that leaked a whole bunch of SSNs ) , but instead exploring all those " unique " ways that developers try to address the problem .
Well , here are three more to add to the mix .
" I found this particular snippet in the external sales portal at my company , " wrote Ben , " it 's a technique that appears throughout the site in various queries .
This was their attempt to protect the database from SQL injection attacks . "
$ sql = " select * from customers where " .
" email_address = ' " . base64_decode(base64_encode( $email_address ) ) . " ' and password = ' " . base64_decode(base64_encode ( $password ) ) . " ' " ;
As it turned out , encoding a string in Base64 and then decoding it does n't do all that much .
It did feel pretty sneaky , though .
Vincent Ballard found this next snippet in the authentication code for the project he'd been assigned to .
//
The following string is an SQL comment , and could // blank out the check for password in our SQL statement // if used in the username ! if ( username.indexOf ( " ' ; -- " ) != - 1 ) { throw new AuthorisationException ( username + " given as login name contains ';-- , this is bad for SQL ! " ) ; } //
Get the ( hopefully single ) id of the player with // this name and password ResultSet authorised = statement.executeQuery ( " SELECT id FROM table_name_redacted WHERE " + " username= ' " +username + " ' AND password= ' " + password + " ' ; " ) ;
It 's a bit better , but does n't quite fool the hacker who uses the " ' ; --" attack instead of " ' ;--" .
Surprisingly , today 's most effective injection prevention comes from a whole bunch of financial institutions , thanks software provided by Harland Financial Solutions .
Instead of bothering with that " parameterized query " nonsense , they just simply ban all hacker words :
Why can’t I use certain words like " drop " as part of my Security Question answers ?
There are certain words used by hackers to try to gain access to systems and manipulate data ; therefore , the following words are restricted : " select , " " delete , " " update , " " insert , " " drop " and " null " .
You have to especially be careful about that last one on the list .
When you start throwing the n-word around , systems will be hacked .
Il resoconto della mia indagine su Altadefinizione , il famose sito pirata di film streaming , dove ho cercato di capire quale tra i numerosi cloni presenti in internet fosse l'originale .
Ho cercato di seguire ogni pista possibile per giungere all ' origine , ho fatto domande ( sconclusionate ) , ho spulciato qualsiasi articolo a riguardo e vagato per internet in cerca di risposte .
Ho scoperto che quell
The John McCain campaign sent out more than 1 million applications for absentee ballots to Republicans .
Each had a line at the top next to a box : " I am a qualified elector . "
Brunner sent a memo telling county election officials to reject those applications for absentee ballots if the box was not checked .
" Failure to check the box leaves both the applicant and the board of elections without verification that the applicant is a ' qualified elector ' , " she wrote .
But that 's contrary to state law and Brunner does n't have the authority , according to the lawsuit and an opinion from Hamilton County 's Republican Prosecutor Joe Deters .
Ohio law allows voters to request an absentee ballot on the back of a grocery sack if they want to , as long as they include their name , address , date of birth , signature and either a driver 's license number , last four Social Security numbers or a valid picture I.D .

“ The other folks are voting . ”
Yes , he really said that .
Politico reports on Senator Chambliss ’ tour of North Georgia :

Tell us , Senator , who are these “ other folks ” ?
John Kerry believes that the so - called al Qaeda Halloween videotape released days before the last presidential election in the United States affected enough undecided voters that it may have made the difference in the outcome .
Remember that a swing of only 60,000 voters in Ohio would have resulted in a President Kerry .
Experts still debate whether it was al Qaeda 's intention to affect the Spanish political process when it attacked the Madrid commuter train network three days before that country 's March 2004 election .
The attack did result in an electoral defeat for the incumbent party , which had sent troops to Iraq at the request of the United States .
And , of course , there is Pakistan , where a terrorist assassination killed Benazir Bhutto , a candidate for prime minister , just 10 months ago .
CIA Director Mike Hayden publicly blamed Baitullah Mehsud , the Pakistani radical , but said he acted with help from the broader al Qaeda network .
Bhutto had promised to combat the Taliban , al Qaeda , and similar groups inside Pakistan .
Is al Qaeda really sophisticated enough to attempt to manipulate democratic elections in Europe , Asia , and America ?
It is difficult to judge how adept they are at achieving their desired results .
We do know that Osama bin Laden reads western opinion polls , if only because on one occasion he discussed fairly obscure European opinion surveys in some detail .
Given that history , what can we expect in the next month ; will al Qaeda try to influence the 2008 U.S. presidential election ?
Some analysts saw the opening salvos of an al Qaeda campaign in the two attacks on American targets that came within three days of each other two weeks ago .
First , al Qaeda mounted a large and sophisticated assault on the American embassy in Yemen .
Many analysts are surprised that the attack failed and that the local guard force fought back courageously and well .
Al Qaeda 's plan seemed to be to penetrate the embassy wall , gather up Americans , and then kill them in a series of terrorist suicides with explosive belts .
Second , al Qaeda attacked the Marriott hotel in Islamabad with a large truck bomb .
This attack seems to have been aimed at the Pakistani president , prime minister , and cabinet who were supposed to be dining there at the time but were not because of a last - minute decision to change the venue to a more secure location .
Two U.S. military personnel who were dining there died in the attack .
Those who see the two attacks as the opening round of a pre-election campaign note that they were the first two major al Qaeda - related attacks on American facilities in a very long time , the first serious al Qaeda attack on an American embassy in a decade .
Others believe that the timing of the two attacks was coincidence and that they were both dictated by internal dynamics in the countries where the attacks took place and not by the U.S. election campaign .
Nonetheless , U.S. intelligence and security officials are worried .
They admit that there is nothing concrete that suggests another attack , but they fear that al Qaeda may try something , maybe even in the United States .
The last National Intelligence Estimate on al Qaeda concluded that the group had reconstituted , was stronger than it had been in many years , was capable of staging attacks again , including probably in the United States .
General Hayden has talked publicly about " European looking " al Qaeda terrorists who have been trained recently in Pakistan and sent back out into the world , presumably to stage attacks .
These " Europeans " may have European Union passports , which would mean that they could enter the United State without a visa .
If they are what police call " clean skins " ( people whose names do not appear in the database of suspected terrorists ) , they could easily enter the country .
Hayden suggested that they could be standing next to you " in the line at Dulles Airport , " and you would not be suspicious of them .
If they do show up in the United States , it is not hard to get weapons or fertilizers that can be converted quickly into explosives .
So , another attack in this country before the election is at least theoretically possible .
At the very least , expect another Halloween video from the scary man in the cave .
What would be the purpose of any attempted manipulation of the U.S. election ?
It could just be to use the election to magnify the media coverage of their terrorist activities , make al Qaeda look even more capable than it is , and remind everyone they are still around .
Such a media - amplified attack might help them with recruitment and fundraising .
Even more likely is the possibility that al Qaeda would hope the attack would benefit John McCain .
Opinion polls , which , as noted above , al Qaeda reads closely , suggest that an attack would help McCain .
Polls in Europe and the Middle East also suggest an overwhelming popular support there for Barack Obama .
Al Qaeda would not like it if there were a popular American president again .
Here 's some " straight - talk " for ya from Nebraska 's Senior Senator .
“ I think it ’s a stretch to , in any way , to say that she ’s got the experience to be president of the United States , ” Hagel said .
" I think they ought to be just honest about it and stop the nonsense about , ' I look out my window and I see Russia and so therefore I know something about Russia , ' " he said .
" That kind of thing is insulting to the American people . "

Prime Minister Gordon Brown has condemned Iceland 's handling of the collapse of its banks and its failure to guarantee British savers ' deposits .
He said its action were " effectively illegal " and " completely unacceptable " .
The UK government has frozen all UK - held assets of the Icelandic bank Landsbanki after it collapsed .
Iceland 's prime minister Geir Haarde said it was " not very pleasant " to learn that anti-terror laws were being used to deal with the company .
Landsbanki , one of many banks hit heavily by the global credit crunch , was taken over by the Icelandic government and declared insolvent on Tuesday .
The 300,000 UK customers of its subsidiary IceSave were unable to access their accounts .
' Further action ' UK Chancellor Alistair Darling later announced that all UK savers affected would be protected .
But the government has not yet offered the same for more than £ 900 m known to have been invested in Icelandic banks by UK councils , police and transport authorities .
In an interview with BBC political editor Nick Robinson , Mr Brown said the government was talking with local authorities about what could be done and intended to recover as much money as possible .
He added : " What happened in Iceland is completely unacceptable .
I 've been in touch with the Icelandic prime minister .
I said this is effectively illegal action that they have taken .
They have failed not only the people of Iceland ; they have failed people in Britain
Gordon Brown on Icelandic authorities
Councils ' not reckless with cash '
" We are freezing the assets of Icelandic companies in the United Kingdom where we can .
We will take further action against the Icelandic authorities wherever that is necessary to recover money . "
He added : " This is fundamentally a problem with the Icelandic - registered financial services authority - they have failed not only the people of Iceland , they have failed people in Britain . "
Mr Haarde , asked if he felt there was a crisis in relations between Britain and Iceland , said : " I thought so for a few minutes this morning when I realised that a terrorist law was being applied against us .
" That was not very pleasant .
I 'm afraid that not many governments would have taken that very kindly , to be put in that category and I told the chancellor that we were not pleased with that . "
Diplomatic moves
But he said he had cleared up a number of issues with Mr Darling .
Minister for Work and Pensions , James Purnell , said efforts were going on to ease the diplomatic situation with Iceland .

" Clearly it 's been unacceptable that Iceland was only acting to protect its own depositors .
" That 's why we 've acted to protect ours , and it's also been frustrating we have n't been able to get in sort of proper communication with them .
That is now something that 's been addressed - Treasury officials are going there in the next few days - and we want to make sure that we address this in a way that 's constructive with the Icelandic government . "

A patrol officer arrived at the scene first , and a few minutes later , a unit of Emergency Service officers .
When they arrived , the police said , Mr. Morales ran onto the fire escape outside his third - floor apartment .
Fleeing the officers up the fire escape , he tried to enter an apartment on the fourth floor by pushing in an air - conditioner , the police said .
Unsuccessful , he then descended to the second - floor fire escape and from there jumped down to the security - gate housing for a ground - floor storefront , which was about 10 feet from the sidewalk .
As an officer was securing himself on the second - floor fire escape , Mr. Morales jabbed at him with an eight - foot - long fluorescent light tube , the police said .
Under orders from a lieutenant , the officer on the sidewalk , who is 37 and has been in the department for 10 years , used the Taser on Mr. Morales , according to the police , and he fell to the sidewalk , hitting his head .
That was at 2:27 , the Police Department said , about 22 minutes after the Emergency Service officers arrived at the scene .
The police said an officer at the scene had radioed for an inflatable bag , and it was not clear why the bag had not arrived when Mr. Morales fell , or why the officers had not waited for it before using the Taser on Mr. Morales .
Mr. Morales was taken to Kings County Hospital Center with serious head trauma and was later pronounced dead .
The cause of death has not yet been determined .
The order not to use the Taser in such circumstances appears in a 10 - page interim order issued by the Police Department in June .
Mr. Browne said that the order was released before the distribution of new holsters for police sergeants , who were ordered to carry their Tasers with them , rather than keep them in their cars , as they had previously done .
Emergency Service officers have been carrying them for 24 years .

The order discusses types of people the Taser should not be used on , including children , the elderly and pregnant women , and instructs officers not to use them “ in situations where the subject may fall from an elevated surface . ”

A Kentucky judge has upheld that state 's seizure of some of the world 's most popular online casino domain names , ruling they constitute a " gambling device " that is subject to Kentucky 's anti-gambling laws .
Last week 's ruling by Franklin County Circuit Judge Thomas Wingate applies to absolutepoker.com , ultimatebet.com , and 139 other domain names accused of illegally offering gambling opportunities to Kentucky residents .
Wingate said he had legal standing to seize ownership of the domain names even though few if any of the owners are located in the state , an element the opponents argued was necessary for the seizure to be upheld .
" We note that opposing groups and lawyers argue any judicial interference of the internet will create havoc , " Wingate wrote in his October 16 ruling ( PDF ) .
" The internet , with all its benefits and advantages to modern day commerce and life , is still not above the law , whether on an international or municipal level . "
The 43 - page decision upholds a previous ruling Wingate issued in secret ordering domain name registrars to transfer ownership of 141 internet addresses to Kentucky officials .
The state 's Justice and Public Safety Cabinet filed its complaint under seal and obtained the ruling before the casinos had an opportunity to argue against the motion .
In a September 26 court hearing , lawyers representing the domain name owners argued Wingate 's order should be overturned .
Among other things , they said the court lacked jurisdiction over the forfeiture of domain names because they are rights granted in a service contract rather than property that is owned .
They also argued that because the domain names were n't physically located in Kentucky , Wingate 's court did not have authority to seize them .
Wingate shot those arguments down .
The domain names " perform a critical role in creating and maintaining connection by way of the various interfaces to transact a game or play , " he wrote .
" Accordingly , but subject to further review during the forfeiture hearing , the court finds reasonable bases to conclude that the internet gambling operators and their property , the internet domain names , are present in Kentucky . "
He went on to write that the domain names " are virtual keys for entering and creating virtual casinos from the desktop of a resident in Kentucky .
The domain name is indispensable in maintaining the player 's continuing access to the virtual casinos which serve as the internet gambling operators premises for conducting illegal gambling activity . "
The dispute is the latest example of the difficulty of regulating activity on the internet , a medium that in many ways breaks down geographical boundaries .
If decisions like Wingate 's are allowed to propagate , any site on the once freewheeling internet could be subject to the laws of the most world 's most restrictive states .
Wingate said he was inclined to lift the seizure of Goldenpalace.com because the website is limited to ads for third - party gambling websites .
Wingate also amended his earlier seizure order to exempt any online casino that uses geographic filtering to block Kentucky residents from using the services .
Those that do not will be ordered to forfeit their domain names .
Oral arguments on the forfeiture are scheduled for November 17 . ®
You know , I always feel for heterosexual or bisexual folks when they clearly have paid attention to this stuff , done the reading or just talked to women , put it all together and have that " Whoah ! " moment about this issue .
With so many people reared to think that male - female vaginal intercourse is THE sex , and how many gender issues are often involved in that social conditioning , even though it 's ultimately positive to start reaching these conclusions about the reality of the thing , for plenty of people , it can feel like an awful lot of air is being let out of the proverbial sails .
But really , I swear : it 's a positive realization that benefits everybody .
Let 's take a look at that piece together , okay ?
( You might also find it helpful to look at this article , Yield for Pleasure and this one , Vagzilla !
( Or , All Genitals Great and Small ) ) .
First of all , understand that the clitoris is bigger than it looks : it is n't just the glans and the hood that you can see on the outside , it 's also internal , as explained and illustrated about halfway through that article .
Imagine , if you would , if a penis were internal : the clitoris as a whole is about the same size , internal and external combined .
A guy can even get a sense of that just by feeling his penis through a pair of jeans .
If someone , say , is straddling a male 's lap and rocking their weight over the area where the penis is , inside pants , that guy most certainly feels something .
That 's part of how vaginal intercourse can provide some clitoral stimulus : the pressure of another person 's body on the vulva entire , as well as the internal pressure of the penis ( or a silicone substitute ) stimulating the clitoris in a general way .
Another big why that front portion of the vaginal canal is the most sensitive -- as opposed to the back half of the vagina , where we have no real sensory nerve endings at all -- is that parts of the internal clitoris surround it , and the g - spot is just inside there , too .
So , again , women can feel pleasurable pressure on those portions during intercourse and other kinds of vaginal sex .
With intercourse , that tends to be more generalized pressure than something more specific and targeted -- such as say , with fingers -- but some women like that feeling of general pressure , and some even prefer it to more direct stimulus .
Too , certain sexual positions put weight and pressure on the internal and / or external clitoris .
The clitoris really is not that far from the vaginal opening , nor does intercourse only put pressure on the vaginal opening and vaginal canal .
A female partner who wants to have intercourse can let her partner in on which positions are best for her when it comes to her clitoris .
This topic , and so much related to it , is so loaded : a lot of people have a whole lot of big feelings , thoughts and confusion about intercourse and gender and anatomy and sexual partnership .
If you want to talk to us about it , you can find us on our moderated forums , or , if you 're in the United States , at our text helpline at : ( 206 ) 866-2279 .
But overall , is intercourse , all by itself , something a majority of women find completely satisfying , physically or otherwise ?
Is it something which will cause a majority of women to reach orgasm through ?
No , it is n't .
It 's also something a great many men do n't find completely satisfying all by itself either -- and not just because just like vaginal intercourse does n't always stimulate the clitoris or g- spot , intercourse does n't stimulate the prostate gland or the rest of a man 's body and sensitive bits .
Are women whose sex lives are ONLY about vaginal intercourse usually feeling very fulfilled ?
No , not usually .
But when that is the case , it also often is n't just about not getting enough clitoral stimulus : it tends to also be about how it emotionally feels to only engage in that activity and what the dynamics of sexual relationships tend to be like when intercourse is the only kind of sex being had .
Another truth of the matter is that even when we take away any anatomical issues , having one kind of sex all the time , or making one kind of sex THE sex , is like eating the same meal every single day .
Sure , that meal might sustain us in some ways , but it 's not likely to stimulate us very much , physically , emotionally or intellectually .
For the most part , with any kind of sex , for most couples and most people it is all about combining more than one activity at a time .
For example , it 's incredibly easy for women to get very direct clitoral stimulation during intercourse by just having themselves or a partner manually ( with fingers ) rub the clitoris during that intercourse , or use a vibrator .
Too , if women want vaginal insertion that gives more specific , rather than general , pressure , their partners can use their fingers and hands or mouths rather than penises .
I am sure I did not write that the " clitoris is the source of pleasure for a woman . "
Sure , it 's mostly a matter of semantics , but the semantics are important in this case .
Pleasure -- for men or women -- and sexual pleasure are far more complex things than to be found or derived in one , small place , and it 's really helpful for everyone to really understand and internalize that .
Not only do women differ a lot , but our whole bodies -- whatever our gender is -- are sexual organs and places of pleasure .
As well , whether we do or do n't experience pleasure during sex , how much or how little , also has , in many ways , a lot more to do with our brains , our whole nervous systems and the specific dynamics involved in sex with someone else than with our sexual anatomy .
What was written there is that the clitoris is the primary source of most genital sensation .
Not most pleasure .
Pleasure is a very multifaceted thing .
To give you a solid example , understand that someone being sexually assaulted might get clitoral stimulus and yet be feeling the literal opposite of pleasure .
Just touching a pleasurable spot on the body does not always pleasure make .
There was a study that came out a little while ago about the positive motivations for teenage partnered sex which showed that more young women who had sex did so primarily for emotional reasons and benefits than for physical pleasure as compared to young men .
My first reaction to that , as a feminist , was that that was likely because so many women have been reared being told that is what they SHOULD enjoy most with sex , and so many women have simply accepted that so much of the sex they are having is n't about their pleasure .
For sure , that is going to be part of the issue , and by that same token , young men have the same or similar motivations , but we are n't hearing about it as much because men are so often reared told that they should NOT enjoy the emotional aspects of sex most , or give them any real priority .
As well , we also know that for many young men ( and plenty of older men ) , social status and personal validation can be a bigger driver for partnered sex than physical pleasure .
But at the same time , we really can't say partnered ( or solo , really ) sex is somehow just physical or just emotional , because it is interpersonal and because our sexuality is n't just physical : it is about our identity , our feelings , our unique history and personality , about the intellectual , the psychological and the spiritual .
And partnered sex is also about what pleasure we derive from our partner 's pleasure .
Sexuality is big stuff .
We also have to be pretty careful saying that sex is more or less pleasurable for people as a whole because of the reasons why people report to enjoy it .
In other words , if a given person finds great enjoyment in intercourse that is very emotionally enriching for them , but which does n't result in orgasm , we can't really say that it 's somehow unilaterally better for people with the opposite experience .
Sexuality is very individual , and so are sexual experiences .
Obviously , the ideal is for any sexual activity to feel bloody fantastic emotionally and bloody fantastic physically .
But often enough , no matter what we 're doing , just because our moods , state of being in our bodies , relationship dynamics and the whole lot differ from day to day , even with the same sexual activity , we 'll have varied experiences .
So , for those women who say they do n't get a lot of physical pleasure from intercourse , but do get a lot of emotional pleasure , not only do we have to believe them -- rather than just presuming they only speak about this in the way they were taught to -- we also have to value their experiences and personal preferences without analyzing them to death .
Which part of something they enjoy is n't all that important : what 's important is simply that it is pleasurable and positive for them .
In the case that some or all of those women were or are only saying what they think they should , and really are not enjoying their sex lives and the intercourse they 're having at all , then we have to simply afford them the respect of accepting that they will change that for themselves if they want to at some point .
I do n't know if you have girl - parts or boy - parts , but whichever it is , know that whatever sexual activities it is that you and your partners together enjoy most , by whatever merits and in whatever ways or combinations , are just fine .
If , in fact , it turns out that for you , or for a partner you have , intercourse is n't that exciting -- even when combined with other activities -- but other sexual activities do the job better , there 's not a thing in the world wrong with that .
You may find too , as many people do , that what you and your partners enjoy does n't stay the same , but shifts from partnership to partnership or scenario to scenario : a woman may enjoy vaginal intercourse in some situations and partnerships more than she does in others .
And there are also women who just plain do n't like intercourse at all , but that gets to be just as okay as men who just plain do n't enjoy being on the receiving end of anal sex .
Because any one sexual activity is n't someone 's thing does n't mean that a person is somehow missing out : most people will have something that they either do n't like or just do n't find very compelling , and that 's no big whoop .
If you want to delve more into this issue , I have a pretty substantial section of my book which addresses intercourse dynamics and underwhelm , and you might also have a look at this piece , which talks about human sexual response , arousal and orgasm in depth .
You might also find this piece , which addresses the metaphysics of entry , of interest .

My latest Guardian column is up : " Warning to copyright enforcers : Three strikes and you 're out " argues that if the entertainment industry wants the right to disconnect accused infringers after three accusations , then they should be prepared to have their corporate Internet access terminated if they make three false accusations .

The internet is only that wire that delivers freedom of speech , freedom of assembly , and freedom of the press in a single connection .
It 's only
vital to the livelihood , social lives , health , civic engagement , education and leisure of hundreds of millions of people ( and growing every day ) .
This trivial bit of kit is so unimportant that it 's only natural that we equip the companies that brought us Police Academy 11 , Windows Vista , Milli Vanilli and Celebrity Dancing
With the Stars with wire - cutters that allow them to disconnect anyone in the country on their own say - so , without proving a solitary act of wrongdoing .
But if that magic wire is indeed so trivial , they wo n't mind if we hold them to the same standard , right ?

Israeli Yamam police invade the home of Abu Majed Eisha in Beit Hanina .
( Jill Shaw )

And what exactly is an “ ordinary ” home demolition in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories ?
According to Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions ( ICAHD ) founder , Jeff Halper , house demolitions are one of Israel ’s main weapons in its occupation of Palestine .
Sadly , this extraordinary and devastating phenomenon is not at all uncommon to Palestinians .
ICAHD , an Israeli group whose primary mission is to resist Israel ’s practice of home demolitions , states that 18,000 Palestinian homes have been demolished by Israel since 1967 .
Additionally , another 22,000 East Jerusalem homes have demolition orders on them .
This does not include the thousands of homes with demolition orders throughout the rest of the West Bank .
The reason for the destruction ?
Quite simply , the houses do n’t have permits .
And without a permit , your house is illegal , and therefore subject to demolition .
It is this bureaucratic logic that gives Israel ’s practice of bulldozing Palestinian homes a veneer of legitimacy , for , after all , only “ illegal ” houses are demolished .
Look a bit further , however , and it quickly becomes apparent that building permits are nearly impossible for Palestinians to obtain , so in fact , any new growth homes are usually illegal .
During my two weeks ’ participation in ICAHD ’s summer rebuilding program , I heard the same story repeated countless times from Palestinian residents of Anata , another East Jerusalem neighborhood .
Anata reminded me of photos of Afghanistan , marked as it was by piles of rubble and half - demolished homes .
Surrounded by this landscape , Palestinians told of spending thousands of dollars over a period of years applying for building permits with the Israeli authorities , only to be denied repeatedly .
Reasons for denial range from the illogical to the outright absurd : permits were denied because the land was zoned for agricultural purposes , though the land was pure desert .
In other cases , permits were withheld because the land was on an inappropriately steep slope , though much of the land in Jerusalem , both East and West , is on a steep slope .
Does the moniker “ city on a hill ” sound familiar ?
Eventually , most Palestinians will build , or in Abu Eishah ’s case , expand their homes , without a permit .
This is why 22,000 families in East Jerusalem go to bed at night knowing that they may awake the next morning to find Israeli soldiers and bulldozers at their doorstep .
According to Salim Shawamreh , whose home in Anata was demolished and rebuilt four times , police usually arrive before or at dawn , while the family is still sleeping .
Police and sometimes military , depending on the home ’s location , will surround the house and call for the family to come outside .
If the family resists , the police will forcefully remove the family , at which point , the bulldozers will begin their work .
Sometimes families are allowed to quickly remove some or all of their possessions , and sometimes they are not .
When our group of 18 internationals , hearkening from as far afield as Norway and Finland , America , Portugal and Spain , arrived at the site in Beit Hanina , we learned that five families called it home .
A large family lived in the first two floors , while the top two floors each contained two apartments .
Residents of the building told us that the first two floors were licensed , but that the top two were not .
Abu Eisha had tried unsuccessfully to obtain a permit to expand .
When that failed , he did what most Palestinians do — he built anyway .
Rather than a fine , Abu Eisha received a demolition order , which he had spent the last two years fighting against in court .
On the morning of 27 July , Abu Eisha also lost this battle when the court finally handed down a definitive demolition order .
Word spread quickly .
By the time our group arrived , about 80 of Abu Eisha ’s friends and neighbors were gathered together inside the house , smoking , drinking tea , and sharing stories of misery and insult living under Israeli rule .
After discussing what we would do if the police came , some of us drifted off to sleep , hoping that we would wake at a normal hour to a regular morning .
Instead , the warning call came at about 3:30 am .
A neighbor down the main road had seen the police heading towards the house .
Screams rang out through the first floor to wake those who had been sleeping , and a large group ran out of the house and down the small street to the main road .
Men rushed to tip over the large municipal trash dumpsters on either side of the street leading up to the home , while others rushed to park their cars zig - zag style up the street leading to Abu Eisha ’s house .
One could only wonder if the fury with which the Israelis stormed the house was piqued by these vain attempts to block their entry .
Soon , yelling erupted again .
The municipal and border police had been sighted coming down the main road .
Everyone bolted back up to the house .
Within minutes , the Yamam police , the Israeli equivalent of a SWAT team , stormed the house .
The Yamam were dressed in full body armor , faces masked in black , armed with American M - 16s , and accompanied by attack dogs .
The only resistance offered by the Palestinians against this onslaught was a few choruses of “ God is great . ”
The first two floors of the building were quickly emptied , with many Palestinians and activists being hit with batons or fists , or worse , being kicked in the back while running away .
Activists and families from the upstairs apartments reported being similarly treated , and were not allowed time to gather or retrieve any personal items .
Once outside , Palestinians were scrambling to get away from the house and down to the main street while police continued to stream into the house .
The main street was crowded with dozens of police cars , a few ambulances and bulldozers .
As Palestinians and internationals from ICAHD , the International Solidarity Movement , and Faculty for Israeli - Palestinian Peace continued to pour into the street , Israeli police cordoned off the area , aggressively forcing back those who did not back up immediately .
I saw one particularly brutal policeman rush forward and punch a Norwegian woman in the face , the force of which threw her to the ground .
Once the initial shock of being raided and thrown into the street in the middle of the night had subsided , the muted drama of waiting began .
The police formed a human line in front of the street leading to the house , presumably to block the residents and owners from being freshly inflamed by any view of their homes being wired with explosives .
While the police held their line , chatting , laughing , passing along water bottles to each other , the approximately 100 Palestinians in the street cried , consoled each other , and mainly waited .
A few gave interviews to the few press members who were on the scene , including a Reuters reporter and a reporter from Palestine Media .
The one thing no one did was engage in violence of any kind .
When one young man started to walk towards the police with his belt in hand , looking either like he was going to hurl a stone or lash one of the police , a few of his elders rushed to him , embraced him , and pulled him back away from the police .
Each man had tears in his eyes .
When the call to prayer came before dawn , the men lined up in a neat row and began praying , exactly opposite the line of police .
The two lines of people , one line of young Israeli men and women dressed in full combat uniform with guns slung at their sides , and the other of mostly middle - aged Palestinian men in civilian clothes , could not have been staring across a wider divide , though they were only separated by about 200 feet .
Many of the praying men’s eyes were moist with tears , and I saw one man who had been kicked by a policeman stumble to rise from his knees .
After the prayers ended , the waiting began again .
A few bulldozers pulled up , some police arrived on horses , and a UN jeep came and went .
Rabbi Arik Ascherman , Executive Director of Rabbis for Human Rights , had managed to pass the roadblocks and arrived with copies of Abu Eisha ’s building permit in hand .
He offered the copies to a number of disinterested police , and then fell back with the rest of us to wait .
The waiting lasted for about half a day .
The estimated 300-400 police stood in one line chatting and laughing , occasionally rushing forward to back up the crowd , mainly staring straight ahead .
The Palestinians milled about , hugged , cried and occasionally screamed at the Israelis .
Those of us with ICAHD left the scene at about 9am , but were informed later that evening that the house had indeed been demolished .
Because of its size , it was wired with explosives and blown up , rather than bulldozed .
The next day , I went to the former home of five Palestinian families , and saw the gorgeous building I had visited only two nights before lying in a hideous mass of rubble .
Neighbors and former residents were also there , processing this new reality .
A few of the trees alongside the erstwhile terrace were still standing aside the wreckage .
The planted flower beds lining the front of the house remained as well , framing the sign the municipality had posted , stating “ Caution , Dangerous Building , Entry Forbidden , ” with a cartoon picture of a man standing outside an unstable house that looks as if it might fall on him .
Disregarding the sign , I climbed atop the rubble to fully absorb the destruction .
I saw a biology textbook diagramming the development of a fetus , the red and white matching sofa set of the single mother who had only just moved in , a stove still fully intact , and other objects of domestic life .
I also saw a Fatah party flag waving atop the metal rods spiraling out of one of the fallen cement columns .
As I moved to snap a photo , five Israeli police , all of whom I recognized from the morning before , arrived again , still fully armored and armed .
As I scrambled down from the building , two of the police climbed up , scaled the cement pillar , and removed the flag .
The Palestinians could only shake their heads .
As I witnessed this , the same question from the morning before repeated in my head : “ How does any of this help ensure Israel ’s security ? ”
The simple answer is , it does n’t .
But home demolitions , like most aspects of Israeli policy in the Occupied Palestinian Territories , have more to do with Israel ’s agenda of land acquisition rather than its security .
How could policies that humiliate , deprive , confine and brutalize the Palestinians , leading to the diminishing of options and a subsequent sense of despair , ever ensure the security of Israel and its people ?
Though Israel routinely invokes “ security ” as a catch - all rationale for its policies , it ’s hard to see the logic of this argument in cases like the demolition of Abu Eisha ’s home .
However , from another lens , the demolition makes terrible sense .
Every Palestinian
I met in Jerusalem spoke of the undeniable truth as they experience it : Israel is making life economically and emotionally impossible for Palestinians in order to squeeze them out of the area .
This is particularly true for Palestinians who remain in coveted Jerusalem , and might explain why 22,000 East Jerusalem houses have outstanding demolition orders .
This is why Jeff Halper believes that house demolitions are one of Israel ’s main weapons in its arsenal of occupation .
Demolish the home , demolish the family , demolish the spirit , and maybe , just maybe , the people will follow .
Jill Shaw is an American living in San Francisco , where she works as a criminal defense investigator .
Shaw was in Palestine recently as a participant in the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions ’ two - week summer rebuilding program .

Explaining Greatness
A guy at worked showed me this and after some intense , once or twice , google searching I could n’t find anything relating to it on zee web .
So I made a comic out of it .
When you jump down the rabbit hole of starting your own webcomic it becomes very easy to build up animosity towards other webcomics .
Such as a really successful stick figure comic .
But , somehow XKCD keeps me coming back with the sheer content and hilariousness of the comic .
I just hope this is n’t old news and I just missed it .
* Note : This was by far the most successful comic of V2 , it brought in so many Stumbles , Redditers , Diggers and general fans of XKCD .
However it also made me feel bad to piggy back off of Mr. Munroe 's success .
However , I am grateful that hardly a negative word was muttered regarding this and tt is my sincere hope that if V3 were to ever see this kind of success again that it would come on its own merit .

Engineers expect contact to be lost with Ulysses very soon
The solar wind - the stream of charged particles billowing away from the Sun - is at its weakest for 50 years .
Scientists made the assessment after studying 18 years of data from the Ulysses satellite which has sampled the space environment all around our star .
They expect the reduced output to have effects right across the Solar System .
Indeed , one impact is to diminish slightly the influence the Sun has over its local environment which extends billions of kilometres into space .
Even though the end is now in sight , every day 's worth of new data is adding to our knowledge of the Sun and its environment
Richard Marsden
Esa 's Ulysses project scientist Confirmation of that prediction should come from the far - distant Voyager spacecraft which were launched in the 1970s and are now bearing down on the edge of the heliosphere - the great " bubble " of wind material that surrounds the Sun .
Scientists now predict the Voyagers will hit the edge and cross over into interstellar space - that region considered to be " between the stars " - sooner than anticipated .
Space age
The solar wind , which originates in the Sun 's hot outer atmosphere known as the corona , gusts and calms with the star 's familiar 11 - year cycle of activity ( but also over its less well known longer cycles , too ) .
Calmer wind conditions would be expected to prevail right now , but the Ulysses data indicates circumstances unprecedented in recent times .
The Sun is a variable star ; activity rises and falls in cycles " This is a whole Sun phenomenon , " said Dave McComas , Ulysses solar wind instrument principal investigator , from Southwest Research Institute , San Antonio , US .
" The entire Sun is blowing significantly less hard - about 20 - 25 % less hard - than it was during the last solar minimum 10 - 15 years ago .
" That 's a very significant change .
In fact , the solar wind we 're seeing now is blowing the least hard we 've see it for a prolonged time , since the start of those observations in the 1960s at the start of the space age . "
In addition to being calmer , the wind measured at Ulysses is 13 % cooler .
However , judging from Sun activity data collected by non-satellite methods over the past 200 years , the current behaviour is thought to be well within the long - term norm .
Nonetheless , scientists expect the weakened wind to have a wide range of impacts .
Energetic rays
The charged wind particles also carry with them the Sun 's magnetic field , and this has a protective role in limiting the number of high - energy cosmic rays that can enter the Solar System .
More of them will probably now make their way through .
Many of these rays , which include electrons and atomic nuclei , originate in exploding stars and at black holes , and move at colossal speeds .
The Voyager spacecraft will move beyond the solar wind 's influence
They pose no major risk to people on Earth because our atmosphere also works to reduce their intensity ; but they are a consideration for space operations .
The rays can damage satellite electronics , and if current solar wind conditions persist , engineers would have to take this into account when deciding how to " harden " their spacecraft .
Astronauts , too , are at risk from the higher doses of radiation associated with cosmic rays .
" The Sun also puts out cosmic rays in the form of bursts and these bursts are much less frequent at solar minimum .
However , when they do occur at solar minimum , they are more lethal , so this is not a good time to be travelling in space owing to both kinds of cosmic rays , " explained Professor Nancy Crooker , from Boston University , Massachusetts , US .
" Reduced solar activity also leads to the cooling of Earth 's upper atmosphere and if Earth 's upper atmosphere is cooler then there is less drag up there on satellites and this means we are left with much more debris up there - which is also something astronauts have to look out for . "
Some researchers have attempted to link the intensity of cosmic rays at Earth to cloudiness and climate change .
Current conditions may be a good opportunity to test these ideas further .
Artist 's impression :
The wind forms a bubble of material around the Sun
The Ulysses mission is a co-operative venture between the US space agency and the European Space Agency ( Esa ) .
Launched by the shuttle in 1990 , it was the first satellite to study the space environment above and below the Sun 's poles .
It samples the solar wind and solar magnetic field as it circles the star in a six - year orbit that also carries it out to Jupiter and back .
But the harsh conditions of space are now slowly taking their toll on the spacecraft .
Ulysses ' main transmitter no longer works and it is struggling to put enough power into its heating systems .
With the satellite currently moving away from the Sun , it is gradually getting colder ; and engineers expect the hydrazine fuel used in its thrusters to freeze very soon .
When this happens , Ulysses will no longer be able to orientate itself and its antenna , and contact will be lost with Earth .
" Even though the end is now in sight , every day 's worth of new data is adding to our knowledge of the Sun and its environment ; and it's been a great and exciting mission , " said Richard Marsden , Esa 's Ulysses project scientist and mission manager .

I first had bacon noodles the summer of 2002 .
It was the only meal that Karl knew how to cook , so he would often make this recipe for me that summer .
The recipe originates from Karl ’s grandparents , and it is one of our favorites .
Start by chopping the bacon and season with pepper .
1 package Sodium Free Bacon a few pinches ground pepper
Add to a nonstick skillet and cook on high .
Stir continuously to break up the bacon .
Once the bacon is cooked , remove the bacon bits and remove the fat from the pan ( leave the little brown bits in the bottom of the pan ) .
While the bacon is cooking , boil some water for the noodles and cook them according to the directions .
1 bag whole wheat noodles
In the same pan that we cooked the bacon , add the butter .
1 Tablespoon unsalted butter
Add back the cooked noodles and bacon .
Salt and pepper to taste .
Cook for about 10 minutes , flip about every 2 minutes .
This step is very important because it gives the noodle the signature texture .
Also never attempt this step in a non -non - stick pan .
The ideal Bacon Noodles have varying textures on the noodles ; some crunchy , some soft .
Correction to this article
AS THE Democratic National Convention got underway in Denver yesterday , so , too , did a novel attempt to drum up interest in the American electoral process .
Microsoft has tweaked its Xbox video - gaming consoles so that they can be used to register to vote in the presidential election and to participate in opinion polls and online forums .
Part of an initiative to boost youth participation in this year 's election , Microsoft 's move shows how gaming technology can have an impact far beyond the narrow confines of a display screen .
In a forthcoming book called “ Changing the Game ” , David Edery and Ethan Mollick argue that many skills and lessons from the gaming world are applicable in the business world .
The smartest firms , the authors argue , will not only allow game - playing in the workplace , but will actively encourage it .
Shutterstock
Captain of industry ?
To CEOs who throw a tantrum every time they catch someone playing solitaire on an office PC , or who consider video games to be the exclusive preserve of pasty - faced teens , that may sound like daft advice .
It may also smack of bias coming from Mr Edery , who happens to be in charge of game planning for Xbox 's Live Arcade online - gaming system .
( Mr Mollick is an academic at MIT 's Sloan School of Management ) .
But there are good reasons to think that he 's right .
Much ( electronic ) ink has already been spilt about boosting sales through online promotional games .
These “ advergames ” have become a staple of viral marketing campaigns for firms such as Burger King and Intel .
Intel 's “ Silicon Commander ” , for instance , lets users manoeuvre a fleet of robots through a host of IT - related dangers .
Players advance more easily by upgrading their fleet to “ Pro ” models — which happens to be the name of a processing technology developed by Intel .
Admittedly , game - based marketing has had its downs as well as ups .
Many marketing efforts in virtual worlds such as Second Life have flopped .
But to judge the potential value of gaming to business solely on the basis of its ability to promote products is to miss the bigger picture .
According to Messrs Edery and Mollick , by making work more fun and by allowing firms to tap into wisdom beyond their walls , game playing can dramatically improve both productivity and bottom lines .
To see why , consider one of the things it takes to become an ace at , say , World of Warcraft , a hugely popular online fantasy game inhabited by griffins , trolls and other mythical creatures .
To make progress inside the game , players must engage in “ grinding ” — gamer - speak for performing a repetitive task , such as slaying a monster , many times over .
What makes people , both young and old , want to sit for hours in front of a screen , clicking away on their consoles ?
The answer , say the authors , is status and friendly competition .
Games that track players ' progress against their previous achievements , or against those of others , can make grinding seem like — well — less of a grind .
Staging in - house competitions to boost productivity is hardly novel .
But gaming technology can make competition more enjoyable .
Take Microsoft 's own experience .
Before it releases a new version of its Windows operating system , it asks staff to help debug the software by installing and running the system .
In the past , project managers had to spend a great deal of time and effort persuading busy Microsoftees to help them with this boring task .
So for Windows Vista , the system 's latest incarnation , Microsoft created a game that awarded points for bug - testing and prizes such as wristbands for achieving certain goals .
Participation quadrupled .
Gaming also promotes community building .
Popular games can attract hundreds of thousands of user - group members , who swap notes and develop their own modifications ( or “ mods ” ) .
In many cases , such as The Sims — the most popular computer game of all time ( in terms of copies sold ) , which allows players to control a household full of people with very human attributes — these mods have deepened customers ' attachment to the product .
The authors argue that firms in other industries should look to video - gaming companies for inspiration when it comes to managing their own communities .
They point out that good gaming firms must learn the language and rules of different customer groups , appointing staff to engage with them .
They also offer prizes that encourage creativity , as well as tools and support that make it easier for users to come up with mods , while discouraging unwanted innovation .
The resulting software can help predict what future products might succeed .
The gaming industry also offers examples of what not to do .
In 2006 CCP , an Icelandic company that makes EVE Online , a game that lets teams of players fight epic online battles over virtual star systems , got a rocket from its users when it emerged that an employee had been giving special help to a particularly powerful team .
Mods can have cons too , notably when hackers exploit them .
Sometimes mischief - makers can go a step further , creating new contents from scratch .
Spammers have created an online game to get around CAPTCHA , the bot - catching test that requires people to read then type weirdly distorted letters when , say , registering for a free online account or other service .
Their game involved a scantily clad virtual model removing an article of clothing each time a user identified a distorted word — which , unbeknown to the player , was a CAPTCHA from another website .
Thanks to this , the spammers got others to help them create new e-mail accounts from which to send their junk .
Such hiccups aside , the evolution of gaming technology has definitely given companies the ability to create virtual sandboxes that can provide a competitive edge .
So executives who still insist on all work and no game play wo n't just be running dull workplaces ; they will also be running less profitable ones too .
In an earlier version of this article , we wrote that an employee of CCP had provided help to a team of gamers in 2007 .
In fact , that happened in 2006 .
This article was corrected on August 26th 2008 .

Make Your Own Pancetta
There ’s something powerful about hacking apart a pig , slathering it with salt and spices , tying it up , and letting it hang in the cellar until covered with mold .
“ It shows what you ’re capable of doing , ” says Christine Mullen , executive chef of San Francisco ’s CAV Wine Bar & Kitchen .
“ Not everybody can make their own salami and have a great product . ”
The art of preserving or curing meat , charcuterie includes everything from pâtés and terrines to bacon and headcheese .
Many chefs , like Mullen , are making their own in wine cellars and walk - ins across the country , turning previously undesirable pig parts into artisanal salamis , hams , and sausages .
It ’s a centuries - old European tradition that is experiencing a major renaissance .
Blame it on Batali and Bertolli .
Mario Batali ’s father , Armandino , operates a salumi shop in Seattle using skills he learned in Italy .
When Mario opened Babbo in New York City in 1998 , he began curing meats , too , using recipes his father helped to develop .
Paul Bertolli made his first charcuterie around 1982 , while a chef at Chez Panisse .
He later evangelized it at his annual Whole Hog Dinner menu at Oliveto in Oakland , California .
His 2003 book Cooking by Hand contains an extensive chapter on curing pork that has inspired many chefs to give it a try .
“ There ’s a whole subculture in the food world that wants something authentic , wants something genuine , and wants to be transparent about it , ” says Bertolli , who recently founded Fra’mani Handcrafted Salumi in Berkeley , California .
No two pieces of cured meat taste alike .
The unique temperature , moisture , and mold conditions where each product hangs contribute to a subtle uniqueness that some compare to the terroir in wines .
“ These are products that you do n’t put between mustard - slathered slabs of bread , ” says Bertolli .
But there are dangers in the seemingly mystical transformation from raw to cured .
If you do n’t closely monitor temperatures , or if you use too little salt , harmful bacteria can flourish .
For instance , homemade pancetta needs to be rolled very tightly , as pathogens can grow in air pockets .
Because of the risks , there are stringent health - code rules for charcuterie in most cities .
In May , New York City health inspectors confiscated and destroyed several years ’ and thousands of dollars ’ worth of charcuterie after they found that the curing room at Il Buco was six degrees warmer than the health code allowed .
However , some chefs choose to break the rules .
Mold flavors the meat , and to grow mold you need certain temperature and humidity levels — levels that the law might not always permit .
“ If you take [ mold ] . . . away , it ’s just not gonna happen , ” says Mullen .
“ You ’re not gonna get the ‘ wow ’ factor . ”
Here ’s our recipe for homemade pancetta .
It ’ll make you feel powerful .
Or at the very least , it will add bacony , fatty goodness to whatever it touches .
Just do n’t be scared of a little mold .

This week , Sarah Palin is paying visits to several foreign leaders while they are in New York attending the opening of the United Nations .
She ’ll meet with Afghani President Hamid Karzai , Colombian President Álvaro Uribe , Iraqi President Jalal Talabani , Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili , and , of course , Bono .
But one of her most high - stakes meetings will surely be the one that ’s planned between the Alaska governor and Henry Kissinger , the former Secretary of State and the archduke of conservative foreign policy .
The meeting is scheduled to take place today .
We ’ve used our usual political prescience to predict how their conversation will go down :
[ The setting is an expansive suite in the Waldorf =Astoria , with many dimly lit lamps and a couple of Tocca scented candles .
Kissinger sits , legs crossed , in a giant , heavily - upholstered winged chair .
He is tapping his fingers together gently .
A black lab sits at his feet .
Sarah Palin enters , looking nervous .
She approaches quietly , with her head lowered , and curtsies . ]
Kissinger : Vell , hello there .
Palin :
It ’s such an honor to meet you , Your Majesty .
Kissinger : Could you fetch a bowl of vater for my dog here ?
He eez thirsty .
Palin : Oh !
Um , this is awkward .
I ’m not a hotel employee .
I ’m Sarah Palin ?
You know , the hockey mom ?
Pitbull with lipstick ?
Energy - policy expert ?
Drill baby drill ?
Kissinger : [ To black lab ]
Vucking hell .
Palin :
Oh , do n’t you worry about it for one minute .
Everybody always thinks I ’m a greeter at Wal - Mart — it ’s the combination of my glasses and spunk .
A greeter at the Waldorf =Astoria is a step up , really !
Kissinger :
So zey tell me you are an expert on foreign policy , particularly with Russia .
Palin :
Oh , yes .
If you count Russia , Alaska shares a border with two different countries .
Really big countries !
Kissinger : Zen I am very interested in vat you think of my legacy of realpolitik .
Palin :
In what respect ?
Kissinger : Vell , vat do you interpret it to be ?
Palin :
You mean your worldview ?
I think when someone like you says “ Real Politics , ” you mean a clear , honest effort to rid the world of Islamic extremism , terrorists who are hell - bent in destroying our nation .
There have been blunders along the way , though .
There have been mistakes made , and with new leadership , and that ’s the beauty of American elections , of course , and democracy , is with new leadership comes opportunity to do things better .
Kissinger : I see .
Can you get that bowl of vater for my dog , please ?
Palin :
Oh , I thought I just explained .
I ’m not a concierge — I ’m Sarah Palin , I ’m the woman John McCain selected as his vice - presidential running mate .
Kissinger : I know .
Palin : Oh !
Sure , okay .
So , you ’re German , right ?
I ’ve been to Germany !
Kissinger : I am American .
Palin :
Then why do you talk that way ?
You do n’t even say the “ s ” at the end of “ politics . ”
Kissinger : [ After a lengthy pause , during which Palin fills a water bowl for the dog and begins petting it . ]
So , what do you think about China ’s influence on American financial institutions zese days ?
Palin : I have a lot of experience on this issue .
Under my watch , Alaska sold 27 percent more fish to China than ever before .
Kissinger : And Southeast Asia ?
Palin : I know Senator John S. McCain spent a lot of formative years over there , so we ’re very pro–Southeast Asia .
We would n’t be where we are today without that region .
Kissinger : [ Looking around the room at his lavish surroundings ]
You can say zat again .
Palin :
We would n’t be where we are today without that region .
Kissinger : Come closer for a moment .
Has anyone ever told you that you look a little like a brunette Jill St. John ?
Palin :
Is she a real saint ?
I have n’t heard of that one .
But I am in full support of the war in Iraq , just like God !
Kissinger : [ Softly ]
You know , power is the ultimate aphrodisiac .
Palin : I certainly do n’t think we should elect someone just because he is black , if that ’s what you mean .
Kissinger : Vat ?
Palin :
You know , they say you were a maverick .
I ’m a maverick , too !
We should be buddies !
I have so many questions for you , especially about places I do n’t know much about , like Cambodia , Argentina , Bolivia , Bangladesh …
Kissinger : [ To dog ] Töten Sie sie .
The Power of Implementing Ruby in Ruby
If you 're not familiar with Mixology , it 's a gem that enables modules to be both mixed into and unmixed from objects , creating a great way to implement the state pattern in Ruby .
The First Test
The first test for Mixology is fairly straightforward .
Let 's say we have an object with a foo method that returns " foo from object " , and a module with a foo method that returns " foo from mixin " .
When we mix in the module , foo should return " foo from mixin " .
We should then be able to unmix the module from the object and have the foo method return " foo from object " again .
def test_unmix object = Class .
new { def foo ; " foo from object " ; end }. new mixin = Module .
new { def foo ; " foo from mixin " ; end } object .
mixin mixin assert_equal " foo from mixin " , object .
foo object .
unmix mixin assert_equal " foo from object " , object . foo end
Getting the First Test to Pass
Using MRI , we 're at the point where we need to drop down into C code to implement this .
My C skills are n't too great , which is why Patrick Farley implemented Mixology .
But my Ruby skills are much better .
Because Rubinius implements as much of Ruby in Ruby as possible , we can get this test to pass with 100 % Ruby code .
module Mixology def mixin ( mod ) reset_method_cache IncludedModule . new ( mod ) . attach_to metaclass reset_method_cache self end def unmix ( mod_to_unmix ) last_super = metaclass this_super = metaclass .
direct_superclass while this_super if ( this_super == mod_to_unmix || this_super .
respond_to ? ( : module ) && this_super .
module == mod_to_unmix ) reset_method_cache last_super .
superclass = this_super .
direct_superclass reset_method_cache return self else last_super = this_super this_super = this_super .
direct_superclass end end self end protected def reset_method_cache self .
methods .
each do | name | name = self .
metaclass .
send ( : normalize_name , name ) Rubinius :: VM .
reset_method_cache ( name ) end end end Object .
send : include , Mixology
And now if we run the test , we 'll have green .
$ rubinius test/ mixology_test.rb require ' test/unit/testcase ' has been deprecated Loaded suite test / mixology_test Started .
Finished in 0.024741 seconds .
1 tests , 1 assertions , 0 failures , 0 errors
It 's not every day when you want implement something like unmixing a module .
But if you do want to , Rubinius empowers you to do much more at the Ruby level .
It 's also a great way to learn more about Ruby 's internals .
For example , the IncludedModule class used in this implementation is how Ruby puts modules in the inheritance hierarchy for an object .

There are still 5 pending tests before Mixology 's whole test suite passes in Rubinius .

GpsPasSion forum member [ Ospray ] has released a new version of MioPocket .
For those of you that do n’t know , MioPocket is a great unlock kit for GPS units .
It basically unlocks the hidden potential of your GPS so you can access the built - in functionality of a PDA as well as retaining the GPS software .
This means you can play music , watch video , play games , read and write office documents , and many other things with the once single - purpose device .
Originally written for Mio brand devices , it has been successfully used on a couple other brands .
We ’ve seen it on a Navigon 2100 using a modified install .
This software can run directly off the SD card , so it can easily be updated or removed .
The fun part is fiddling with the scripts to get the newest releases to work on the Navigon and Magellan devices .
The Republicans were euphoric over Sarah Palin ’s debate performance , particularly the part in which she stood tall and refrained from falling off the stage .
“ There are conservatives and Republicans across America who are ... breathing a sigh of relief , ” said Pat Buchanan on MSNBC , adding that “ of the four debaters we ’ve seen , she was the most interesting , attractive of them all . ”
Palin did indeed answer each question with poise and self - confidence , reeling off a bunch of talking points that were sometimes totally unrelated to the matter at hand .
When she was asked to respond to Joe Biden ’s critique of the McCain health care plan , she announced : “ I would like to respond about the tax increases , ” cheerfully ignoring the fact that tax increases had never been mentioned .
After the recent Katie Couric unpleasantness , Palin told the viewers that this time they were getting a chance to hear her “ answer these tough questions without the filter . ”
And , indeed , her answers were murky in the extreme .
She railed repeatedly about government regulations getting in the way of the private sector , then announced that the financial rescue plan “ has got to include that massive oversight that Americans are expecting and deserving . ”
She said that she did n’t want to discuss what caused global warming , only how to ease its impact .
She appeared to agree with Dick Cheney ’s manic theory that the vice president is a member of both the executive and legislative branches , although it ’s hard to tell since she began her answer this way : “ Well , our founding fathers were very wise there in allowing through the Constitution much flexibility there in the office of the vice president .
And we will do what is best for the American people in tapping into that position and ushering in an agenda that is supportive and cooperative with the president ’s agenda in that position . ”

Since 1929 , Republicans and Democrats have each controlled the presidency for nearly 40 years .
So which party has been better for American pocketbooks and capitalism as a whole ?
Well , here ’s an experiment : imagine that during these years you had to invest exclusively under either Democratic or Republican administrations .
How would you have fared ?
As of Friday , a $ 10,000 investment in the S.& P. stock market index * would have grown to $ 11,733 if invested under Republican presidents only , although that would be $ 51,211 if we exclude Herbert Hoover ’s presidency during the Great Depression .
Invested under Democratic presidents only , $ 10,000 would have grown to $ 300,671 at a compound rate of 8.9 percent over nearly 40 years .

If done right , the use of some technologies can greatly reduce costs and make us more efficient .
Here are ten technologies every techie should consider to help cut costs in this slow economy :
1 ) Open Source
Dump the high cost proprietary systems for equivalent open source systems where you can .
There are many operating systems , databases , content managment systems , communications tools , networking and administration tools that are open source and free to use .
Choose mature products with a strong community following and plenty of available support options either via developers or third party support offerings .
2 ) Software as a Service
Instead of spending money on time on developing complex in - house solutions to CRM , support and project management use SaaS providers such as Sales Force , Google , 37 Signals and Right Now .
Not only do you save money by using these third party tools by cutting development costs , but you also reduce costs on specialized hardware to run similar in - house solutions .
Many SaaS solutions can also be integrated via the providers API's .
3 ) Virtualization
Do you have multiple servers and workstations handling different tasks ?
Combine them into one machine .
With virtualization suites such as ones offered by VMware you can take one machine and turn into multiple virtual machines .
One machine can act as your web server , your network share and your exchange server .
Each virtual machine will work independent of the other and optimize utilization of hardware resources .
4 ) Thin Clients
Employees no longer need to use expensive machines for light computing work such as emailing and using basic office work .
Low powered thin -clients connected to a single multi-core system with x64 architecture and virtualization can power the work of multiple employees .
Besides better utilization of hardware and energy , you also introduce efficiency for IT managers by reducing the # of systems they have to manage .
5 ) Enterprise 2.0
Get your organization connected and sharing information .
Use intranet systems with built in messaging , voice messages , wikis , profiles and contact information .
Keeping your employees connected and sharing information about your business can keep the organization from making costly decisions .
6 ) Digital Documents
Move as much of your company 's paper usage to digital as you can .
Not only do you save money with printing you also save money on office space to store all that paperwork .
Other ways to save more on printed costs is move to email for memos and letters .
Also consider e-fax services as an alternative to fax machines .
7 ) Fast Efficient Networks
Using all these cost savings technologies will require a fast internal network and fast bandwidth coming in .
These days companies and individuals can subscribe to fiber - optic bandwidth providers .
With higher bandwidth network such as fiber lines , you can also server voice and video through the same connection .
Internally make sure you 've upgraded as much of your hardware to gigabit speeds .
Newer networking gear tends to be more energy efficient and capable of handling faster network speeds .
A fast network means less waiting for employees and more working .
8 ) Data Storage
Storing as much of your company 's data and information on the network keeps it accessible for employees and staff to use at any time from any location .
This saves employees from physically having to search for the required data or information .
The time savings will make your staff more efficient .
Saving data on cheap mass storage hard drives saves you office space for storing documents and paper work .
9 ) Wireless
With wireless connectivity employees can work from anywhere .
They are no longer stuck to their desk and their mobile systems such as laptops can move with them from meetings to conference areas .
An added benefit of wireless systems are the savings in running wire for hard networking .
10 ) Virtual Office
Cut the overhead costs of keeping employees on site by allowing them to work from home .
Virtual offices reduce the amount of resources required for equipment and office space .
Many companies have already instituted virtual office policies and have realized great results from doing so .
With virtual offices upfront investments in secure networking will be required .
Setting up VPNs and access to other network resources for employees will be a must .
There 's no escaping the slowing economy .
Layoffs are being announced and companies are in cost cutting mode .
Whether you are a tech at a big company or a small one man operation it 's time to cut the fat before you get cut out of work .
Unnecessary expenses have to go and inefficient ways of working need to be analyzed and improved .
If done right , the use of some technologies can greatly reduce costs and make us more efficient .
Here are ten technologies every techie should consider to help cut costs in this slow economy :
Dump the high cost proprietary systems for equivalent open source systems where you can .

Stuart Rothenberg , who has served as a political analyst for CNN and CBS News , is editor and publisher of The Rothenberg Political Report , a nonpartisan political newsletter .
Nathan Gonzales is the publication 's political editor .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Chris Shays of Connecticut , the last Republican in the House of Representatives from New England , is used to running against the partisan tide .
But this year , the wave might be too high for the Republican congressman to overcome .
Recent polls show Republican Rep. Chris Shays tied with or trailing his Democratic opponent in Connecticut .
Shays is just one of many GOP candidates trying to win by outperforming Sen.
John McCain 's underwhelming performance in congressional districts nationwide .
McCain , R - Arizona , trailed Illinois Sen. Barack Obama by 21 points in Connecticut 's 4th District , according to an October 13 - 14 SurveyUSA poll for Roll Call newspaper .
A just - released University of Connecticut poll and a mid-September survey by the Democratic Feldman Group also had Obama winning by at least 20 points .
By comparison , Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry won the district by just 6 points four years ago .
Recent public and private polling shows Shays either tied with or trailing his Democratic opponent Jim Himes .
In 2004 , Shays got 6 more points than President Bush , but the congressman will need a significantly larger number of Obama voters to cross over this year .
Watch how some GOP candidates are handling McCain 's lag »
McCain 's non-existent coattails run counter to the initial conventional wisdom that said his moderate style and crossover appeal would lift Republican candidates down ballot .
That 's just not the case two weeks out from Election Day .
In North Carolina , Republican Rep. Robin Hayes is a perennial target .
President Bush won his 8th District by 9 points over Kerry in 2004 , but McCain is trailing Obama in the district by 9 points , according to an end of September Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research poll for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
Hayes won with just 50.1 percent last cycle , and does n't have much room for error .
McCain 's struggles continue in other Republican - leaning districts like Pennsylvania 's 3rd .
According to an October 6 - 8 Research 2000 poll for the liberal Daily Kos Web site , Republican Rep. Phil English trailed his Democratic opponent by 7 points while McCain was losing the district by 2 points .
President Bush won it by 7 points in 2004 .
The news does n't get better in more staunchly GOP areas .
President Bush won Ohio's 2nd District by 28 points four years ago , but an early October Research 2000 poll showed McCain 's margin at just 11 points .
Republican Rep. Jean Schmidt is in another competitive re-election race there .
Even in Wyoming , where Republicans are defending an open seat , McCain is n't reaching Bush 's numbers .
McCain was underperforming the President 's 2004 totals by 10 points , according to an October 14 - 16 Research 2000 survey .
In the House race , Gary Trauner , the Democrats ' losing 2006 candidate , led former Republican state treasurer Cynthia Lummis , 44 - 43 percent .
Schmidt and Lummis are fortunate because McCain will carry their districts and they only need Republican voters to vote for them in order to get elected .
For Shays , Hayes , and English , the problem is more severe .
A big wave for Obama might be too much of a burden for Republican congressional candidates to bear at a time when they are already saddled with an unpopular Republican president and an unpopular Republican brand .
All About John McCain • Barack Obama • U.S. House of Representatives
Sarah Palin " would be wise to quit trying to spin her way out of " the Troopergate mess , said The Dallas Morning News in an editorial .
Claiming vindication after the release of a " fairly damning " Alaska legislature 's report on her role , as governor , in the firing of her ex-brother - in - law could give even many McCain - Palin supporters pause .
She 'd be better off if she " admitted error . "
" If we were n't in the midst of an election right now , " said John McCormack in The Weekly Standard online , most people would agree that firing Trooper Michael Wooten was the right thing to do .
The man " physically abused his 10 - year - old stepson by tasering him , " and threatened Palin 's father .
The public is better off with him off the force , regardless of how Palin felt about the matter .
That 's beside the point , said The Washington Post in an editorial .
Palin's " refusal to cooperate reflects poorly on her , " as does her " mischaracterization " of the report by saying it found she did nothing " unethical . "
The worst of it is that she " does not understand — or chooses not to acknowledge — the seriousness of the mess she helped create . "

I know that I ’m not the only Doctor Who fan out here on Geeks Are Sexy .
Our love of Britain ’s most celebrated Sci-Fi show is as potent as that of any Trekkie or Star Wars buff .
Well , brace yourself , my brethren , for some rough news .
There have been rumors for months about who would be leaving the show .
If you ’re a fan of David Tennant or Russell T. Davies , you ’re probably already aware that they have been the prime suspects .
Now , Tennant has confirmed our worst fears in a BBC interview .
He enjoyed his three season stay , but after 4 one - hour specials , he will gracefully bow out and hand the roll over to someone else .
Even he does n’t know the manner of his “ death ” yet , but it will undoubtedly be the climax to a great episode .
He also confirmed that Davies will be leaving as lead producer and writer and handing the show off to Steven Moffat .
Tennant admits that he ’s a huge fan of Moffat and it ’s one of the things tempting him to keep on in the role .
Even so ,
The Doctor knows that it ’s better to step out on a high note than wait until everyone is asking when he ’s leaving .
Personally , I am optimistic about the next Doctor and the next season .
The main character is changing but they ’ve always made good casting choices in the past .
The old cast is largely “ done ” because their smash - bang season finale moved most of them off to Torchwood ( or killed them … or stranded them in another universe ) , but who knows what new talents they ’ll introduce .
What do you expect after the Doctor regenerates ?

So this explains last week ’s double barrel middle finger action from Utah State Aggie fan towards the BYU faithful .
Alcohol .
These people in rural Utah are drunk until the day they die .
And forget what the scoreboard says .
It ’s really friggin’ blurry after grain alcohol mixed with Vitamin Water to stay hydrated .
Take grandma who is on her death bed but can still belt out the official Utah State drinking song .
Do n’t try to tell us she has n’t slammed a few shots in her day .
Watching Utah State football will make you take such drastic action .

Buyer Beware .
At the end of September , the USDA quietly halted a program called the Agricultural Chemical Usage Program .
The program ’s purpose was to measure pesticide use in fruit and vegetable crops .
Data from the program was widely used by the EPA to set allowable pesticide levels and also by university researchers and other groups that help farmers minimize the amount of pesticides they apply to their crops .
The reason cited for the move was cost .
I do n’t know about you , but $ 8 million a year seems a small price to pay for safer food .
A little background : remember the Alar scare in 1989 ?
Alar was a carcinogenic chemical widely sprayed on apples and when its residue ended up in the apple sauce and apple juices so often eaten by children , a public furor erupted .
The flap over Alar resulted in the banning of the chemical , a new slate of food laws , and the enactment of the Agricultural Chemical Usage Program in 1990 .
Fast forward : university researchers and EPA policy makers must now purchase the data privately at a cost of $ 500 - $ 800 a year from a company called Dmrkynetec .
I would n’t be surprised if Dmrkynetec has a few lobbyists roaming the halls of the USDA .
After all , the USDA is the same government agency that was recently ordered by a federal judge to stop buying ads against Proposition 2 in California ( a proposition that will ban some of the worst confined feeding practices in industrial meat and egg production ) .
Last time I checked it was illegal for government agencies to try to influence elections .
This development is just another reason to buy your produce from a local , organic farmer you trust .
There is a bright side .
If word gets out , this will only help the community farmers who are doing it right .
So after you hit your local farmers ’ market , tell a few friends about what the USDA is n’t doing to ensure safe food supplies .

The sparks are going to fly :
The legal status of Amazon 's ( AMZN ) controversial 1 - click patent , which the company filed for in 1997 and won in 1999 -- and licensed to companies like Apple ( AAPL ) -- is now in doubt .
Reuters :
A U.S. patent appeals court ruled on Thursday that business methods , such as Amazon.com Inc 's one - click to buy goods on the Internet , can not be patented .
The case was closely watched by software makers , Internet companies , investment houses and other businesses .
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said the patent application in question -- a method for reducing the risk of sudden changes in energy costs -- was not a machine and did not result in a transformation , both standards set by the U.S. Supreme Court for patentability .
Business titans split over the case : American Express ( AXP ) and Accenture ( ACN ) both filed friend - of - the - court briefs arguing business methods should be patentable , on the other side IBM ( IBM ) , SAP ( SAP ) , Dell ( DELL ) , and Microsoft ( MSFT ) all submitted briefs they should not be .
( PatentlyO has the run down . )
The dust is still settling , but consider this near - certain :
This one is going all the way the Supreme Court .
Why your mobile should carry a health warning like cigarette packets because of brain cancer risk
Cancer risk : Scientists want mobile phones to carry a health warning for brain cancer similar to lung cancer warnings on cigarette packets
Mobile phones should carry a health warning like those on cigarette packets , scientists have warned .
The authorities must not make the same mistakes over possible links between mobile phones and brain cancer as they did with cigarettes and lung cancer , experts warned a powerful U.S. congressional committee .
It took 50 years to get the tobacco industry to acknowledge the risks , and 70 years to remove lead from paint and petrol , they said .
' Society must not repeat the situation we had with smoking and lung cancer , where we waited until every ' i ' was dotted and 't ' was crossed before warnings were issued , ' said Professor David Carpenter , director of the institute of health and environment at the University of Albany .
' Precaution is warranted even in the absence of absolutely final evidence concerning the magnitude of the risk - especially for children . '
Dr Ronald Herberman , director of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute - one of the top U.S. cancer research centres - agreed and said : ' We must learn from our past to do a better job of interpreting evidence of potential risk . '
He said that in countries such as Britain and the U.S. , 'every child is using cell phones all of the time ' .
The committee heard that scientists are split over how dangerous mobile phones are to users .
But Dr Herberman said that most studies claiming there is no link between mobile phones and brain tumours are outdated because many defined regular mobile phone use as once a week .
He added that most do not include enough long - term users because a brain tumour can take many years to develop .
Both experts told the committee the brain cancer risk from mobile phone use is far greater for children than for adults .
Dr Herberman produced a model showing how radiation from a mobile phone penetrates far deeper into the brain of a five - year - old than that of an adult .
The committee was shown a research paper published this month by the Royal Society in London which found that teenagers who start using mobile phones before the age of 20 are five times more likely to develop brain cancer at the age of 29 than those who did not use a mobile phone .
Another this year by a Swedish cancer specialist found that frequent cell phone users are twice as likely to develop a malignant tumour on the nerves of the ' handset ear ' than on the other ear .
Dr Herberman said : ' I can not tell you cell phones are definitely dangerous .
But , I certainly cannot tell you that they are safe .
Like the messages that warn of health risks on cigarette packs , cell phones need a precautionary message . '
Case study
Mother - of - three Ellen Marks blames her husband 's malignant brain tumour on his mobile phone use .
Mrs Marks told the U.S. congressional hearing that her husband Alan , 56 , found out he had a brain tumour on his right frontal lobe in May .
The tumour is on the same side of his head where he held his mobile , which he used about 30 hours a month .
He had used one for around 20 years .
Mrs Marks , from California , said that for many years before his tumour was diagnosed , his behaviour changed dramatically , alienating his family .
He had had to take bi-polar medications and anti-depressants during those years .
He has been given a prognosis of around five years .
' I often threatened to throw the mobile phone into the garbage and how I wish I had , ' she said .
' This horror could have been avoided with a simple warning . '
Amarni's teacher had asked her to take home a signed permission note because it was incomplete , which was against the school 's risk management plan , the court heard .
This sparked a " chain of events " that led to the student being in the deep end of a pool in which she should not have been allowed to swim , counsel representing the Dirani family , Anthony Black , told Westmead Coroner 's Court .
During his cross-examination today of school principal Rita Porteous , Mr Black asked : " That that situation could occur is a significant failure of the risk management plan , is n't it ? "
Ms Porteous replied : " That it could occur , yes . "
Mr Black : " That it did occur is evidence that the risk management plan was defective , at least in its implementation . "
Ms Porteous told the court she believed that it was " reasonable " supervision for teachers to be standing along the pool watching children in the water .
She also said it was not a problem to send home an incomplete note for Amarni as she was a " responsible student " .
" She was a compliant student and would aim to carry out what was asked of her to the best of her ability , " Ms Porteous said .
The school 's former assistant principal , Bronwyn Whelan , defended the teachers , saying they were doing " a good job " .
She said there had been up to eight teachers supervising the Olympic pool area , and they were scattered along the edge of that area .
" They were doing their job , they were doing a good job , " she told the court .
But this prompted Amarni's uncle , Aimen Dirani , to interrupt the court , saying : " They did n't do a good job . "
He then walked out of the inquest .
The court has been told that the teachers ' aides were supervising children with special needs and other teachers were in the wading pool area and the canteen .
The court also heard today that Stuart Holstein , the teacher who organised the excursion and who pulled Amarni out of the pool would not be required to give evidence .
Earlier , the court had heard that Mr Holstein was in a " fragile state " and had only recently returned to work at another school .
The court had previously heard that Amarni 's permission slip for the excursion had circled that she could swim up to 20 metres .
However , her father who signed the permission slip was adamant that he had not circled it .
Senior Constable Dianne Erhardt told the court this week that it was unknown whether Amarni 's mother , Dalal Dirani , whom she believed did not have as good command of the English language as Mr Dirani , might have circled the permission slip without understanding it .
The inquest continues .

Yesterday the archaeology department of China 's Chongqing Municipality announced a remarkable discovery : a Qing Dynasty tomb of an almost unique style , made out of more than 2,000 qing hua ci ( blue and white porcelain ) bowls .
The Chongqing Economic
Times quoted archaeologists as saying that this kind of tomb is very rare and had probably been constructed by migrants to the area .
The tomb was discovered on the morning of August 24 , the final day of the Beijing Olympics , by a team of road workers in E’Ling Street , in the Yuzhong district of Chongqing .
When the first bowl was dug out , the workers thought nothing of it and discarded it , but as more bowls emerged , they realized they had discovered something unusual and called the city ’s cultural relics administration .
The archaeology department sent a team to investigate .
They discovered a tomb constructed from porcelain bowls .
Lying just 60 centimeters under the road surface , the bowls had been piled together to form a tomb .
The coffin and other funerary objects were then placed inside .
The bowls and the basic structure of the tomb were scarcely damaged , despite lying directly under a road , but the contents had been stolen by tomb raiders .
Almost all the funerary objects had been taken , and the identity of the person buried there will probably remain a mystery .
The bowls remained intact because they were stuck together very tightly , and secured with sticky rice and cement , which helped the tomb retain its shape .
Archeologists said that it would be a very difficult task , requiring chemical solvents , to separate one bowl from the others .
The bowls are Qing Dynasty qing hua ci bowls , very common in that period .
The images and flower patterns on the porcelain look brand new .
Some experts speculate that the reason for using bowls as construction materials was that the occupant of the tomb would have something to eat in the afterlife .
Archeology team leader Li Dadi said that this kind of tomb is very rare in Chongqing and was probably constructed by occupants of a Qing Dynasty migrant settlement .
He was unable to say for certain where the migrants had come from , but similar , somewhat smaller , bowl - tombs had been found in Fujian Province .

“ But we have a situation that ’s escalated , ” Ms. Lavery said .
“ Neighbors are upset that it ’s too close to their property ; building has been done on town property ; there are issues of traffic and drainage .
We ’re hoping to come up with a compromise , but there are a lot of issues to address . ”
There ’s plenty of local history in Wiffle ball ( it was invented up the road in Fairfield ) and Greenwich land - use disputes ( where to start ? ) , but Vincent and Justin say they just wanted a place to play Wiffle ball .
They got materials from a friend ’s basement plus two big pieces of plywood being thrown away by a Shell station on East Putnam Avenue .
They fished pallets out of Dumpsters and spent perhaps $ 200 , mostly on green paint .
But even before they were finished , things began to get complicated .
They were told the neighbors had complained , the field was on town - owned land , they needed a permit to put up their field and it would probably have to come down .
This being Greenwich , they decided not to go quietly .
They and / or parents alerted the local newspaper and politicians up to Lt. Gov. Michael Fedele of nearby Stamford .
Soon they had everyone in town talking about it , with most of them seemingly put off by the notion that even a Wiffle ball field needs to enlist the armies of adult supervision and legalistic oversight .
“ BACK before we lost our collective minds and began shrieking with horror at the thought of kids having fun on their own ( as in not part of an official league or otherwise organized activity ) , they used to do things like find a vacant field , turn it into a makeshift diamond and spend glorious hours in the summer sun , ” the local newspaper , Greenwich Time , wrote in an editorial in support of the youths on Wednesday .
Update : A
recent CD post
reported that American consumers save $ 1.42 billion annually for every one penny decrease in retail gasoline prices .
According to
EIA data
, the average retail gasoline price peaked in early July at $ 4.165 ( national average ) per gallon , and is now at $ 2.914 , a decrease of 125.1 cents ( see chart above ) .
That fall in gas prices translates into a $ 177.6 billion savings for U.S. consumers over a one - year period , and there 'll probably be more to come as gas prices continue to fall .
And in Texas , where gas prices are down to
$ 2.02 in some areas
, the $ 2 per gallon fall in gas prices there ( from $ 4 in July ) would translate into almost $ 300 billion worth of annual consumer savings ( actually $ 284 billion ) .
As Dennis Gartman wrote in "
The Gartman Letter
" last Friday :
" This [ $ 177 billion savings ] dwarfs by a huge factor the recent tax rebate checks that went out to the nations taxpayers and which helped bump up the economy in the summer .
That was a one - off event ; the weakness in gasoline prices is an on - going one instead .
This is a tax cut of massive proportions ... beyond anything that Obama might promise . "
Labor contemplates Obama presidency
With a month before the election , a top union leader and Obama ally is already cautioning others in labor not to ask for too many specific favors from President Obama .
In a memo to another labor official , John Wilhelm , a top official of the merged UNITE HERE hotel and textile workers unions , writes that labor should respond to an Obama presidency by launching a massive organizing campaign , but warns against " flood[ing ] a new Obama administration with all sorts of proposals for regulatory changes , executive orders , appointments , etc . "
Instead , Wilhelm writes in the September 18 memo to Tom Tom Woodruff , the director of the Strategic Organizing Center at the Change to Win federation of unions , labor should ask Obama to use his " bully pulpit " and a few key appointments to further the labor cause .
( The memo was provided to Politico by a union official . )
The memo is a mark of how immediate the prospect of an Obama presidency feels to elemets of the Democratic Party , and how the jockeying has already begun for its favor .
Wilhelm 's was the first major labor union to endorse Obama , and ihs memo is seen by some as an attempt to head off the flood of demands Obama expects .
Wilhelm writes :
I disagree with the notion that we should flood a new Obama administration with all sorts of proposals for regulatory changes , executive orders , appointments , etc .
To the contrary , I believe that we should have only one demand of an Obama administration : that the President of the United States publicly , repeatedly , and strenuously advocate that workers have Unions because Unions are necessary to build a good America ; that he apply that advocacy to specific worker fights and not just general statements ; and that he put people on the [ National Labor Relations Board ] and in his cabinet who share that view and are committed to implementing it .
That is what would make a real difference .
If we give a new adminsitration all sorts fo chocices , they wo n't choose the one thaing that matters most but would be the most daring from a politiciains point of view : the bully - pulpit and regulatory authority of the President of the United States consistently employed to grow unions .
Wilhelm also writes that he does n't think the union should launch a " massive campaign " on the Employee Free Choice Act , a measure that would help organizing , but which he warns would n't be a " magic wand . "

DAMASCUS , Syria , Sept. 5 ( UPI ) -- Syria 's foreign minister Friday said Israel 's withdrawal in 1967 drew a border line which remains the basis for any peace talks between the two countries .
Walid Muallem called the line nonnegotiable for Syria and said future talks regarding the Golan Heights must deal with these " decisive and important " border issues , The Jerusalem Post reported Friday .

Druse leader Walid Jumblatt , meanwhile , has accused Syrian President Bashar Assad of using the indirect talks with Israel to strengthen diplomatic ties between Syria and the United States , the Post reported .
Jumblatt attacked Thursday 's four - way summit in Damascus saying the meeting between leaders of Syria , France , Turkey and Qatar violated the Arab initiative for peace with Israel , the Post reported .
A $ 700 bn bail - out to save the crumbling US economy was passed by the House of Representatives today .
The measure , rejected by the House on Monday , was passed comfortably this time by 263 votes to 171 .
Relieved traders sent the Dow Jones index up by more than 1.6 % immediately afterwards .
Just before the vote Nancy Pelosi , the Democrat speaker of the House of Representatives said : " It 's an important vote , it 's a difficult vote .
But it 's a vote we must win for Mr and Mrs Jones on Main Street . "
Republicans had blamed what they perceived to be Pelosi 's partisan rhetoric before the previous vote for the bill being defeated by a margin of 228 to 206 .
On that occasion a majority of Republican representatives voted against the bill .
The rejection of the bill triggered the Dow Jones ' biggest one day points drop in history .
The measure was passed by the Senate on Wednesday .
The money will be used by the US Treasury to purchase toxic debts from banks in the US , thus freeing up the balance sheets of financial institutions and hopefully restoring faith in lending markets .
Following the rejection of the bill , which was proposed almost three weeks by Tresury secretary Henry Paulson , a number of amendments were made , including an increase of insurance for deposit accounts .
Presidential rivals John McCain and Barack Obama were said to be calling representatives from their respective parties right up until the vote to try to ensure the bill passed .
CBS
News executives were red- faced yesterday trying to explain how David Letterman used unaired news footage of Sen. John McCain with Katie Couric to embarrass the Republican presidential candidate .
McCain canceled his appearance on Letterman ’s show late Wednesday , several hours before he was due to appear – claiming he had to return to Washington to deal with the financial crisis .
Get MORE TV News at NYPost.com
But when Letterman discovered the Senator sitting down with Couric at the same time he was supposed to be taping “ Late Night , ” he unloaded on McCain .
“ I ’m more than a little disappointed by this behavior , ” Letterman told viewers .
“ This does n’t smell right . ”
“ This is not the way a tested hero behaves .
Somebody ’s putting something in his Metamucil , ” he said .
Later in the show , Letterman showed an internal , live video of McCain being tended to by a make - up artist before the Couric interview .
Both Couric and Letterman are on CBS .
Letterman said on the air that McCain had called him personally to apologize and said he was racing to the airport .
“ He does n’t seem to be racing to the airport , does he ? ” Letterman told viewers .
“ I feel like we ’ve caught him getting a manicure , ” Letterman quipped , as a make - up woman dabbed at McCain ’s face .
Asked if CBS officials had a problem with Letterman using the internal news feed , a spokeswoman for “ The Evening News ” refused to address the issue .
But several CBS
News executives – who asked not to be identified – said that the stunt did not go down well within the news division .
“ If we had done something like that to him , someone around here would end up getting fired , ” one said .
News officials found out Letterman was using the internal feed shortly after it showed up on an internal CBS feed carrying the “ Late Show ” taping .
“ They were pretty aggravated , ” a CBS News source told The Post .
“ But they were not about to start a fight with Letterman , ” the source said .
“ We ’re in the middle of a heavy , heavy news cycle and Letterman is Letterman .
“ He does whatever he wants and always has . ”
McCain spokeswoman Nicole Wallace said that the campaign canceled on Letterman because it “ felt this was n’t a night for comedy . ”

The values of scientific enquiry , rather than any particular policy positions on science , suggest a preference for one US presidential candidate over the other .
The election of a US president almost always seems like a crossroads , but the choice to be made on 4 November feels unusual , and daunting , in its national and global significance .
Science and the research enterprise offer powerful tools for addressing key challenges that face America and the world , and it is heartening that both John McCain and Barack Obama have had thoughtful things to say about them .
Obama has been more forthcoming in his discussion of research goals ( see Nature 455 , 446–449 ; 2008 ) , but both have engaged with the issues .
McCain deserves particular credit for taking a stance on carbon emissions that is at odds with that of a significant proportion of his party .
There is no open - and - shut case for preferring one man or the other on the basis of their views on these matters .
This is as it should be : for science to be a narrow sectional interest bundled up in a single party would be a terrible thing .
Both sides recognize science 's inspirational value and ability to help achieve national and global goals .
That is common ground to be prized , and a scientific journal 's discussion of these matters might be expected to stop right there .
“ The core values of science are those of open debate within a free society that have come down to us from the Enlightenment . ”
But science is bound by , and committed to , a set of normative values — values that have application to political questions .
Placing a disinterested view of the world as it is ahead of our views of how it should be ; recognizing that ideas should be tested in as systematic a way as possible ; appreciating that there are experts whose views and criticisms need to be taken seriously : these are all attributes of good science that can be usefully applied when making decisions about the world of which science is but a part .
Writ larger , the core values of science are those of open debate within a free society that have come down to us from the Enlightenment in many forms , not the least of which is the constitution of the United States .
On a range of topics , science included , Obama has surrounded himself with a wider and more able cadre of advisers than McCain .
This is not a panacea .
Some of the policies Obama supports — continued subsidies for corn ethanol , for example — seem misguided .
The advice of experts is all the more valuable when it is diverse : ' groupthink ' is a problem in any job .
Obama seems to understands this .
He tends to seek a range of opinions and analyses to ensure that his own opinion , when reached , has been well considered and exposed to alternatives .
He also exhibits pragmatism — for example in his proposals for health - care reform — that suggests a keen sense for the tests reality can bring to bear on policy .
Some will find strengths in McCain that they value more highly than the commitment to reasoned assessment that appeals in Obama .
But all the signs are that the former seeks a narrower range of advice .
Equally worrying is that he fails to educate himself on crucial matters ; the attitude he has taken to economic policy over many years is at issue here .
Either as a result of poor advice , or of advice inadequately considered , he frequently makes decisions that seem capricious or erratic .
The most notable of these is his ill - considered choice of Sarah Palin , the Republican governor of Alaska , as running mate .
Palin lacks the experience , and any outward sign of the capacity , to face the rigours of the presidency .
The Oval Office is not a debating chamber , nor is it a faculty club .
As anyone in academia will know , a thoughtful and professorial air is not in itself a recommendation for executive power .
But a commitment to seeking good advice and taking seriously the findings of disinterested enquiry seems an attractive attribute for a chief executive .
It certainly matters more than any specific pledge to fund some particular agency or initiative at a certain level — pledges of a sort now largely rendered moot by the unpredictable flux of the economy .
This journal does not have a vote , and does not claim any particular standing from which to instruct those who do .
But if it did , it would cast its vote for Barack Obama .

La version candidate RC - 1 a été annoncée le 28 juillet par Linus qui a souligné la taille impressionnante de cette version : " Cela fait deux semaines ( et un jour ) et la période des modifications est terminée .
Je ne sais pas pourquoi mais j'ai l'impression que cette période aura été sacrément active .
La taille du patch de la RC - 1 soutient ce sentiment puisqu'avec 12 Mo il est environ 50 % plus gros que le patch 2.6.26 -RC - 1 .
Cette taille me rend un peu nerveux .
C'est vrai cela signifie que nous sommes vraiment bons pour inclure toutes les nouveautés mais je dois dire que je me demande parfois si nous n'incluons pas trop de choses à la fois et si notre cycle de sortie ( déjà court ) n'est pas en fait trop gros .
Mais bon cette discussion est pour une autre fois .
Il y a une tonne de nouveaux trucs là-dedans mais pour moi les choses les plus intéressantes sont la traque du verrou global et peut - être l'introduction de la fonction get_user_pages_fast ( ) sans verrou .
D'autres trucs ?
Le chargement des firmwares , le travail de fusion des branches x86 qui continue .
De plus en plus de code qui devient générique .
Le support des machines de 4096 processeurs , etc .
Allez sur kernelnewbies ou sur Linux Weekly News pour plus de détails .
Moi je vais dormir pendant 24 heures ;) "
" Une semaine après cette première version candidate Linus a annoncé la version RC - 2 :"
Il y a plein de changements divers là-dedans et j'espère que nous allons commencer à ralentir un peu les choses .
Il y a quand même un truc particulier qu'il est peut - être bon de souligner du fait des conséquences éventuelles : un certain nombre d'architectures ont utilisé " l'accalmie " après la RC - 1 ( Hah ! ) pour effectuer le renommage include / asm - nom - de - l ' architecture => ' arch / nom - de- l ' architecture / include / asm . (...)
Sinon il y plein d'autres petits changements mais rien qui ne puisse provoquer un « Wow ! ».
Notez qu'à l'étape RC - 2 il ne devrait de toute façon pas y avoir ce genre de truc donc je ne me plains pas . "
" Les versions candidates RC - 3 et RC - 4 ont vu l'inclusion du pilote ath9 k pour les cartes wifi basées sur des puces Atheros , le support du trackpad des nouveaux portables
Apple ainsi que des corrections sur les systèmes de fichiers XFS et UBIFS .
Le 28 août c'est la version RC - 5 qui a été annoncée : ­­ « Nouvelle semaine ( mes semaines semblent avoir 8 jours , c'est très bizarre ) et nouvelle version candidate .
Cette RC - 5 comporte (...) un grand nombre de petits changements qui , je l'espère , corrigent pas mal de régressions .
Le plus excitant ( du moins pour moi — apparemment ma vie est ennuyeuse au - delà du concevable ) est que nous avons eu des débordements de la pile ( stack overflow ) qui ont totalement corrompu les structure de données des threads .
C'est excitant parce que nous n'avions pas eu cela depuis pas mal de temps .
Bien sûr ce bug aurait impacté uniquement les gens un peu trop aventureux et ayant sélectionné l'option de configuration 4096 processeurs ! ».
». Les versions candidates RC - 6 et RC - 7 sont apparues respectivement le 9 et le 21 septembre , avec le Kernel Summit et la Linux Plumber Conference dans l'intervalle ce qui a un peu ralenti le rythme .
La version RC - 8 a été annoncée par Linus le 29 septembre : « Celle - ci devrait être la dernière .
Nous ne sommes pas à court de régressions mais , en même temps , je dois faire un choix à un certain moment et dans l'ensemble les régressions ne semblent pas _trop_ effrayantes .
Et évidemment la RC - 8 en corrige la plupart . ».
Il est à noter que le bug vicieux qui affectait le pilote e1000e des cartes réseau
Intel n'est plus dangereux mais que Linus n'en pense pas moins : ­­­ «
Le _vrai_bug est dans la conception du matériel qui permet de foutre en l'air ces cartes sans même avoir un bit de sécurité .
J'espère qu'Intel ne va pas traiter ça comme étant juste un bug logiciel .
Certains concepteurs de matériel devraient vraiment réfléchir à propos du genre d'orifice dans lequel ils ont mis leur tête » .
». Il est à noter que le bug vicieux qui affectait le pilote e1000e des cartes réseau
Intel n'est plus dangereux mais que Linus n'en pense pas moins : ».
Linus a finalement décidé de sortir une version RC - 9 afin de bénéficier d'une petite période de test supplémentaire : « Je sais , je sais , j'avais dit que la RC - 8 serait la dernière et que le noyau serait disponible ce weekend .
J'ai menti .
Faites - moi un procès .
J'ai inclus deux corrections pour des bugs subtils aujourd ' hui et , bien qu'ils semblent parfaitement corrects et aient été testés par les gens en charge des régressions , je n'ai pas pu me décider à leur coller le label " v2.6.27 " sans faire un peu plus de tests .
J'ai aussi pensé que c'était une bonne idée d'avoir une version candidate contenant les patchs qui devraient corriger la corruption du pilote e1000e ».
Dans le domaine des gestionnaire de mémoire pour les cartes graphiques il est probable que GEM va faire son entrée ( dès la version 2.6.28 ou la suivante ) et que TTM a perdu la bataille de l'intégration dans la branche principale .
La comparaison entre les deux solutions qui a été effectuée par les développeurs Linux fait apparaître que TTM est une solution plus complexe , difficile à utiliser et ayant une API en partie conçue pour satisfaire les besoins spécifiques des pilotes propriétaires ( ce qui évidemment ne plait à personne ) .
C'est donc GEM qui a la faveur des développeurs ( Jesse Bernes a annoncé qu'il allait proposer l'inclusion de GEM dans la branche Linux - next ) et cela a provoqué l'émoi de ceux qui voient cette solution comme étant trop liée à Intel .
Le futur est donc , provisoirement , encore ouvert mais les opposants à GEM ont intérêt , s'il n'est pas déjà trop tard , à proposer très rapidement une alternative crédible .
le travail continue sur le système de fichiers btrfs et la version 0.16 a été annoncée par Chris Mason le 5 août dernier .
Btrfs ( prononcer butter fs ) a l'ambition de devenir le système de fichiers de nouvelle génération des systèmes GNU / Linux et introduit beaucoup de nouveautés déjà décrites dans une dépêche précédente .
Cette nouvelle version 0.16 fait disparaître le verrou global de btrfs au profit de nombreux petits verrous locaux afin de tirer parti des machines multiprocesseurs .
Dans la même veine les tâches d'arrière plan diverses ( comme le calcul des sommes de contrôle ) sont maintenant exécutées par des threads séparés .
La version 0.16 apporte également le support des attributs étendus ( ACL ) et un nouveau système de cache pour la gestion des snapshots .

) a l'ambition de devenir le système de fichiers de nouvelle génération des systèmes GNU / Linux et introduit beaucoup de nouveautés déjà décrites dans une dépêche précédente .
Cette nouvelle version 0.16 fait disparaître le verrou global de btrfs au profit de nombreux petits verrous locaux afin de tirer parti des machines multiprocesseurs .
Dans la même veine les tâches d'arrière plan diverses ( comme le calcul des sommes de contrôle ) sont maintenant exécutées par des threads séparés .
La version 0.16 apporte également le support des attributs étendus ( ACL ) et un nouveau système de cache pour la gestion des snapshots .

Btrfs se positionne de plus en plus comme LA solution Linux pour avoir un système de fichiers de nouvelle génération .
Néanmoins tout le monde n'est pas de cet avis et Daniel Phillips a posté le 3 juillet un long mail sur la mailing list du noyau afin d'expliquer les grandes lignes du design d'un système de fichiers alternatif nommé Tux3 ( " Comme tout le monde semble bien s'amuser a développer des nouveaux systèmes de fichiers en ce moment j'ai pensé que je pourrai me joindre à la fête " ) .
Le but de Tux3 est d'implémenter les idées originales de Daniel Phillips sur le versionning , on trouve par exemple les informations sur les versions dans le feuilles des arbres B alors que btrfs et ZFS choisissent de créer un arbre par version .
Cela permettrait à Tux3 de faire une économie de place lors du stockage des méta - données par rapport à ses deux concurrents .
Il est à noter que Matt Dillon , qui dirige le développement de DragonFlyBSD , a échangé plusieurs mails avec Daniel Phillips afin de comparer son système de fichiers HAMMER et Tux3 .
Les deux systèmes partagent de nombreuses idées et la conversation , bien que très technique , a sans aucun doute été mutuellement enrichissante .
Matt a toutefois gentiment prévenu Daniel qu'il s'embarquait peut - être dans un projet plus complexe que ce qu'il pensait : "
Il semble que Tux3 utilise pas mal d'idées similaires à ce que je fais dans HAMMER .
Je pense que tu est sur la bonne voie .
J'ajouterai quand même un mot d'avertissement , venant de mon expérience lors de l'implémentation de HAMMER , parce que je pense que tu va être confronté aux mêmes problèmes .
J'ai passé 9 mois sur le design d'HAMMER et 9 mois pour l'écrire .
Durant l'implémentation j'ai fini par jeter l'équivalent de 80 % de ce qui était dans le design original .
Une bonne part de ce que j'ai du abandonner lors du passage du projet à la réalité était dans le but de diminuer la complexité . (..)
Si j'ai une inquiétude à propos de ton implémentation cela serait dans le secteur de la complexité algorithmique . "
Si les idées de Tux3 sont innovantes il n'en est toutefois absolument pas au même stade de développement que btrfs .
Daniel Philips l'a exprimé avec humour dans un mail daté du premier septembre : "
Les derniers patchs ont permis d'amener Tux3 jusqu 'au point ou il commence indéniablement à se comporter comme un système de fichiers :
On peut écrire des fichiers , partir un moment et , quand on revient , ces fichiers sont toujours là et on peut les relire . "
Le chemin est donc encore long avant de pouvoir envisager l'inclusion dans la branche principale du noyau .

Enfin , preuve du bouillonnement actuel dans le domaine des systèmes de fichiers , un concurrent de plus vient d'apparaître .
Répondant au doux nom de NILFS ( New Implementation of a Log- structured File System ) ce système se propose d'enterrer tous les autres systèmes en se basant sur la technique d'écriture des données « en flux » ( sous forme de log ) sans avoir à se préoccuper d'optimiser l'écrire les données les unes à coté des autres ( ce qui prend beaucoup de temps ) .
L'idée est que les lectures de données se font très souvent à partir de la RAM et qu'il est donc plus rationnel d'optimiser l'écriture plutôt que la lecture .
Le code a été soumis sur la liste de diffusion et un fichier pdf comparant NILFS avec d'autres systèmes de fichiers est disponible .
NILFS semble particulièrement adapté aux nouveaux disques SSD et il constitue donc , aux cotés de LogFS , une alternative possible au tout nouveau UBIFS ( quand l'accès direct à la mémoire flash sous - jacente sera possible ) .
L'inquiétude d'Andrew Morton sur le manque de travail des développeurs face à la vague future des disques SSD semble donc étonnante :
" Il me semble entendre un silence assourdissant au sujet du support de ces périphériques SSD .
J'ai la vague inquiétude que nous allons assister à une diffusion massive de ces SSD et que Linux y fera face avec le pantalon sur les chevilles . "
Andrew Wilcox a été prompt a lui rétorquer qu'au contraire la situation était plutôt bonne et qu'il n'y avait pas de souci à se faire : " Je travaille ( et je poste des patchs ) sur le support des SSD Intel .
Honnêtement nos pantalons évoluent actuellement dans la zone de l'aine . "
Aller plus loin
Un peu plus de deux mois et demi après la version précédente Linus Torvalds a annoncé la sortie de la version 2.6.27 du noyau Linux .
Comme d'habitude le code source de ce nouveau Linux stable est téléchargeable sur les serveurs du site kernel.org
Pour un bilan en chiffres ( analyse statistique issue de cet article du site LWN ) le noyau 2.6.27 aura incorporé plus de 10604 patchs ( 10100 pour les noyau 2.6.26 ) .
Cela représente un gain net de 218000 lignes ( +826000 et - 608000 ) .
On peut noter que le français Jean - François Moine est le troisième contributeur en terme de lignes de code du fait de son important travail sur l'intégration et le nettoyage du pilote de webcam GSPCA
Ces plus de dix mille patchs viennent de 1109 développeurs différents ( 1065 pour le noyau 2.6.26 ) travaillant pour plus de 150 entreprises .
I was shocked on the night of the performance , I can tell you .
I had knocked on his dressing room door to tell him there was an hour before the curtain up , and was sure I could hear someone gently weeping .
I opened the door and saw John sitting at his dressing table wearing a dressing gown and doing terrible punishment to a bottle of Drambuie .
He looked up at me with swollen , tear - filled eyes and tried feebly to smile .
‘ What ’s the matter Mr. Noakes ? ’
I asked .
I must admit the sight of one of my idols crying into a bottle ( and his bottle was definitely half empty ) disturbed me greatly .
‘ Oh nothing … nothing , here sit down , ’ replied John , wiping his tears on the back of his towelled sleeve .
He patted a stool next to his .
I sat down .
After a long silence he turned to me , a far away look in his eyes .
“ Love ’s a funny thing , is n’t it son ? ”
He took another pull on the Drambuie , spilling some of it down his chin where it dripped forlornly into the folds of his gown .
‘ Eh ? ’
Being eighteen years old I knew nothing of love .
The nearest I ’d got to love with a woman was pulling myself off over picture stories from my little sister ’s Jackie comics .
‘ Love son , love …it ’s a funny thing , ’ he burped .
Snot dribbled down his top lip and he sucked it up absent - mindedly .
I thought about this for a while .
I was sure that it was , but I also felt sure that his statement required a certain answer …
I did n’t want to set him off crying again and he’d be up in front of the Queen in just over an hour .
‘ I suppose it is Mr. Noakes , I would n’t really know . ’
I could n’t help looking round at the door , my illusion of John ’s hard - man image was falling apart .
They say that you should never meet your heroes .
‘ Take Valerie Singleton .
I … I loved her for years lad , years … and I never told her . ’
He made a sound somewhere between a sniff , a sob and a belch and closed his eyes .
‘ Oh ’ I said .
‘ Never told her …never fucking told her .
Could n’t you see , she would n’t look at me …would n’t fucking look at a p- poor northern boy like me !’
He brought his bottle angrily up to his mouth and , unaware that he ’d just smashed one of his front teeth out , took another pull of Drambuie ( and blood ) .
I was now desperate ; I did n’t want to be there anymore .
‘ Shep loved me ! ’
He wailed .
Oh shit , he ’s brought the fucking dog up .
Again .
‘ And I loved Shep ! ’
He was starting to shout .
I suddenly noticed that in his drunken state his dressing gown was falling open .
I noticed his nipples .
Christ they were hairy .
And it was n’t human hair .
‘ Fucking hell John ! ’
I rasped , ‘ what the fuck happened to your nipples ? ’
But John did n’t hear .
He swayed to his feet , the cord on his dressing gown becoming worryingly loose .
‘ I never fucking told her !
I never told her and thought I ’d never have her…but Jesus Christ son , she ’s just telegrammed me . ’
He shoved a tear - stained telegram in my face .
I read it .
To cut a long story short it seemed that Valerie Singleton had only just come to the boil and had told him , in no uncertain terms , that he was on a promise after the show .
I did n’t know the language of love at that tender age and some of the terms were unfamiliar .
‘ I ’m going to fuck you big boy ’ was obvious but I did n’t know what a ‘ hot lunch ’ was .
It sounded good for him anyway .
‘ What ’s the problem then , Mr. Noakes ? ’
I asked , confused .
‘ It looks like you ’re up for a right seeing - to , and no mistake … ’
‘ What ’s the problem ?!’ he barked , ‘ WHAT ’S THE FUCKING PROBLEM ?!
IT ’S SHEP !!’
‘ But…but Shep ’s dead Mr. Noakes , Shep ’s dead !’
John swayed and looked down on me , the hint of a triumphant smile on his wet lips .
‘ Oh no he ’s not … Not thanks to modern science .
Shep ’s alive .
IN ME !!’
‘ What ?
I do n’t understand !’
Panic was rising in my chest , I tried to rise but he pushed me firmly back down .
‘ Surgery boy !
Surgery !
I ’ve melded Shep into my own body !
It was the right thing to do …it felt so good !’
Jesus , suddenly the hairy nipples made sense … they were Shep’s !
But , surely , he ca n’t have …
‘ But oh !
The irony !’ he gargled , ‘ I have my little Sheppy forever , but because of this , I ca n’t have Valerie , she wo n’t want me now ! ’
I had to think fast .
‘ But it ’s only nipples John , surely you can keep your shirt on and she ’ll never know ! ’
His hand moved up to the back of my head , grabbing my hair and twisting it around his strong fingers .
‘ Oh she ’ll know alright boy , she ’ll know … ’
I gagged in horror as his dressing gown fell to the floor .
The nipples were the least of it .
I watched , frozen with horror as his canine lipstick started to emerge from within himself , leaking a silken thread of doggy pre-cum two inches from my face .
‘ But you do n’t mind do you lad ? … You do n’t mind … ’
I was powerless to resist as Shep ’s engorged member forced its way to the back of my throat .
We The People
It 's because you wo n't cover it !
Kucinich has introduced the Articles of Impeachment against Bush ... and the Media has n't said shit .
" Liberal Media " my ass !
The Media is fucking fascist , end of story .
They are utterly controlled by the same corporate interests that control both major political parties .
That 's why Dennis Kucinich is a pariah in his own party -- he actually looks out for the Constitution and the rights of .
Such dedication to Liberty is considered treason in the bowels of both the Democratic and Republican parties .
A few mainstream outlets picked up the story and managed to spend an approximate average of less than 200 words describing the measure .
They could n't even be bothered to list more than a few of the 35 articles of impeachment I 've seen better reporting in a fucking high school newspaper .
I do n't blame the beat reporters ; if their editors said " give me 2,000 words " they would have .
As is , they probably had to fight to get 200 .
But it 's disgusting .
I mean , jeeze , it 's only the impeachment of the goddamn President of the United States of America .
They all managed to mention that it 's not politically feasible .
Well I wonder why that is , you jackasses !
If you did , everything would change , no matter how shitty and biased your coverage .
Mr. 25 % Approval Rating would not find many advocates in the populace , even if he would in the dominant press .
And then you 'd look pretty stupid , would n't you , defending the murdering megalomaniac who launched an illegal war .
Those of us who still remember the impeachment of Bill Clinton know that it takes very little to whip the Media into a frothing frenzy of obsessive , inane coverage .
Surely you could do the same for Bush .
But you wo n't .
Because you 're traitors .
Yeah , that 's right .
I said it .
And it 's true .
This president is the most evil , diabolical man ever elected and you , the supposed Fourth Estate , wo n't criticize him in a voice above a whisper .
It 's fucking pathetic .
Look at Kucinich 's 35 articles of impeachment .
There 's a lot of red meat here :
# 1 : Creating a secret propaganda campaign to manufacture a false case for war against Iraq # 2 Falsely , Systematically , and with Criminal Intent Conflating the Attacks of September 11 , 2001 , With Misrepresentation of Iraq as a Security Threat as Part of Fraudulent Justification for a War of Aggression # 3 Misleading the American People and Members of Congress to Believe Iraq Possessed Weapons of Mass Destruction , to Manufacture a False Case for War # 4 Misleading the American People and Members of Congress to Believe Iraq Posed an Imminent Threat to the United States # 14 : Misprision of a felony , misuse and exposure of classified information and cover up ( Plame outing ) # 15 : Providing immunity from prosecution for criminal conduct for contractors in Iraq # 17 : Illegal detention – detaining indefinitely , and without charge , American citizens and foreign captives ( suspension of habeus ) # 18 : Torture – secretly authorizing and encouraging use of torture , as matter of official policy # 19 Rendition # 24 Spying on citizens violating 4th Amendment # 26 Announcing intent to violate laws w / signing statements , and then violating those laws .
# 27 Failing to comply with congressional subpoenas , and instructing others to do so .
# 29 : Conspiracy to violate voting rights act of 1965 , Ohio Sec of State 2004 - 06 # 34 : Obstruction into the investigation of 9/11
OVER ONE MILLION IRAQI INNOCENTS
That 's just a few of them .
And this is n't wing - nut stuff , this is all stuff that has been discussed at one time or another in the mainstream press .
Much of it was hushed up ( the NSA spying scandal , election fraud , 9/11 obstruction ) but some of it was loud and clear ( torture , Plame , illegal Iraq War ) .
Far from being left - wing lunacy , this is the last 7.5 years , distilled into 35 bullet points .
And yet the Media wo n't cover a congressman trying to hold Bush / Cheney accountable for their crimes .
I already told you why .
But let it sink in .
The Mainstream Media are the ones who made the Bush / Cheney disaster possible .
They 're the ones who greased the wheels , regurgitated the lies , jumped on the bandwagon and hushed up the really bad shit .
Bush , without a fawning press corps , is just another partisan nutcase with a rich daddy .
He would n't 've been re-elected , let alone " elected " in the first place ( another coverup there ) .
Let me lay it down for ya , real simple :
If Bush hangs , Brian Williams should hang , too .
If Cheney hangs , Tim Russert needs to swing from the same pole .
If Rumsfeld goes down to the gallows , Charles Krauthammer and David Brooks need to die too .
The blood ofis on their hands .
Maybe that 's why the Media is so protective of the Bush regime :
They know if Bush goes down , they all go down .
They 've all bloodied their hands and sullied their souls together .
Might as well stick together until the bitter end .
But if we do n't stop them , they 'll turn this nation into a fascist state and make you and I into criminals for believing in justice , peace and freedom .
Somehow we 've got to stop them , but I just do n't know how .
I 'm just some random guy with a blog .
What can I do ?
There 's no one representing my interests in Washington except Dennis Kucinich .
One man , standing up against the Forces of Evil , spitting in the wind and calling for change .
This does n't look good for the underdogs .
Meanwhile , the supposed hope of mankind is cozying up to Israel , possibly attending the secret Bilderberg meeting ( another media coverup ) and generally doing whatever it takes to get elected .
Fair enough .
But Barack Obama had better watch out that he does n't sell his soul in the process .
Maybe the whole Obama campaign is just a mirage , a hallucination by those of us who have dreamed of someone who could bring our government back from the brink of tyranny and outright fascism .
I hope I 'm wrong , but it 's hard to believe in anything or anybody anymore .
We 've been utterly betrayed by the government , the media and the elite .
It just hurts too much to care anymore .
The audacity of hope , indeed .
I 'd feel a lot more hopeful if I knew somebody out there was fighting the good fight .
I sleep a little sounder knowing Kucinich has the balls of a man twice his size , but he 's only one man .
We need a few hundred more like him in Congress .
Dennis Kucinich : I salute you .
You are a true American patriot .

Update - 2009 - 11 -17 : GMAC 's Board of Directors , independent of any federal influence , forced the resignation of GMAC Financial Services ' CEO Alvaro de Molina on Monday according to a report in the Wall Street Journal .
He was replaced by Michael Carpenter , who told Bloomberg in an interview that Rescap " has been a drag on the company and we need to find a solution . "
What that solution may be remains to be seen :
" The government is running into bailout fatigue and GMAC is realizing it can't rely on this pool of support from the taxpayers , " said Sean Egan , president of Egan - Jones Ratings Co. in Haverford , Pennsylvania .
" The easiest group of assets to jettison , if you want to call them assets , is ResCap .
They 've been a source of a huge amount of embarrassment and pain . "
The shakeup comes on the heels of news that GMAC is seeking yet a third infusion from the government 's Troubled Asset Relief Program .
GMAC reportedly asked the Treasury to delay its investment to allow the new CEO to assess the company 's needs .
Carpenter told the New York Times " The $ 5.6 billion is off the table .
What the exact number is , I do n't know .
Update - 2009-02-03 : GMAC posted preliminary results for the fourth quarter and full year 2008 today , with ResCap reporting a $ 981 million loss on the quarter .
GMAC was granted bank holding status and received a $ 5 billion investment from TARP .
ResCap got a $ 1.67 billion equity contribution from GMAC , and gave up its non-voting equity interest in the parent of GMAC Bank :
" On Jan. 30 , 2009 , GMAC acquired 100 percent of ResCap 's non-voting equity interest in IB Finance Holdings , the parent company of GMAC Bank .
As a result , all voting and economic interests in IB Finance are now owned directly by GMAC . "
Another apron string cut detangling ResCap 's ties to the bank , yet GMAC remains steadfast in its commitment to auto and mortgage finance :
" Looking ahead , challenges still remain and GMAC will focus on transitioning the company to meet all bank holding company requirements ; further strengthening the liquidity and capital position ; building a world - class organization ; expanding and diversifying customer - focused revenue opportunities in auto and mortgage ; and driving returns by repositioning the risk profile and maximizing efficiencies , " de Molina said .
Update - 2008 - 12 - 26 : Shortly after the close of trading on Christmas Eve , GMAC announced it had received Fed approval to become a bank holding company .
Quoting GMAC CEO Alvaro G. deMolina , CNN Money reported " GMAC will be competitively positioned for the long - term to provide financing to auto and mortgage consumers and businesses such as automotive dealers . "
Under the federal order , GM will reduce its ownwership interest in GMAC from 49 % to 10 % , with remaining equity interest being transferred to a trustee .
Cerberus ' 51 % interest will be reduced to 33 % , distributing those interests to its respective fund investors .
Converting to bank holding status makes GMAC eligible to apply for funds from the TARP program .
How much remains to be seen .
CNBC reported that spokesperson Gina Proia said " GMAC has submitted an application to the Treasury Department for money from the government rescue fund , though she declined to say how much the company is seeking . "
Employee reaction to the news at Residential Capital LLC was mixed with optimism .
Wrote one worker at the Ft. Washington , PA call center :
" The conditions have been rather awful .
Employees who have worked for ResCap for years are walking out and not bothering to even say good bye .
We are dropping massive amounts of calls and last week the hold times were as long as two hours during busy times of day .
Moreover , we do state by state licensing so even if a customer eventually gets through , we often have to tell them that we 're not licensed in their state and will have someone call them back .
Obviously , not everyone gets a call back ...
We are priced way out of the market .
We generally have to charge 2.5 points to offer the same rate most other mortgage companies are offering with zero points .
I would say right now things are as bad as they can be , so this news can only mean that things will get better .
I think we 'll stay open , get national licensing so every loan officer can help every call , reduce our pricing to be more competitive , and at least for now remain a major presence in the business . "
Update - 2008 - 12-13 : GMAC has once again extended the deadline in a press release citing an " agreement in principal " that represents " substantial progress . "
In the same breath ... " significant additional participation will also be required . "
" GMAC announced that it has extended the early delivery time with respect to the offers to 5:00 p.m. , New York City time , on December 16 , 2008 and extended the expiration date of the offers to 11:59 p.m. , New York City time , on December 26 , 2008 . "
The previous extension only yielded an additional commitment of less than $ 1 billion :
" To date , approximately $ 6.8 billion in aggregate principal amount ( or 24 % ) of the outstanding GMAC old notes have been tendered in the GMAC offers and approximately $ 2.4 billion in aggregate principal amount ( or 25 % ) of the outstanding ResCap old notes have been tendered in the ResCap offers . "
" My boss says it does n't look good , " an inside source told us .
" If we were n't looking [ for work elsewhere ] then we'd be foolish . "
Update - 2008 - 12-10 : GMAC is woefully short of its goal to " buy or swap " at least 75 % of the $ 38 billion of debt held by ResCap and other divisions that would enable it to become a bank holding company .
From the AP :
" So far , only about $ 6.3 billion , or 22 percent , of the outstanding GMAC notes have been tendered and about $ 2 billion , or 21 percent , of the outstanding ResCap notes have been tendered , GMAC said . "
The deadline for the offers has been extended to Friday , December 12 , 2008 .
" If the offers are n't successful , " the article goes on , " GMAC said it will withdraw its application to become a bank holding company . "
Bloomberg reports :
" The company said that if it does n't complete the swap and win Fed approval by Dec. 31 , " it would have a near - term material adverse effect on GMAC 's business , results of operations , and financial position . " "
Update - 2008 - 11 - 20 :
In its 8 K filing with the SEC today , GMAC announced plans to raise an additional $ 500 million " to improve ResCap 's liquidity . "
Without GMAC 's continued support and the successful execution of this and other initiatives , it is acknowledged that ResCap 's days may be numbered .
" In light of ResCap 's liquidity and capital needs , combined with volatile conditions in the marketplace , there is substantial doubt about ResCap 's ability to continue as a going concern . "
Update - 2008 - 11-05 : 2008 's third quarter earnings are out , and the picture still looks grim for Residential Capital .
From Reuters :
Some analysts said ResCap may not survive beyond early 2009 despite having already slashed risky lending , reduced risk on its balance sheet , and shed some 10,000 jobs over two years .
" It 's not a foregone conclusion that they 're done , but they 're close , " said David Lykken , president of the consulting firm Mortgage Banking Solutions in Austin , Texas , who said he has clients that may want to buy ResCap assets .
A sale of all or part of the unit would be one possibility , but likely only at a distressed price .
" Given market conditions , and given that collateral values are still falling in markets where they lent , I think a bankruptcy is imminent , within the next 60 days , " Lykken said .
Christopher Wolfe , an analyst at Fitch Ratings , added : " If GMAC ca n't provide support that ResCap needs , then bankruptcy is an option for ResCap . "
Having heard that repeatedly for over a year now , we 're inclined to think bankruptcy as an " option " is more of an " inevitability . "
Update - 2008-09 - 24 : From a press release yesterday , Canada 's Brookfield Residential Property Services ( " BRPS " ) , a division of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. announced it had entered into an agreement with GMAC Holdings and Residential Capital LLC to acquire GMAC Home Services LLC .
" The GMAC Home Services ' business units that are part of this acquisition include : GMAC Global Relocation Services , GMAC Real Estate and GMAC Home Services Mortgage . "
What might not be immediately obvious here is the implication for ResCap .
This leaves Residential Capital LLC standing with Ditech , GMAC Bank , Homecomings Financial ( now just a servicing arm ) and the skeletal remains of GMAC Mortgage .
Having divested all but the remaining mortgage subsidiaries , is it too much of a leap to conclude ResCap is now positioned for the bankruptcy that has been repeatedly predicted ?
Residential Capital , LLC should not be confused with Residential Capital Mortgage Corporation in Henderson , NV .
Update - 2008-09-08 : The Mortgage Lender Implode - O- Meter has received credible information that GMAC may file for bankruptcy as early as Wednesday , September 10 , 2008 .
We do know they are scrambling to move / sell assets prior to this tentative filing date , and we are attempting to confirm the information received .
GMAC 's Gina Proia in Media Relations got back to us and suggests " There is no basis for this type of speculation . "
A full statement of denial is here .
Described on their web site as GMAC Financial Services , GMAC " operates in approximately 40 countries in automotive finance , real estate finance , insurance and commercial finance businesses . "
On Nov. 30 , 2006 , GM sold a 51 percent controlling interest in GMAC to a consortium of investors led by Cerberus Capital Management , L.P. , a private investment firm , and included Citigroup Inc. , Aozora Bank Ltd. and a subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group , Inc .
According to Bloomberg , Aozora Bank Ltd. , the Japanese lender controlled by Cerberus Capital Management LP , fell to a record low in Tokyo trading after a report said it may post a loss for the fiscal first half ending Sept. 30 .
" Aozora plans to take a writedown of 17.8 billion yen this year on an investment in GMAC after the partly owned finance unit of General Motors Corp. recorded a $ 2.5 billion loss in the second quarter . "
Stuart Hoffman , chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group ( commenting on the Freddie / Fannie bailout ) , expects " the economy will flatline " which does not boost the overall outlook for investments like their part in GMAC .
Exactly which GMAC units are involved has yet to be ascertained .
Stay tuned .
Update - 2008-09 -02 : A reliable source told us GMAC Mortgage would be shutting down its Retail origination platform , letting go " LO's , RM's , DM's , assistants , and the like . "
We were given to understand one region had well in excess of 400 loan officers , and while the tipster was unsure how many regional offices were left , the number of employees affected would reportedly " be in the thousands ... all retail branches . "
Today , the official announcement came out , and GMAC Mortgage retail is not the only part of ResCap that 's being impacted .
From an internal memo sent to all employees by ResCap Chairman and CEO Tom Marano :
In order to address these and other developments in the credit markets , we are taking action today to streamline and sharpen the focus of ResCap 's operations .
These changes are painful .
However , I firmly believe that they are necessary to reposition ResCap as a more cost - efficient and effective company .
These actions will help us to significantly reduce our operating costs by year end .
Achieving these numbers will regrettably impact approximately 5,000 associates in ResCap and in the corporate functional groups that support ResCap 's businesses .
A separate announcement also went out to brokers .
All 200 GMAC Mortgage retail offices are being closed , and the Homecomings Wholesale Channel will cease loan originations through brokers .
Additional consolidation will occur in Information Technology , Risk , Finance , Human Resources , Legal and Procurement .
Noted in the announcement :
" Business Capital Group ( BCG ) , which provides capital solutions to builders and developers , is substantially contracting the scope of its operations due to the ongoing decline in credit conditions and reduced consumer demand in the housing markets . "
Speaking with a recently displaced employee , we were told Ditech 's direct ( phone / internet ) lending platform would be the only retail origination operation remaining under the ResCap umbrella of companies .
GMAC Bank 's Correspondent and Wholesale Lending divisions continue to do business in the secondary market , but have drastically cut back product & program offerings over the past months and now offer strictly Agency and FHA / VA loans .
This will be applied to all of ResCap 's origination channels , as the memo states :
" Going forward , this means that we will only originate loans that are : - Supported by Government Sponsored Enterprise programs such as Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae , or which can be sold to another guaranteed investor partner ; and - Originated through the following ResCap channels : GMAC Bank correspondents , including support for lenders with warehouse lines of credit ; GMAC Mortgage direct ; ditech call centers ; and the GMAC Mortgage Charlotte , N.C. , call center . "
Bloomberg and MarketWatch are reporting the layoffs amount to nearly 60 % of ResCap staff , and all 200 GMAC Mortgage retail offices will be closed .
ResCap will realize charges of $ 90 to $ 120 million related to the initial 3,000 job cuts , with more projected in the future for the remaining 2,000 .

Update - 2008-08 - 21 :
We continue to hear about more contractions at GMAC Bank .
Writing about their Correspondent lending division a tipster said , " GMAC is dropping nearly all of it's programs , and killing deals right and left for no apparent reason .
It 's a pretty good bet they will cease operations in the next couple of weeks . "
GMAC announced all Jumbo products were being suspended effective today .
Another tipster sent this news :

This affects their entire remaining national team of 8 Recruiters .
Also , David Ahlers , the company 's top HR manager , has left the company .
The company has been reduced to 3 operating divisions ( from 6 ) and there is a total hiring FREEZE on ALL positions company wide .

" GMAC Mortgage just announced they are closing their Troy MI processing center and cutting the regions down to 3 .
They also are suspending the entire Home Equity loans , " one tipster wrote .
" I believe they announced it by a conference call . "
Another source confirmed the above information , and indicated there was a memo that had been sent to employees .
We are trying to obtain a copy .
In their 2008 - 08 -08 10Q filing for the second quarter of 2008 , Rescap reported a $ 1.9 billion loss , including $ 233.3 million in net charge - offs :
" In our domestic mortgage business , we have shifted the bulk of our loan production to prime mortgage products that conform to the requirements of government - sponsored enterprises .
In our international business , we generally restrict originations to those products and markets for which liquidity remains available , and we have suspended new loan originations in the United Kingdom , Europe and Australia . "
Update - 2008-08-06 : Tips coming in have alerted us that the Bellevue , WA office of Homecomings has now received notice of its shutdown .
One tipster said , " mgmt had a conference call yesterday at 4 pm and then stayed in the conf room til late - they had a meeting today telling them all . "
We called the office and confirmed the announcement .
Approximately 80 employees were affected .
Update - 2008-07 - 29 :
In an announcement sent to brokers ( view pdf ) , Homecomings said they were discontinuing home equity lending entirely .
Loans in the pipeline must be locked by 2008 - 07 - 31 .
This includes both closed - end seconds and home equity lines of credit .
Update - 2008 -06 - 20 : Homecomings is hunkering down with branch consolidations and lay offs .
From a 2008 - 06 - 17 memo sent to employees :
After thorough research and consideration , we have determined that it will be necessary to consolidate the Cherry Hill , Petaluma , and Charlotte facilities by moving selected operations to our Dallas , Ft. Washington , and Minneapolis locations .
The Cherry Hill facility will close on October 4 , 2008 and the Petaluma facility will close on October 31 , 2008 .

Approximately 337 associates in Cherry Hill , 62 associates in Petaluma , and 71 associates in Charlotte will be impacted by these changes .
Ninety - six positions will be eliminated and 374 associates will be offered positions at alternative sites .
A tipster told us there remain about 80 people in the Bellevue office .
" Account managers laid off ... is about 8 , " the source wrote .
" There will be more to come in this branch in the next 30 days if it [ stays ] open at all . "
Meanwhile , GMAC & Rescap stay atop the news , and the downgrades continue .
Reuter 's reports Rescap now accounts for 85 % of GMAC 's net worth .
" ResCap and GMAC earlier this month completed a $ 60 billion refinancing to buy time to turn around the struggling lender , which is paying a steep price for its risky bets on residential mortgage loans . "
The refinancing included additional capital infusions from GMAC and Cerberus of $ 1.4 billion dollars , as reported when the deal was completed on 2008 - 06 - 04 .
Update - 2008-06-03 : Rescap 's floundering becomes markedly more desperate .
Today in Yahoo Business :
Residential Capital LLC , the mortgage lending unit of GMAC LLC , said Tuesday it needs more than three times more cash to stay in business than it estimated just weeks ago .
ResCap estimates it now needs about $ 2 billion in cash by the end of June to meet liquidity demands , according to a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
It previously estimated it needed just $ 600 million by the end of the month .
Update - 2008-05-06 : Rescap has inched steadily closer to bankruptcy since our last update , as recent news suggests .
Bloomberg reports today that GMAC " may keep the mortgage unit afloat long enough to find a buyer or break it up . "
Yesterday , Rescap announced an offering to exchange $ 14 billion of notes to extend maturies between 2010 and 2015 for " as little as 80 cents on the dollar , " Bloomberg reported .
" To finance the debt restructuring , ResCap is seeking a new $ 3.5 billion credit line from its parent GMAC , " the article notes .
Rescap admits even this may not be enough in it 's Q1 8 - K filing with the SEC :
" There is a significant risk that we will not be able to meet our debt service obligations , be unable to meet certain financial covenants in our credit facilities , and be in a negative liquidity position in June 2008 . "
Rescap ( Residential Capital , LLC ) is a wholly owned subsidiary of GMAC , LLC ( which is owned by General Motors Corp. and Cerberus Capital Management L.P. ) .
Rescap subsidiaries at risk of BK or being dumped include Ditech , GMAC Bank , GMAC Mortgage , and Homecomings Financial .
Update - 2008 -04 - 24 :
In news we posted today , HousingWire reports Rescap " had borrowed $ 468 million ... against a $ 750 million credit facility " newly established with GMAC on 2008 - 04 - 18 .
Also of concern : $ 875 million in revolving credit and a $ 1.75 billion dollar loan , set to mature in June and July respectively .
On 2008 - 04-07 The Street reported that GMAC " bought ResCap debt with a face value of $ 1.2 billion in the open market for just $ 607 million " and " investors are questioning how long the company will continue to invest in ResCap to keep the second largest independent mortgage lender out of bankruptcy . "
Update - 2008 -02 - 22 :
In an article out today , S&P downgrades will put more pressure on GMAC to inject more money , or bail out :
" NEW YORK , Feb 22 ( Reuters ) - GMAC LLC and its Residential Capital LLC mortgage unit were cut several notches deeper into junk status by Standard & Poor 's , which said mounting mortgage losses might require new capital injections from General Motors Corp ( GM.N : Quote , Profile , Research ) and Cerberus Capital Management LP [ CBS.UL ] .
S&P on Friday downgraded GMAC three notches to " B - plus , " its fourth - highest junk grade , from " BB - plus , " and cut ResCap four notches to " B " from " BB - plus . "
Its rating outlook is negative , suggesting further downward pressure . "
Update - 2007 - 11 - 23 : Rescap appears to be heading closer to the Imploded list per an article November 20 , 2007 :
" NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Bond investors are betting that finance company GMAC , and its major backer Cerberus Capital LP ( CBS.UL : Quote , Profile , Research ) , will not provide further capital injections for GMAC 's unit Residential Capital ( ResCap ) , the second - largest independent U.S. mortgage lender .
Bonds of ResCap already trade at levels reflecting bankruptcy fears , and investors say ResCap would need at least another $ 1 billion capital injection from GMAC or Cerberus in the next month to avoid violating loan agreements with debt investors . "

Update ( 2007 - 10 - 26 ) : Homecomings Financial is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GMAC LLC .
According to a Manager who is being laid off this week , Homecomings is closing all offices this year and will maintain one office in each of North Carolina , Texas , and Washington .
A Mortgage Broker in California received this from their AE :
" Homecomings Financial is going through a company wide restructuring due to the current market conditions .
Unfortunately , we had to layoff 3,000 people today , which is 25 % of our workforce .
Our Newport Beach office will be closing as of December 31st , 2008 and migrating with the Bellevue , Washington office .
In addition , in saddens me to say that every AE that has been with the company for less than 12 months has been layed off , which includes me ... "

Will cut around 1,000 jobs .
Causing headaches for GM ; even though they sold GMAC in Nov 2006 :
GM , which announced Thursday that it would n't report its results as scheduled tomorrow because of accounting problems and the need to finalize GMAC numbers , sold 51 % of GMAC for $ 14 billion to Cerberus Capital Management .
The deal closed Nov. 30 , and accountants for GM and Cerberus have since been poring over the books to make sure the $ 14.4 billion tangible net book value ascribed to GMAC at the time is reliable .
If the value is higher or lower , GM or Cerberus may need to pay out certain settlements .
... Lehman Brothers auto analyst Brian Johnson said in a note Friday that complications related to estimating the value of GMAC's [ Residential Capital , LLC ] mortgage unit could cost the auto maker $ 300 million to $ 400 million in cash charges in the first half .
[ Residential Capital , LLC ] has long been viewed as the crown jewel in the GMAC portfolio , but it has fallen under industrywide pressure that has hurt many traditionally strong lenders and may have diminished [ Residential Capital , LLC ] 's value .
A Lehman update has subsequently put the estimate of the write - downs and other related expenses at $ 950 million .
I guess GM was too slow .
* Note : Not to be confused with Residential Capital , LP , another Lender .
Houses of cards , chickens coming home to roost - pick your cliche .
The new low in the financial crisis , which has prompted comparisons with the 1929 Wall Street crash , is the fruit of a pattern of dishonesty on the part of financial institutions , and incompetence on the part of policymakers .
We had become accustomed to the hypocrisy .
The banks reject any suggestion they should face regulation , rebuff any move towards anti-trust measures - yet when trouble strikes , all of a sudden they demand state intervention : they must be bailed out ; they are too big , too important to be allowed to fail .
Eventually , however , we were always going to learn how big the safety net was .
And a sign of the limits of the US Federal Reserve and treasury 's willingness to rescue comes with the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers , one of the most famous Wall Street names .
The big question always centres on systemic risk : to what extent does the collapse of an institution imperil the financial system as a whole ?
Wall Street has always been quick to overstate systemic risk - take , for example , the 1994 Mexican financial crisis - but loth to allow examination of their own dealings .
Last week the US treasury secretary , Henry Paulson , judged there was sufficient systemic risk to warrant a government rescue of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ; but there was not sufficient systemic risk seen in Lehman .
The present financial crisis springs from a catastrophic collapse in confidence .
The banks were laying huge bets with each other over loans and assets .
Complex transactions were designed to move risk and disguise the sliding value of assets .
In this game there are winners and losers .
And it 's not a zero - sum game , it 's a negative - sum game : as people wake up to the smoke and mirrors in the financial system , as people grow averse to risk , losses occur ; the market as a whole plummets and everyone loses .
Financial markets hinge on trust , and that trust has eroded .
Lehman 's collapse marks at the very least a powerful symbol of a new low in confidence , and the reverberations will continue .
The crisis in trust extends beyond banks .
In the global context , there is dwindling confidence in US policymakers .
At July 's G8 meeting in Hokkaido the US delivered assurances that things were turning around at last .
The weeks since have done nothing but confirm any global mistrust of government experts .
How seriously , then , should we take comparisons with the crash of 1929 ?
Most economists believe we have the monetary and fiscal instruments and understanding to avoid collapse on that scale .
And yet the IMF and the US treasury , together with central banks and finance ministers from many other countries , are capable of supporting the sort of " rescue " policies that led Indonesia to economic disaster in 1998 .
Moreover , it is difficult to have faith in the policy wherewithal of a government that oversaw the utter mismanagement of the war in Iraq and the response to Hurricane Katrina .
If any administration can turn this crisis into another depression , it is the Bush administration .
America 's financial system failed in its two crucial responsibilities : managing risk and allocating capital .
The industry as a whole has not been doing what it should be doing - for instance creating products that help Americans manage critical risks , such as staying in their homes when interest rates rise or house prices fall - and it must now face change in its regulatory structures .
Regrettably , many of the worst elements of the US financial system - toxic mortgages and the practices that led to them - were exported to the rest of the world .
It was all done in the name of innovation , and any regulatory initiative was fought away with claims that it would suppress that innovation .
They were innovating , all right , but not in ways that made the economy stronger .
Some of America 's best and brightest were devoting their talents to getting around standards and regulations designed to ensure the efficiency of the economy and the safety of the banking system .
Unfortunately , they were far too successful , and we are all - homeowners , workers , investors , taxpayers - paying the price .

" We want to create great new options for communities that have been traditionally under - served , " Mr Duncan said in the Chicago Tribune .
" If you look at national studies , you see gay and lesbian students with high dropout rates ...
I think there is a niche there we need to fill . "
Is n’t it ludicrous even to ask such a question ?
Apparently not , in the presidential race of 2008 .
I ’ve spent the better part of the last two weeks absorbing and reflecting on the drama of the conventions .
I got so whupped up alongside the head with the Palin pick , followed by incredulity at the delirious embrace by her party , that I ’m only just now managing to mobilize some reactions .
One of the strongest is that I do n’t want – and we do n’t need – “ just a regular Joe – or Jane ” – at the helm of this nation , whether as president or vice president .
Palin has been touted as a hockey mom normal folks can relate to , a small - town gal who somehow exudes virtue merely because of those roots , an NRA - backing good ol ’ girl who can fish and hunt and dress her game alongside the boys – yet is n’t afraid to keep the boys in line in her state when they misbehave .
Rah-rah , Sarah Barracuda .
Many of the contrasts drawn in the media barrage of late have been , interestingly , between Palin and Obama , not Palin and Biden .
Perhaps it ’s their similar age , and that each has been accused of an experience deficit .
Obama ’s detractors have further tried to frame him as a self - serving , offensively ambitious , liberal elitist , “ out of touch ” with regular folk like residents of Wasilla , Alaska — ergo , unfit to be president .
( Oops – arrogant and presumptuous of me to resort to Latin ; sorry . )
Apparently it ’s a problem when a presidential candidate has an Ivy League education .
Heaven forbid we ’d want to put in office someone with a political science bachelor ’s degree from Columbia with a specialization in international affairs , who then went on to Harvard Law School and became the first African - American to edit the Harvard Law Review .
As good populists we are not going to make a distinction between Harvard and the University of Idaho .
Nor are we going to suggest that there is any difference in the value or quality of post - graduate experience in which one individual went on to a fellowship at the University of Chicago Law School while the other became a sports broadcaster for a local Anchorage TV station .
Obama , who chose to waste his time in community activism , directed the Illinois Project Vote from April to October 1992 , a voter registration drive that marshaled 700 volunteers to achieve its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state , leading Crain ’s Chicago Business to name Obama to its 1993 list of “ Forty under 40 ” powers to be .
After being appointed as a Lecturer in constitutional law at the University of Chicago , Obama joined a small law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development .
From there to the Illinois state senate , then to Washington where he held assignments on the Senate Committees for Veterans ’ Affairs and Homeland Security , and served as Chairman of the Senate ’s subcommittee on European Affairs .
As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , he made official trips to Eastern Europe , the Middle East , Central Asia and Africa .
Ms. Palin got her first passport in 2007 .
How dare someone suggest that there are different degrees of “ inexperience ” ?
( Footnote : thanks to a Sept. 3 Xtreme English blog post called “ Experience ?
Let ’s Compare , ” for some of these details . )
There ’s been a lot of banter , too , about Obama ’s “ pretty language ” and smooth rhetoric , suggesting that it ’s all just a lot of words , a showy veneer .
However , rhetoric – the ability to use language effectively , the art of persuasive oratory — has held a venerable place in classical education .
Originating in ancient Greece , it was also taught in the Roman Empire and as one of the three subjects of the trivium , or liberal arts , during the Middle Ages , alongside logic and grammar .
To communicate well persuasively – to order one ’s thoughts , to select and support powerful arguments , and to make a case through potent , moving prose , is – take it from a college professor in 2008 – a rare and dying art .
Far from being verbal fluff , effective oration reflects effective thinking .
A president who can think : a no-brainer ?
Maybe not .
I ’ve heard Obama criticized because he is not black and white enough on some issues , particularly those involving moral dilemmas .
The fact that Obama recognizes and grapples with complexity is , for some , a weak spot , rather than a hallmark of a sharp intellect .
Better that we have a president who can make pat , simple judgments and act forcibly on them , than wrestle with the layers and oppositions and challenges to reason presented by dilemmas like how to help Israelis and Palestinians live together , or how best to reduce the number of abortions in America , or whether or not “ clean coal ” can ever really be clean when hundreds of square miles of Appalachian mountaintops have been blasted away to get at it .
John McCain said in his acceptance speech that access to education is the new civil rights movement in America .
He was applauded for that statement by his supporters on the convention floor .
Yet these are the same voices who deride an African - American candidate ’s “ elite ” education , who suggest that Obama is ill - suited to serve as president precisely because of such an academic pedigree .
Paul Krugman wrote in the New York Times , “ What struck me … is how much of the anger on the right is based not on the claim that Democrats have done bad things , but on the perception – generally based on no evidence whatsoever – that Democrats look down their noses at regular people . ”
What irony .
The party of labor , the party of the downtrodden , the party of the peripheral , the party of the people ?
Has n’t something gotten twisted around here ?
I ’m a Democrat , from a long line of FDR - style Democrats , and I ’d say I ’m one of those regular people .
My grandfather was a miner , who later with my grandmother moved to Seattle to help build airplanes during WWII .
My other grandmother raised three girls on her own and walked each day – they had no car – to her job as a department store clerk in a small town .
My father was a suburban P.E. teacher , my mother a dental assistant , and I worked as a grocery checker at Safeway in blue - collar Everett , Washington , to put myself through college .
That ’s pretty ‘ regular . ’
But I also value education and opening myself up to the wider world .
I have a master ’s degree in journalism and a Ph.D. in media studies .
I have been to 46 countries and all 50 states , some of that travel through jobs , the rest financed by work and not sheer privilege .
( In fact , I worked in Alaska for nine summers , and I know well the insularity and renegade personality of the state ’s culture – and I ’m not sure it ’s an asset for bipartisan effectiveness in Washington , D.C. ) .
My education has taught me we are on the back side of the earth ’s oil reserves .
It ’s taught me that simple physics says we are heating our atmosphere through record levels of human - produced greenhouse gas emissions .
I ’ve learned , through understanding science , that “ Drill , baby , drill ! ” will only hurt us in the bigger scheme of things .
I ’ve learned that ecosystems matter , and it ’s not in our self - interest to be cavalier about endangered species in order to suit our immediate political interests .
My education has taught me how to do research , to find and critique data , to know , through an analysis of evidence , that trickle - down economics do not work .
And that lasting democracy in Iraq or central Asia is a highly unlikely scenario , given millennia of tribal enmity and authoritarian regimes .
My study of history , geography and culture suggests to me that if we vow to stay in Iraq till we achieve “ victory , ” we may never get out .
At every angle , Barack Obama seems to me a man who is fit to lead the most influential country in the world , in large part because he has the educational and cultural capital to do so .
They are not sufficient alone – but they are essential .
While my own academic credentials are nowhere close to Obama ’s , I am absolutely certain that I am more capable – as a citizen , as a leader , and as a professional – by virtue of my education .
To call me an elitist because I ’m well educated is , well , just plain ignorant .
My concern is not whether a candidate ‘ looks like me ’ or has my background , or owns just a single house – but can the candidate understand and relate to and work for me , and my interests ?
A president needs to represent regular folks – but to best do so , he or she had best be a cut above in competence .
I guess I should answer my own questions !
Why do you want a gut in the first place ?
I feel strong and powerful with a gut .
I love the way it protrudes out from in front of me , no way to hide it from view .
My dad has a big gut and I want to be bigger than him .
How serious are you really ?
( come on now ... be honest ) I 've been serious since before the 2004 holidays .
I 've grown tired of dieting , beating my brains out at the gym for the " perfect body " .
I still believe in being healthy , nothing greater than a huge healthy gut .
What the hottest reason for having a big gut hanging from your bod ?
My wife loves to lay her head on it .
She also rubs it constantly .
She fairly trim so I think she likes the fact that I 'm bigger than most guys ... gut wise anyway .
Do you like gaining alone ?
Do you like gaining with other gainers ?
I really do n't like gaining alone .
I 'd love to find local gainers who are into massive eating binges and mutual feeding .
If you could gain any amount of weight just by wishing it , what would you wish ?
( oh ya ... no returning to your " normal " weight )
I 'd go for an even 500 # .
I would still be mobile at that weight .
And if I keep up my weight lifting , the weight should n't be a problem for me to handle without discomfort .
Do you like to show of your gut in public ?
( no shirt or very tight shirts ) I go around the house and yard without a shirt ( got a great tan going ) .
I do n't wear a shirt at the pool or beach .
Otherwise , it 's fairly reveling tank tops .
My dress shirt are all tailored so that my form shows , not to tight but not to baggy .
Ron Paul : Obama wo n't pull troops out of Iraq David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday October 30 , 2008
Print This Email This On Wednesday 's Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC , the rising - star host spoke with ' political phenom ' Ron Paul , a popular Republican congressman from Texas , about whether or not the GOP is at an 'end . '
Paul , in arguing for a return to truly conservative ideals , espoused the belief that Obama will not be able to bring the troops home from Iraq within 16 months , as the Democratic candidate has promised .
Maddow 's introduction detailed an article in Politico , which outlined a plan by senior Republicans to meet two days after the election and discuss a plan to " revive " the party .
" ... Which is not something you typically plan to do if you think your nominee is gonna win the White House , " said Maddow .
With looming electoral defeat and internal power struggles , what will become of the Republican party ?
This question in mind , Maddow introduced her guest .
" Why did you decide to stick with the Republican party straight through the primaries , and not try to be the nominee of the Constitution Party or the Libertarian Party this year ? " she asked Rep. Paul .
" Mainly because the laws are very biased against some people doing that , " he said .
" Some wo n't even allow you to do it .
The system is not very democratic for third parties and alternate choices .
All the rules and all the laws are written by Republicans and Democrats , and it 's very hard to get into debates .
" If I had n't been in the Republican primary , I would n't get into the debates .
It 's very hard to get on ballots , although they 've done relatively well .
It takes a lot of money .
They 'll spend half their money just getting on ballots .
The system is very biased against competition . "
" We have fallen into a terrible trap , " Paul explained moments later .
" Unfortunately , the two major candidates are n't even talking about Syria , Pakistan , and the things that are important .
They essentially agree with that viewpoint ; they both say send more troops to Afghanistan .
" And , quite frankly , I am not expecting the troops , regardless of whether Obama wins , to be home in 16 months .
That is just pure political talk . "

Click to viewJoss Whedon 's new TV show , Dollhouse , is all about people whose minds are erased , allowing them to " become " anybody and have any skills .
So does this mean Whedon is coming down on the " nurture " side of the nature / nurture debate ?
Are people purely shaped by their conditioning ?
Is your brain just a piece of hardware that you can run any software on ?
We caught up with Whedon and asked him .
His answer may surprise you .
Here 's a handy transcript :
Are you coming down on the side of nurture in the whole nature / nurture debate ?
Are we just shaped by our conditioning ?
Are our bodies just hardware that you can run any software on ?

First of all , thank you .
No -one 's ever asked that question .
I mean it .
And second of all , nature versus nurture is something I 've spent a lot of my life thinking about .
And I 've always been a nurture guy .
I 've always felt , " You 're shaped by your environment , and the terrible , terrible things that your perfectly reasonable parents do to you . "
And then I had children , and they came out very much themselves .
There are definitely things I can do to mess them up , and I 'm doing my best , but they are who they are .
And I think Dollhouse ...
I will never answer your question , by the way .
Dollhouse is the question .
I 've said before : Movies are an answer , TV shows are a question .
Because if you give a definite answer , what the hell is your next episode about ?
My feeling is , there 's a lot of both .
Nuture is the key , but nature is interesting .
And there is something innate within us , that can overcome what we 've been saddled with .
My wife is an amazing example of somebody who should not be as cool as she is , but could not help herself .
So I 've definitely learned that there are two sides to it , and that 's what I want to explore with Dollhouse .
Advertisement
It 's about something who — there is no nature .
They 've wiped out her personality .
So she has to create her own .
But she has the will to do that .
They have not gotten rid of that .
That 's the key to the whole show .
It explains what I 'm about , it explains Eliza [ Dushku ] , it is Echo defining herself with no parameters .
With no nurture , and no real nature , to fall back on .
Who am I ?
So I 'll be answering your question , with any luck , for the next seven years .
You 've almost answered my followup question .
Your show is about somebody who 's programmed to be whoever they need her to be this week .
She does n't have any agency .
How are we supposed to identify with her or root for her , as an audience ?
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
The throughline of the show is that gradually she is becoming self - aware in between these engagements .
And her self - awareness starts to affect the engagements , and the engagements start to affect her self - awareness .
And she begins to realize , " I think that I 'm somebody .
I think I exist .
And I think the fact that I know that might be dangerous for me . "
So that throughline , and the way the Dollhouse runs , that 's progressing throughout .
I will never do a show that 's just a reset show .
These people are going to grow and learn and become stranger and more twisted every week .
But every week she will have an engagement that does resolve , so you can just sit down and watch it .
It 's not one of those shows , like I always use Murder She Wrote as an example , where there is no accumulated knowledge .
And it 's not just one of those shows where it 's just , " Twist - twist - twist - twist , please come back next week . "
We 'll definitely resolve her engagements .
Advertisement
At the same time , if you watch consistently , you will get to see her struggle to become , and the struggle everybody around her has dealing with that .
Because some are against it , some are for it , but everybody has to deal with it .
She is the stone in the pond that creates ripples in everybody 's lives .
In a recent Buffy comic , Faith goes undercover as an upper class British woman , I was like , " This could be an episode of Dollhouse . "

Yeah .
It was actually written before Dollhouse was conceived .
It was something Brian [ K. Vaughan ] had pitched a long while ago .
But she will definitely be bringing that as well .
That 's the great thing , it 's like , who can she be this week ?
Eliza , she 's not wearing wigs , she 's not Meryl Streep with accents , she 's always Eliza to an extent , but that 's not a problem .
Because her character is just the essence of what she 's doing , and she really is versatile .
We had her being not British , but very upper class swing dance kind of forties , and we had her being a Latina gangster , speaking Spanish for an entire scene .
She did both of those scenes in one day .
And all she did was change her costume .
It 's not like I explained how she should do that .
She brings so much in terms of understanding of body language .
And of dialect and and the way she presents ... she can't turn off the Eliza .
Nobody can turn off the Eliza .
You could power the grid with the Eliza .
But she can present it in many different ways , and it 's beautiful to see .

What 's free , looks like Mac OS X , just works and is actually Linux ?
The answer is gOS , which recently launched a new beta that builds on the distro's initial success and adds new tools like integrated Google Gadgets for Linux .
When it launched onto the scene late last year , gOS ( which stands for good OS ) made quite a splash for getting Linux into the U.S. retail giant WalMart .
Through a partnership with PC manufacturer Everex , gOS brought Linux to your parents ' generation via WalMart .
But chances are , if they picked up a gOS equipped machine , Mom and Dad would have no idea they were running Linux .
Like the Xandros distro that Asus packages with the EeePC , gOS does n't trumpet its open source credentials or advertise its infinite customization options .
It just works .
That 's part of what makes gOS " Linux for the rest of us . "
The distro is n't intended to be powerful , nor is it a desktop package from a company that makes its real money off server installations as many Linux distros are .
gOS has one simple goal : make a lightweight , web - heavy operating system that anyone can use .
For Linux purists and those that enjoy spending hours fiddling with configuration files , gOS will be an utter disappointment .
But gOS is n't aimed at hard - core Linux users .
It 's aimed at otherwise computer illiterate users who simply want an easy way to check e-mail , browse the web and share some photos online .
That 's why gOS is marketed mainly to OEM partners like Everex or Sylvania .
You 're most likely to encounter it in a netbook or other lightweight " internet appliance . "
gOS Installation Screen - Click to Enlarge
The emphasis in gOS is on web apps and everyday tasks like browsing the web and checking e-mail .
Under the hood , gOS is based on Ubuntu , but aside from that familiar startup sound , you 're unlikely to notice the Ubuntu underpinnings .
Administration tools are decidedly lacking in gOS , but that 's expected since it is n't part of the distro 's plan .
While Ubuntu does a nice job of balancing user - friendliness and power , gOS simply tries to make things as easy as possible for the end -user .
If that comes at the loss of what longtime Linux users consider very basic tools , so be it .
gOS is aimed at those who do n't have slightest interest in power , they just want to use their PC .
gOS is also notable for embracing proprietary software .
The original release shipped with Wine pre-installed and used Picasa instead of the traditional Gnome photo manager FSpot .
The latest release continues that trend , shipping with Wine 1.0 to make installing Windows apps easier and Google Gadgets for Linux are also pre-installed .
Once the system is installed and rebooted , you 'll be greeted by a cheerful , bubbly , green interface that 's closer in appearance to Mac OS X than other Linux distros .
As soon as gOS loads , you 'll see the new Google Gadgets sitting off to the left of the screen , not unlike the Gadgets shelf that ships with Windows Vista .
On the elevator to my hotel room , a 20 - something man , too tanned and relaxed to be in the tech industry , spied the massive logo on the shopping bag - like tote that Microsoft doled out at its Professional Developer 's Conference .
" Windows 7 , huh ? "
" There 's always another one , " I said .
Without missing a beat , he replied dryly , " They need another one . "
This gentleman is not a registered PC .
Ironically , my tote 's straps were tied around the handle of a less ostentatious rolling bag that cradles a new unibody MacBook Pro .
Some things are n't worth getting into in an elevator .
It 's really difficult for a savvy user not to bring a cynical , or at least skeptical , viewpoint to Windows 7 after the foot - shooting that was pre-SP1 Vista .
What many end -users will see in Windows 7 is an effort to Mac-ify Windows , right down to enabling multitouch gestures on Tablet PCs , and copying Apple is instant , certain buzzkill .
[ See Tom Yager 's first look at Windows 7 | Join the Windows 7 conversation in Randall C. Kennedy 's Windows Sentinel blog |
For more news from Microsoft 's Professional Developers Conference , check out InfoWorld 's special report ]
Apple claims that Microsoft is suffering a drought of original ideas .
Reading between the lines , Microsoft counters that Vista , before Service Pack 1 ( it 's proud of SP1 and later ) , was a mess for many reasons , but in part because every yahoo on the Internet was invited to transmit his gripes and fantasies directly to Microsoft product managers , who were then duty - bound to take them seriously .
Look , Do n't Listen
That probably works when you 're architecting the next rev of SQL Server , because the only people who supply feedback are those with specific expertise .
Poll the public at large about what it wants from a client operating system , and you end up with a lot of data that can't be parsed definitively .
I 've put that too kindly .
It 's like trying to diagnose a hypochondriac 's true ills based on self - reporting of his perceived ailments .
It just wastes the time of people who have better uses for it .
It 's better to tell the patient to shut up and get the story directly from his body and blood .
For Windows 7 , Redmond is telling the rabble to put a sock in it , and is instead wiring Windows 7 for more of what it calls " telemetry . "
Telemetry is the data that unmanned sensors like satellites , planetary rovers , and weather instruments send back to a place where the data is stored and analyzed .
When you click the check box in Media Player , Office , or Windows that invites you to help Microsoft make better products , your PC becomes a highly detailed recorder and reporter of your system 's state and your usage patterns -- data that gets shipped to Microsoft .
How detailed is this telemetry ?
Analyzing opt - in telemetry from millions of users , Microsoft determined that a substantial percentage of them change desktop backgrounds fairly frequently .
Analysis revealed seasonal and periodic patterns in these changes , so one of Windows 7 's features lets you schedule desktop background changes .
It 's a small thing and a poor example , but Microsoft 's telemetry says that people will use it if it 's exposed in a friendly way .
Let users ' usage patterns , not the users , tell the story .
Apple never asks customers what they want ; it watches what customers do .
This delivers an interesting benefit :
By analyzing what people do , you can identify workflow snags and spot common work - arounds .
Fairly simple enhancements based on this data make it appear that the vendor has been reading your mind .
How could they know exactly what I need ?
They did n't waste their time , or yours , asking you what you need .
Search to Anywhere
A more significant example of a telemetry - inspired Windows 7 feature is search .
Search has been integral to Windows Explorer since Clippy , and yet telemetry indicated that users still spend an inordinate amount of their workday looking for and organizing information .
Windows users are just resigned to it .
Windows 7 creates Libraries , somewhat akin to OS X's Smart Folders , where data - sharing a project , type , or other criteria can be grouped .
Microsoft also observed that when users search , they want to search all of the sources that they can access regardless of their location .
All of the search hits show up in one list , roughly Internet search engine style but better formatted ( and without the ads ) , and the hyperlink in each search hit takes you to the data wherever it lives .
Microsoft does n't credit all of its innovations to telemetry , but one of the features of Federated Search that seems clearly based on behavioral data is that hyperlinks pointing to locations behind the company firewall automatically set up the equivalent of a task - specific VPN session without requiring user interaction .
Microsoft is n't just watching end -users ; it has analyzed the patterns of interaction between users and their help desks and found what we in IT already know : Support staff wastes an inordinate amount of time on problems that users can fix themselves , and waiting for a fix is unproductive time for users as well .
What 's in a backpack ?
After all it's just a storage device that you can stuff with essentials and lug around on your back , right ?
Wrong .
The backpack has evolved so much you can hardly recognize it .
Now we have backpacks that double up as jets , bicycles , personal masseurs and even refrigerators .
Take a look at 11 Bizarre examples of all that a backpack can be :
11 . The Backpack Fridge
It can be a challenge to carry and consume food for a long trip .
" Boxcooler " , the backpack fridge with its own picnic dishes , revamps the idea of the cooler and makes it truly transportable .
One can carry it in 2 ways : on the back , so the user 's hands are relieved , or by using the cover hinge ( which is hollow inside and has access from the back ) as a handle .
The shoulder cushions can also be fixed at the headrests of a car , ensuring the backpack stays as positioned during any journey .
Thermoelectric Peltier elements replace the traditional " freezer batteries " which slowly defrost after a while .
Therefore , the food inside stays fresh and cool for a long time .
Inside the pockets are compact tablets with all the equipment needed for a picnic .
A fold - able cup , a knife , spoon and fork are moulded into the tablet surface .
All these parts are developed to use a minimal amount of space with a maximum of function .

10 . The Massaging Backpack
At the end of a long day , I am almost always ready to give anything for a soothing back massage .
" Anyone want to take my used lintbrush and give me a backrub .
It 's a rare lintbrush ... really hard to find "
It 's difficult to find a cheap good masseuse .
If I had the money , I would hire a personal masseuse to rub away my aches and pains daily , but rich I am not .
So I guess the Massaging Backpack will have to do for me .
The massaging backpack has a built - in mechanisms that make it constantly vibrate , pummeling away on the upper back to provide the relaxation that we all so deserve and crave .
It might look silly , but then , that 's a a small price to pay for comfort and relaxation .
Plus , it 's much cheaper than a personal masseuse .

9 . The Jet Setting Backpack
I never thought I would find this ( not that I was looking for it ) , but I found a backpack which is a strap - on helicopter with rocket - powered rotor blades !
The pack is powered by two hydrogen fuel canisters and the rockets at the end of the blades negate the need for a tail rotor .
Technologia Aeroespacial Mexicana , the firm that designed this , is selling these jetpacks for a cool $ 250,000 .
The package includes a special machine to make your own unlimited supply of rocket fuel , hands - on training in the process and the equipment , 24/7 expert support and flight training of 10 flights in your own rocket belt .

Next time , why do n't you bring your own chair or maybe even plan on wearing your own chair .
You read that right , wearing your chair is possible with this backpack .
It 's called Wear Your Seat and is molded to fit your back .
So now , wherever you go , you can carry your chair with you on your back .
The idea is great , but the bulkiness of the contraption scares me .

4. The Keep Yourself Tidy Backpack
The idea for this backpack started with a vision - to make packing , keeping and carrying all your belongings more simple .
The manifestation of that vision was Tidypack - developed by and made for globetrotters .
The Tidypack Backpack has shelves which can be extended by hanging it over a door .
Just pack your clothes into the various compartments , close the rucksack and you are ready to go .
When you reach your next destination , just extend the shelves and hang it over a door .
TidyPack looks very much like any other backpacks ; it 's just that the interior consist of an useful and expandable wardrobe system .
Designed and developed by Marit Lien , this sure is a neat idea .
( Pun intended . )

3. The Total Stereo Backpack
The problem with most portable music systems is that you can't easily share your music with others or blast it wherever you go .
Thankfully , someone has created the solution .
According to design student Joonas Saaranen " Reppo II is a hardshell backpack with an integrated high quality digital amplifier and pair of speakers .
This beauty comes in a ultra-cool shiny hardshell backpack that gets heads turning .
Just plug in any audio source , strap the whole thing on your back and share your favorite tunes with your friends on the go . "

2. The BulletProof Backpack : Backpackshield
Would n't it be great if your backpack could save your life , not just help you carry your stuff ?
The backpackshield is a bulletproof backpack insert that can stop 9 mm and 44 magnum rounds of gunfire .
Backpackshield is not a backpack technically but an insert that can be switched to another backpack if you outgrow your pack or decide to switch styles .
Made from 13 layers of K - 29 Kevlar , this thin , lightweight plate fits in most backpacks .
According to the inventor , this was designed for " college students , high school students , concerned parents , and commuters . "
I guess schools have really gotten dangerous , huh ?
Available in 10 assorted colors , it costs $ 279USD .
If you do n't want to change shools to keep your kid safe , I guess the backpackshield can offer some much needed safety .

1. Got a Big Butt Backpack
Love big butts and want to carry some around everywhere you go ?
Then you surely will want to lug around these “ female form ” inspired backpacks dubbed “ The Peach ” by Yen - Hsiang Skeet Wang .
The artist liked the juxtaposition of the erotic female form with something totally unrelated so I guess he thought ... hmmmm , I wonder how good a butt would look as a backpack .
If I wore this backpack , I know no one would be looking at my real butt and thinking it is big , so I am all for getting one .

Inner Fence 's new Credit Card Terminal accepts payments directly from your iPhone .
According to the company 's web page , the system offers just enough features so you do n't have to drag a lot of equipment around with you , which makes it attractive for off - site use .
Inner Fence suggests using it at Antique Shows , Art Festivals , and Farmers Markets , among other venues .
I think that 's a pretty rocking cool idea , but this is not for the casual user .
Using Credit Card Terminal takes a lot of planning before you can go out and get started .
You 'll first need to set up an account with Authorize .
Net , a firm that handles the actual credit card processing .
I gave John Haycock , of Authorize .
Net , a call to see how this all would work .
He explained that iPhone users need to establish two accounts : a gateway account and a merchant account .
The gateway account is responsible for authorizing cards in order to permit the transaction to go through .
The merchant account allows funds to be deposited to a bank , providing the actual payments .
You have to set these up before you can go forward .
As for the moolah involved , an Inner Fence page lays out your costs .
First , you 'll pay a $ 99.00 set - up fee .
Then , a $ 27.90 monthly fee covers both your merchant and gateway accounts .
You then pay a flat $ 0.35 fee for each transaction , which goes to Authorize .
Net .
Beyond that , the credit card company gets its percentage , which ranges between 2.19 to 3.3 percent , depending on the kind of credit card in use .
This varies by whether you 're using a rewards card , a sky miles card , or so forth ; the page lays out the surcharges .
After that , you need to buy the program itself .
Credit Card Terminal ( iTunes ) costs $ 49.99 .
As you can see , going high - tech sales with your iPhone is n't for the casual user ; do n't expect the guy sitting on the corner selling roses to whip out an iPhone to accept credit card purchases .
And , since
Ars did n't get to actually test out the program , there 's no guarantee that transactions wo n't end with the White Apple of Doom™ .
Caveat venditor .
We 've probably all had the experience of being stuck in line at the pharmacy with a box of prophylactics , some tampons and some apple sauce , and found out far too late that we do n't have the cash to cover it .
Do n't you wish there was something else you could trade instead of that " money " stuff you never seem to have ?
Well many parts of the world are way ahead of you , ditching money in favor of ...

8 Airtime Continue Reading Below Advertisement Everyone has a damn cell phone these days .
You can't urinate on the front doors of a library any more without at least three passers - by phoning the cops and having you picked up .
For that reason , maybe it's not entirely surprising that in some rural parts of Africa , cell phone scratch cards have actually become a form of currency .
Despite having a GDP on par with your average 7 - Eleven , the Congo has several million cell phones and subscriptions have increased 150 % in the last year , which means everyone in Buttfuck Nowhere , Africa really wants to talk to someone else all the time .
Now that they can , they 've taken to buying airtime vouchers or " scratch cards " and texting the codes to others who can then use the codes to redeem the cash value right away in a sort of rudimentary money transfer system that happens instantly and costs the price of a text message .

The practice is so widespread that these scratch cards are now acceptable currency for bribing officials .
As an added bonus , you can pay the bribes remotely with this method , so there 's no need for the cops to even take you downtown to bribe the judge when you can pay them all off at the same time .
Ah , technology .
Simultaneously bribing multiple government officials to quietly overlook your backyard sex parties has never been easier .

While it 's unlikely they 're all skydivers drinking Mountain Dew and listening to one of those screaming , loud bands the kids these days love so much , the residents do have enough blow to keep themselves wired and tweaking 24/7 .
The President of Guerima .
It seems Colombia , in an effort to do something to curb its drug trade , has tried to stop Marxist rebels from trafficking in cocaine .
One of the ways they did this was to deploy the army to remote areas and block access to places where cocaine is grown and processed , places like Guerima .

So imagine a little town in Idaho growing potatoes until one day the army comes and stops anyone from coming in and buying those potatoes to make delicious , addictive , potentially lethal french fries .
Now the little town has a shitload of potatoes and no money .
So how do you get by ?
The people of Geurima , ( population of 1,000 ) , just replaced cash with powder .
Without FARC rebels paying for cocaine , the people of the town use it to conduct transactions amongst themselves and , according to reports , one gram will get you a bottle of Coca - Cola .
If this society can actually pull off their homemade economic system , well , kudos .
But we 're betting heavily that the " Trapping 1,000 People in a Tiny Village with Nothing to Do But Pass Cocaine Around "
Plan is eventually going to backfire in a pretty huge way .

The school and teachers are now being threatened with legal action by some parents who want their children ’s failing marks changed to passing marks - even though those children were absent 15 - 30 times during the term and did not complete enough schoolwork to pass their various key stages .
The Message Was :
’ Hello !
You have reached the automated answering service of your school .

The window through which Salam Amira , 16 , filmed the moment when an Israeli soldier shot from close range a handcuffed and blindfolded Palestinian detainee has a large hole at its centre with cracks running in every direction .
" Since my video was shown , the soldiers shoot at our house all the time , " she said .
The shattered and cracked windows at the front of the building confirm her story .
" When we leave the windows open , they fire tear gas inside too . "
Her home looks out over the Israeli road block guarding the only entrance to the village of Nilin , located just inside the West Bank midway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv .
It was here that a bound Ashraf Abu Rahma , 27 , was shot in the foot in July with a rubber bullet under orders from an Israeli regiment commander .
The treatment of the family stands in stark contrast to the leniency shown to the soldier and his commander involved in that incident .
B�Tselem , an Israeli human rights group , has accused the Israeli army of seeking " revenge " for the girl�s role in exposing the actions of its armed forces in the West Bank .
It may also be hoping to dissuade other families from airing similar evidence of army brutality , particularly since B�Tselem began distributing dozens of video cameras to Palestinians across the West Bank .
Scenes captured on film of hooded settlers attacking Palestinian farmers near Hebron came as a shock to many early this summer .
The village of Nilin has been the focus of the Israeli army�s actions since May , when its 4,700 inhabitants began a campaign of mainly non-violent demonstrations to halt the building of Israel�s separation wall across their land .
After the wall is completed , the village will be cut off from 40 per cent of its remaining farmland , effectively annexing it to half a dozen large Jewish settlements that encircle Nilin .
The settlements are all illegal under international law .
Several times a week the villagers , joined by small numbers of Israeli and international supporters , congregate in olive fields where bulldozers are tearing up the land to make way for the wall .
The people of Nilin have tried various non-violent forms of protest , including praying in the path of the heavy machinery , using mirrors to reflect sunlight at the construction workers , banging pots and pans , and placing rocks in the way of the bulldozers during the night .
The army has responded with tear gas and stun grenades , as well as on occasion , with rubber - coated steel bullets and live ammunition .
Last month it was reported that Israel was also experimenting with a new crowd dispersal method called " skunk " , which involves firing a foul - smelling liquid at demonstrators .
In the past few weeks , two youngsters have been shot dead by the army , including one , Ahmed Moussa , who was 10 .
The army claimed he was throwing stones .
An autopsy showed he was hit in the head by a bullet from an M - 16 rifle .
This week a soldier fired from close range three rubber bullets at Awad Surur , a mentally disabled man , as he tried to prevent his brother from being arrested .
Two bullets penetrated his skull , according to B�Tselem , which denounced the army as increasingly " trigger - happy " and " reckless " .
Salam�s family , like many other villagers , bear the injuries from attendance at protests .
Most of her five brothers have been hit by rubber bullets , as has her father , Jamal Amira , 53 .
The army has sealed the village off on several occasions and , according to villagers , beaten and terrorised inhabitants .
Mr Amira is among at least 100 farmers whose livelihoods will be devastated by the wall .
He will lose all 14 hectares of his land , fields on which his ancestors have made their living by growing olives , cucumbers , aubergine and tomatoes .
But Salam�s five - minute film of the roadblock incident , taken during a four - day curfew imposed on the village , has only intensified the family�s troubles .
Three days after the video was aired , the army arrested her father during a peaceful protest .
He was the only one seized after the army claimed the demonstrators had entered a closed military zone .
Mr Amira was also charged with assaulting a soldier .
He was held for three and a half weeks before an Israeli military judge rejected the army�s demand that he be remanded for a further three months until his trial .
In an almost unprecedented rebuke to the prosecution , the judge questioned the army�s case , saying he could see no evidence of an assault .
He also asked why Salam�s father was singled out from all of those protesting .
Mr Amira�s lawyer , Gabi Laski , said the decision confirmed " our preliminary claim that the arrest was out of vengeance and punishment for the video filmed by the girl " .
Nonetheless , Mr Amira still faces a military trial .
A report last year by Yesh Din , a human rights group , found that in only 0.25 per cent of cases heard by military tribunals was the defendant found innocent .
Even if acquitted , Mr Amira is expected to face legal costs amounting to nearly US $ 10,000 ( Dh36,700 ) , a sum the family says it cannot pay .
In contrast , the two soldiers responsible for the shooting of the detainee at the roadblock have been reprimanded with the minor charge of " unbecoming conduct " .
Neither will stand criminal trial .
B�Tselem has called the decision " shameful " .
According to the legal group the Association of Civil Rights in Israel , the punishment under Israeli law for aggravated abuse of a detainee is seven years imprisonment .
ACRI�s lawyers have submitted a petition arguing the lenient charge " transmits to officers and other soldiers an extremely grave message of contempt for human life " .
Lt Col Omri Borberg , the commander who gave the order to shoot Abu Rahma , resigned his post but was immediately moved sideways to a senior post in a different unit .
In a show of support , Gabi Ashkenazi , the head of the army , said Lt Col Borberg may be reinstated to a command position .
Meanwhile , the villagers said the army�s behaviour would not dissuade them from protesting or cause them to renounce their commitment to non-violence .
Salah Hawaja , a protest organiser , said : " When we started our demonstrations , maybe 50 soldiers showed up .
Now there are hundreds stationed permanently around us .
Israel is treating us like a major war zone , even though we are using non-violence .
" The people of Nilin have accepted that the best strategy to stop Israel�s plans to steal our land and leave us inside a ghetto is non-violence , " said Mr Hawaja .
" We need to show the world who is the occupier and who the occupied .
Israel understands how threatening this is , which is why it is using so much force against us . "
A fund has been established to help the Amira family .

Lower Mainland Conservative candidates are starring in the Liberal B.C. Team ’s “ Harpocracy ” attack on Stephen Harper .
The Muzzle Watch Website lists all candidates who have been “ muzzled ” , either by refusing to call reporters back , or being no - shows at all - candidates ’ meetings .
Several instances of “ muzzlings ” were taken from Georgia Straight stories , including this one on federal arts funding , when Vancouver Centre candidate Lorne Mayencourt did n't return Jessica Werb 's calls to discuss the Conservative government 's $ 45 million in cultural cuts .
So far , the site claims that there have been 44 reported cases of Conservative muzzling in BC .
Of those , four involve Vancouver Centre candidate Lorne Mayencourt , and four with Vancouver Kingsway candidate Salomon Rayek .
Surrey North candidate Dona Cadman also racked up four .
The Muzzle Watch site opens with this pithy quote :
“ Democracy cannot be maintained without its foundation : free public opinion and free discussion throughout the nation of all matters affecting the state within the limits set by the criminal code and common law . ”

Call it a rite of passage : children by the roadside peddling their homemade goodies to adults who are more than eager to drop a few cents into a makeshift cashbox .
But Katie and Sabrina Lewis ' veggie stand , in the town of Clayton , Calif. , where they sold homegrown watermelons for $ 1 , has been shuttered by town officials who told the girls ' parents that their daughters ' venture violated local zoning ordinances .
" I think that they 're wrong , " dad Mike Lewis said of the town officials .
" Kids should be able to be kids . "
Melon Sales Take Off
The stand started about two years ago when Katie , now 11 , decided she wanted to start selling produce from the family 's ever - expanding garden .
The family had been growing its own fruits and vegetables on its half - acre lot and giving away armfuls of extras to friends and family .
" I thought , ' No one 's going to buy melons , ' " Lewis said , before telling his eldest daughter to " go ahead . "
Two hours later , Katie had sold out of melons .
Lewis said his daughter , now assisted by 3 - year - old Sabrina , operated her stand on weekends , maybe 20 or so times during the year .
They 'd bring in about $ 10 to $ 20 a week .
" I take it and once I 've got about $ 20 to $ 30 , I 'll bring it to the bank and put it in my bank account for college , " Katie told ABCNews.com .
Closing Down
Lewis said the family got a call after the stand went up from a town employee saying that as long as the stand ran only on weekends it was fine .
But Clayton Mayor Gregory Manning said he first heard of the girls ' operation this past April , after two residents called to ask if it was legal .
Two months later , a police officer was sent to the stand to tell the Lewises that the girls were violating zoning regulations that prohibit commercial activities in a residential area .
The stand also violates health regulations , he said , which state that food can't be sold without a permit .
And while only two citizens complained , Manning said , " I find that for every person who calls you or writes a letter , there are 100 that feel the same . "
Clayton , located about 30 miles east of San Francisco , is home to about 11,000 residents .
Lewis compared his daughters ' stand to a more - common lemonade stand .
But Manning said those , too , are illegal in Clayton , though officials typically do n't pay much attention because they do n't last more than a day or two .
" This is a pretty good operation , " he said of the Lewis girls ' stand .
" I 'm sure it 's very nice stuff . "
Katie said her most popular seller was the watermelons .
Also big were zucchinis ( 75 cents for four small zucchinis and $ 1.25 for four of the larger ones ) and eggplant , which was priced at six for $ 1 .
Little sister Sabrina , Katie said , helped by picking flowers and hauling produce from the garden .
Manning said he's not trying to be the bad guy in this situation , but that he has to consider the residents ' best interests .
" It 's not like we 're the Gestapo going out and closing down fruit stands , " he said .
Child 's Play or Breaking the Law ?
Posters on a local community blog were divided , with some calling for the mayor to lay off and others reminding the Lewis girls that everyone has to follow the same rules .
So , for now at least , the money going into Katie 's college fund has slowed , though her father said they still sell some produce to loyal customers who call and then come by the house to pick it up .
Lewis said he 's tried to get a temporary variance from the town to let the girls continue to work their stand , but said he 's gotten the run around from the city council and its planning commission .
" I'm open to any suggestions from them , " he said .
Manning , who is one of five on the city council and has served for 22 years , said the Lewises spoke to planning officials informally about the variance and were denied , though they were welcome to file a formal application .
Manning said he also wondered why no one from the family has spoken before either the council or the commission , when both entities have public comment portions at their meetings .
Lewis said he has been to a planning meeting , but a neighbor spoke on his behalf .
And Lewis believes the majority of the council members to be against the stand 's operation and that 's why he has n't approached them .
Manning said he never went out to the Lewis home while the girls were working their stand .
Katie said that maybe the town officials were " not looking into it quite well . "
" The produce is organic , " she said , " and it 's really good . "
I ’ve often wondered how they got those very attractive pictures of the beers in Michael Jackson ’s 500 Great Beers book , and I ’ve also been increasingly frustrated at how bad my own photos are .
They tend to look like this :
So I spent a few hours trawling the web for tutorials on how to photograph food — this was a great one — and then tried to use some of the same techniques to photograph a nice pint of beer using my very basic digital camera .
Here ’s the result :
I ’ll tell you how I did it after the jump , if you ’re interested .
Firstly , I set up a very primitive white room in the lightest place I could find ( the patio ) using a large piece of white cartridge paper and some blu - tack .
Then I dug out the tripod and attached the camera , lining it up nice and square on the “ set ” .
I cleaned a nice glass * very * thoroughly , dried it , and polished it with a lens cleaning cloth .
I chose a beer I had two bottles of — Summer Lightning — and put one ( with cap ) on the table .
Then I carefully poured as near a perfect pint as I could .
Without too much delay , I placed it next to the unopened bottle and started snapping away .
I took about 15 photos , hoping that one would turn out OK .
I did n’t use a flash — this puts big white spots on the bottle , and just looks weird .
This is the un-tinkered with photo :
Then , using GIMP , I cropped the picture down to just the good stuff .
I then adjusted the levels of white ( Layer > Colours > Levels ) .
Auto did quite a good job , but I manually set the paper background to pure white ( see this tutorial for more on GIMP ’s levels controls ) .
Then , to further boost the image , and bring out the colours , I duplicated the layer and set the top copy to “ overlay ” .
That looks pretty good , and if you do n’t like fiddling about , you could leave it there .
But I spent 10 minutes carefully painting out the grey in the background , using a mixture of “ magic wand ” selections and careful work .
Finally , I played with the perspective feature ( Tools > Transform > Perspective ) to straighten the image up a bit .
I ’m quite pleased with the results .
Next time , I ’ll add more light using reflectors — the bottle is a bit dark .
I do n’t know if I ’ll do this * every * time I photograph a beer , but it really did n’t take too long , and the finished product looks very appetising .
I ’m drinking it now !
Tom Bachtell
General Richard A. Cody graduated from West Point in 1972 , flew helicopters , ascended to command the storied 101st Airborne Division , and then , toward the end of his career , settled into management ; now , at fifty - seven , he wears four stars as the Army Vice - Chief of Staff .
This summer , he will retire from military service .
In 2004 , in a little - noted speech , Cody described the Army ’s efforts to adapt to its new commitments .
( It was attempting to fight terrorism , quell the Taliban , invade and pacify Iraq , and , at the same time , prepare for future strategic challenges , whether in China or Korea or Africa . )
The endeavor was , Cody said , like “ building an airplane in flight . ”
Last week , the General appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee and testified that this method of engineering has failed .
“ Today ’s Army is out of balance , ” Cody said .
He continued :
The current demand for our forces in Iraq and Afghanistan exceeds the sustainable supply , and limits our ability to provide ready forces for other contingencies .
. . .
Soldiers , families , support systems and equipment are stretched and stressed .
. . .
Overall , our readiness is being consumed as fast as we build it .
If unaddressed , this lack of balance poses a significant risk to the all - volunteer force and degrades the Army ’s ability to make a timely response to other contingencies .
In 2006 , the Army granted eight thousand three hundred and thirty “ moral waivers ” to new recruits , meaning that it had accepted that number of volunteers with past criminal charges or convictions .
The percentage of high - school graduates willing to serve is falling sharply from year to year ; so are the aptitude - exam scores of new enlistees .
To persuade soldiers and young officers to reënlist after overlong combat tours , the Army ’s spending on retention bonuses increased almost ninefold from 2003 to 2006 .
In normal times , when an active four - star general implies in public that the Army is under such strain that it might flounder if an unexpected war broke out , or might require a draft to muster adequate troop levels , he could expect to provoke concern and comment from , say , the President of the United States .
Some time ago , however , George W. Bush absolved himself of responsibility for his Iraq policy and its consequences by turning the war over to General David H. Petraeus , Cody ’s four - star peer , and the champion of the “ surge ” policy , who will testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee this week .
Petraeus , too , is a loyal Army man , but he has distinctive views about military doctrine ; he has long advocated a change in orientation by the Army , away from preparations for formal warfare between governments and toward the challenges of counter - insurgency and nation building .
( “ Learning to Eat Soup with a Knife ” is the title of a book co-written by one of Petraeus ’s advisers , Lieutenant Colonel John A. Nagl . )
To buy time in Iraq , Petraeus has lately argued within the Pentagon that the Army must buck up and accommodate his need for heavy troop deployments , despite the strains they are creating , and he has publicly fostered an unedifying debate about how to most accurately assess failure and success in Iraq , as if such an opaque and intractable civil conflict could be measured scientifically , like monetary supply or atmospheric pressure .
There is , of course , empirical evidence of declining violence in Iraq , which has coincided with Petraeus ’s command .
The additional troops he requested have certainly been a factor , but not even Petraeus can say how much of one .
At best , during the past year he has helped to piece together a stalemate of heavily armed , bloodstained , conspiracy - minded , ambiguously motivated Iraqi militias .
Nobody knows how long this gridlock will hold .
A war born in spin has now reached its Lewis Carroll period .
( “ Now here , you see , it takes all the running you can do , to keep in the same place . ” )
Last week , it proved necessary for the Bush Administration to claim that an obvious failure — Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki ’s ill - prepared raid on rival Shiite gangs in Basra , which was aborted after mass desertions within Maliki ’s own ranks — was actually a success in disguise , because it demonstrated the Iraqi government ’s independence of mind .
In this environment , it is perhaps unsurprising that General Cody ’s plainspoken , valedictory dissent about the Army ’s health attracted little attention .
His testimony marked a rare public surfacing of the contentious debates at the Pentagon over the strategic costs of the surge .
These debates involve overlapping disagreements about doctrine ( particularly the importance of counter - insurgency ) , global priorities ( Iraq versus Afghanistan , for instance ) , and resources .
At their core , however , lies Cody ’s essential observation : the Army is running on fumes , but Petraeus and his fellow surge advocates are driving flat out in Iraq , with no destination in sight .
It hardly matters whether Petraeus would recommend keeping a hundred and thirty thousand or more combat troops in Iraq for a hundred years , or only ten .
Neither scenario is plausible — at least , not without a draft or a radical change in incentives for volunteers .
Flag officers in the Bush Administration ’s military have learned that they can be marginalized or retired if they speak out too boldly .
The Administration does not romanticize the role of the loyal opposition .
Last month , Admiral William J. Fallon , the commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East , announced his early retirement , under pressure from the White House , after he argued privately for a faster drawdown from Iraq , to bolster efforts in Afghanistan and to restore a more balanced global military posture .
Publicly , Fallon also described the “ drumbeat of conflict ” against Iran as “ not helpful . ”
The suppression of professional military dissent helped to create the disaster in Iraq ; now it is depriving American voters of an election - year debate about the defense issues that matter most .
These include the nature and the location of the country ’s global adversaries and interests , the challenge of a revitalizing Al Qaeda in Pakistan , the conundrum of Iran , the failing health of the nuclear nonproliferation regime , and , to address all this , the need for a sustainable strategy that restores the Army ’s vitality and makes rational use of America ’s finite military resources .
To implement such a strategy , it would not be necessary to rashly abandon Iraq to its fate , but it would be essential , at a minimum , to reduce American troop levels to well below a hundred thousand as soon as possible .
In the long run , success or failure for the United States in Iraq will not hinge on who wins the argument about the surge ; it will depend on whether it proves possible to change the subject . ♦
Dear Friend and Reader ,
While doing some Sarah Palin research , I discovered an article on Feministing , an online feminist resource , that there was a terrifying police and National Guard presence at a peace protest outside the Republican National Convention on Monday , which lead to an outrageous use of force including “ pepper spray , rubber bullets , concussion grenades and excessive force , ” according to this report .
284 protestors were arrested .
Reporter Amy Goodman and two producers , Sharif Abdel Kouddous and Nicole Salazar , of Democracy Now , were arrested .
The link is a video of the arrest .
See for yourself whether you think the police used unnecessary aggression .
Seven reporters from I - Witness , a group of NYC - based video journalists focused on civil rights , were detained as a preemptive measure , while 30 police officers surrounded their office .
Here are more details about the arrest of Goodman , Kouddous and Salazar :
All three were violently manhandled by law enforcement officers .
Abdel Kouddous was slammed against a wall and the ground , leaving his arms scraped and bloodied .
He sustained other injuries to his chest and back .
Salazar ’s violent arrest by baton - wielding officers , during which she was slammed to the ground while yelling , “ I ’m Press ! Press ! , ” resulted in her nose bleeding , as well as causing facial pain .
Goodman ’s arm was violently yanked by police as she was arrested .
On Tuesday , Democracy Now ! will broadcast video of these arrests , as well as the broader police action .
These will also be available on : www.democracynow.org
Goodman was arrested while questioning police about the unlawful detention of Kouddous and Salazar who were arrested while they carried out their journalistic duties in covering street demonstrations at the Republican National Convention .
Goodman ’s crime appears to have been defending her colleagues and the freedom of the press .
Ramsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher told Democracy Now ! that Kouddous and Salazar were arrested on suspicion of rioting , a felony .
While the three have been released , they all still face charges stemming from their unlawful arrest .
Kouddous and Salazar face pending charges of suspicion of felony riot , while Goodman has been officially charged with obstruction of a legal process and interference with a “ peace officer . ”
In addition to the illegal arrests and detainments of journalists , the peace march sponsored by Poor People ’s Economic Human Rights Campaign ended with violence .
At least one demonstrator was tasered by officers as he lay on the ground .
Read below for some accounts of the violence at Monday ’s peace march sponsored by Poor People ’s Economic Human Rights Campaign .
This report hails from St. Paul ’s local news station , Kare 11 :
Spasms of violence erupted throughout downtown as tear gas was fired and protesters в Ђ ” some angry , some insistent on dancing amid the chaos в Ђ ” played a game of cat - and - mouse as police , backed up by 150 Minnesota National Guard soldiers , alternately accommodated , confronted and chased roving bands intent on disrupting the convention .
Organizers of the Coalition to March on the RNC and End the War estimated 30,000 people showed up to march from the state Capitol to the Xcel Energy Center .
They had expected 50,000 .
Police put the crowd at about 10,000 .
This one comes from feministing , an eyewitness account of the police and National Guard presence :
Deep black - clad troops thick with riot gear and anonymizing helmets , no distinction between them save color - coded duct tape between the shoulders and the slightly differing gait in the thudding of their boots against the cold and hard pavement marched , god I ’m not kidding you , Gestapo style up the middle of Robert Avenue in St. Paul last night around 8:45 p.m. , straight up toward the Capital building , where they young girls I ’d just interviewed were headed because , as they explained , the Poor People ’s march “ was getting too rowdy . ”
Boy , were they likely surprised when 300 storm troopers in black black riot gear showed up to the party , that had already been shut down and quiet for hours .
It was easily the most terrifying thing I ’ve ever seen :
When I watch videos of the Khmer Rouge moving in on cities in Cambodia , a place I love second only to America , I try to access what the feeling must be like of watching your people invade their own with intent to harm in mass , faceless numbers .
Before last night at 8:45 p.m. , I could not for the life of me imagine it .
And now I saw it , in the very city I ’d been told since birth was immune from the evils of the world .
I know it ’s too late to lose my innocence , again , but I took a moment to meditate beside a lake this morning in Chanhassen where we ’re all staying , the great pink horde of us , far far away from the clamor of the streets ( too far if you ask me , but some of the ladies here are content with that ) .
As I looked out over the gently moving lake , waking up with the 8 a .m. winds , rocking against the shore , I hit sorrow in the pit of my stomach like I have n’t felt before .
I thought it might be the aggravation of 20 - hour days spent fighting , documenting , worrying , running , sorting through the miscommunications of a group constantly on the go , and just plain old waiting for something to happen .
It was n’t aggravation .
It was a single image .
The image of American troops dressed in black moving in with intent to harm young American civilians .
Reports will roll in today about what exactly went down and where and when and why .
Anarchists will be blamed for “ bomb - making ” – these reports are n’t , by the way , to be believed –and stories of National Guardsmen and St. Paul Police and Sheriffs and undercover cops going rogue and lashing out at people will flood the Midwest like the Mighty Mississippi .
What I know is that dump trucks were called in to blockade entire streets .
Hundreds of troops suited up before the Rage Against the Machine Concert and waited for them to start .
Two lines of troops surrounded all sides of a peaceful march just winding down–put on , by the way , by the Poor People ’s Economic Human Rights Campaign–and threw tear gas , released flash grenades ( at least four of them ) , intimidated , harassed , and roiled a crowd standing up for their right to speak out against a damaging administration into a frenzy they then had to control , through further intimidation and harassment .
The images and the reports speak for themselves : clearly , a peace march outside the Republican National Convention is call for a police state .
Free speech rights have been violated , illegal arrests and detainments have been made and excessive force was used against internationally respected reporters and relatively - peaceful protestors .
I ’ll continue covering this story as it unfolds , stay tuned .
Back in 2004 , conservatives from all corners of the media attacked John Kerry as a " gigolo " who never earned a dime in his life and owed everything to his rich , heiress wife .
Well , now that the tables are turned -- and a Republican is the one who owes his entire political existence to his rich , heiress wife -- is it unfair to use the same line of attack against John McCain ?
Salon 's Glenn Greenwald examined this in a great blog post titled :
The right and men who live off their second wives ' inherited wealth
[ A] fter running his campaign based on depicting Barack Obama as an out - of - touch elitist and himself as the all - American Everyman , McCain lives a life that is about as far removed from the Average American as one can get , and has done so for decades .
What 's notable is how McCain was able to live that way .
McCain himself is n't actually rich .
He just lives off the inherited wealth of his much younger former mistress and now - second - wife -- for whom he dumped his older and disfigured first wife -- and who then used her family 's money to fund McCain 's political career and keep him living in extreme luxury ( after insisting that he sign a prenuptial agreement , which would make McCain the first U.S. President to have one ) .
There needs to be a lot more focus of this sort on John McCain 's " character , " given that , from now until November , no matter what Obama does , the Rovian disciples managing John McCain 's candidacy will ensure his campaign is about little other than these sorts of slimy , personality - based , Freak Show attacks on Obama .
It 's what the GOP does and it's what the media is capable of disseminating .
Glenn provides about a dozen examples , all of which could apply to this election if you replace " John Kerry " with " John McCain . "
Take this one for example :
Now , having a wife who provides you with a private jet and eight multimillion - dollar vacation homes provides for a comfortable life .
But is this the right preparation for becoming president ? . . .
To be sure , that does not mean McCain never did an honest day 's work in his life .
But even while he did these jobs , his wives ' wealth always gave him a safety net .
He was going to be taken care of whether he succeeded professionally or not .
. . .
Whether McCain wins or loses the presidency , he will still be living like a king .
Works perfect , no ?
Oh wait , I forgot ...
Kerry was never a POW .
It 's only fair to accuse non-POWs of mooching off their rich wives .
Nevermind .
Sometimes no publicity is good publicity , but it 's too late for that for Lincoln , Nebraska shop - owner Christian Firoz .
Firoz runs Exotica , a Lincoln boutique , and back in March , as the Nebraska legislature was pondering legislation that would ban salvia ( it died without a vote ) , Firoz was quoted in a March Lincoln Journal - Star article about an up - tick in interest in the fast - acting , short - lived hallucinogen after the ban effort received local news coverage .
salvia leaves
That resulted in a visit from undercover officers from the Lincoln police , who purchased salvia at the shop , then returned with arrest and search warrants .
Firoz was charged not with selling salvia , but with violating a state law against selling substances " which will induce an intoxicated condition ... when the seller , offerer or deliverer knows or has reason to know that such compound is intended for use to induce such condition . "
That prompted Firoz ' attorney , Susan Kirchmann , to seek dismissal of the charges , arguing that the law is so vague ordinary people can't understand what is prohibited and must guess at its meaning .
But the state countered that Firoz was not selling cleaning chemicals with no idea they were to be used to get high .
Instead , he was knowingly selling salvia his purchasers would use to become intoxicated , they argued .
Last week , Lancaster County Judge Gale Pokorny sided with the prosecution .
In a September 10 order , Pokorny ruled that Firoz must stand trial because he knew what he was selling .
" This judge is of the opinion that Mr. Christian Firoz knew precisely that the Salvia Divinorum he was selling was a ' substance ' his purchasers were buying intended for human ingestion for the sole purpose of achieving mind altering intoxication , " Pokorny wrote .
" While there may be others who potentially might be caught up in some confusing terminology contained in these two statutes , Mr. Christian Firoz does not appear to be one of them . "
Firoz will go on trial for unlawfully selling a legal substance next month .
He faces up to three months in jail and a $ 500 fine .
Meanwhile , the first prosecution of anyone on salvia charges anywhere in the United States is set for next week in Bismarck , North Dakota , where at last word , Kenneth Rau was set to go to trial Monday on felony salvia possession charges .

Watermelons are loaded with anti-oxidants which are good for the skin
Eating watermelon has a similar effect on the body to Viagra , according to researchers in the US .
It 's down to a chemical called citrulline which is found in the juicy fruit .
Citrulline is an organic compound which affects the body 's blood vessels in the same way as the sex enhancement pills .
It helps relax the blood vessels which means blood gets around the body more easily .
The research comes from the US ' Texas Fruit and Vegetable Improvement Centre .
Dr Bhimu Patil led the research .
He said : " We 've always known that watermelon is good for you , but the list of its very important healthful benefits grows longer with each study .
" Watermelon may not be as organ specific as Viagra ... but it 's a great way to relax blood vessels without any drug side - effects . "
It 's also claimed watermelons are good for your heart and immune system .
The vast majority of watermelon ( 92 % ) is made up of water .
But the remaining 8 % is loaded with the anti-oxidant lycopene which is also good for your skin .

Okay , before we begin , let me come clean and admit that the title of this article is a little sensationalist !
JavaScript does n’t really have multi- threading capabilities , and there ’s nothing a JavaScript programmer can do to change that .
In all browsers – apart from Google Chrome – JavaScript runs in a single execution thread , and that ’s just how it is .
However , what we can do is simulate multi- threading , insofar that it gives rise to one of the benefits of a multi - threaded environment : it allows us to run extremely intensive code .
This is code which would otherwise freeze - up the browser and generate one of those “ unresponsive script ” warnings in Firefox .
Time Waits for No One
It all hinges on the use of asynchronous timers .
When we run repetitive code inside an asynchronous timer , we ’re giving the browser ’s script interpreter time to process each iteration .
Effectively , a piece of code inside a for iterator is asking the interpreter to do everything straight away : “ run this code n times as fast as possible . ”
However the same code inside an asynchronous timer is breaking the code up into small , discreet chunks ; that is , “ run this code once as fast possible , ” – then wait – then “ run this code once as fast as possible ” , and so on , n times .
The trick is that the code inside each iteration is small and simple enough for the interpreter to process it completely within the speed of the timer , be it 100 or 5,000 milliseconds .
If that requirement is met , then it does n’t matter how intense the overall code is , because we ’re not asking for it to be run all at once .
How Intense is “ Too Intense ” ?
Normally , if I were writing a script that proved to be too intensive , I would look at re-engineering it ; such a significant slowdown usually indicates a problem with the code , or a deeper problem with the design of an application .
But sometimes it does n’t .
Sometimes there ’s simply no way to avoid the intensity of a particular operation , short of not doing it in JavaScript at all .
That might be the best solution in a given case ; perhaps some processing in an application needs to be moved to the server - side , where it has more processing power to work with , generally , and a genuinely threaded execution environment ( a web server ) .
But eventually you may find a situation where that ’s just not an option – where JavaScript simply must be able to do something , or be damned .
That ’s the situation I found myself in when developing my Firefox extension , Dust - Me Selectors .
The core of that extension is the ability to test CSS selectors that apply to a page , to see if they ’re actually being used .
The essence of this is a set of evaluations using the matchAll ( ) method from Dean Edwards ‘ base2 :
for ( var i=0 ; i<selectors.length ; i++)
{
if ( base2.DOM.Document.matchAll
( contentdoc , selectors [ i ] ) . length >
0 )
{
used ++;
}
else
{
unused ++;
}
}
Straightforward enough , for sure .
But matchAll ( ) itself is pretty intense , having – as it does – to parse and evaluate any CSS1 or CSS2 selector , then walk the entire DOM tree looking for matches ; and the extension does that for each individual selector , of which there may be several thousand .
That process , on the surface so simple , could be so intensive that the whole browser freezes while it ’s happening .
And this is what we find .
Locking up the browser is obviously not an option , so if this is to work at all , we must find a way of making it run without error .
A Simple Test Case
Let ’s demonstrate the problem with a simple test case involving two levels of iteration ; the inner level is deliberately too intensive so we can create the race conditions , while the outer level is fairly short so that it simulates the main code .
This is what we have :
function process ( )
{
var above = 0 , below = 0 ;
for ( var i=0 ; i<200000 ; i++)
{
if ( Math.random ( ) * 2 > 1 )
{
above ++;
}
else
{
below ++;
}
}
}
function test1 ( )
{
var result1 = document.getElementById(' result1 ' ) ;
var start = new Date ( ) .getTime ( ) ;
for ( var i=0 ; i<200 ; i++)
{
result1.value = ' time= ' +
( new Date ( ) .getTime ( ) - start ) + ' [ i= ' + i + ' ] ' ;
process ( ) ;
}
result1.value = ' time= ' +
( new Date ( ) .getTime ( ) - start ) + ' [ done ] ' ;
}
We kick off our test , and get our output , from a simple form ( this is test code , not production , so forgive me for resorting to using inline event handlers ) :
< form action= " " >
< fieldset >
< input type=" button " value= " test1 " onclick = " test1 ( ) " />
< input type =" text " id =" result1 " />
</ fieldset >
</ form >
Now let ’s run that code in Firefox ( in this case , Firefox 3 on a 2GHz MacBook ) … and as expected , the browser UI freezes while it ’s running ( making it impossible , for example , to press refresh and abandon the process ) .
After about 90 iterations , Firefox produces an “ unresponsive script ” warning dialog .
If we allow it to continue , after another 90 iterations Firefox produces the same dialog again .
Safari 3 and Internet Explorer 6 behave similarly in this respect , with a frozen UI and a threshold at which a warning dialog is produced .
In Opera there is no such dialog – it just continues to run the code until it ’s done – but the browser UI is similarly frozen until the task is complete .
Clearly we ca n’t run code like that in practice .
So let ’s re-factor it and use an asynchronous timer for the outer loop :
function test2 ( )
{
var result2 = document.getElementById('result2 ' ) ;
var start = new Date ( ) .getTime ( ) ;
var i = 0 , limit = 200 , busy = false ;
var processor = setInterval ( function ( )
{
if (! busy )
{
busy = true ;
result2.value = ' time= ' +
( new Date ( ) .getTime ( ) - start ) + ' [ i= ' + i + ' ] ' ;
process ( ) ;
if (++i == limit )
{
clearInterval ( processor ) ;
result2.value = ' time= ' +
( new Date ( ) .getTime ( ) - start ) + ' [ done ] ' ;
}
busy = false ;
}
} , 100 ) ;
}
Now let ’s run it in again … and this time we receive completely different results .
The code takes a while to complete , sure , but it runs successfully all the way to the end , without the UI freezing and without warnings about excessively slow scripting .
( The busy flag is used to prevent timer instances from colliding .
If we ’re already in the middle of a sub- process when the next iteration comes around , we simply just wait for the following iteration , thereby ensuring that only one sub - process is running at a time . )
So you see , although the work we can do on the inner process is still minimal , the number of times we can run that process is now unlimited : we can run the outer loop basically forever , and the browser will never freeze .
That ’s much more like it – we can use this in the wild .
You ’re Crazy !
I can hear the objectors already .
In fact , I could be one myself : why would you do this – what kind of crazy person insists on pushing JavaScript to all these places it was never designed to go ?
Your code is just too intense .
This is the wrong tool for the job .
If you have to jump through these kinds of hoops then the design of your application is fundamentally wrong .
I ’ve already mentioned one example where I had to find a way for heavy scripting to work ; it was either that , or the whole idea had to be abandoned .
If you ’re not convinced by that answer , then the rest of the article may not appeal to you either .
But if you are – or at least , if you ’re open to being convinced , here ’s another example that really nails it home : using JavaScript to write games where you can play against the computer .
Game on
What I ’m talking about here is the code required to understand the rules of a game , which can then evaluate situations and tactics in order to try to beat you at that game .
Complicated stuff .
To illustrate , I ’m going to look at a project I ’ve been developing on the side for a little while .
By “ little while ” I mean three years , the majority of which was spent at a plateau where the game theoretically worked , but was too intense to use … until I thought of this approach .
The game is a competitive puzzle based around color - and shape - matching .
To summarize : you make your way across the board by adjacent shape - and color - matching .
For example , if you start on , say , a green triangle – then you can move to any other triangle , or any other green shape .
Your objective is to reach the crystal in the middle , then take it to the other side of the board , while your opponent tries to do the same .
You can also steal the crystal from your opponent .
So , we have logical rules determining movement and we can also see tactics emerging .
For example , to avoid having your opponent reach the crystal , or stealing it from you – you might select a move that blocks them , or try to finish at a place they ca n’t reach .
The work of the computer is to find the best move for any given situation , so let ’s have a look at that process in summary pseudo - code :
function compute ( )
{
var move = null ;
move = tactic1 ( ) ;
if (!move ) { move = tactic2 ( ) ; }
if (!move ) { move = tactic3 ( ) ; }
if ( move )
{
doit ( ) ;
}
else
{
pass ( ) ;
}
}
We evaluate a tactic , and if that gives us a good move then we ’re done ; otherwise we evaluate another tactic , and so on , until we either have a move , or conclude that there is n’t one and we have to pass .
Each of those tactic functions runs an expensive process , as it has to evaluate every position on the board , as well as potential future positions , possibly many times each in light of various factors .
The example only has three tactics , but in the real game there are dozens of different possibilities , each one expensive to evaluate .
Any one of those evaluations individually is fine , but all of them together , run consecutively , make for an overly intense process that freezes the browser .
So what I did was split the main code into discreet tasks , each of which is selected with a switch statement , and iterated over using an asynchronous timer .
The logic of this is not a million miles away from those Choose Your Own Adventure books I used to have as a kid , where each task concludes with a choice of further tasks , all in real time , until we reach the end :
function compute ( )
{
var move = null ;
var busy = false , task = ' init ' ;
var processor = setInterval ( function ( )
{
if (! busy )
{
switch ( task )
{
case ' init ' :
move = tactic1 ( ) ;
if ( move ) { task = ' doit ' ; }
else { task = ' tactic2 ' ; }
busy = false ;
break ;
case ' tactic2 ' :
move = tactic2 ( ) ;
if ( move ) { task = ' doit ' ; }
else { task = ' tactic3 ' ; }
busy = false ;
break ;
case ' tactic3 ' :
move = tactic3 ( ) ;
if ( move ) { task = ' doit ' ; }
else { task = ' pass ' ; }
busy = false ;
break ;
case ' doit ' :
doit ( ) ;
task = ' final ' ;
busy = false ;
break ;
case ' pass ' :
pass ( ) ;
task = ' final ' ;
busy = false ;
break ;
case ' final ' :
clearInterval ( processor ) ;
busy = false ;
break ;
}
}
} , 100 ) ;
}
This code is significantly more verbose than the original , so if reducing code size were the only imperative , this would clearly not be the way to go .
But what we ’re trying to do here is create an execution environment with no ceiling , that is , a process that does n’t have an upper limit in terms of complexity and length ; and that ’s what we ’ve done .
This pattern can be extended indefinitely , with hundreds or even thousands of tasks .
It might take a long time to run , but run it will , and as long as each individual task is not too intense , it will run without killing the browser .
A Path of No Return
The strength of this approach is also its major weakness : since the inner function is asynchronous , we cannot return a value from the outer function .
So , for example , we cannot do this ( or rather , we can , but there would be no point ) :
function checksomething ( )
{
var okay = false ;
var i = 0 , limit = 100 , busy = false ;
var processor = setInterval ( function ( )
{
if (! busy )
{
busy = true ;
if ( condition )
{
okay = true ;
}
if (++i == limit )
{
clearInterval ( processor ) ;
}
busy = false ;
}
} , 100 ) ;
return okay ;
}
That checksomething ( ) function will always return false because the inner function is asynchronous .
The outer function will return before the first iteration of the inner function has even happened !
This next example is similarly pointless :
if (++i == limit )
{
clearInterval ( processor ) ;
return okay ;
}
We ’re out of the scope of the outer function , therefore we ’re unable to return from it ; that return value disappears uselessly into the ether .
What we can do here is take a leaf out of Ajax coding techniques , and use a callback function ( which in this example I ’m calling “ oncomplete ” ) :
function checksomething ( oncomplete )
{
var okay = false ;
var i = 0 , limit = 100 , busy = false ;
var processor = setInterval ( function ( )
{
if (! busy )
{
busy = true ;
if ( condition )
{
okay = true ;
}
if (++i == limit )
{
clearInterval ( processor ) ;
if ( typeof oncomplete == ' function ' )
{
oncomplete ( okay ) ;
}
}
busy = false ;
}
} , 100 ) ;
}
So when we call checksomething ( ) , we pass an anonymous function as its argument , and that function is called with the final value when the job is complete :
checksomething ( function ( result )
{
alert ( result ) ;
} ) ;
Elegant ?
No .
But robustly functional ?
Yes .
And that ’s the point .
Using this technique , we can write scripts that would otherwise be impossible .
Do Androids Dream of Silicon Sheep ?
With this technique in our kit , we now have a means for tackling JavaScript projects that were previously way out of the realm of possibility .
The game I developed this pattern for has fairly simple logic , and hence a fairly simple brain , but it was still too much for conventional iteration ; and there are plenty of other games out there that need a good deal more clout !
My next plan is to use this technique to implement a JavaScript Chess engine .
Chess has a huge range of possible scenarios and tactics , leading to decisions that could take an extremely long time to calculate , far longer than would have been feasible without this technique .
Intense computation is required to create even the most basic thinking machine , and I confess to being quite excited about the possibilities .
If we can pull off tricks like this , who ’s to say what ’s possible ?
Natural language processing , heuristics … perhaps we have the building blocks to develop Artificial Intelligence in JavaScript !

It ’s an ill wind that blows nobody good .
Three years after Hurricane Katrina , another storm is heading for the Gulf Coast  and this has given Republicans a reason to cancel President Bush ’s scheduled appearance at their national convention .
The party can thus avoid reminding voters that the last man they placed in the White House did such a heckuva job that he scored the highest disapproval ratings ever recorded .
Instead , Mr. Bush is playing Commander in Chief .
On Sunday morning the White House Web site featured photos of the president talking to Gulf state governors about Hurricane Gustav while ostentatiously clutching a red folder labeled “ Classified . ”
On Monday , instead of speaking at the convention , reports suggest that Mr. Bush will address the nation about the storm .
And a report on Politico.com suggested that John McCain might give a speech “ from the devastation zone if the storm hits the U.S. coast with the ferocity feared by forecasters . ”
What ’s wrong with this picture ?
Let ’s start with that red folder .
Assuming that the folder contained something other than scrap paper , is the planned response to a hurricane a state secret ?
Are we worried that tropical storm systems will discover our weak points ?
Are we fighting a Global War on Weather ?

Vil trekke flere hundre milliarder ut av USA Hvis ikke USA undertegner Kyoto - avtalen .
Leder i Naturnvernforbundet , Lars Haltbrekken , mener Norge bør trekke flere hundre milliarder ut av amerikanske selskaper hvis ikke USA undertegner Kyoto - avtalen .
I en kommentar i Nationen torsdag tar Haltbrekken til orde for å koble handels - og miljøpolitikk i tilfeller der land ikke respekterer internasjonale miljøforpliktelser .
- Verdens miljøavtaler har det til felles at de som bryter eller nekter å inngå dem ikke får noen skikkelig straff .
Handelssanksjoner vil være en effektiv straffereaksjon mot miljøbøllene , skriver Haltbrekken .
I tillegg til å trekke ut hundrevis av millioner kroner som Norge gjennom oljefondet har plassert i amerikanske selskaper vil Haltbrekken også legge straffetoll på import fra USA eller stanse importen helt .

Leaked ' Simpsons ' clip shows rigged voting machine David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday October 2 , 2008
Print This Email This Although the cartoon Simpson family did once help Krusty the Clown run for Congress as a Republican with the aid of Fox News , their general learning is clearly towards the Democrats .
In a leaked clip from the upcoming Halloween episode of The Simpsons , Homer declares when faced with an electronic voting machine , " I want to vote for Obama .
...
It 's time for a change . "
The machine , however , has ideas of its own , which it enforces more and more violently .
" This does n't happen in America ! " screams Homer .
" Maybe Ohio , but not in America .
One blogger notes that it would " be funny if it did n't seem eerily plausible . "
" We really made a fun one , " executive producer Al Jean says of the episode .
The leaked clip was posted on YouTube by " deebold08 , " a user name referring to charges that Diebold voting machines have been used to steal elections .

La tecnologia può avere un impatto positivo per l’ambiente , sviluppando innovazioni utili nella riduzione dell ’uso di materie prime e di energia .
Ma quando si parla di IT , sembra che l’ago della bilancia penda più verso il lato negativo , sia per quanto riguarda il lato software che quello hardware .
Secondo uno studio dell ’ IZT institute di Berlino presentato al CeBIT di Hannover , ad esempio , sembra che l’impatto della semplice navigazione in internet sia a dir poco spropositata .
Secondo il professor Siegfried Behrendt un avatar comunemente usato in Second Life consumerebbe la stessa quantità di energia di un brasiliano (! ) .
Anche per quanto riguarda i prodotti di elettronica e i computer in particolare i dati non sono dei migliori .
Secondo il Greener electronics guide , un affascinante ecoguida ai prodotti elettronici curata da Greenpeace , pochi dei grandi colossi hi-tech prendono la sufficienza nella pagella della sostenibilità , colpa di una scarsa attenzione alla riciclabilità dei prodotti e all ’efficienza ( energetica e di consumo di materie prime ) dei processi .
Ad aggravare uno scenario già fosco , la notizia che il solo settore dell ’ICT è responsabile di almeno il 2 % delle emissioni di gas serra a livello globale .
Come stanno rispondendo le aziende imputate ?
Sicuramente non ignorando questa problematica , che in tempi di caro gasolio e documentari sul global warming , sta attirando sempre di più l’attenzione dei consumatori .
Alcune aziende ( IBM e Intel tanto per fare due nomi ) , stanno investendo per entrare i nuovi mercati più green , sviluppando tecnologie energetiche solari o simili ; secondo Rhone Resch , responsabile della Solar Energy Industries Association ( SEIA ) , “ virtualmente ogni chipmaker sta soppesando un ruolo nel solare ” .
Ma anche altri nomi noti del settore dell ’ informatica stanno cercando di lavare la propria immagine spostandosi verso produzioni più green , apportando modifiche ai propri prodotti o sviluppando nuovi modelli campioni di sostenibilità ( o almeno questo è l’obiettivo dichiarato ) .
Come i nuovi eco-book di Asus , con il case in bambù e altre caratteristiche che fanno felici gli ambientalisti .
O come Apple che ha brevettato una tecnologia che permetterà di ricoprire le superfici dei propri prodotti , dal MacBookAir all ’IPod con sottilissime celle solari che permetteranno una ricarica completamenteeco - friendly .
Ma questa è solo una delle tante iniziative in questo campo promosse da Apple , che si sta difendendo così dalle pesanti accuse di produrre PC e gadget vari altamente inquinanti , sia per i materiali tossici usati nella produzione che per la scarsa attenzione alla riciclabilità degli stessi .
Interessante è anche il caso di Dell , che si è autodefinita “ the greenest technology company on the planet ” e ha tutta l’intenzione di diventarlo .
Grazie a nuovi prodotti come il Dell Studio Hybrid , un nuovo sistema desktop ultra-compatto stile Mac - Mini che consuma però fino al 70 % in meno di un PC desktop normale ed è costruito con materiali riciclabili .
Ma grazie soprattutto ad un’attenzione agli impatti ambientali in tutte le fasi del processo produttivo , dal design dei nuovi prodotti alla produzione e distribuzione , facendo in modo di ridurre l’impiego energetico anche nell ’uso del prodotto , così come la riciclabilità dello stesso alla fine del suo ciclo di vita .
Anche in questo settore , dunque , molte rotte sono state aperte per dirigere la produzione verso obiettivi più green , che coniugano redditività con l’attenzione all ’ambiente .

I cannot quite keep count at this point of the bald - faced lies that the McCain - Palin campaign has been telling to a pliant , pathetic , useless excuse for an American press corps .
But here 's the latest .
We were all told by the McCain - Palin campaign that Sarah Palin had visited Iraq earlier this year :
Following her selection last month as John McCain 's running mate , aides said Palin had traveled to Ireland , Germany , Kuwait , and Iraq to meet with members of the Alaska National Guard .
During that trip she was said to have visited a " military outpost " inside Iraq .
The campaign has since repeated that Palin 's foreign travel included an excursion into the Iraq battle zone .
This was another simple lie .
Not a distortion , a lie .
But , as we know , the McCain - Palin campaign tells massive lies and when called on them , first try a dodge , rather than the truth .
And so when asked to give more details about her trip to Iraq , we were first told :
Asked to clarify where she traveled in Iraq , Palin 's spokeswoman , Maria Comella , confirmed that " She visited a military outpost on the other side of the Kuwait - Iraq border . "
So not far into Iraq , but definitely Iraq , right ?
Wrong , according to " Lieutenant Colonel Dave Osborn , commander of the 3d Battalion , 207th Infantry of the Alaska National Guard , who was in charge of the 570 local troops serving in Kuwait and Iraq . "
Here 's the truth :
On the second day of the trip , he said , Palin was flown to the border crossing , about 100 miles north of Camp Buehring , where she spent the morning meeting with troops and presiding over a ceremony in which an Alaska National Guard soldier extended his enlistment .
But she did not venture into Iraq , Osborn said .
" You have to have permission to go into a lot of areas , and [ the crossing ] is where her permissions were , " he said .
Palin did not stay the night in Iraq , and spent the rest of the second day at Camp Virginia and Ali Al Salem Air Base , Osborn said .
Her alleged visit to Ireland was also , it turns out , a refueling stop .
She did n't leave the plane .
I swear to you I 'm not making any of this up .

Apple said this week some of its more recent MacBook Pro models may contain faulty Nvidia graphics chips that produce distorted video or fail completely .
The problem
In July , Nvidia informed the Securities and Exchange Commission that it would incur a $ 150 million to $ 200 million charge to cover repair and replacement expenses resulting from " a weak die / packaging material set " in certain versions of its previous MCP and GPU products employed by various notebook vendors .
" The previous generation MCP and GPU products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities , " the chipmaker told the Commission .
" Certain notebook configurations of these MCP and GPU products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates . "
When contacted by AppleInsider shortly after the filing , officials for Nvidia refused to confirm or deny whether Apple was among the notebook manufacturers affected by the issue , citing " confidentiality obligations " to its customers that prevent it from discussing the matter .
For its part , Apple also contacted Nvidia in July and was assured " that Mac computers with these graphics processors were not affected , " it revealed in a support document for the first time this week .
" However , after an Apple - led investigation , Apple has determined that some MacBook Pro computers with the NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT graphics processor may be affected , " the company said .
" If the NVIDIA graphics processor in your MacBook Pro has failed , or fails within two years of the original date of purchase , a repair will be done free of charge , even if your MacBook Pro is out of warranty . "
Affected MacBook Pros and symptoms
Among the models affected are those that were manufactured between approximately May 2007 and September 2008 .
They include the MacBook Pro ( 15 - Inch , 2.4/2.2GHz ) , MacBook Pro ( 17 - Inch , 2.4GHz ) , and MacBook Pro ( Early 2008 ) .
Customers who own one of these systems should look for instances of distorted or scrambled video on their screen , or the absence of video on the screenÂ ( or external display ) when the computer is running .
Getting your MacBook Pro repaired
" If your MacBook Pro is exhibiting any of the symptoms listed above , please take it to an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider ( AASP ) for evaluation , or call your local Apple Contact Center , " Apple said .
" Before visiting the Genius Bar at the Apple Retail Store , please make a reservation . "
Apple is also issuing refunds to customers who may have paid for repairs related to this issue .
These customers should contact Apple for details on the refund process .
Lawsuit
Despite Nvidia 's claim that its graphics chip failures were limited to a certain number of chips manufactured for a certain number of notebooks , the Inquirer in July charged the company with masking the severity of the problem , alleging that " all the G84 and G86 parts are bad .
Period .
No exceptions . "
" All of them , mobile and desktop , use the exact same ASIC , so expect them to go south in inordinate numbers as well , " the publication said .
Last month , Nvidia shareholders joined the fight by filing a class - action lawsuit , accusing the company of violating federal securities laws by concealing the existence of a serious defect in its graphics chip line for at least eight months â in a series of false and misleading statements made to the investing public.â 
DENVER - A city drug panel has voted to urge police to refrain from arresting adults for marijuana possession during next week ’s Democratic National Convention , but the cops are n’t necessarily on board .
Lt. Ernie Martinez , the police department ’s representative on the panel , said police , bracing for potentially tens of thousands of protesters during the Aug. 25 - 28 convention , would have more pressing duties than rounding up pot smokers .
At the same time , he said , authorities would n’t ignore blatant flouting of the law .
“ If something occurs in front of us , we ’re going to act , ” he said .
The Denver Marijuana Policy Review Panel , appointed by Mayor John Hickenlooper , voted 5 - 3 at its Wednesday night meeting to issue a recommendation discouraging police from “ arresting , detaining or issuing a citation ” to any adult caught with up to one ounce of marijuana during the four - day convention .
Denver voters have twice approved initiatives calling on police to overlook adult marijuana possession but police , citing state and federal laws , have continued to make marijuana - related arrests .
A department spokesman yesterday said it was reviewing the panel ’s recommendation .
Mason Tvert , a panel member and pot-legalization activist , Thursday delivered a copy of the panel ’s recommendation to Mr. Hickenlooper and police Chief Gerry Whitman , saying that “ we expect police to abide by this very logical recommendation . ”
“ If police expect the taxpayers to cover their $ 1.2 million in overtime during the DNC , it is only fair that they respect the laws adopted by those taxpayers , ” said Mr. Tvert , leader of Safer Alternatives for Enjoyable Recreation .
“ There will be plenty for police to do during the DNC aside from arresting or citing adults who are simply making the safer choice to use marijuana instead of alcohol . ”
Mr. Tvert told the panel Wednesday that authorities have actually increased their enforcement of marijuana laws since the 2005 and 2007 votes .
Based on current numbers , he said , the city is on track to prosecute 1,900 marijuana - related cases this year , up from 1,600 last year .
In 2005 , Denver voters approved a measure legalizing adult possession of up to an ounce of marijuana .
Two years later , an initiative making adult marijuana possession the city ’s lowest law enforcement priority also won at the ballot box .
Mr. Tvert said he hoped the police would give the panel ’s recommendation the same weight as if it were issued by the mayor .
“ There ’s no way for the recommendation to be binding , but it was issued by a panel appointed by the mayor , so we would expect it to be treated as a pronouncement from the mayor , ” said Mr. Tvert .
The Denver County Sheriff ’s Office gave a media tour earlier this week of its temporary holding cell , a renovated warehouse intended to house anyone arrested during the convention .
The facility , equipped with a photo station and 18 - by - 18 holding cells , can process 60 people an hour and hold up to 400 detainees .
Local activists have already dubbed the facility “ Gitmo by the Platte , ” referring to the nearby Platte River , but it could have been worse .
Officials abandoned earlier plans to line the top of the cells with razor wire after objections from the community .
Authorities are bracing for potentially tens of thousands of protesters during the Aug. 25 - 28 convention .
Demonstrators will be fenced in at a designated protest area in the vicinity of the Pepsi Center , the site of most convention events .
The protesters , affiliated with groups like Recreate 68 and the Alliance for a Real Democracy , are expected to demonstrate against the Iraq war and in favor of social - justice issues .
One anti-war organization , Tent State University , has estimated that its group alone will attract 50,000 demonstrators .
The group had hoped to camp overnight at a local park until city authorities nixed the idea .

Europe saw the first bridge completely made of plastic and installed in Germany which is expected to last up to 50 years without any repairs .
Weighing 80 tons , the bridge 's carriageway slab is made of fiberglass - reinforced polymer ( FRP ) , and then glued onto two steel bearers .
The bridge was pre-assembled a unit and then transported to the construction site , with total installation taking less than one day .
The FRP bridge is 27 m in length and 5 m in width and meets 2010 Eurocode standards , the new code prepared by European Commission for public construction purposes .
The fiberglass - reinforced polymer bridge is able to withstand the load of all kind of vehicles and was put into place for use near Friedberg ( 20 minutes from Frankfurt ) .
More and more women are seeking cosmetic vaginal surgery A leading urogynaecologist has spoken out against the growing popularity of cosmetic vaginal surgery .
Professor Linda Cardozo , of King 's College Hospital , London , says little evidence exists to advise women on the safety or effectiveness of procedures .
These include operations to make the external appearance more " attractive " and reshaping the vagina to counter laxity after childbirth , for example .
She discussed the issues at a medical meeting in Montreal , Canada .
Women want to emulate the supermodel .
It 's part of a trend
Professor Cardozo A Google search showed over 45,000 references to cosmetic vaginal surgery , yet on medical databases such as PubMed or Medline there were fewer than 100 .
Professor Cardozo said the most established vaginal cosmetic procedure was reduction labioplasty - a procedure to make the labia smaller - which is requested by women either for aesthetic reasons or to alleviate physical discomfort .
" Women want to emulate the supermodel .
It 's part of a trend .
But they should know that all surgery can be risky .
" Most of the procedures are done in the private sector and it 's totally unregulated . "
The exact numbers of procedures carried out are unknown .
In the past five years there has been a doubling of the number of labial reductions carried out on the NHS from 400 in 2000 / 1 to 800 in 2004 / 5 .
Growing trend
The evidence from existing case studies shows that the procedure , which costs about £ 2,000 at a private clinic , does have positive aesthetic results but it is unclear whether it resolves feelings of psychological distress or improves sexual functioning , she said .
Types of cosmetic vaginal surgery Labioplasty - to make the labia smaller Vaginal rejuvenation - to make the vagina tighter Hymenoplasty - to restore the hymen and make the woman appear a virgin
And there was little evidence that " vaginal rejuvenation " - the surgical repair of vaginal laxity , with a price tag of about £ 3,000 - improved symptoms and was any better than doing simple pelvic floor muscle exercises .
She said robust research was needed so that doctors could properly advise their patients .
In the meantime , she urged surgeons to remain cautious and operate only as a last resort .
In her presentation at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 7th International Scientific Meeting , Professor Cardozo said : " Cosmetic vaginal procedures raise a number of serious ethical questions .
" Women are paying large sums of money for this type of surgery which may improve the appearance of their genitalia but there is no evidence that it improves function . "

What are these ?
A recent article in YNet revealed this ironic nugget : the US Ambassador to Israel has sent a letter to Israeli Finance Minister Ronnie Bar - On , excoriating Israel for illegally consuming Iranian pistachios nuts :
The US ambassador ’s letter reveals another amazing fact : Israel is the largest per capita consumer of the pistachio .
“ I am writing to draw your attention to the troubling issue of illegal importation of pistachio of Iranian origin to Israel , ” writes Jones .
“ Israel is the world ’s largest per capita consumer of pistachio nuts and therefore an important market – estimated at $ 20 million – for pistachio producers …
Evidence strongly suggests that most , if not all , of the pistachios entering Israel are actually of Iranian origin . ”
Anyone with even a passing knowledge of Israeli snacking habits will attest that Israel will be hard pressed to give up their pistachio addiction , no matter where the nuts actually come from .
For its part , Israel claims it gets most of its pistachios from Turkey ( yeah , right ! )
The most priceless part of the article comes at the end , when journalist Nahum Barnea unabashedly editorializes on the scandal of the situation :
Every pistachio nut brings Iran another step closer to achieving nuclear capability …
You know , this country of ours has more wealth than any nation , but that 's not what makes us rich .
We have the most powerful military on Earth , but that 's not what makes us strong .
Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world , but that 's not what keeps the world coming to our shores .
Instead , it is that American spirit , that American promise , that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain ; that binds us together in spite of our differences ; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen , but what is unseen , that better place around the bend .
That promise is our greatest inheritance .
It 's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night and a promise that you make to yours , a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west , a promise that led workers to picket lines and women to reach for the ballot .
( APPLAUSE )
And it is that promise that , 45 years ago today , brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington , before Lincoln 's Memorial , and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream .
( APPLAUSE )
The men and women who gathered there could 've heard many things .
They could 've heard words of anger and discord .
They could 've been told to succumb to the fear and frustrations of so many dreams deferred .
But what the people heard instead -- people of every creed and color , from every walk of life -- is that , in America , our destiny is inextricably linked , that together our dreams can be one .
" We can not walk alone , " the preacher cried .
" And as we walk , we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead .
We cannot turn back . "
Republican presidential hopeful John McCain 's MySpace page was commandeered on Tuesday to display a satirical message suggesting the Conservative was now in favour of gay marriage , particularly between " passionate females " .
The prank was orchestrated by Mike Davidson , chief exec of Newsvine , after he noticed that the Senator 's aides has taken a MySpace layout template he 'd designed without credit .
McCain 's page used unmodified imagery to create the " Contacting John McCain " table .
Adding insult to injury , the image to create this table was served from Newsvine 's site , costing the firm extra bandwidth charges every time someone visited McCain 's MySpace page .
Davidson was relaxed about McCain 's use of his code but irritated by politicians , like McCain , who get their aides to establish MySpace pages they pretend they actually use in a bid to " connect " with younger audiences .
He was further irritated by a Newsweek article that listed McCain 's MySpace page .
Fortunately , Davidson has set up his server to serve his real " contact me " image if the image was referenced from his own MySpace page , but a sample image if it was served from anywhere else .
So by changing this sample image , the content on McCain 's MySpace page was easily changed to read : " Today I announce that I have reversed my position and come out in full support of gay marriage ... particularly marriage between two passionate females . "
Davidson described the prank , which he said was not politically motivated , as the perfect hack .
" The only thing necessary to effectively commandeer McCain 's page with my own messaging was to simply replace my own sample image on my server with a newly created sample on my server .
No server but my own was touched and no laws were broken .
The immaculate hack , " he said .
McCain 's aides moved quickly to remove the offending image but not before Davidson was able to grab screen grabs and document his hack here . ®
Michael Creighton 's latest thriller , Next , presents all sorts of what - if scenarios for the genetic community .
While most of us will not have to deal with foul - mouthed orangutans or smart - ass parrots , a recent report published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that there may be a genetic factor contributing to fear of commitment in males .
As reported today by the BBC ( " Commitment phobes can blame genes " , Sept 2 , 2008 ) , this gene is called AVPR1A .
Males with a certain allele for this gene ( allele 334 ) have an aversion to commitment , and are less likely to have happy , fulfilled marriages .
Maybe this is not a surprise ... but it could be a problem for some males .
In a Creighton - world scenario , a male goes out for a date with an attractive women .
As he excuses himself to go use the restroom , the woman quietly swabs the inside of his glass , removing a few epithelial cells .
She then sends these off to a genetic screening lab where she finds out that the male possesses two copies of AVPR1A allele 334 .
The next day she ends the relationship and then publishes his name on her blog to warn her friends that he is a hopeless cause .
If you think that these tests do not exist , check out these links .
Why would she do this ?
Because there are evolutionary differences between the ways that men and women view relationships .
Like it or not , in the animal kingdom ( to which humans belong ) , women often form long - term relationships for the purpose of rearing young .
Men , on the other hand , are more likely to seek multiple , short - term relationships .
So back to humans .... why should the female invest valuable time and energy in a relationship that is genetically bound for failure ?
No longer do women have to contemplate whether he will " change " - the genetic evidence will tell them .
Anyone else hear warning sirens ?
So guys , the next time you go out on that first date , make sure that you have your partner sign a non-disclosure agreement stating that any genetic information that she obtains as a result of your date is to remain your legal property unless you consent to its release .
Of course , that type of conversation will probably also stop you from getting a second date , but at least your little genetic secret may remain private
We have gotten used to Bush 's decision - making style .
Minimal input , instant decision , refusal to ever think again , and disdain for any process of thinking things through or ever having second thoughts .
Just gut - and instant leaps .
This description of how she made the absurd decision to run for vice - president is particularly chilling :
GIBSON : And you did n't say to yourself , " Am I experienced enough ?
Am I ready ?
Do I know enough about international affairs ?
Do I -- will I feel comfortable enough on the national stage to do this ? "
PALIN : I did n't hesitate , no .
GIBSON : Did n't that take some hubris ?
PALIN : I -- I answered him yes because I have the confidence in that readiness and knowing that you can't blink , you have to be wired in a way of being so committed to the mission , the mission that we 're on , reform of this country and victory in the war , you can't blink .
So I did n't blink then even when asked to run as his running mate .
Never blink , never think , just go with your gut .
Pure ambition .
Minimal thought .
If you loved the last eight years , you 'll love President Palin .
I wonder : did they ever ask her the last , routine , basic vetting question :
Is there anything more you need to tell us that might potentially damage or embarrass the campaign ?
Did they even ask her ?
If they did , did she say no ?
I have a feeling this question will be critical in the coming weeks as this hologram of neocon fantasy comes into sharper relief .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Round The Bend
The crowd at The Corner seems to have gone well and truly insane .
It all starts when David Frum asks :
“ Does anybody really seriously believe that Barack Obama is a secret left - wing radical ?
And if not , then what is this fuss and fury supposed to show ? ”
There follow a series of posts at The Corner which basically answer : yes .
Jonah Goldberg :
“ Well , yes .
Lots of people do .
For me , it depends on what you mean by “ radical ” … ”
Mark Levin :
“ How can anyone who actually follows this stuff , who reads Freddoso , Kurtz , and scores of other reliable sources of information , conclude that Obama is not some wild - eyed radical ? ”
Andy McCarthy :
“ If you accept the premise that he was a radical , how has he changed such that he should no longer be considered a radical ?
Obviously , he is very smooth and he presents himself as a reasonable , moderate fellow .
But that does n’t affect substance . ”
There follow several more posts , and then we get to the piÃ¨ce de resistance , from McCarthy again :
“ Obama ’s radicalism , beginning with his Alinski / ACORN / community organizer period , is a bottom - up socialism .
This , I ’d suggest , is why he fits comfortably with Ayers , who ( especially now ) is more Maoist than Stalinist .
What Obama is about is infiltrating ( and training others to infiltrate ) bourgeois institutions in order to change them from within — in essence , using the system to supplant the system .
A key requirement of this stealthy approach ( very consistent with talking vaporously about “ change ” but never getting more specific than absolutely necessary ) is electability .
With an enormous assist from the media , which does not press him for specifics , Obama has walked this line brilliantly .
Absent convincing retractions of his prior radical positions , though , we should construe shrewd moves like the ostensibly reasonable Second Amendment position as efforts make him electable .
This is why Ayers is so important : it is a peek behind the curtain of Obama ’s rhetoric . ”
So , if I understand this correctly : Barack Obama is in fact a radical ; if not himself a Maoist , then at least someone who “ fits comfortably ” with people who are “ more Maoist than Stalinist . ”
But he is disguising this fact in order to infiltrate bourgeois institutions and implement his radical vision from within .
A quiescent media does not press him for specifics , thereby allowing his centrist disguise to go unquestioned .
Only his relationship with Bill Ayers allows us “ a peek behind the curtain . ”
This is delusional .
It would be interesting to ask , for instance , why so few of Obama ’s law students have come forward to talk about his attempt to transform them into Maoist cadres , or why the lawyers in his firm have not mentioned his commitment to cultural revolution , or how he has managed to conceal his desire to nationalize the means of production from , well , everyone .
Was he secretly plotting to get asked , unexpectedly , to speak at the Democratic Convention , take a chance on running for President , and succeed , back when he was on the Harvard Law Review ?
That , plus absolutely iron self - control , might explain why no one caught a glimpse of Obama ’s secret radicalism : he has been concealing it for decades , the better to bore away at our bourgeois institutions .
There ’s only one problem with that hypothesis : if Obama were as stealthy as that , if he had lived a secret life for decades , completely concealing his inner Maoist , he would never , ever have blown his cover by getting on a board with William Ayers .
Corner : you ’re getting into When Prophecy Fails territory .
Get a grip .
There are just so many ways the Universe is out to get us .
Astronomers have already considered the threat from our Sun ’s orbit around the center of the Milky Way .
When our Sun rises up out of flat plane of the Milky Way , it appears we might be less protected from intergalactic radiation and cosmic rays .
Well , it looks like passing through the middle of the galactic plane might have its own share of risks : an increased number of comets might be hurled towards the Earth because of gravitational interaction with the densest parts of our galaxy .
Researchers at the Cardiff Centre of Astrobiology have built a computer model of the Solar System ’s journey around the Milky Way .
Instead of making a perfectly flat orbit around the galaxy ’s centre , it actually bounces up and down .
At times it can rise right up out of the galactic plane – getting 100 light years above – and then dip down below it .
They calculated that we pass through the plane every 35 to 40 million years .
And this time period seems to match dangerous periods of impacts on Earth .
According to the number and age of craters on Earth , we seem to suffer increased impacts every 36 million years .
Uh oh , that ’s a match .
In fact , one of these high points of comet activity would have been 65 million years – the same time that an asteroid strike wiped out the dinosaurs .
And here ’s the bad news .
According to their calculations , the Solar System will be passing through the galactic plane in the near future , and should see an increased risk of impact .
Our risk of impact could increase 10 - fold .
There might be a silver lining to the bounce , though .
The impacts might have helped life spread across the galaxy .
While the “ bounce ” effect may have been bad news for dinosaurs , it may also have helped life to spread .
The scientists suggest the impact may have thrown debris containing micro-organisms out into space and across the universe .
Centre director Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe said : “ This is a seminal paper which places the comet - life interaction on a firm basis , and shows a mechanism by which life can be dispersed on a galactic scale . ”
Here ’s more info on the story from Bad Astronomy .

George Washington and Deism
Deists have a great example of toleration , perseverance , and integrity in the person of fellow Deist George Washington .
Christian preachers who ardently wanted Washington to be portrayed as one of them have made up many stories of George Washington 's strong Christian beliefs .
One of the primary purveyors of these propaganda pieces was Mason Locke Weems , a Christian preacher who came up with the fable of George Washington and the cherry tree .
He also feverishly promoted the myth of George Washington and Christianity .
Washington , like many people in colonial America , belonged to the Anglican church and was a vestryman in it .
But in early America , particularly in pre-revolutionary America , you had to belong to the dominant church if you wanted to have influence in society , as is illustrated by the following taken from Old Churches , Ministers and Families of Virginia , by Bishop William Meade , I , p 191 .
" Even Mr. Jefferson , and George Wythe , who did not conceal their disbelief in Christianity , took their parts in the duties of vestrymen , the one at Williamsburg , the other at Albermarle ; for they wished to be men of influence . "
In the book Washington and Religion by Paul F. Boller , Jr. , we read on page 92 , " Washington was no infidel , if by infidel is meant unbeliever .
Washington had an unquestioning faith in Providence and , as we have seen , he voiced this faith publicly on numerous occasions .
That this was no mere rhetorical flourish on his part , designed for public consumption , is apparent from his constant allusions to Providence in his personal letters .
There is every reason to believe , from a careful analysis of religious references in his private correspondence , that Washington ’s reliance upon a Grand Designer along Deist lines was as deep - seated and meaningful for his life as , say , Ralph Waldo Emerson ’s serene confidence in a Universal Spirit permeating the ever shifting appearances of the everyday world . "
On page 82 of the same book , Boller includes a quote from a Presbyterian minister , Arthur B. Bradford , who was an associate of Ashbel Green another Presbyterian minister who had known George Washington personally .
Bradford wrote that Green , " often said in my hearing , though very sorrowfully , of course , that while Washington was very deferential to religion and its ceremonies , like nearly all the founders of the Republic , he was not a Christian , but a Deist . "
Like truly intelligent people in all times and places , Washington realized how very little we know about life and the workings of the universe .
He wrote that the ways of Providence were " inscrutable . "
Yet he DID the very best he could in all aspects of his life .
When things were dark and it looked like the Revolution would be lost , he never gave up .
Even when people in his own ranks were turning on him and trying to sink him he persevered because of his deep heartfelt Deistic belief in Providence .
George Washington coupled his genuine belief in Providence with action .
After the American defeat at Germantown in 1777 he said , " We must endeavor to deserve better of Providence , and , I am persuaded , she will smile on us . "
He also wrote that we should take care to do our very best in everything we do so that our , " reason and our own conscience approve . "
Washington 's toleration for differing religions was made evident by his order to the Continental Army to halt the observance of Pope 's Day .
Pope 's Day was the American equivalent of Guy Fawkes ' Day in England .
A key part of Pope 's Day was the burning of the effigy of the Pope .
In his order , Washington described the tradition as , " ridiculous and childish " and that there was no room for this type of behavior in the Continental Army .
The altruism and integrity that Washington possessed is made evident by his restraint in his personal gains .
At the successful conclusion of the American Revolution he could have made himself dictator for life .
Or he could have allowed others to make him king .
Yet , like the Roman General Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus before him , Washington refused to do either .
Preacher Weems has written that on Washington 's death bed , " Washington folded his arms decently on his breast , then breathing out ' Father of mercies , take me to thyself , ' - he fell asleep . "
Like almost all of what the Christian fundamentalists have written about Washington , this is not true .
Tobias Lear , Washington 's secretary , was with him when he died .
The following is his account of Washington 's death .
" About ten o'clk he made several attempts to speak to me before he could effect it , at length he said , -'I am just going .
Have me decently buried ; and do not let my body be put into the vault in less than three days after I am dead . '
I bowed assent , for I could not speak .
He then looked at me again and said , ' Do you understand me ? '
I replied , ' Yes . '
' Tis well , ' said he .
" About ten minutes before he expired ( which was between ten and eleven o'clk ) his breathing became easier ; he lay quietly ; - he withdrew his hand from mine , and felt his own pulse .
I saw his countenance change .
I spoke to Dr. Craik who sat by the fire ; - he came to the bed side .
The General 's hand fell from his wrist - I took it in mine and put it into my bosom .
Dr. Craik put his hands over his eyes and he expired without a struggle or a sigh ! "
Like other Deists such as Paine , Jefferson , Voltaire , Franklin , and Allen , Washington did not fear death but looked at it as just another part of nature .
Though he did n't speculate much on an after - life , he was comfortable to look at his own death as part of God 's design .
George Washington offers us a tremendous example of altruism and positive action .
His actions tell us stronger than any words could possibly do to persevere in the face of all obstacles .
To never give up and to always combine our sincerely held beliefs with action .
If a successful analyst is hired by another organization , chances are both his work performance and the market value of his new company will not reap the expected benefits ; they might even lose altitude .
So discovered HBS professor Boris Groysberg and colleagues Ashish Nanda and Nitin Nohria , who detailed their results four years ago in the Harvard Business Review article , " The Risky Business of Hiring Stars . "
Since launching his research into the war for talent , however , Groysberg has started to notice something quite different about the career paths of successful analysts who were female .
Star women , he found , maintained their shine even after switching companies .
Unlike their male peers , they thrived in new work environments .
Why the difference ?
As Groysberg observed in the Harvard Business Review last February , " Female star analysts , it would seem , take their work environment more seriously yet rely on it less than male stars do .
They look for a firm that will allow them to keep building their successful franchises their own way . "
Groysberg brings us up to date on his study of the career trajectories of talented analysts , and suggests how women and men can make the most of star power .
Q : Why did you think there might be an important gender aspect to your research into star performers and their career development ?
How did you study this topic in depth ?
Boris Groysberg : A few years ago , my colleagues and I began this research by looking at what happens to stars when they change jobs .
Equity analysts are an ideal population to study :
Their performance is objectively measured every year , there is a lot of demographic and organizational data on them and their employers , and many things are held constant when they change firms .
For instance , when an analyst moves , he or she continues to cover the same companies and serve the same clients .
Most investment banks are within a mile radius of each other , so even the commute does not change .
“ A company that is willing to double your current salary , but will not invest in your long - term success , is not a good choice . ”
Overall , we found that stars did poorly at their new firms .
Analyzing the data further revealed that there are gender differences in how well stars do after they jump ship .
In fact , the decline in performance was pronounced only for star men .
Star women who switched firms exhibit no decline in performance .
Follow - up analyses also suggested some intriguing reasons for this , as outlined in my Harvard Business Review article , " How Star Women Build Portable Skills . "
Q : What are the different obstacles that male and female professionals have encountered in order to rise in their organizations ?
A : Women tend to do better after a move for two reasons .
One is that they are more invested in external than in in - house relationships .
There are four main reasons why star women maintain external focus : uneasy in - house relationships , poor mentorship , neglect by colleagues , and a vulnerable position in the labor market .
External focus makes them more " portable " in terms of making a positive move , but can cause problems if they want to progress within their own organization , because you need a solid internal network and good political capital to get things done in organizations .
Anyone who focuses mostly on external relationships will not have that .
The other reason is that women do far more due diligence when they receive a job offer than men do , because women need to ensure that the company is good for women and that they wo n't be treated as token females .
In the process of due diligence , star women learn a lot of valuable information about the company that helps them make good strategic decisions .
They scrutinize prospective employers on receptivity to women , managerial support , latitude and flexibility , and performance measurement .
There 's no downside to that strategy — it is one that men could benefit from just as well .
The major obstacles that women face are discussed in greater detail in the HBR article .
Men can also face similar obstacles if they are in a poorly managed organization .
Star men from mismanaged departments , in which it was difficult to create good in - house relationships and there were frequent changes of management , respond much as women do — by investing in external networks .
Not all but some of their strategies at poorly managed firms resemble the strategies of women .
Q : Are you seeing evidence that workplaces on Wall Street , for example , are taking steps to overcome some of the barriers for women that you have noticed ?
Or does it appear that women need to continue designing their own strategies in order to thrive as professionals ?
A : Some investment banks have tried to make a greater effort in this area .
The research department of Lehman Brothers took steps to create a comfortable environment for women , and to evaluate all their analysts fairly and mentor them intensively .
This paid off :
The bank developed a lot of stars and benefited from their loyalty as employees .
In fact , working environments that were good for women were equally good for men .
Certainly , I 've also noticed that when some organizations deliberately set out to create female - friendly environments , they seemed to reap a competitive advantage .
Unfortunately , there are still only a few organizations that invest the time , effort , and resources in creating these environments .
And in many that do , only some managers make an effort to be inclusive .
The consequence of that is when these managers leave , the female - friendly environments disappear .
Q : Based on your research , how could male as well as female professionals improve their career choices ?
A : Women 's portability comes from two sources : a greater emphasis on external relationships , and conducting better research about a company before joining it .
Men would benefit from conducting more due diligence as well .
Do n't let yourself be blinded by the money !
A company that is willing to double your current salary , but will not invest in your long - term success , is not a good choice .
Investigate a firm 's management , its culture , its resources , the commitment it is willing to make to you .
These are the things that will ultimately make you a star — and keep you one .
Women in a male - dominated industry realize that they are vulnerable , but men are vulnerable to bad management and cultural mismatches more than they realize .
Q : What new questions has your research raised for you ?
What are you working on next ?
A : One question is what happens when a profession becomes more gender - balanced over time .
Do men's and women 's career strategies become more similar ?
I think there are also opportunities to study what attributes of organizations make professionals become stars faster .
Finally , understanding careers of female professionals is important .
How do they make their career choices ?
My colleagues and I have been working on a few case studies on these subjects .
For example , the " Leading the Josie Esquivel Franchise " case shows how a female professional can build her own " star franchise " and what to consider when you change firms .
Another example is the " Leadership in Law : Amy Schulman at DLA Piper " case , which focuses on different stages in this star 's career and what she did to be successful at each stage .
We need more cases on how gender dynamics affect individual careers .
On that note , I would very much like to hear from female readers of HBS Working Knowledge who would be willing to share their experiences around any of the strategies I 've just mentioned or on building successful careers in general .
Their insights would further this research for myself and my MBA students .

Mozilla was forced to halt the rollout of Firefox 78 after some users reported experiencing a serious bug after installing the latest version of the browser .
According to the official bug report , users noticed that Firefox 78 was missing all search engines as well as its list of one - click search engines .
Auto - complete was also broken in the address bar and searching from the start page did not launch a search .
Firefox Stable and Extended Support Release ( ESR ) were also affected by the bug when updated to the new version though new installations of Firefox are not .
As reported by Ghacks , Mozilla engineers discovered that the issue was caused by a local IndexedDB database that was not working properly .
After investigating further , the engineers found that the search engine of Firefox was switched to using “ remote settings ” in the new release and that it relied on Indexed DB to function properly .
Firefox 78.0.1
Following its botched release of Firefox 78 , a newer version of the browser named Firefox 78.0.1 is now available to download on Mozilla 's website .
The latest version of Mozilla 's browser adds the Protections Dashboard which provides users with consolidated reports about tracking protection , data breaches and password management .
Users can now see if any of their saved passwords have been exposed in a data breach as well as track the number of breaches that have have been resolved right from the dashboard .
Firefox 78 also fixed an issue in which screen savers would interrupt WebRTC calls in the browser and this means that the new release will offer improved video calling .
At the same time , Mozilla has finally executed its plan to drop support for the legacy protocols TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 after putting it on hold back in March due to the pandemic .
Now when Firefox users visit a site that does n't support TLS 1.2 , they 'll see an error page
Firefox 78 is the last major release of the browser that includes support for macOS versions 10.9 , 10.10 and 10.11 .
The release also addresses seven high - severity security flaws , four medium - severity flaws , two low - severity flaws and a set of high - severity memory safety flaws .

There 's yet another new search engine on the block , but this time , it 's being ballyhooed as an actual challenger to Google .
Cuil.com ( pronounced " cool " ) made its public launch today and already calls itself the " biggest search engine on the web . "
Run by a team of former Google employees , the startup takes a slightly different approach to search than most of the big names , but whether it will be able to unseat Google — or even Yahoo — remains to be seen .
Right off the bat , the Cuil team makes a number of direct comparisons to Google , but often without actually naming the Big G .
For one , Cuil brags that it has already indexed 120 billion Web pages , roughly three times as many as Google and ten times as many as Microsoft .
" Rather than rely on superficial popularity metrics " like Google does , Cuil 's info page says that the site contextually analyzes each page and organizes search results based on content and relevance .
When you search for a particular keyword , Cuil attempts to group the results into relevant categories .
As you can see from my screenshot below , searching for " chinchilla " produces tabs for " all results , " " chinchilla food , " " chinchilla supplies , " and " chinchilla fur " across the top .
An " Explore by Category " box on the right - hand side of the results page offers a number of further associations ( in this case , related to the Australian town of Chinchilla in Queensland ) .
This is , of course , assuming you get any search results at all .
Among Cuil 's 120 billion web pages , we were n't able to get results for the large majority of our searches ; the search only worked with mostly generic terms .
Even searching for a very specific name ( " Ars Technica " ) , which should point to our URL , yielded nothing for several hours , although it did manage to spit out some search results at publication time .
When we were able to get results , they were oddly grouped in ways that did n't make a lot of sense to us .
Clearly , Cuil has a ways to go in optimizing its search pattern analysis to figure out exactly what it is that users are looking for and how to present it , although some of these burps can undoubtedly be attributed to opening day troubles .
Who needs search logs ?
Cuil also makes a pot shot at Google and other search engines when it comes to privacy issues .
" We believe that analyzing the Web rather than our users is a more useful approach , so we do n't collect data about you and your habits , lest we are tempted to peek .
With Cuil , your search history is always private , " says the company .
Indeed , Google has been in the spotlight lately due to the extensive user search logs it keeps , which are now being anonymized within 18 to 24 months thanks to pressure from privacy advocates .
The issue came up again recently when a judge ordered Google to turn over 12TB of YouTube search data to Viacom ( the two companies have since agreed that Google will anonymize the database before handing it over ) .
Even though Google has managed to stay mostly out of trouble so far by anonymizing its data , Cuil hopes to circumvent the entire privacy mess by not keeping logs at all .
With no search data in the first place , there 's nothing for privacy advocates to get worried about .
" The Web continues to grow at a fantastic rate and other search engines are unable to keep up with it , " Cuil CEO and cofounder Tom Costello said in a statement .
" Our significant breakthroughs in search technology have enabled us to index much more of the Internet , placing nearly the entire Web at the fingertips of every user . "
Though we agree that Cuil offers a unique perspective on search , it looks to be a long while before it can challenge the top players .
Human - powered search engine Mahalo launched just over a year ago and has certainly gained popularity since then , but it has yet to do anything to unseat Google or Yahoo .
We 'll continue to keep our eye on Cuil , but we still doubt that we 'll be seeing the next " Google Killer " anytime soon .
If novels and movies can provide philosophical commentary on the real world , there is surely no reason why a videogame can't do the same .
I would argue , in fact , that videogames are uniquely qualified to provide this sort of insight , requiring human interaction as they do .
I 've been playing LEGO Batman : The Videogame for two weeks now , and I just last night realized what messages it 's been sending me .
If you 've played any of the LEGO videogames , you know that one thing you absolutely must do on every level , in each game , is to go around looking for things to destroy .
Every level is chock full of things you have to bust open to get studs and find hearts , which are optional , but also things that you need to break to get LEGO pieces to build something , to solve a puzzle .
So there you are , playing Obi-Wan Kenobi or Indiana Jones or Batman , iconic good guys all , and you 're running around breaking things right and left .
If you pause to think about it , is n't it a little weird that , for instance , when you 're Indiana Jones in the library in Venice , you can run around vaporizing the tables , chairs , and even some of the books ( ! ) , without consequence or remorse , and without any other character caring ?
This really comes to a head in the Batman game , because for the first time there are villain levels as well as hero levels .
After completing a " chapter " as Batman and Robin , you can switch from the Batcave to Arkham Asylum and play the corresponding villain chapter .
Just as actors say it 's fun to play the heavy , because you get to be evil without actually hurting anyone , it 's a heck of a lot of fun to play the Joker and shoot the LEGO policemen , and lock up Commissioner Gordon , because they 're virtual LEGO policemen after all .
What struck me last night was that there 's essentially no difference at all between the heroes and the villains .
The tools are subtlely different , but the actions are for all intents and purposes identical .
What difference , really , is there between when I play Joker and Scarecrow busting up the art museum and shooting down the guards and when I play Batman and Robin busting up the streets of Gotham City so they can get into Killer Moth 's hideout ?
If anything , the only difference is that it actually makes sense for the villains to be destroying things left and right .
Batman 's supposed to be the good guy , and yet he gets closer to the game 's " Superhero " status by doing exactly the same things Joker , for instance , does to get closer to " Supervillian " status .
I know there have been videogames before that have delved into the meanings of good and evil , and I 've played some of them .
But , until now , all the ones I 've seen have been upfront about their message : Black & White and Star Wars : Jedi Knight , to name two .
I expected to find only a heck of a lot of fun in the LEGO videogames , so the message came as a bit of a surprise .
Next , I think I need to figure out what the message of Mario Kart Wii is .
Leading conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer pretty much threw in the white flag this morning .
He did a little slash and burn first , trying to mislead his readers into thinking that Obama has only been working at the federal level for 19 months – cute , but a lie – but still , even Krauthammer had to then concede that Obama is probably going to win .
Now , do n’t get your hopes too high – we can still lose this .
But the fact that people like Krauthammer are already publicly lamenting McCain ’s loss , one month before the election , is a very good sign .
It means Republicans are pretty much convinced it ’s over .
And that ’s golden .
Introduction
Python has begun soaring in popularity in recent years , and part of the reason is that the language is very flexible , yet incredibly powerful .
Python can be used for systems administration , Web development , GUI programming , scientific computing , and more .
The main aim of this article is to introduce people who are used to scripting procedural code in Bash , PHP , or some other language , and to assist them in moving into object - oriented Python developing .
This rising popularity of Python means that developers currently using other programming languages might be called upon to do some of their projects in Python , in addition to their favorite language .
Procedural programming certainly has its place , and it can be a highly effective way to solve a problem .
On a very basic level , procedural programmming can be defined as a list of instructions , and Bash and PHP often are written in such a manner .
Because of Python ’s popularity , though , PHP and Bash scripters who are Web developers or systems administrators are getting thrown into situations in which they have to learn both object - oriented programming and Python at the same time .
If you have n’t heard of functional programming before , I would highly recommend reading some of the articles on functional programming in resourceson the right .
Briefly , though , functional programming can be described as “ passing functions around . ”
Often functional programming can be a more succinct and clear way to express an idea than object - orientated programming .
Object - oriented can be a lot to digest at once , so this article takes on procedural Bash and PHP scripts , and first converts them to procedural Python .
As a final step , they get converted into the end goal of object - oriented Python .
The article concludes by touching on a few advantages of object - oriented Python , and then finally with some disadvantages in which either procedural or functional programming might be a better fit .
By the end of this article , Bash or PHP programmers should be able to jump into object - oriented Python projects without fear .
Writing a disk - monitoring function in PHP and Bash
While PHP is mostly meant to be run inside a browser , it can also perform system calls by way of the exec function .
The first example , written in PHP , will capture the output of the shell command “ df -h , ” place the output into an array , and then examine each line of output against a regular expression .
If the line matches the regular expression , then you print out that line .
If you want to run this example from home , you will only need to call this script index.php and place it in the served - out directory of an Apache / mod_php server .
PHP disk - monitoring example
< html > < body > <? php // Analyzes disk usage // Takes regex pattern and message function disk_space ( $ pattern= " / 2[0‑9 ] % / " , $ message = " CAPACITY WARNING : " ) { exec( escapeshellcmd ( " df ‑h " ) , $ output_lines , $return_value ) ; foreach ( $ output_lines as $ output ) { if ( preg_match ( $ pattern , $ output ) ) echo " < b> $ message < / b > $ output < br /> " ; } } disk_space ( ) ?> </ body > </html >

If you run this Web page in a browser , you get the following results :
CAPACITY WARNING : /dev/sda1 3.8G 694M 2.9G 20 % / Show more
Show more icon
Looking at the code , you can see that the regular expression pattern was set to match a line that contained 20 - 29 % .
This could be modified easily to fit some other flag , such as 90 - 99 % , as 20 % is a very low disk capacity .
Next let ’s look at doing this in a Bash function .
In Bash , the problem is much easier to solve because you are really processing system calls .
In this example , you do n’t even need to use an array or a regular expression library , because a pipe to grep is much easier .
Setting default parameters for functions in Bash are always a bit verbose , though .
Bash disk - monitoring example
#!/usr /bin/env bash # function flags disk usage takes pattern and message optionally function disk_space ( ) { #checks for pattern parameter if [ " $ 1 " != " " ] ; then pattern= $ 1 else pattern = " 2[ 0‑9 ] % " fi #checks for message parameter if [ " $ 2 " != " " ] ; then message = $ 2 else message = " CAPACITY WARNING : " fi #looks at output for pattern to flag output_lines=df ‑h | grep $ pattern if [ " $output_lines " != " " ] ; then echo $ message $ output_lines fi } #example of optional parameters usage # disk_space 9[ 0‑9 ] % ALERT : disk_space Show more

When you run this script , you get the same output , so you can skip showing it .
What you can correlate from the PHP version of the script and Bash version is that this procedural code does in fact run like a set of instructions .
It is almost as if the computer is a small child , and you are telling the child how to do something like tie his shoes for the first time .
Before you get into thinking in the “ Object - Oriented Paradigm ” in Python , let ’s look at making a procedural version of this same function in Python .
Python disk - monitoring example
from subprocess import Popen , PIPE import re def disk_space ( pattern = " 2[ 0‑9 ] % " , message = " CAPACITY WARNING : " ) : # takes shell command output ps = Popen ( " df ‑h " , shell = True , stdout=PIPE , stderr=PIPE ) output_lines = ps.stdout.readlines ( ) for line in output_lines : line = line.strip ( ) if re.search ( pattern , line ) : print " %s %s " % ( message , line ) disk_space ( )

Looking over the procedural Python version of our code , it quite similar to both the Bash and PHP versions .
With Python , the subprocess module handles making the system call to the shell command , and puts it into a list , called in array in Bash or PHP .
Much like the PHP version , I then iterate over the items in the list that are lines of the standard out of the command .
I look for a regular expression that makes the pattern I am looking for , and then print the line of the disk report with a special message that gets injected .
This is a classic example of how a top - down scripting problem can be solved , but in the next section you change your approach completely and think in terms of objects .
From procedural to object - oriented Python
Procedural programming is often the most natural style of programming for a beginning developer , and it is also highly effective for many problems .
On the other hand , object - oriented programming can be a very useful way to create abstraction , and thus resuable code .
Often procedural code can show cracks in its foundation when a project approaches a certain level of complexity , though .
Let ’s jump right into an object - oriented version of the last example and see how that changes things .
Object - oriented Python disk - monitoring script
#!/usr/bin/env python from subprocess import Popen , PIPE import re class DiskMonitor ( ) : " " " Disk Monitoring Class " " " def init ( self , pattern = " 2 [ 0 - 9 ] % " , message = " CAPACITY WARNING " , cmd = " df - h " ) : self .
pattern = pattern self .
message = message self.cmd = cmd def diskspace ( self ) : " " " Disk space capacity flag method " " " ps = Popen( self.cmd , shell =True , stdout=PIPE , stderr=PIPE ) outputlines = ps.stdout.readlines ( ) for line in outputlines : line = line.strip ( ) if re.search(self.pattern , line ) : print " %s %s " % ( self.message , line ) if _name == " __main " : d = DiskMonitor ( ) d.disk_space ( )

In looking at the object - oriented version of the code , you can see that the code becomes more abstract .
Sometimes too much abstraction can lead to design problems , but in this case it allows you to separate the problem into more reusable pieces .
The DiskMonitor class has an init method where you define your new parameters , and the disk_space function is now a method inside of the class .
With this new style , you can easily reuse and customize things without changing the original code , as is often necessary with procedural code .
One of the more powerful , and also overused , aspects of object - oriented design is inheritance .
Inheritance allows you to reuse and customize existing code inside a new class .
Let ’s see what that might look like in this next example .
Object - oriented Python disk - monitoring script using inheritance
#!/usr/bin/env python from subprocess import Popen , PIPE import re class DiskMonitor ( ) : " " " Disk Monitoring Class " " " def init ( self , pattern = " 2 [ 0 - 9 ] % " , message = " CAPACITY WARNING " , cmd = " df - h " ) : self .
pattern = pattern self .
message = message self.cmd = cmd def diskspace ( self ) : " " " Disk space capacity flag method " " " ps = Popen( self.cmd , shell =True , stdout=PIPE , stderr=PIPE ) outputlines = ps.stdout.readlines ( ) for line in outputlines : line = line.strip ( ) if re.search(self.pattern , line ) : print " %s %s " % ( self.message , line ) class MyDiskMonitor ( DiskMonitor ) : " " " Customized Disk Monitoring Class " " " def diskspace ( self ) : ps = Popen( self.cmd , shell =True , stdout=PIPE , stderr=PIPE ) print " RAW DISK REPORT : " print ps.stdout.read( ) if __name == " __main " : d = MyDiskMonitor ( ) d.disk_space ( )
Show more
Show more icon
If you run this version of the script that uses inheritance , you get the following output :
RAW DISK REPORT : Filesystem Size Used Avail Use % Mounted on / dev/sda1 3.8G 694M 2.9G 20 % / varrun 252M 48 K 252M 1 % / var / run varlock 252M 0 252M 0 % / var / lock udev 252M 52 K 252M 1 % /dev devshm 252M 0 252M 0 % /dev/shm
Show more

This output is very different from the previous — flagged — version , because it is just the unfiltered results of df -h with a print statement injected at the top .
You were able to change the intent of the disk_space method completely by overriding the method in the MyDiskMonitor class .
The Python magic that allowed you to reuse the attributes from the other class were this “ MyDiskMonitor ( DiskMonitor ) . ”
You only needed to place the name of the previous class inside of paranethesis when you defined the name of the new class .
As soon as that happens , you instantly gain access to the other classes attributes to do with as you wish .
The fun does n’t stop there , either .
You could further customize the new class by adding another method , perhaps called disk_alert ( self ) , which would e-mail flagged messages .
This is the beauty of object - oriented design ; it allows experienced developers to constantly reuse code they have written , and save themselves quite a bit of time .
There ’s a simple answer to the problem of overuse of inheritance :
Think about whether the problem can be refactored as “ A contains B ” ( a.b ) rather than “ A is a subclass of B ” ( A ( B ) ) .
If so , the ‘ contains ’ approach is almost always better .
There is a dark side to object - oriented programming , as well , unfortunately .
All of this abstraction comes at a cost of complexity , and if abstraction is taken far enough , it can get downright ugly .
Because Python supports multiple inheritance , abstraction can be taken to a level of complexity that is quite unhealthy .
Can you imagine having to look at several files to just write one method ?
Believe it or not , this does happen , and it represents the unfortunate reality of one side of object - oriented programming .
One alternate to object - oriented programming is functional programming , and Python offers resources to program in a functional style , as well as object oriented and procedural .
In the final example , let ’s take a look out how to write our now tiresome disk - monitoring code in a functional style .
Functional - style Python disk - monitoring script
from subprocess import Popen , PIPE import re def disk_space ( pattern = " 2 [ 0 - 9 ] % " , message = " CAPACITY WARNING : " ) : # Generator Pipeline To Search For Critical Items ps = Popen ( " df - h " , shell = True , stdout=PIPE , stderr=PIPE ) outline = ( line.split ( ) for line in ps.stdout ) flag = ( " " . join ( row ) for row in outline if re.search ( pattern , row [ - 2 ] ) ) for line in flag : print " %s %s " % ( message , line ) disk_space ( )
Show more

If you look at this last example , it is much different from anything else you have seen in this article .
If you walk through the code line by line , you can first start with something you have seen before in “ ps ” variable .
The next two lines of code - use generator expressions to handle the file object ps.stdout and to parse it and search it for the lines you are looking for .
If you cut and pasted these lines of code into an interactive Python shell , you would see that outline and flag are both generator objects if you printed them .
Generator objects come with a next method attached to them , and as such , allow you “ pipeline ” actions together .
The outline line strips the newline character from one row , and then passes that one row down to the next generator expression , which searches for a regular expression match , in each row , one at a time , and then passes the output to flag .
This type of compact workflow can be an alternative to the object - oriented programming style , and it is quite interesting .
There are drawbacks to this style as well , though , as the conciseness of the code can lead to errors that are difficult to debug unless each line of code is executed independantly .
Functional programming also stretchs the brain , as it makes you think of solving problems by chaining solutions together .
This is quite different from either procedural or object - oriented styles .
Summary
This article was somewhat experimental , as it went from Bash and PHP , to procedural , object - oriented , and finally functional Python using the same basic code .
I hope it illustrated that Python is a very flexible and powerful language that developers in other programming languages can also learn to appreciate .
As Python continues to grow in popularity , it will become more important for other developers to learn about in addition to their language of choice .
Two of the largest recent growth areas of Python are Web development and systems administration .
In terms of Web development , developers in PHP may soon have to make weekly choices about which project makes more sense in Python , and which project makes more sense in PHP .
For systems administrators , Bash and Perl scripters , are often being asked to look at doing some of their projects in Python .
Partly this is out of choice , and partly because many vendors are offering Python API ’s for their products .
Having a bit of Python in your toolkit can never hurt anyone .
VIENNA ( Reuters ) - North Korea has expelled U.N. monitors from its plutonium - making nuclear plant and plans to start reactivating it next week , rowing back from a 2007 deal to scrap its atomic bomb program , officials said on Wednesday .
North Koreans participate in celebrations for the 60th anniversary of the founding of North Korea in Pyongyang , September 9 , 2008 , in this picture distributed by North Korea 's official news agency KCNA .

The reclusive Stalinist state said on Friday it was working to restart the Yongbyon atomic complex it had been dismantling since last November under a disarmament - for - aid agreement with five powers that has derailed in disputes over implementation .
Olli Heinonen , the International Atomic Energy Agency ’s head of non-proliferation safeguards , told an IAEA board of governors meeting that monitors verifying North Korea ’s denuclearization were forced to leave the plutonium plant this week .
“ There are no more seals and surveillance equipment in place at the ( plutonium ) reprocessing facility , ” IAEA spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said , referring to the most proliferation - sensitive installation at Yongbyon .
“ ( North Korea ) further stated that from here on , IAEA inspectors will have no further access to the reprocessing plant , ” she said , summarizing Heinonen ’s remarks .
“ ( North Korea ) also informed IAEA inspectors that they plan to introduce nuclear material to the reprocessing plant in one week ’s time , ” Fleming said outside the Vienna meeting .
Nuclear analysts have said North Korea would need several months at least to bring the installation back on line since it had been largely taken apart over the past year .
Confronted with the apparent unraveling of a rare foreign policy achievement by the Bush administration , U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said North Korea ’s actions had “ by no means ” killed off the country ’s nuclear disarmament .
“ Everyone knows what the path ahead is ... an agreement on a verification protocol so that we can continue along the path of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula , ” she told reporters outside the U.N. General Assembly in New York .
“ The North Koreans know that and so we will continue working with our partners on what steps we might need to take . ”
Rice said she had already had consultations with her South Korean and Chinese counterparts and would soon meet the Russian and Japanese foreign ministers .
South Korean Prime Minister Han Seung - soo said the situation was “ very unfortunate ” and reminded him of 1993 , when North Korea balked at verification of its nuclear programs and withdrew from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty .
“ Although we are at an impasse , I ’m sure that China , together with the other partners , will be able to solve this problem eventually , ” he told the Asia Society think tank in New York .
Diplomats close to the IAEA said the three monitors ousted from positions at the plutonium facility were still observing other parts of the Soviet - designed Yongbyon complex .
They said the monitors were forced to remove about 100 seals and 20 - 25 cameras from the plutonium facility .
North Korea has said steps are under way to restore Yongbyon to its “ original state ” -- reneging on a February 2007 accord with five powers to scrap its bomb program to emerge from diplomatic isolation and obtain major trade and energy benefits .
DEAL RUNS AGROUND
Last month , North Korea said it planned to restart Yongbyon because it was angry at Washington for not taking it off its terrorism blacklist .
In early September , it made minor but initial moves to restart the plant , U.S. officials said .
Washington says it will de-list Pyongyang once it allows inspectors to verify claims it made about nuclear arms output .
North Korea is demanding a more flexible verification mechanism , regional analysts said .
“ What North Korea has done is troubling , ” said Gregory Schulte , U.S. ambassador to the IAEA .
“ North Korea has a decision it needs to make .
Is it going to continue to move forward and fulfill the commitment it made to abandon its nuclear weapons , or does it really prefer to go back to its past of isolation ? ” he told reporters .
Before Yongbyon ’s shutdown , U.S. officials estimated North Korea had produced about 110 pounds ( 50 kg ) of plutonium , which experts said would be enough for six to eight nuclear weapons .
“ The ( IAEA ) board expressed the view that a successfully negotiated settlement of this long - standing issue , maintaining the essential verification and monitoring role of the IAEA , would be important for international peace and security , ” said a chairman ’s summary of the governors ’ deliberations in Vienna .
North Korea readmitted IAEA non-proliferation monitors in mid-2007 to verify its dismantling of Yongbyon , four years after expelling U.N. watchdog personnel after U.S. accusations that it had a secret uranium - enrichment program .
In 2005 , North Korea said for the first time it had nuclear arms capability and in 2006 tested a plutonium nuclear device .
Yongbyon consisted of a 5 - megawatt reactor , a fuel fabrication facility and a plutonium reprocessing plant , where weapons - grade material could be extracted from spent fuel rods .
Well , this is terrible .
Edward Davidson , the " Spam King " who was sentenced to 21 months in jail and ordered to pay $ 714,139 in restitution to the IRS for spamming and tax evasion , escaped from prison with the aid of his wife only to then turn a gun on her , his 3 - year old daughter , a teenage girl and finally himself .

He and his family drove off from a minimum security prison ( Driving out of prison ?
Yeah , that security sounds pretty minimal ) .
He went for some cash and a change of clothes .
Then things got ugly .
A teenage girl was shot in the neck and a baby was found unhurt in a car seat inside the vehicle where the three bodies were found , Arapahoe County undersheriff Mark Campbell said .
The relationship between the girl , baby and the escaped convict was n't immediately clear .
The bodies of " Spam King " Edward " Eddie " Davidson , his wife , and 3 - year - old daughter were found in an SUV parked in a farmhouse driveway in a rural part of Bennett , about 25 miles east of Denver .
Authorities said Davidson was the apparent gunman .

At least he left the baby alone .
But really , stories do n't get much worse than this .
As if you needed a reason to hate spammers any more .

I think it 's time to let all of our readers know that my blogs may be taking on a slightly different character in the coming months , as I have decided to have a baby – a decision that undoubtedly will affect every area of my life .
I have wanted to have a baby for the past five years , but I knew that my life ( and my child 's ) would be easier if I waited until I finished school and got settled into a career .
Of course , I always imagined that I would have my first baby after being married and that having a family would be more of a partnership than a solo venture .
But as we all know , life rarely goes as expected .
So I 've decided to pursue my dream despite the fact that there 's no sign of marriage in my immediate – or perhaps even distant – future .
Naturally , taking care of a baby is a chore on its own , but getting pregnant is my present challenge .
In less than two weeks , I will be ovulating , which as everyone should know is primetime for baby making .
The problem is that I do n't yet have a partner for this process .
Now , I 'm not looking for a source of child support or a baby - daddy in the sense that he should have any supportive role in the pregnancy or in raising the child , I just need some good , hearty seed .
Now , my first thought was to go to a sperm bank because it does n't get much more NSA than that , but I had to reject this idea .
First , pay for semen ?
Really ??
That notion goes into the same bucket as paying for air or sunshine or , well , sex .
Second , as a scientist , I 'm trained to cringe at the thought of biological samples going through any freeze - thaw process , and I 'm not too keen on the potential for my first baby to have two heads or one too many sex chromosomes .
My second thought was to go to a friend .
What better place to create life than with someone I know and trust , right ?
The obvious problem with this idea is that I would ultimately have to defriend my donor – and not just on Facebook – for all of the obvious reasons .
Since I have successfully dated two people through this blog network I am turning to it again for assistance in this effort .
The network has agreed to help financially with the baby but I am turning to the readers / commenters for my donator .
The nail in the coffin was the latest example of using the internet as an efficient means for a solution – whether it ’s paying college tuition or finding the right donor .
So now readers … chime in .

We usually eat watermelon simply cut into triangles .
But fried watermelon ?
Believe it or not , it works and it tastes delicious !
It may not be a healthy thirst - quencher , but it is a unique delicacy .
Frying watermelon utilizes the same technique as frying many other types of food .
First , the watermelon is dipped into a light batter , then placed in hot oil , and then topped with powdered sugar as a finishing touch .
This recipe calls for cutting the watermelon flesh into pieces , but if you 'd like it to resemble a carnival snack you can cut into triangles and insert a stick through the rind before coating and frying .
Like most fried foods , this is best served immediately while warm and crisp .

Read On To Discover How You Can Become
a Respectable Bluesman Faster Than
You Thought Possible ...
If you ever had that spark of inspiration when you listened to Stevie Ray Vaughan , B.B. King , or Clapton and you wanted to play like them ... then this is what you 've been looking for .
I 'll never forget the summer of 1990 .
I had just bought my first instrument -- a white B.C Rich ( not a great axe , but I was a happy clam because I had a guitar ! )
One sunny day , I was driving my grey , beat - up , 1980 Chevy , ( which did n't even have a cassette deck ) .
LOL ...
And then ... " The Thrill is Gone " by B.B. King started playing on the radio .
I 'll never forget the feeling .
I thought " man this is cool sh*t " ...
I squinted my eyes and started shaking my head , and absorbed what B.B. was sharing with me .
I probably looked like a weirdo driving around town , but I did n't care .
This felt like the music my soul had been looking for it 's entirely life .
So I had a new mission ... a new obsession ... to become a " blues man " .
I did everything I was " supposed " to do : I took lessons , and I faithfully practiced every day .
I was also spending $ 50 a week with guitar teachers ,
and they were doing their best to help me , but I was
only getting little bits of pieces of the puzzle .
I had a subscription to Guitar Player magazine .
I read all the articles and followed all the lessons ( especially the blues lessons ) , but something was still missing .
Although the passion never faded , it just felt like my improvements were slower than a drunk turtle .
Fast forward a few years .
I was now in college .
I was talking to another guitarist .
When he asked me what style I played , I hesitantly said " blues " .
I worried he 'd ask me to play something .
Even though I desperately wanted to be playing the blues , I really was n't that good and hardly knew any blues songs .
I just did n't know how to get better .
And I did n't know where to get the
answers I was looking for .
The reality is that none of the things I was learning from : the teachers , the guitar articles , etc ... gave me a complete system .
Fortunately , because I have a very obsessive personality , I did n't give up .
I just kept learning and learning and practicing , year after year .
Eventually all of that learning and experience ripened and you know what ?
It turns out the blues is actually simple !
It just took a long time to weed through all of the extraneous information and distractions and get to the heart of the matter .
I started putting together the puzzle pieces .
Brick by brick it came together .
The beautiful thing is , there 's only a handful of KEYS you need to have .
And it's my life 's mission to share these keys with guitarists like you .
That 's why I created " How To Play Smokin ' Blues " .
It 's a step - by - step blues guitar system that
takes all the pain out of the journey and
makes it simple , easy and fun .
Boy , I wish I had something like " How to Play Smokin Blues " when I was first was getting started .
It probably would have saved me about 10 years of doing the dance of delusion in the land of confusion .
My goal when I created this course is simple : create the most complete zero to hero blues course of all time .
So I spent months planning it .
Went into the studios with my pro filming crew and we filmed a new instructional video series called " How to Play Smokin ' Blues " .
It 's 3 DVDs of no - fluff stuff that 's going to give you EVERY critical guitar technique a bluesman will ever need .
You 'll quickly start playing smokin ' blues guitar in just a few days .
Most importantly ...
I 'm going to show you
simple versions of legendary blues songs .
The best part is that everything is tabbed out for you so it 's very easy to follow along and play all these cool licks and riffs on your guitar .
The easy explanations on DVD plus the tabs make it simple .

GRANTS PASS --
An Oregon man playing in the yard with his toddler sons captured a 6 - foot - long lizard capable of killing pets and injuring humans .
Ryan Nelson said he thought it was a crocodile when he first spotted the Nile monitor by the rose bushes .
He was able to capture it and wrestle it into a large metal dog cage with the help of Dalton Brown from MB Reptiles , a pet store in Grants Pass .
No report on missing lizards has been filed recently with either the Josephine County sheriff 's office or Grants Pass police .
But officials say whoever lost the lizard should have immediately reported it because the Nile monitor 's teeth and claws make it dangerous to pets and people .
The lizard is now on display at the pet store .

Rocker Sammy Hagar , who wrote the song I Can't Drive 55 , helps change a sign in 1995 after the maximum speed limit was raised to 65 mph on Highway 101 in Northern California .
POSTED SPEEDS ACROSS THE USA IN MPH POSTED SPEEDS ACROSS THE USA IN MPH Congress repealed the National Maximum Speed Limit in 1995 .
As of today , 32 states have raised speed limits to 70 mph or higher on some portion of their roadway systems .

Though it lasted longer than disco and leisure suits , the national 55 - miles - per - hour speed limit was another remnant of the 1970s that did not endure .
Yet with high fuel costs reviving memories of the energy crisis of that decade , proposals to bring back the " double nickel " or something like it are emerging , with backers saying federal speed limits could save fuel , money and perhaps lives .
" The faster you go , the more you waste , " says Tim Castleman , a Sacramento man who is promoting a Drive 55 campaign .
Until gasoline approached $ 4 a gallon , Castleman did n't find a lot of support for reinstating the 55 - mph limit that Congress abolished in 1995 after more than 20 years .
" It was a terribly unpopular law , " acknowledges Castleman , who maintains a website , www.drive55.org.
Indeed , reinstating the national 55 - miles - per - hour limit , or 60 mph as some suggest , would seem a tough sell after the first experiment proved about as successful as Prohibition .
Opponents such as Jim Baxter , head of the National Motorists Association , a Wisconsin group , argue any fuel savings would be tiny and that higher limits have n't made highways less safe .
" People have to be willing to comply with it , " he says .
" And they were n't . "
New action in Congress Proposed by President Nixon and enacted in January 1974 , the nationwide speed limit was described as a temporary emergency response to oil shortages and was to expire in mid-1975 .
But Congress soon made it permanent , and the 55 - mph limit immediately became part of the national culture .
Auto speedometers highlighted the 55 - mph limit , police radar detection devices became popular , and rocker Sammy Hagar had a 1984 hit record that complained , I Ca n't Drive 55 .
States that had allowed speeds 75 mph or higher were compelled to go along because of the threat of losing federal money for highway construction .
But in the face of resistance , Congress in 1987 relaxed the law to permit 65 mph on rural interstate highways .
In 1995 , Congress lifted the federal limit entirely .
Baxter says most states have maximum limits of 65 or 70 mph .
Some Western states have higher limits .
Sen. John Warner , R - Va. , introduced a bill last month that orders a study to determine the effects of a national 60 - mph speed limit .
Warner says the 55 limit reduced fuel use by 167,000 barrels a day , or 2 % of highway consumption , citing a Congressional Research Service report .
With far more vehicles , fuel savings is likely to be far greater now , he says .
Rep. Jackie Speier , D - Calif. , has proposed a 60 - mph limit in urban areas and 65 - mph elsewhere .
" There is no need for OPEC or the oil companies to help us out , " Speier says .
" Every driver can affect change simply by easing up on their right foot . "
Both point to findings by the Environmental Protection Agency that fuel efficiency decreases above 60 mph .
Speier says 11 other House Democrats , most of them from California , are co-sponsoring her bill .
And she claims support from environmental groups and the American Trucking Associations .
Few other politicians have been eager to climb aboard , Baxter says .
He notes that Warner is leaving office at the end of this year and that Speier represents a San Francisco and San Mateo district where voters may be less tied to their autos than elsewhere in the country .
" The public is n't real excited about going back to a 55 - mph national speed limit , " Baxter says .
Traffic fatalities on decline Baxter says the savings potential is overstated because most driving is done on streets and roads where lower limits are in effect .
Only 2 % of the nation 's roughly 4 million miles of roadways have limits above 55 mph now , he says .
While up to one - third of daily traffic volume is on interstate highways , Baxter says , congestion often limits speeds anyway .
" All we would do by establishing another national speed limit is we would generate a lot of tickets , a lot of insurance surcharges , and give a little boost to the radar - detector industry , " Baxter says .
" There would be no change in fuel pricing . "
Warner says safety is a reason to lower speeds too .
He points to a National Academy of Sciences finding that the law " saved up to 4,000 lives per year from highway accidents . "
Disputing that , opponents point to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 's figures that show the rates of traffic fatalities and injuries have been declining for more than a decade .
The fatality rate in 2007 was 1.37 per 100 million vehicle miles traveled , compared with 1.69 in 1996 .
Castleman , 50 , a retired heating and air conditioning contractor , acknowledges his cause is a long shot .
" We 've been calling on people to do it for themselves , do it voluntarily , do it for the country , do it to stop climate change , do it to save money , do it to make our roads safer , " he says .

Saving the environment has never been so cool ; fashion designers made “ organic , green ” grocery bags that will cost you just as much as your monthly food bill would be .
Organic fashions are simple , eco friendly , and will make your bank cry .
If you ’ve went food shopping with only buying organic in mind , you probably were a bit surprised when your bill was double what you normally pay , right ?
For the average person , affording these things is n’t realistic .
Sure it might be nice to sport the coolest , greenest hybrid car on the market , but the truth is right now they are still pricey , and we still need to be able to get around .
I ’m going to give you ten ways to green your life , without spending a ton of money
1 . Turn off your lights dude .
You want to be green , but how many times have you fallen asleep with the TV on ?
How many nights go by that your computer buzzes away even though no one ’s checking their email ?
Before you leave the house , and before you hit the sack make sure your appliances and lights are OFF .
You ’ll be saving money on your bill , and preserving some energy .
2. DON ’T buy in bulk .
Cosco , BJ’s , Sams Club ; these chains cater to large families who need 27 invididually wrapped candy bars , not just one .
We understand the concept of buying in bulk , but think of all the waste that goes into making these products ?
If you can , avoid shopping there .
If you feel like you ca n’t live without a thirty pack of chocolate milk , figure out a way to recycle the material .
3. BUY LOCAL !
You may think there ’s no one selling local produce in your area , but websites like Local Harvest use a search engine to find farmers markets , and farms in your community that are selling the good stuff .
Who would n’t want to buy CHEAP , fresh organic produce ?
A tip : hit up the markets towards the ends , and sellers will lower the prices of their good signicantly since they can’t re-sell them .
I ’ve gotten homemade organic pies , vegges , and fruits all for under ten dollars by going an hour before the vendors closed up !
4. Direct Deposit and Automatic bill pay – does anyone actually pay their bills by mail anymore ?
If you do , stop .
You ’ll be saving a ton of trees by paying your bills online ; almost every credit card , bank , and store offer free , safe ways to deposit money online and it ’s easy as pie .
5 . Eat at home , and compost while you ’re at it .
Eating out ( especially at fast food joints ) = tons of waste .
6 . Get thrifty !
You do n’t need to buy fancy organic materials to be more “ green … ”
You ’d be surprised at how much cool stuff you can find at your local Salvation Army , or even on Craigslist .
One mans junk is another mans treasure , and you can find some amazing things to call your own , without breaking a budget .
7 . Turn the heat down !
Winter ’s coming , and we all want to be toasty and warm , but we can acheive this buy throwing on another layer , NOT turning up the heat .
8 . Get a water filter :
Most of us love a cold bottle of water … but think about the waste !
You can have clean , fresh water by getting a filter , and purchasing an eco friendly water bottle to carry arouind .
9. Reusable coffee filters .
Have you ever run out of coffee filters and felt like life was over ?
I have .
Purchasing a resuable filter will save you sanity , and help you live a bit more “ green … ”
10 . Nix the paper towells .
I ’ve got a toddler , two dogs , and two cats so paper towells were always a must in our home , and we ’d go through five rolls in a week .
When I realized ( gulp ) how much waste that was I felt a little sick , so now I collect old clothes , dishtowels , etc and use them as washclothes that I can wash when I ’m done !
Most of these are probably in your face obvious , but many of us choose not to change .
If you can try and green your life in any of these ways , you ’re making a small but important step .
Being eco-concious is n’t a trend , it ’s a way of life .
Share with us other ways you “ green ” yourself !

Insight on what the fall of financials means for fixed income , with Mohamed El - Erian , PIMCO co-CEO
Sept. 11 , 2008  --
The following excerpts are from the ABC News exclusive interview with Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in Fairbanks , Alaska , conducted by " World News " anchor Charlie Gibson on September 11 , 2008
Sarah Palin on Experience :
GIBSON : Governor , let me start by asking you a question that I asked John McCain about you , and it is really the central question .
Can you look the country in the eye and say " I have the experience and I have the ability to be not just vice president , but perhaps president of the United States of America ? "
PALIN : I do , Charlie , and on January 20 , when John McCain and I are sworn in , if we are so privileged to be elected to serve this country , will be ready .
I 'm ready .
GIBSON : And you did n't say to yourself , " Am I experienced enough ?
Am I ready ?
Do I know enough about international affairs ?
Do I -- will I feel comfortable enough on the national stage to do this ? "
PALIN : I did n't hesitate , no .
GIBSON : Did n't that take some hubris ?
PALIN : I -- I answered him yes because I have the confidence in that readiness and knowing that you can't blink , you have to be wired in a way of being so committed to the mission , the mission that we 're on , reform of this country and victory in the war , you can't blink .
So I did n't blink then even when asked to run as his running mate .
GIBSON : But this is not just reforming a government .
This is also running a government on the huge international stage in a very dangerous world .
When I asked John McCain about your national security credentials , he cited the fact that you have commanded the Alaskan National Guard and that Alaska is close to Russia .
Are those sufficient credentials ?
PALIN : But it is about reform of government and it's about putting government back on the side of the people , and that has much to do with foreign policy and national security issues
Let me speak specifically about a credential that I do bring to this table , Charlie , and that 's with the energy independence that I 've been working on for these years as the governor of this state that produces nearly 20 percent of the U.S. domestic supply of energy , that I worked on as chairman of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission , overseeing the oil and gas development in our state to produce more for the United States .
GIBSON : I know .
I 'm just saying that national security is a whole lot more than energy .
PALIN : It is , but I want you to not lose sight of the fact that energy is a foundation of national security .
It 's that important .
It 's that significant .
GIBSON : Did you ever travel outside the country prior to your trip to Kuwait and Germany last year ?
PALIN : Canada , Mexico , and then , yes , that trip , that was the trip of a lifetime to visit our troops in Kuwait and stop and visit our injured soldiers in Germany .
That was the trip of a lifetime and it changed my life .
GIBSON : Have you ever met a foreign head of state ?
PALIN : There in the state of Alaska , our international trade activities bring in many leaders of other countries .
GIBSON : And all governors deal with trade delegations .
PALIN : Right .
GIBSON : Who act at the behest of their governments .
PALIN : Right , right .
GIBSON : I 'm talking about somebody who 's a head of state , who can negotiate for that country .
Ever met one ?
PALIN : I have not and I think if you go back in history and if you ask that question of many vice presidents , they may have the same answer that I just gave you .
But , Charlie , again , we 've got to remember what the desire is in this nation at this time .
It is for no more politics as usual and somebody 's big , fat resume maybe that shows decades and decades in that Washington establishment , where , yes , they 've had opportunities to meet heads of state ... these last couple of weeks ... it has been overwhelming to me that confirmation of the message that Americans are getting sick and tired of that self - dealing and kind of that closed door , good old boy network that has been the Washington elite .
Sarah Palin on God :
GIBSON : You said recently , in your old church , " Our national leaders are sending U.S. soldiers on a task that is from God . "
Are we fighting a holy war ?
PALIN : You know , I do n't know if that was my exact quote .
GIBSON : Exact words .
PALIN : But the reference there is a repeat of Abraham Lincoln 's words when he said -- first , he suggested never presume to know what God 's will is , and I would never presume to know God 's will or to speak God 's words .
But what Abraham Lincoln had said , and that 's a repeat in my comments , was let us not pray that God is on our side in a war or any other time , but let us pray that we are on God 's side .
That 's what that comment was all about , Charlie .
And I do believe , though , that this war against extreme Islamic terrorists is the right thing .
It 's an unfortunate thing , because war is hell and I hate war , and , Charlie , today is the day that I send my first born , my son , my teenage son overseas with his Stryker brigade , 4,000 other wonderful American men and women , to fight for our country , for democracy , for our freedoms .
Charlie , those are freedoms that too many of us just take for granted .
I hate war and I want to see war ended .
We end war when we see victory , and we do see victory in sight in Iraq .
GIBSON : I take your point about Lincoln 's words , but you went on and said , " There is a plan and it is God 's plan . "
PALIN : I believe that there is a plan for this world and that plan for this world is for good .
I believe that there is great hope and great potential for every country to be able to live and be protected with inalienable rights that I believe are God - given , Charlie , and I believe that those are the rights to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
That , in my world view , is a grand -- the grand plan .
GIBSON : But then are you sending your son on a task that is from God ?
PALIN : I do n't know if the task is from God , Charlie .
What I know is that my son has made a decision .
I am so proud of his independent and strong decision he has made , what he decided to do and serving for the right reasons and serving something greater than himself and not choosing a real easy path where he could be more comfortable and certainly safer .
Sarah Palin on National Security :
GIBSON : Let me ask you about some specific national security situations .
PALIN : Sure .
GIBSON : Let 's start , because we are near Russia , let 's start with Russia and Georgia .
The administration has said we 've got to maintain the territorial integrity of Georgia .
Do you believe the United States should try to restore Georgian sovereignty over South Ossetia and Abkhazia ?
PALIN : First off , we 're going to continue good relations with Saakashvili there .
I was able to speak with him the other day and giving him my commitment , as John McCain 's running mate , that we will be committed to Georgia .
And we 've got to keep an eye on Russia .
For Russia to have exerted such pressure in terms of invading a smaller democratic country , unprovoked , is unacceptable and we have to keep ...
GIBSON : You believe unprovoked .
PALIN : I do believe unprovoked and we have got to keep our eyes on Russia , under the leadership there .
I think it was unfortunate .
That manifestation that we saw with that invasion of Georgia shows us some steps backwards that Russia has recently taken away from the race toward a more democratic nation with democratic ideals .
That 's why we have to keep an eye on Russia .
And , Charlie , you 're in Alaska .
We have that very narrow maritime border between the United States , and the 49th state , Alaska , and Russia .
They are our next door neighbors .
We need to have a good relationship with them .
They 're very , very important to us and they are our next door neighbor .
GIBSON : What insight into Russian actions , particularly in the last couple of weeks , does the proximity of the state give you ?
PALIN : They 're our next door neighbors and you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska , from an island in Alaska .
GIBSON : What insight does that give you into what they 're doing in Georgia ?
PALIN : Well , I 'm giving you that perspective of how small our world is and how important it is that we work with our allies to keep good relation with all of these countries , especially Russia .
We will not repeat a Cold War .
We must have good relationship with our allies , pressuring , also , helping us to remind Russia that it's in their benefit , also , a mutually beneficial relationship for us all to be getting along .
Sarah Palin on Russia :
We cannot repeat the Cold War .
We are thankful that , under Reagan , we won the Cold War , without a shot fired , also .
We 've learned lessons from that in our relationship with Russia , previously the Soviet Union .
We will not repeat a Cold War .
We must have good relationship with our allies , pressuring , also , helping us to remind Russia that it's in their benefit , also , a mutually beneficial relationship for us all to be getting along .
GIBSON : Would you favor putting Georgia and Ukraine in NATO ?
PALIN : Ukraine , definitely , yes .
Yes , and Georgia .
GIBSON : Because Putin has said he would not tolerate NATO incursion into the Caucasus .
PALIN : Well , you know , the Rose Revolution , the Orange Revolution , those actions have showed us that those democratic nations , I believe , deserve to be in NATO .
Putin thinks otherwise .
Obviously , he thinks otherwise , but ...
GIBSON : And under the NATO treaty , would n't we then have to go to war if Russia went into Georgia ?
PALIN : Perhaps so .
I mean , that is the agreement when you are a NATO ally , is if another country is attacked , you 're going to be expected to be called upon and help .
But NATO , I think , should include Ukraine , definitely , at this point and I think that we need to -- especially with new leadership coming in on January 20 , being sworn on , on either ticket , we have got to make sure that we strengthen our allies , our ties with each one of those NATO members .
We have got to make sure that that is the group that can be counted upon to defend one another in a very dangerous world today .
GIBSON : And you think it would be worth it to the United States , Georgia is worth it to the United States to go to war if Russia were to invade .
PALIN : What I think is that smaller democratic countries that are invaded by a larger power is something for us to be vigilant against .
We have got to be cognizant of what the consequences are if a larger power is able to take over smaller democratic countries .
And we have got to be vigilant .
We have got to show the support , in this case , for Georgia .
The support that we can show is economic sanctions perhaps against Russia , if this is what it leads to .
It does n't have to lead to war and it does n't have to lead , as I said , to a Cold War , but economic sanctions , diplomatic pressure , again , counting on our allies to help us do that in this mission of keeping our eye on Russia and Putin and some of his desire to control and to control much more than smaller democratic countries .
His mission , if it is to control energy supplies , also , coming from and through Russia , that 's a dangerous position for our world to be in , if we were to allow that to happen .
Sarah Palin on Iran and Israel :
GIBSON : Let me turn to Iran .
Do you consider a nuclear Iran to be an existential threat to Israel ?
PALIN : I believe that under the leadership of Ahmadinejad , nuclear weapons in the hands of his government are extremely dangerous to everyone on this globe , yes .
GIBSON : So what should we do about a nuclear Iran ?
John McCain said the only thing worse than a war with Iran would be a nuclear Iran .
John Abizaid said we may have to live with a nuclear Iran .
Who 's right ?
PALIN : No , no .
I agree with John McCain that nuclear weapons in the hands of those who would seek to destroy our allies , in this case , we 're talking about Israel , we 're talking about Ahmadinejad 's comment about Israel being the " stinking corpse , should be wiped off the face of the earth , " that 's atrocious .
That 's unacceptable .
GIBSON : So what do you do about a nuclear Iran ?
PALIN : We have got to make sure that these weapons of mass destruction , that nuclear weapons are not given to those hands of Ahmadinejad , not that he would use them , but that he would allow terrorists to be able to use them .
So we have got to put the pressure on Iran and we have got to count on our allies to help us , diplomatic pressure .
GIBSON : But , Governor , we 've threatened greater sanctions against Iran for a long time .
It has n't done any good .
It has n't stemmed their nuclear program .
PALIN : We need to pursue those and we need to implement those .
We can not back off .
We cannot just concede that , oh , gee , maybe they 're going to have nuclear weapons , what can we do about it .
No way , not Americans .
We do not have to stand for that .
GIBSON : What if Israel decided it felt threatened and needed to take out the Iranian nuclear facilities ?
PALIN : Well , first , we are friends with Israel and I do n't think that we should second guess the measures that Israel has to take to defend themselves and for their security .
GIBSON : So if we would n't second guess it and they decided they needed to do it because Iran was an existential threat , we would cooperative or agree with that .
PALIN : I do n't think we can second guess what Israel has to do to secure its nation .
GIBSON : So if it felt necessary , if it felt the need to defend itself by taking out Iranian nuclear facilities , that would be all right .
PALIN : We cannot second guess the steps that Israel has to take to defend itself .
Sarah Palin on ' the Bush Doctrine ' :
GIBSON : We talk on the anniversary of 9/11 .
Why do you think those hijackers attacked ?
Why did they want to hurt us ?
PALIN : You know , there is a very small percentage of Islamic believers who are extreme and they are violent and they do not believe in American ideals , and they attacked us and now we are at a point here seven years later , on the anniversary , in this post - 9/11 world , where we 're able to commit to never again .
They see that the only option for them is to become a suicide bomber , to get caught up in this evil , in this terror .
They need to be provided the hope that all Americans have instilled in us , because we 're a democratic , we are a free , and we are a free - thinking society .
GIBSON : Do you agree with the Bush doctrine ?
PALIN : In what respect , Charlie ?
GIBSON : The Bush -- well , what do you -- what do you interpret it to be ?
PALIN : His world view .
GIBSON : No , the Bush doctrine , enunciated September 2002 , before the Iraq war .
PALIN : I believe that what President Bush has attempted to do is rid this world of Islamic extremism , terrorists who are hell bent on destroying our nation .
There have been blunders along the way , though .
There have been mistakes made .
And with new leadership , and that 's the beauty of American elections , of course , and democracy , is with new leadership comes opportunity to do things better .
GIBSON : The Bush doctrine , as I understand it , is that we have the right of anticipatory self - defense , that we have the right to a preemptive strike against any other country that we think is going to attack us .
Do you agree with that ?
PALIN : I agree that a president 's job , when they swear in their oath to uphold our Constitution , their top priority is to defend the United States of America .
I know that John McCain will do that and I , as his vice president , families we are blessed with that vote of the American people and are elected to serve and are sworn in on January 20 , that will be our top priority is to defend the American people .
GIBSON : Do we have a right to anticipatory self - defense ?
Do we have a right to make a preemptive strike again another country if we feel that country might strike us ?
PALIN : Charlie , if there is legitimate and enough intelligence that tells us that a strike is imminent against American people , we have every right to defend our country .
In fact , the president has the obligation , the duty to defend .
GIBSON : Do we have the right to be making cross - border attacks into Pakistan from Afghanistan , with or without the approval of the Pakistani government ?
PALIN : Now , as for our right to invade , we 're going to work with these countries , building new relationships , working with existing allies , but forging new , also , in order to , Charlie , get to a point in this world where war is not going to be a first option .
In fact , war has got to be , a military strike , a last option .
GIBSON : But , Governor , I 'm asking you :
We have the right , in your mind , to go across the border with or without the approval of the Pakistani government .
PALIN : In order to stop Islamic extremists , those terrorists who would seek to destroy America and our allies , we must do whatever it takes and we must not blink , Charlie , in making those tough decisions of where we go and even who we target .
GIBSON : And let me finish with this .
I got lost in a blizzard of words there .
Is that a yes ?
That you think we have the right to go across the border with or without the approval of the Pakistani government , to go after terrorists who are in the Waziristan area ?
PALIN : I believe that America has to exercise all options in order to stop the terrorists who are hell bent on destroying America and our allies .
We have got to have all options out there on the table .
What If Bristol Palin Were Black ?
By Cenk Uygur
Created Sep 2 2008 - 9:29am
Christian - right leaders and conservative stalwarts have praised the decision of Bristol Palin , the daughter of Governor Sarah Palin , to carry her child to term .
She is 17 and conceived this child out of wedlock .
Now imagine she was n't the daughter of a prominent Republican politician but an average person .
Now imagine she was black .
What do you think conservatives would have to say about her ?
" Typical , urban youth with no sense of responsibility raised with loose morals who plans to depend on the state to take care of her child . "
You know it .
It 's not within dispute .
That 's exactly what they would say .
Barack Obama has told everyone to lay off this because it is a personal , family matter .
Yes , but it also has public policy ramifications .
Governor Palin is for abstinence only education .
Well , that obviously did n't work .
Has she learned her lesson ?
Will she now amend her policy position on this matter given her personal record of failure in implementing this ridiculous stance ?
Notice I am not blaming Bristol .
Quite the opposite .
People like me are the ones that defend the Bristols of the world .
It is conservatives like James Dobson , Rush Limbaugh and yes , Governor Palin who usually attack people who find themselves in Bristol 's situation .
They demand a dogmatic adherence to moral strictures and chastise and belittle women who have children out of wedlock .
Especially if they are women of color .
Which brings us back to Obama .
Do you think the Republicans would lay off of Obama if his 17 year - old daughter had gotten pregnant out of wedlock ?
You know the answer to that question .
Everyone does .
" This is what the permissive liberal attitude gets you .
If you allow your children to think everything is acceptable , they have no boundaries .
They wind up getting themselves in trouble like this .
It 's a predictable result of the liberal lifestyle . "
And that 's before the subtle and not so subtle racial implications are brought into this .
There is a constant double - standard of how black and white people and politicians are covered in this country .
When a young black girl gets pregnant , she 's looking to get money from welfare .
When a young white woman gets pregnant , she made an unfortunate mistake and her family is being supportive in trying to help the make the best of it .
Cindy McCain was addicted to drugs and stole from her own charity to feed her addiction .
Now what do you think the Republicans would have done if Michelle Obama had done that ?
How do you think the press would have covered it ?
You think they would have called it a simple mistake and moved on ?
When presented with these examples , no matter who you are , you know in your heart that this double standard exists .
All of this is not said to condemn Bristol Palin or Cindy McCain .
This is to get you to think twice about your own assumptions about the next time you hear a story of a young African - American woman who got pregnant in the inner city or a minority who got addicted to drugs and committed a crime to feed that addiction .
There but for the grace of God go Bristol Palin and Cindy McCain .
Watch The Young Turks Here
_______
My MSM take on the total absurdity of the Palin nomination is in the Sunday Times today :
I ’m afraid I can not join in .
In fact I cannot say anything about this candidacy that takes it in any way seriously .
It is a farce .
It is absurd .
It is an insult to all intelligent people .
It is a sign of a candidate who has lost his mind .
There is no way to take the nomination of Palin to be vice - president of the world ’s sole superpower - except to treat it as a massive , unforgivable , inexplicable decision by someone who has either gone insane or is managerially unfit to be president of the United States .
When , at some point , the hysteria dies down , even her supporters will realise that , by this decision , McCain has rendered himself unfit to run a branch of Starbucks , let alone the White House .
Formerly sane people have written of the McCain campaign ’s selection of this running mate as if it represents a new face for Republicanism , an emblem of can - do western spirit , a brilliant ploy to win over Clinton voters , a new feminism , a reformist revolution , and a genius appeal to the religious right .
For the past two weeks serious commentators and columnists have been asked to take the candidacy of Sarah Palin for the vice - presidency of the United States seriously .
The announcement of Palin was made more than two weeks ago .
It took a fortnight for her to agree to sit down for an intimate interview of the kind usually reserved for Hollywood stars instead of the press conference typical of a new vice - presidential candidate .
This has never happened in American political history .
Even Dan Quayle , the least qualified vice - presidential nominee before Palin , and a man who did not know how to spell “ potato ” , gave a press conference a day after the convention in 1988 .
There have been two explanations for this astonishing Putin - style decision to keep a vice - presidential candidate from the press .
The first was that the press would be too mean to her and needed to show , in campaign manager Rick Davis ’s word , sufficient “ deference ” before they would be allowed to ask her a question .
Deference ?
Is 21st - century America an 18th - century monarchy ?
The press owes such a total unknown who could be president next January deference ?
The second explanation is that she needed time to cram for the exam .
The McCain camp knew she had never expressed any views about foreign policy .
And the only time she had on record was to oppose the surge that is the centrepiece of McCain ’s campaign .
They knew she knew nothing and was utterly unqualified to be president at a moment ’s notice .
And so she spent the last week furiously prepping .
As Maureen Dowd noticed , she is Eliza Doolittle to John McCain ’s Henry Higgins .
But at the end of last week we were granted an audience with the Princess of Alaska .
It was painful .
She had no idea what the Bush Doctrine was  the central and most controversial foreign policy innovation of the past eight years : the doctrine of preemption against states with WMDs .
Moreover , in her speech the same day , she described the war in Iraq .
She said her eldest son , who has just enlisted , would “ defend the innocent from the enemies who planned and carried out and rejoiced in the death of thousands of Americans ” .
Does Palin believe that the men who planned and carried out the 9/11 attack are in Iraq ?
The hijackers are all dead , but Bin Laden and Zawahiri and the rest of the gang are , as far as we know , in Pakistan .
Nobody believes they are in Iraq .
If more people understood what has happened in the British and American banking system , the financial crisis would only be containable by the immediate partial nationalisation of every bank in Britain and America .
There was not a run on the banks by depositors queuing in the streets to withdraw their savings .
Rather , it was an escalating and terrifying run on the banks in effect by themselves , which , if it spread to millions of small savers , would reproduce the events of 1929 .
In Britain , the money markets that the banks organise between themselves completely froze .
Such was the break down in trust and sense of panic that some of the most familiar names in British high street banking would not lend to each other at all or , at best , just overnight .
Instead , the Bank of England had to supply tens of billions to banks who found the normal sources of funds blocked .
I have been writing on the financial markets for nearly 30 years .
I have known the system was becoming increasingly fragile , but for all the ferocity of my criticisms , I never expected the scale of today 's events .
Or that I would begin to wonder whether my own bank would survive without nationalisation .
The negotiations in Washington over this weekend to finalise the $ 700 bn Paulson financial bail - out plan , and the expected vote on Sunday , are all that stands between the Anglo - American banking system and a first - order disaster .
The scheme had better work .
This is not the end of capitalism , as some wildly claim ; there is no intellectual , social or political challenge to a market system based on respect for private property rights , even by the Chinese Communist party .
Rather , it is a crisis of a particular capitalism that has set aside respect for trust , integrity and fairness as fuddy - duddy obstacles to ' wealth generation ' .
What we are relearning is that without trust and fairness , capitalism risks its own sustainability , even while it unleashes forces that undermine those self - same values .
London 's money markets froze because of a trust collapse ; banks simply do n't believe each other when they say their businesses are sound and will not default on their obligations .
Trust matters .
And although some conservatives in Britain and America continue to make the ideological case against any government action as a response to the recent turmoil - governments necessarily do everything worse than the market - they have no alternative proposal about how to restore trust once it has gone .
Trust is a reciprocal relationship , dependent upon a desire to be considered decent and honourable .
Even in the dog - eat - dog financial markets , trust and integrity are matters of self - interest .
However amoral you may be , it is in your interest to care about your reputation , because if you behave badly you will not do business with me - or others - on favourable terms again .
But the scale of the personal rewards now available in London and Wall Street - £ 15 m - £ 20 m at the top is the norm - along with the greed - is - good doctrine associated with extreme laissez - faire economics , has trashed the need for individuals to worry about integrity .
They do n't need to be concerned about their reputations ; they just need one deal or one year at the top and they need never work again .
The incentive structure has so departed from one of the principal norms of fairness - proportionality between value added and reward - that it has eviscerated trust relationships and integrity .
Everybody tries to ' game ' the system on their route to vast personal fortunes - whether short - selling , packaging up dud mortgages as prime mortgages or telling lies about their financial viability - and the result is that the system is getting wise .
The best course today in any financial transaction is to presume zero integrity .
Credit is drying up and with it the very lifeblood of the economy .
Worse , now that the system is in trouble , financiers are turning to taxpayers in the US and Britain for help without understanding the other key principal of fairness - that we will consider helping those who for no fault of their own get into trouble , but not those who freely created their own bad circumstances .
Hank Paulson certainly acted decisively in launching his plan , but the former Goldman Sachs CEO , who negotiated a special exemption from tax when he took the job , like his former Wall Street colleagues is not well endowed with the fairness gene .
It polluted the very design of the scheme .
He knows that unless the US government does something comprehensive , the entire financial system is at stake , but his original plan was designed to bail out the system intact .
It made no demands that any financial executives sacrifice pay or bonuses despite having driven their firms and wider economy to the point of bankruptcy .
He does not want the government to provide new bank capital to help recapitalise a bust banking system .
Instead , he wants the government to buy their toxic debt and so leave the banks unreformed .
On top he wanted complete discretion to act as he chose without any oversight .
American economists of every persuasion signed a joint letter complaining not at the aim of the bail out , which is plainly vital , but for its lack of fairness .
Conservative papers and politicians echoed the complaint .
Suddenly , Wall Street is coming back to earth .
The transactions from which it skims such riches are built on the savings of ordinary Americans to whom it has obligations , as it has to other Wall Street firms .
What we know now about the yet to be agreed compromise is that Paulson has accepted Congressional oversight , will offer direct help to distressed US homeowners as well as banks , and will accept some constraints on the worst excesses of executive pay .
But the core proposal remains .
The government will buy toxic debt rather than inject government funds into the banks ' capital base , in other words , reject even partially nationalising the entire US banking system as the Swedes had to in 1992 .
I do n't know - nobody does - whether the Paulson plan would be sufficient or whether ultimately the Americans will have to go for nationalisation .
What I do know is that unless there is a radical and government - led change in ownership , structure , regulation and incentives so that the principles of fairness are put at the heart of the Anglo American financial system - proportionality of reward and fair distribution of risk - there is no chance of the return of trust and integrity upon which long - term recovery depends .
The political debate in Britain and America so far little reflects this need - but it will .
Barack Obama 's election as President is much more likely .
And the discourse in Britain will follow .
Brown may be crampingly cautious but , unlike Cameron , he does understand that without government action the restoration of trust and fairness may never happen .
This week , I expect the nationalisation of the stricken Bradford & Bingley to join Northern Rock .
It is but another in a long sequence of interventions that are imperative to save the system from its own proclivities .
Once again , the left is coming to capitalism 's rescue .
The Democratic presidential contender , Sen. Barack Obama ( Ill. ) , acknowledges that climate change is real , man-made and an " immediate threat . "
From a July 2007 speech on the floor of the Senate : " I know that when it comes to the word ' carbon , ' the range of views among my colleagues is varied and complex .
I am among those senators who believe that carbon from human activities contributes to climate change , that it is an immediate threat , and that we must immediately require emission reductions through a strong cap - and - trade system . "
Arizona Sen. John McCain , the Republican candidate , along with Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I–Conn . ) , introduced the Climate Stewardship Act in the Senate in 2003 — which was seen as a break with hard - line Republicans .
He acknowledges that human activity accelerated global warming and proposes an " all of the above energy solution " called The Lexington Project to stem it .
From remarks made at a wind turbine - manufacturer in Portland , Ore. , in May : " For all of the last century , the profit motive basically led in one direction — toward machines , methods and industries that used oil and gas .
Enormous good came from that industrial growth , and we are all the beneficiaries of the national prosperity it built .
But there were costs we were n't counting , and often hardly noticed .
And these terrible costs have added up now — in the atmosphere , in the oceans , and all across the natural world . "
La consolle M16C RENESAS permette sia di visualizzare su di un display 16x2 i dati ricevuti dalla seriale che di inviare una stringa di dati , magari in risposta ad una determinata richiesta .
M16C Renesas CONSOLLE REMOTA
1.SCOPO del progetto Renesas M16 c consolle
Quante volte usando un apparato ci viene pensare come sarebbe comodo poter avere più informazioni di quel benedetto led che assume 527 colori o lampeggia in 6432 modi diversi ma poi , in fin dei conti , sempre uguali .
Quante applicazioni oggi fanno uso di un modulo GSM ?
Telecontrolli , teleattuatori , comandi attivazione remota ecc. ma che pensandoci bene perché non usarlo per ricevere o inviare SMS ?
Certo ci sarebbe da rilavorare sul firmware , ma almeno avremmo l'hardware a disposizione !
Bene , se vi siete trovati in una di queste situazioni il progetto della consolle remota ( realizzata con il microcontrollore Renesas m 16c ) che segue può fare al caso vostro .
2.DESCRIZIONE M16C consolle
La consolle M16C RENESAS permette sia di visualizzare su di un display i dati ricevuti da un altro sistema che di inviare una stringa di dati , magari in risposta ad una determinata richiesta .
I principali blocchi funzionali che la compongono sono :
1 ) Display di visualizzazione .
2 ) Tastiera alfanumerica .
3 ) Seriale di comunicazione .
4 ) Unita centrale di elaborazione .
Di seguito andremo ad analizzare nel dettaglio ognuno di questi blocchi .
3.DISPLAY DI VISUALIZZAZIONE M16C
Per poter visualizzare i dati la scelta è caduta su di un classico display alfanumerico 16x2 ovvero un dispositivo in grado di visualizzare 16 caratteri standard ASCII su due righe .
L'interfacciamento con il microcontrollore Renesas avviene mediante tre segnali di controllo e otto segnali per la linea dati , ovviamente gestiti all ' interno del firmware .
4.TASTIERA ALFANUMERICA consolle M16C
Una tastiera alfanumerica da 14 tasti ( 0 - 9 , RD , WR, SEND , UP DOWN ) permette di scrivere i dati da inviare .
L'interfacciamento con il microcontrollore è stato realizzato sfruttando il metodo a matrice ciò permette di diminuire il numero di I/O necessari alla connessione elettrica e semplifica la realizzazione del driver firmware di gestione .
5.SERIALE DI COMUNICAZIONE
Renesas M16C
La comunicazione con il mondo esterno è affidata ad una seriale tramite segnali di TX , RX e GND .
Un semplice transceiver RS232 è interposto tra l'unità centrale e l'esterno .
6.UNITA ' CENTRALE DI ELABORAZIONE Renesas M16C
Il controllo del sistema è affidato ad un microcontrollore a 16 bit Renesas della serie M16C / 62P che grazie suo firmware può controllare e gestire in tempo reale il corretto funzionamento della CONSOLLE .
La stesura del programma è stata realizzata in C e si compone dei principali blocchi funzionali :
gestione tastiera .
gestione display .
gestione seriale .
Queste routines vengono eseguite in maniera ciclica all ' interno del main program e permettono all 'utente di usufruire di tutte le funzionalità della CONSOLLE .
Ovviamente ci sono anche driver software più a basso livello per la gestione fisica delle periferiche ( per esempio acquisizione tastiera o inizializzazione display . )
Di seguito viene illustrata la routine che acquisisce la configurazione della tastiera .
Gestione Tastiera
// Title : gestione_tastiera_100.c //Author : najro.prestato //Current Rev : 100 //Mod.Descr. : Modulo per acquisizione tasti // // ptastihi e ptastilo congelano lo stato della tastiera alla prima acquisizione .

In pratica si acquisiscono ( usando dei registri di appoggio ) ad intervalli regolari le configurazioni della tastiera e poi si confrontano ; nel caso in cui siano uguali i registri tastilo e tastihi ; in questa maniera ci si svincola da eventuali problemi di spike , spurie , attivazioni rapide ecc .

Be a bit of a pain if it did , would n't it ?
And the most frustrating thing is that we wo n't know for sure either way until the European laboratory for particle physics ( Cern ) in Geneva switches on its Large Hadron Collider the day after tomorrow .
If you think it 's unlikely that we will all be sucked into a giant black hole that will swallow the world , as German chemistry professor Otto Rössler of the University of Tübingen posits , and so carry on with your life as normal , only to find out that it 's true , you 'll be a bit miffed , wo n't you ?
If , on the other hand , you disagree with theoretical physicist Prof Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith of the UK Atomic Energy Agency , who argues that fears of possible global self - ingestion have been exaggerated , and decide to live the next two days as if they were your last , and then nothing whatsoever happens , you 'd feel a bit of a fool too .
Rössler apparently thinks it " quite plausible " that the " mini black holes " the Cern atom - smasher creates " will survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside " .
So convinced is he that he has lodged an EU court lawsuit alleging that the project violates the right to life guaranteed under the European Convention of Human Rights .
Prof Llewellyn Smith , however , has assured Radio 4 's Today programme that the LHC - designed to help solve fundamental questions about the structure of matter and , hopefully , arrive at a " theory of everything " - is completely safe and will not be doing anything that has not happened " 100,000 times over " in nature since the earth has existed .
" The chances of us producing a black hole are minuscule , " he said , " and even if we do , it ca n't swallow up the earth . "
So , folks , who do you believe ?
On Comedy Central ’s The Daily Show , Barack Obama pledged to work with Republican rival , Sen. John McCain , on the issue of Global Warming no matter who wins the White House on Tuesday .
[ social_buttons ]
During this race for the U.S. presidency , many a candidate noted their ability to reach across that proverbial aisle , truly defying party lines .
And while I greatly respect that ideal , I questioned its reality .
The primary was grossly long ; heck , it could be measured in light - years .
And saying that the ads ran were scathing … well , that is putting it lightly .
Unfortunately , this presidential race has followed the same suit .
Not that McCain has n’t crossed party lines in the past .
As has Obama , Clinton , and the many other candidates who ran .
Yes everyone touted this ability to work with that “ other ” party .
But after such a rocky election , could they even extend a hand to rivals within their own party – let alone outsiders ?
I was n’t sure .
I am still stuck on McCain calling Obama “ that one . ”
Eh , so much for reaching across that aisle – til now .
No , this is n’t the Obama Infomercial !
Obama Will Work With McCain To Fight Global Warming
[ hulu=http://www.hulu.com/embed/FzDNVXKTWkpjP6MFmXcDyA]
“ You look at a something like global warming , that ’s really an all - hands - on - deck kind of situation , ” Obama said .
“ If we do n’t get everybody on board , conservative hawks who are worried about us buying oil from the Middle East , tree huggers and environmentalists who are worried about , you know , the polar bears .
Bringing all those folks together and saying everybody ’s got a legitimate point of view , let ’s figure out how to solve the problem .
I think that ’s the kind of attitude that we ’re going to need going forward . ”

The number of musical instruments available on the iPhone has increased dramatically since Apple released their SDK for developers ( watch this blog for a iphone instrument roundup soon ! ) .
Before this , most virtual instruments could only be run on a Jailbroken iPhone .
The complexity of some of these new instruments ( like the amazing soon - to - be released iphone synth ) is getting astounding , but a Japanese band called Denki Groove has used some fairly simple apps on jailbroken phones & ipods to do a fantastic version of the song “ Smoky Bubbles ” .
Here ’s a video of the performance :
You can get a copy of their excellent CD as an import from Amazon .
The apps that they used for the song are :
BeatPhone ( Drums )
PocketGuitar ( Bass and Guitar )
Pianist ( Keyboards )
i Phone Synth ( Synthesizer )
I for one think that the iPhone is opening up a whole new area of very portable music generation and look forward to the many more apps that will be available .
Â
Also , check out the official Denki Groove website .
Have you got any iPhone music that you ’ve made ?
if so , tell us !

“ I just want you to know that I ’m not here representing blm , ” archaeologist Blaine Miller reminds me as we drive along the coarsely graded road through central Utah ’s Nine Mile Canyon .
Nestled into the rugged , sparsely populated Tavaputs Plateau , the canyon is a virtual museum of prehistoric art , with an estimated 10,000 images pecked and painted on its towering sandstone walls .
I ’ve come to view the dazzling millennium - old renderings of hunters , shamans , and animals before , as Miller fears , they vanish under a coating of dust and grime , thanks to decisions made by his superiors at the Bureau of Land Management , the Interior Department division that oversees some 262 million acres of federal land .
Miller has been with the bureau 33 years , but he has n’t worked on Nine Mile issues since 2004 , the year he publicly griped that his bosses would n’t let him adequately investigate a proposed gas - drilling project .
Four years and some 200 wells later , this once - serene canyon has become an industrial corridor , and Miller , who wears large aviator glasses and speaks in a lazy cadence , is up in arms over a new blm - approved plan that would bring 600 more gas wells and up to 1,000 truck trips a day through Nine Mile .
Although he’s an expert on the canyon ’s history and the sole archaeologist in the bureau ’s local field office , Miller was n’t able to view his office ’s environmental impact statement for the drilling expansion prior to its public release in February , something Kevin Jones , Utah ’s state archaeologist , calls “ incredible . ”
But Miller has agreed to meet with me as a “ private citizen , ” and so we spend the day scrambling up to cliff ledges and examining art panels 100 feet above the valley floor — several as clear as the day they were etched , others barely recognizable .
“ I know this one is fading from all the dust , because I ’ve seen it hundreds of times since 1982 , ” Miller says , pointing to a faint image of figures with splayed hands , triangular bodies , and hunting bows .
While his superiors discount his observations as “ anecdotal , ” a recent blm - commissioned study concluded that dust raised by the trucks is indeed damaging the rock art .
The Environmental Protection Agency also has raised concerns about the “ physical integrity ” of the art due to dust and unchecked ozone pollution in the canyon .
But what incenses Miller most is his office ’s new Tavaputs Plateau resource management plan , the master blueprint that dictates how the bureau will oversee the area for the next 15 to 20 years .
Normally , these “ rmp s ” take years to complete as myriad competing interests weigh in , but Interior has stamped as “ time sensitive ” nearly a dozen such plans in six resource - rich Western states — Colorado , Wyoming , New Mexico , Montana , Utah , and Alaska — and is rushing to finalize them before Bush leaves office .
Foes of the fast - tracking say it ’s a ploy to open federal lands to energy firms in a way the next president wo n’t be able to undo .
“ There are so many deficiencies — the cultural resources get such short shrift — that the only viable alternative is to go back and start over , ” says archaeologist Jerry Spangler , who heads an antiquities preservation group in Utah .
Federal law stipulates that the blm thoughtfully balance land uses including recreation , grazing , environmental protection , and historic preservation .
But the new , hastily completed plans stray far from this mandate .
In Vernal , Utah , for example , the bureau knew it could save large swaths of prime habitat in the ecologically rich Uintah Basin by scaling back a proposed gas - drilling project from 6,342 wells to 6,117 .
“ They had the science , all the info , to show that a 3 to 4 percent reduction would provide the most benefit to wildlife , ” says Wilderness Society lawyer Nada Culver .
But the bureau went with the marginally bigger development .
Utah ’s six new rmp s , covering more than 11 million acres , designate 16,000 miles of new roads for all - terrain vehicles , a change that could unleash atv s on seldom - traveled areas containing sensitive riparian corridors and archaeological sites .
And , notes David Alberswerth , an adviser to the Wilderness Society , “ Some of these plans make over 95 percent of the lands available for oil and gas development . ”
The bureau is already on an energy binge :
This spring in Wyoming , where studies blame expanded gas drilling for plummeting wildlife populations , it sold new drilling leases covering some 630,000 acres , a move conservationists say will destroy some of the state ’s last and richest sagebrush habitat .
More sales are expected .
blm staffers attribute the problems , in part , to outsourcing .
All of Utah ’s resource plans were researched by consultants — Tavaputs ’ and another plan for Colorado ’s Little Snake River region went to Booz Allen Hamilton , a gop - connected firm that also does intelligence work .
Traditionally , rmp s had been researched in - house , since field staffers are experts on local land issues , but the Bush Interior Department has farmed out dozens in energy - rich Western states .
This worries Steve Madsen , a blm wildlife biologist based in Salt Lake City — especially , he points out , since the bureau determined several years ago that “ some of the contractors were n’t up to the task of doing a real analysis . ”
In Colorado , the blm ‘s White River field office even let oil and gas companies pay for creation of an rmp “ amendment ” that paves the way for about 22,000 new gas wells .
“ That ’s a little weird , ” admits Archie Reeve , a wildlife biologist the bureau often hires for energy - related work .
“ That private interests would pay for it is really unusual .
It would beg the question whether there is a conflict of interest . ” blm field office manager Kent Walter defends the deal .
“ If you look at the way the [ agreement ] is written , you ’ll see that we took extra lengths to make sure that industry has no special treatment , ” he says .
He ’d be hard pressed to make that claim in Utah , where the outsourcing has cost taxpayers millions of dollars in consulting fees , and wildlife groups are preparing to take the bureau to court .
“ If they go forward as is , ” cautions Kristen Brengel , a Wilderness Society lobbyist , “ these six plans will be money down the drain . ”
Previous attacks in North Waziristan left a lot of damage behind More than 20 people have been killed in two suspected US missile attacks in northwest Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan , security officials said .
About 15 , including an al - Qaeda leader , were killed in an attack near the village of Mirali , North Waziristan .
In a second attack , seven people were killed in South Waziristan .
The US military has not commented .
It has launched many missile strikes from Afghanistan against suspected militant targets recently .
Officials named the al - Qaeda leader in Mirali as Abu Akash , believed to be Iraqi .
Local officials told the BBC that at 2030 ( 1430 GMT ) , a drone fired two missiles and destroyed the target - a house in the Esori area about 30 km from the town of Mirali .
Militant
They confirmed that Abu Akash was inside the building when the attack took place .
Abu Akash was a well - known militant in the region and had been living in the area near Mir Ali since coming from Afghanistan in 2002 .
He was believed to have gone to Afghanistan to fight against the Soviets in the late 1980s , or during the time of the Taleban in the mid-1990s .
Abu Akash , who was born in Iraq , came to notoriety last year when he issued a video that called for attacks against coalition forces in their territories , says the BBC's Syed Shoaib Hassan .
He was also said to have recently broken away from the main al - Qaeda entity and formed his own group .
Border tension Tensions between the US and Pakistan have increased over the issue of cross - border incursions against militants by American forces based in Afghanistan .
Pakistan 's foreign ministry said it had voiced its concern to the US envoy in Islamabad on Wednesday .
" It was underscored to the ambassador that the government of Pakistan strongly condemns the missile attacks which resulted in the loss of precious lives and property , " the ministry said in a statement .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
In a move bound to anger China , the United States intends to sell $ 6.4 billion in arms to Taiwan , the State Department said Friday .
Apache attack helicopters are part of the weapons deal .
State Department deputy spokesman Robert Wood said Congress -- whose approval is needed for the deal to go through -- was notified Friday afternoon .
He indicated the administration expects congressional approval quickly .
The package includes a variety of U.S. - made weapons systems , including Patriot III anti-missile missiles , Apache attack helicopters , Harpoon missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles .
The deal had been in the works for a few months , Wood said , and the decision is " consistent with U.S. policy of providing arms for defense of Taiwan and consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act . "
" This arms deal is a key factor in bringing security and stability across the Taiwan Strait , " he added .
The deal also gives Taiwan upgrades for Taiwan 's E - 2T aircraft and spare parts for its air force .
U.S. arms sales to Taiwan have always angered China .
The latest deal comes at a time when the United States needs China in negotiations over Iran 's and North Korea 's nuclear programs .
But Wood said the U.S. government decision is no surprise to Beijing , as the Chinese were briefed " several " times about the impending deal .
This is the latest chapter in a decades - long uneasy standoff .
China claims
Taiwan is its own territory and has threatened to invade if Taiwan ever declares independence .
The United States has said it will defend Taiwan if China ever attacks .

First off , before we get into the details here , I 'll state upfront that I have not yet decided who to support in this year 's Presidential election .
I 'm neither a Democrat nor a Republican .
I 've seen plans from both sides that I find problematic .
Still , it bugs me when I see plans from either side mischaracterized , and I believe that 's the case with this somewhat mocking criticism of McCain 's " jobs plan " as being " the eBay model " ( sent in by reader Rose M. Welch ) .
At issue , is the fact that McCain has repeatedly referred to the 1.3 million people around the globe who " make a living off EBay .
" As the article notes , the figure is clearly exaggerated .
However , many of the other criticisms of what McCain says seems misguided .
It seems like a stretch for anyone to think that McCain is suggesting that people will find jobs selling on eBay .
Rather , he 's using the example of eBay to note that innovation leads to new ways for people to make money -- using the rise of the ecosystem around eBay as an -- not as the definitive method for creating jobs .
And , on that , he 's correct .
Continued innovation does tend to lead to job growth .
The second part of the criticism that seems incredibly unfounded , is the assertion by a few economists that eBay is just a business model for moving junk around , and that it does n't add anything to the GDP .
This is simply incorrect , and it 's really strange that prominent economists would make such an assertion .
eBay is about making an efficient market .
Plenty of people use it to sell new products , rather than just " junk . "
And , many of the people who use eBay to " make a living " do so byto products which they then resell .
That does add to GDP .
eBay is about a lot more than just moving around junk .
In fact , a rather large percentage of our GDP is based on taking already built goods , adding value to them and reselling them .
To pretend this does n't happen on eBay is simply incorrect .
Now , before anyone thinks that this means I support McCain 's economic positions , I do n't .
I think his continued disdain for basic economics , and his seeming assumption that economics can be handled by someone else is problematic .
And , of course , his proposed gas tax holiday is just downright nutty .

( UPDATE : Alan Keyes stoked the Obama birth certificate controversy anew in February 2009 .
See Ticket coverage here . )
[ See August update here . ]
Click on the certificate to enlarge for better reading .
First , last fall , there were all kinds of people , a number of them Ron Paul supporters , dashing from Internet site to Internet site suggesting that John McCain could not serve as president of the United States .
That was because he was born outside the United States and , therefore , not native - born , as presidents must be constitutionally .
McCain was , in fact , born in a U.S. military hospital in the Panama Canal Zone , where his father was serving in the Navy .
That was , in fact , American - controlled territory at the time .
More importantly , his parents were both American citizens , so he could have been born on Mars and still been an American at birth .
And a sense of the Senate resolution took care of any lingering doubts .
Now come the rumors about Barack Obama 's birthplace , that he was really born in his father 's native Kenya , so like Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who was born in Austria , he can't become a U.S. president .
Same rule would apply as for McCain .
Obama 's mother was an American .
So is her son .
The Obama campaign has provided at The Ticket 's request what it says is a copy of the Illinois senator 's official birth certificate , reproduced here , showing he was born in Hawaii on Aug. 4 , 1961 , at 7:24 p.m. , which means he was late for dinner , just like a politician .
Click on the photo to enlarge for reading .
Now , about the citizenship of all those people planting these rumors .
( UPDATE :
In reaction to some of the comments left below challenging the veracity of the document , Ben LaBolt , an Obama campaign spokesman , sent the following reaction to The Ticket : " I can confirm that that is Sen. Obama 's birth certificate . " )

For the first time , researchers have successfully grown functional human blood vessels in mice using cells from adult human donors — an important step in developing clinical strategies to grow tissue , researchers report in Circulation Research : Journal of the American Heart Association .
" What 's really significant about our study is that we are using human cells that can be obtained from blood or bone marrow rather than removing and using fully developed blood vessels , " said Joyce Bischoff , Ph.D. , senior author of the study and associate professor at Harvard Medical School and Children 's Hospital Boston .
The researchers combined two different types of progenitor cells in a culture dish of nutrients and growth factors , then washed off the nutrients and implanted the cells into mice with weakened immune systems .
Once implanted , the progenitor cell mixture grew and differentiated into a small ball of healthy blood vessels .
Progenitor cells are similar to stem cells but can only differentiate into specific cells , while stem cells can differentiate into practically any cell in the body .
In the study , researchers used two different kinds of progenitor cells to grow blood vessels : the endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) , which become cells that line the vessels , and mesenchymal progenitor cells ( MPCs ) , which differentiate into the cells that surround the lining and provide stability .
The researchers used different combinations of the two types of progenitor cells .
They found that a mixture of adult blood - and adult bone marrow - derived progenitor cells or a combination of umbilical cord blood - derived and adult bone marrow - derived cells resulted in the greatest density of new blood vessel formation .
The ability to rapidly grow two - layered blood vessels without using embryonic or umbilical cord blood stem cells could skirt many ethical concerns , Bischoff said .
It would also solve a persistent problem in treating several medical conditions that result from ischemia — the inability of oxygen - rich blood to reach an organ or tissue — such as heart attacks , wound healing and many acute injuries .
" What we are most interested in right now is speeding up the vascularization ( the formation of blood vessels ) , " Bischoff said .
" We see very good and extensive vasculature in seven days and we'd like to see that in 24 or 48 hours .
If you have an ischemic tissue , it 's dying tissue , so the faster you can establish blood flow the better . "
If researchers can develop ways to speed the growth of the vessels , non-surgical cardiac bypass procedures could potentially grow new vessels around those blocked by atherosclerosis .
Bischoff said other findings include :
--
The cells created a vigorous network of vessels that connected to one another and to the vessels of the host mouse within seven days and continued to transport blood during the four - week study .
--
Once combined and implanted , the two progenitor cells arranged themselves into vessels with minimal outside help , i.e. , without any genetic alteration or manipulation to improve their growth .
This is important because many growth - promoting genes are the same genes that become activated in cancer .
-- Mixtures of EPCs and MPCs from adult donors were as effective at generating vessels as those made from a mixture of cord blood EPCs and adult bone marrow MPCs .
That finding increases the likelihood of someday being able to easily find clinically useful amounts of progenitor cells .
The research could also enhance tissue engineering — growing new organs for later implantation into patients , another medical research field that needs good sources of microvascularization to develop , Bischoff said .

Metamaterials might mean the end of all these wires A huge increase in the speed of the internet could be produced by slowing parts of it down , say researchers .
Applying the brakes could be the " metamaterials " that may make it possible to create invisibility cloaks .
The net 's speed limit comes about not in transporting information , but in routing it to its various destinations .
Metamaterials could replace the bulky and slow electronics that do the routing , paving the way for lightning fast speeds .
Dividing light High - speed telecommunications routes include fibre - optic cables that span vast distances , carrying different streams of information in different channels each with its own frequency of light .
As data nears the end of its journey , these frequencies must be separated and sent to their destinations .
The separation is accomplished with bulky equipment that spreads the closely spaced frequencies in the pulses into different detectors .
The ability to slow the light could be a tremendous force for telecoms
Xiang Zhang
The light must then be converted into electrical signals which are stored , routed , and turned back into optical signals with lasers .
The conversion , besides adding significant cost and complexity , also slows down the data transmission .
" It limits the speed of the whole process to the speed of your electronics , " says Dr Chris Stevens from the department of engineering sciences at the University of Oxford .
" The light and the fibres can quite cheerfully sustain a couple of terahertz , but your electronics can't do more than a few gigahertz . "
It is at this point that the metamaterials prove most useful .
If the light signals could be slowed sufficiently during the switching process , there would be no need for the electrical conversion step .
Hurry up and wait
The optical properties of metamaterials are accomplished by design which is why they are touted for use in cloaking and they can be engineered to deliberately slow light down .
The effect could be used to store light signals , with different delays for different frequencies , in a so - called " all optical network " .
" The ability to slow the light could be a tremendous force for telecoms that is sure to enhance speed and efficiency , " says Professor Xiang Zhang , the University of California researcher who demonstrated cloaking earlier this week .
The design of the metamaterials gives them their properties
The metamaterials could be engineered to accomplish the frequency spreading step as well , working much like a prism that splits white light into a rainbow .
" With these materials , you could imagine something more like a single chip with the metamaterial handling the routing all the capability of one of these big filtering systems , but the size of your fingernail , " says Dr Stevens .
Professor Ortwin
Hess of the University of Surrey says that the jumps in speed will become increasingly necessary as more people use bandwidth - intensive video - on - demand services such as the BBC iPlayer .
" We 're living with what was put into the system before the telecoms bubble burst in 2000 , " Prof Hess says .
" There needs to be more clever ideas so that the existing infrastructure can be used in a different way . "

What are these ?
By T. Coddington Van Voorhees VII
Columnist , The National Topsider
Membership Chairman , The Newport Club
When my late father T. Coddington Van Voorhees VI founded the iconoclastic conservative journal National Topsider in 1948 , he famously declared that " Now is the time for all good conservative helmsmen to hoist the mizzen , pour the cocktails , and steer this damned schooner hard starboard . "
In the 60 years since he first uttered it after one - too - many Cosmopolitans at one of Pamela Harriman 's notorious foreign policy black tie balls , father 's pithy bon mot has served as a rallying cry for conservatives from Greenwich to Chevy Chase .
Today , I say it 's time we conservatives once again grab the rigging , and set sail with the flotilla of the true conservative in this race : Barack Obama .
Trust me , I have n't taken this tack lightly .
No Van Voorhees has supported an avowed socialist since great - great - great - great - great - great - great - great - great - great - great grandpapa Cragmont Van Voorhees lent Peter Minuet $ 24 and a sack of wampum to swing a subprime mortgage on Manhattan Island .
Old dad himself often recounted how , as a lad , he would command the family chauffeur Carleton to drive the Duesenberg down to the Times Square Trans - Lux so he could hiss Roosevelt .
But I 've taken a good measure of this Obama fellow , and I must say I like the cut of the man 's jib .
How can I say this , you ask ?
One look at this Obama chap is all the answer you need .
Suave , tanned , unflappable , Harvard connections ; it 's obvious that here is a man to the conservative manor born .
One imagines him at the helm of the Ship of State , basked in the sunlight diffusing through the seaspray over the bow , like some beautiful rugged Othello from a rapturous Ralph Lauren catalog , calmly issuing instructions to the deck crew in that magnificent mellifluous baritone of his .
It 's that easy - going , almost effortless grace that has all the A - list conservatives like David Frum and Kathleen Parker whispering Reaganesque in hushed tones .
Even Peggy Noonan -- the Grand Dame of Gipperism -- has succumbed to Obama 's undeniable conservative charms .
Just last month I listened to her wax poetic about the Adonis of Chicago between chukkers at the Newport Club polo tournament final .
" Why Peggy , you old dowager , " I quipped , " I believe you just had an orgasm . "
Certainly , my endorsement has raised more than a few eyebrows around the National Topsider water cooler , particularly among the alumni of jejune cow colleges like Michigan or Dartmouth .
They sometimes point to Mr. Obama 's radical Rolodex and his hooey about " wealth redistribution " and " dictatorship of the proletariat . "
But , as I patiently explain , this is precisely the point - it is hooey , over - the - top rhetorical flourishes obviously designed by Mr. Obama to win over benighted inner city hoi polloi ( a feat , I might add , that even the Great Communicator himself was unable to accomplish ) .
As for his so - called radical ties , who among us has n't sent dinner party invitations to Gore Vidal and a leftwing terrorist or two to enliven the postprandial conversation ?
Leonard Bernstein loved hosting all manner of Weathermen and Black Panthers and Symbionese Liberation Army celebrities at his Park Avenue pied a terre , but it did n't mean the Maestro was n't in favor of low taxes .
On the contrary ; I know for a fact he itemized every cent of the catering bills for his famous terrorist cocktail parties .
Just so , I have every confidence that Obama 's true conservative butterfly will emerge once in office , coaxed from its Maoist cocoon by conservatives like myself and Frum and Parker and Noonan -- all of whom I am pleased to report are already under consideration for the Obama Administration State Dinner shortlist .
Certainly there may be a tax increase or two , but is n't that what estate attorneys and Cayman Island banks are for ?
Under a worst case scenario some of us may have to set up a lease - back depreciation arrangement on one or two of our vacation compounds , as Dad was forced to in the dark years of Carter .
But I 'm not worried .
I 've got a pretty good sense for character , and I 'd be willing to bet my Weejuns that inside this Obama fellow lives the soul a rock - ribbed old money Brahmin .
Ask yourself : could a seriously committed Marxist carry off a Brooks Brothers suit like that ?
I mean , other than Dad 's old commie nemesis and Harvard fencing club foe Alger Hiss .
But there is an even more compelling reason to support Barack Obama : Sarah Palin .
If you are a conservative like me , you guffawed when you heard John McCain announced this declasse rube as a running mate , followed by good - natured applause , thinking it was some sort of whimsical campus prank he was reenacting from his Annapolis years .
This was , of course , quickly followed the shock of realizing that he was n't joking , and all that Hanoi unpleasantness had finally driven him around the bend .
It 's an inescapable conclusion that this woman has , in 6 short weeks , single - handedly destroyed the Republican party .
Certainly George Bush may share some of the blame ; but we conservatives must remember how our hopes were buoyed by his impressive bloodlines and Yale degree before we realized his excursion to Texas had caused him to " go native . "
But la Palin offers true conservatives no such extenuating graces .
I mean , my God , this woman is simply awful ; the elided vowels , the beauty pageantry , the guns , the crude non-Episcopal protestantism , the embarrassing porchload of children with horrifying hillbilly names , the white after Labor Day .
As fellow conservative commentator Andrew Sullivan quipped to me the other day outside a Martha 's Vineyard antique shop , it 's gratifying to know the Gipper is n't alive to see what has become of his party .
But it 's not just American conservatives who are appalled .
Just last week conservative New York Times columnist David Brooks and I were enjoying an apres- badminton apertif at the family weekend house in Montauk with my good friend Viscount Klaus - Maria Von Wallensheim , the conservative EU Agricultural Pricing Minister with whom I shared an Alpine chalet and manservant during our years as classmates at a Swiss boarding school .
" Kloonkie " ( my old school appellation for the Viscount ) reported the growing dismay of the Continental Right over Palin 's embarrassing enthusiasm for childbirth and Israel .
" Coddsie , old chap , " he warned , " You know I 've always been America 's biggest defender in Monaco .
But if you elect this ill - bred charwoman , I will be forced to move anchor to St. Tropez out of pure shame . "
David and I were left nodding silently , for how else could we respond ?
If Palin has lost Kloonkie , she has surely lost the entire conservative movement .
The idea of this dreadful woman in Washington is almost too much to contemplate .
Not only would it be a fashion disaster , one can scarcely imagine the White House social calendar -- mooseburger fetes to that ghastly Joe the Plumber , perhaps followed by snow machine derbies through the Rose Garden ?
For now , we conservatives must do what we can to sabotage the ill - fated McCain - Palin fiasco and hope for the best .
Once the election is over we can lick our wounds , read the entrails , and decide where the movement should go from here .
In anticipation , the Topsider will be holding a top - level exclusive strategy conference in Nassau next January , featuring tout le monde of conservative intellectuals from the Back Bay Review , The Prospective Standard , National Bowtie , and The Swarthmorean .
If you are attending , please be advised that gentlemen 's jackets will be mandatory after six PM .
Until then , do not despair ; the election of Mr. Obama means that at least some conservatives will still have a place at the table .
I do hope I get seated next to this William Ayers fellow -- I 've heard he has some amazingly droll anecdotes !
Die Generalbundesanwältin Monika Harms hat in einem Interview mit der Leipziger Volkszeitung die Bürger aufgefordert , mehr Vertrauen in die Rechtmäßigkeit staatlicher Ermittlungen zu haben .
Besonders die mit dem neuen BKA - Gesetz geplante heimliche Online - Durchsuchung von Computern sollte nicht kritisch beäugt werden , weil sie gar nicht die Computer von Privatbürgern im Visier habe .
Das Gespräch mit der Generalbundesanwältin fand im Vorfeld eines europäischen Treffens hochrangiger Strafverfolger statt , auf dem die europäische Zusammenarbeit im Kampf gegen den Terror beraten wird .
Harms strebt hier nach eigener Aussage eine bessere europaweite Koordination an , bei der die Verfolgung von Terroristen nicht an Landesgrenzen halt macht .
Bei der Ermittlung von Terroristen sei die Online - Durchsuchung unverzichtbar .
" Wir brauchen die technischen Möglichkeiten , um die Kommunikation dieser Gruppen im Internet verfolgen zu können .
Wir müssen frühzeitig wissen , wo sich etwas zusammenbraut , um eine Anschlagsgefahr rechtzeitig erkennen und eventuelle Pläne vereiteln zu können " , betonte Harms .
Bundesbürger seien von den Maßnahmen nicht betroffen , erklärte sie , die sich mehr Vertrauen in die Arbeit der Ermittlungsbehörden wünscht : " Wir wollen doch gar nicht in den Computer des Privatbürgers schauen , sondern bei einem verdichteten Verdacht die Gefahr schwerster Anschläge abwehren .
Und wir müssen die gewonnenen Erkenntnisse auch im Strafprozess verwenden dürfen . "

Do you miss Beijing ?
Are you pining for some good ol ' fashioned totalitarianism ?
Enjoy seeing any small voice squashed like a ladybug under a Hummer ?
Then come to the University of Virginia !
At Virginia a new rule bans signs of any kind at all sporting events , including football and basketball .
Not advertising signs , of course .
Not " Beer : $ 8 " signs .
Not " Give to the Virginia Scholarship Endowment " signs .
No , only signs about Virginia teams , such as the one then third - year bio-medical engineering student David Becker held up at last year 's
Duke football game , which read , " Fire Groh ! "
That 's Al Groh , the Virginia football coach who always manages to beat the Davids , but rarely the Goliaths .
" No signs , " the gendarme told Becker in taking away the sign .
Becker asked why .
Nobody knew .
So he made another sign , this time smaller , thinking maybe it violated some kind of size - limit rule .
They took that one , too .
Becker asked why again .
" Word from the athletic department , " the guard said .
So he wrote " Fire Groh ! " on a sheet of notebook paper .
The guard took that , too , saying signs of a negative nature were n't allowed and that if Becker wanted to go for one more , he 'd gladly pitch him out under an " exit " sign .
Now — no signs at all , pro or con .
At Virginia !
The nation 's first secular university !
Founded by Thomas Jefferson himself in 1819 !
Framer of the constitution !
Champion of " certain inalienable rights , " like free speech !
The man who once wrote : " A little rebellion now and then is a good thing " !
Who , exactly , is Virginia protecting here ?
Groh ?
The man can handle himself .
After all , he was once the head coach of the New York Jets .
" Seems odd , " says former Virginia star and current Bucs cornerback Ronde Barber .
" You 'd think if there was one university that would stand up for free speech , it'd be Virginia .
When I was there , the signs were really clever . "
I 'll go farther than that .
I 've covered plenty of games where the only clever part of the game was the signs .
College football without signs is like pretzels without salt .
Who can forget these signs from last season ?
" WE WANT A NEW CARR WITH LES MILES ! " — Michigan fan
" KANSAS FOOTBALL : A TRADITION SINCE SEPTEMBER ! " — Jayhawk fan
" IF YOU CAN READ THIS , YOU ARE NOT A CORNHUSKER " — Colorado fan vs. Nebraska
Or , my favorite sign of all time in any sport , from a Bruins game in the ' 70s : " JESUS SAVES AND ESPOSITO SCORES ON THE REBOUND ! "
Virginia 's athletic department says it instituted the policy to promote a " positive game - day environment . "
Ugh .
Sounds like some $ 150 / hour therapist wrote that one .
Someone with tissues in all their pockets and a " Ban Dodge Ball " bumper sticker on their car .
Whoever wrote it does n't get this : 99 % of sports signs are positive .
Can you imagine what Jefferson himself would 've thought of this new jack - booted policy ?
True , he grew to rue freedom of expression a little toward the end of his life , since the press was hammering him on his long - time affair with one of his slaves , Sally Hemings .
( This might be why , to this day , Virginia still does n't have a journalism school . )
But I ask you :
What 's the point of founding a free university if that university is going to tell its students what they can say ?
For instance , how are Virginia students supposed to express themselves about the Cavs ' 52 - 7 home opener loss to USC last Saturday ?
White T - shirts and Sharpies ?
Sign language ?
Hats worn at an angry angle ?
" That 's the thing , " says Robert O'Neil , director of the Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression , also in Charlottesville .
" We do n't quite know what constitutes a sign .
Paint on someone 's chest ?
A T - shirt ?
It 's not quite clear . "
One thing is clear .
This is un-American .
This is n't Havana .
What 's next ?
No yelling ?
No grumbling ?
No heavy sighing ?
How are students supposed to effect change at their school ?
Morse - code flashlights ?
And if they can censor students at the stadium , what 's to keep them from doing it on The Lawn ?
And if we 're worried about a " positive game - day environment , " should n't Groh be held to it , too ?
Remind me :
What 's so " positive " about 52 - 7 ?
This Saturday , the Cavs play Richmond and they 'll be wearing special throwback jerseys .
Seems superfluous .
Virginia 's already a throwback .
To 1775 .
Here 's what Virginia students should do for every home game from now on : Bring signs that say nothing .
Bring signs that say , " This Is Not a Sign . "
Or bring 60,00 signs and let the athletic department goons try to sort them out .
Because sometimes rebellion is n't just a good thing .
It 's the only thing .

‘ If Falun Gong is benign , why is the Chinese government afraid of it ? ’
After nine years of persecution this basic question remains common .
I ’ll try answering it here .
In the 80s , Chinese parks brimmed at dawn with some 200 million people performing slow - movement exercises known as qigong .
In 1992 Master Li Hongzhi introduced Falun Gong , outwardly a qigong practise like any other .
But Master Li uniquely placed emphasis not on healing or supernormal abilities , but on self - cultivation towards spiritual perfection .
Falun Gong became an almost instant hit .
Master Li travelled through China introducing the practise and its principles .
Word of Falun Gong spread quickly , and it could soon be found in thousands of parks .
The Chinese embassy in Paris invited Master Li to teach in their auditorium , and an official study found that Falun Gong saved the country millions in health costs .
Fast - forward to July 1999 and suddenly Falun Gong is public enemy number one .
Practitioners are sentenced to ‘ reform through labour ’ camps where they are starved , beaten , and tortured with electric batons .
By 2008 , there are over 3,000 documented cases of practitioners killed by state persecution .
Increasingly solid evidence suggests many more have been targeted as unwilling donors of kidneys , livers , and hearts .
How many more , we have no idea .
Why , then , this bizarre persecution ?
Weak explanations
Facing international criticism and domestic sympathy for Falun Gong , the ruling Chinese Communist Party scrambled to rationalise its campaign .
It has claimed Falun Gong is a menace to society - a superstitious , foreign - driven , tightly organised , dangerous group of meditators .
State - run media tell gruesome stories of mutilation and suicide , but outsiders are n’t allowed to examine them .
When investigators somehow manage to scrutinize such cases , they find stories of individuals who do n’t exist and crimes committed by people who have nothing to do with Falun Gong .
Human Rights
Watch simply calls the official claims ‘ bogus ’ .
Some Western academics have suggested Party leaders feared Falun Gong because it reminded them of past religions - turned - rebellions .
But the broad - brush parallels ignored how bloody those groups were – the often - referenced Taiping , for example , was responsible for 20 million deaths .
Falun Gong has been strictly non-violent and had no rebellious plans .
One final flawed explanation is that the April 25 , 1999 gathering of 10,000 Falun Gong practitioners in the political heart of Beijing startled Party leaders and triggered the oppression that followed .
But the peaceful demonstration actually came after three years of escalating state oppression already taking place .
In fact , it was a direct response to practitioners being arrested and beaten in nearby Tianjin and a smear media campaign against them .
The individual leader explanation
The incident was pivotal , but for different reasons .
That April day , Premier Zhu Rongji engaged members of the gathered group and listened to their grievances .
Those arrested were released .
Practitioners who were there told me they had felt elated about the open communication between the government and its people .
But that night , then Chairman Jiang Zemin rebuffed Zhu ’s conciliatory stance .
He labelled Falun Gong a threat to the Party and said it would be an international loss of face if Falun Gong were not immediately crushed .
Indeed , many experts attribute the campaign to Jiang ’s obsession with Falun Gong as much as any other factor .
The popularity explanation
What appears to have scared Jiang and other Party hardliners ( some who are still in top posts , maintaining the campaign ) was how popular and cross-social strata Falun Gong had become .
In northern cities , workers practised Falun Gong together in factory yards before heading to the machines .
Professors and students meditated on Tsinghua University lawns .
Party leaders ’ wives and senior cadres had their own little group in central Beijing .
This fear of Falun Gong ’s popularity explains why its main text , Zhuan Falun , was banned from publication weeks after becoming a bestseller in 1996 .
And why , when a government report estimated there were more Falun Gong practitioners ( 70 million plus ) than Party members , security agents began interrupting exercise sessions .
The predatory Party - state explanation
For decades the Party has persecuted different groups – intellectuals , artists , clergy , conservatives , reformists – through political movements .
Some are targeted because they are outside Party control or have their own ideology .
Falun Gong , with its spiritual teachings , sense of community , and independent network falls into that category .
Others are targeted when Party leaders manoeuvre to align power to themselves .
Falun Gong appears to be a victim of that , too , as the persecution provided an excuse for strengthening state security apparatuses .
It gave the Party an opportunity to oil its machinery - from Cultural Revolution - style purges to Internet surveillance systems .
As torture survivor Zhao Ming told me in Dublin , ‘ the Party ’s machinery of persecution was there - Jiang pushed the button ’ .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Authorities on Thursday halted all traffic running through the 50 - kilometer ( 30 - mile ) Chunnel after a fire broke out inside the tunnel , which runs between Britain and France underneath the English Channel , Eurotunnel and fire officials said .
The fire started on a shuttle train carrying freight as it approached France , Eurotunnel said .
No passenger trains were going through the tunnel at the time of the fire .
The fire continued to burn nearly four hours later , according to Georges Bos , the prefecture of France 's Pas de Calais region .
French rail authorities said the tunnel will be closed at least until Friday morning .
The French Interior Ministry said some people were injured in the incident , but did not specify how many or the nature of their injuries .
Bos told BFM - TV that six people suffered from smoke inhalation .
The fire broke out around 2:55 p.m. ( 9:55 a.m. ET ) -- reportedly on one of the trucks being shuttled by the train -- about 11 kilometers ( 7 miles ) from France , officials said .
Thirty - two people were evacuated through a central service tunnel that runs between the east and west tubes , Kent fire officials said .
Were you on the train ?

Eurotunnel authorities suspended services in both directions to allow emergency vehicles to get to the fire .
The tunnel closure will affect thousands of travelers , according to Simon Montague , a spokesman for the Eurostar train system .
" Probably at the order of 2,000 who were actually in transit , and several more thousands who would 've been hoping to travel with us tonight , " he said .
" Obviously our highest priority tonight is to help those travelers who have not been able to complete their journeys . "
The tunnel runs through England 's Kent County and police there may have to implement " Operation Stack " -- in which trucks that are waiting to be shuttled through the tunnel would be lined up on the M20 highway .
People who were planning on driving along that route are being asked to " delay or vary " their travel , according to the Kent police Web site .
Eurostar issued a statement Thursday night saying that service will be suspended Friday , and passengers holding tickets for Friday " are advised not to travel . "
Passengers can exchange their tickets for travel on a later date or get a refund .
Watch options for stranded travelers »
Those holding tickets for Saturday or Sunday travel should check Eurostar 's Web site for updates , the company said .
The $ 15 billion undersea tunnel opened in 1994 and has drastically reduced land / sea travel time between Great Britain and mainland Europe .
A massive fire broke out inside the tunnel in November 1996 , causing structural damage but no serious injuries .
A truck on a Eurotunnel lorry shuttle caught fire before the train entered the tunnel , and the fire spread to nearby cars .
That fire was caused by the vehicle 's traction system and had " nothing to do with the cargo or the people , " according to Colin Brown , director of engineering at the Institute of Mechanical Engineers .
" It will be very interesting if we have the same issue , I doubt that we will , " Brown told CNN .
" My expectation is this will be a different issue . "
He said " it 's too soon to speculate " on what the cause might be .
" The key thing to come back to is nobody 's been hurt , the safety systems have worked , " he said .
King Hussein of Jordan
By Nigel Ashton
Yale , 431 pages , $ 35
Lion of Jordan
By Avi Shlaim
Knopf , 723 pages , $ 35
Of all the heroes and villains in the Middle East drama over the past 50 years , King Hussein of Jordan was by far the most complex character .
Two biographies of Hussein bin Talal ( 1935 - 99 ) aim to capture the intrigue and drama surrounding him from the moment that , at age 15 in 1951 , he watched his grandfather , King Abdullah , shot dead by a Palestinian gunman on the steps of the Al - Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem for attempting to make peace with Israel .
Forty - four years later , as Jordan 's ruler , Hussein would return to Jerusalem for the funeral of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , who himself had been assassinated for signing an Israeli - Jordanian peace treaty .
As Nigel Ashton 's " King Hussein of Jordan " and Avi Shlaim 's " Lion of Jordan " make clear , the intervening years saw one of the most extraordinary political high - wire acts in modern history .
Both books are written by professors of international relations , and both draw on new source material .
Mr. Ashton had access to Hussein 's private papers , including the king 's secret correspondence with not only the U.S. and Britain but also Israel .
Mr. Ashton , however , did n't begin work on " King Hussein of Jordan " until after his subject 's death nine years ago from non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .
He thus never met Hussein , and the book suffers as a result from a certain dryness .

MONTGOMERY - With Hurricane
Ike pushing gas prices above $ 5 today , Gov. Bob Riley late this afternoon declared a state of emergency for Alabama , triggering a price - gouging law .
Riley cited the U.S. Department of Energy 's prediction that gasoline and other energy shortages will likely occur in Alabama because of Hurricane Ike .
The state law that prohibits " unconscionable pricing " of items for sale or rent takes effect when the governor has declared a state of emergency .
Earlier in the day , the governor 's office noted that an Alabama governor 's ability to declare a state of emergency was very limited .
By law , an Alabama governor cannot declare a state of emergency unless there has been or there is anticipated to be an attack on the United States , a natural disaster of major proportions affecting Alabama or a public health emergency .
" I believe this new information means a threat to public health is a strong possibility due to the shortage of fuels , " said Riley .
" I deem it an emergency . "
On October 3 , 2008 , President George W. Bush signed the $ 700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act ( EESA ) of 2008 after Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson asked Congress to approve a bailout to buy mortgage - backed securities that were in danger of defaulting .
By doing so , Paulson wanted to take these debts off the books of the banks , hedge funds , and pension funds that held them .
His goal was to renew confidence in the functioning of the global banking system and end the financial crisis .﻿﻿
Troubled Assets Relief Program
The bill established the Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) , which was originally designed around a reverse auction .
Troubled banks would submit a bid price to sell their assets to TARP , and each auction was to be for a particular asset class .
TARP administrators would select the lowest price for each asset class to ensure that the government did n't pay too much for distressed assets .
However , this did n't happen because it took too long to develop the auction program .﻿﻿
On October 14 , 2008 , the Treasury Department used $ 105 billion in TARP funds to launch the Capital Purchase Program , which purchased preferred stock in the eight leading banks .
By the time TARP expired on October 3 , 2010 , Treasury had used the funds in four other areas :﻿﻿
$ 67.8 billion to the $ 182 billion bailout of insurance giant American International Group ( AIG )
$ 80.7 billion to bail out the Big Three auto companies
$ 20 billion to the Federal Reserve for the Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility , which lent money to its member banks so they could continue offering credit to homeowners and businesses
$ 75 billion to help homeowners refinance or restructure their mortgages with the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan
The Treasury disbursed $ 440 billion of TARP funds in total and , by 2018 , it had put $ 442.6 billion back .
It did this by nationalizing companies when prices were low and selling them when prices were high .
President Barack Obama could have used more of the $ 700 billion , but he did n't want to bail out more banks .
Instead , he launched the $ 787 billion Economic Stimulus Package .
The bill required the president to develop a plan to recoup losses from the financial industry if needed .​
As a result , the taxpayer was never at risk of losing $ 700 billion .﻿﻿
More Than Just TARP
On September 20 , 2008 , Secretary Paulson submitted a three - page proposal to the House of Representatives , but many in the House felt it was forcing taxpayers to reward bad banking decisions .
Supporters added many safeguards to try and get the bill to pass , but the House voted against it on September 29 , 2008 .
As a result , global markets plummeted .
The Dow fell 777.68 points during intraday trading — the most significant single - day point drop ever at the time .
The Senate reintroduced the proposal by attaching it to a bill that was already under consideration , and the House also approved that version on October 3 , 2008 .
The final act included other much - needed oversights , but the most important was help for homeowners facing foreclosure .
It required the Treasury to both guarantee home loans and assist homeowners in adjusting mortgage terms through HOPE NOW .
It also increased the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit for bank deposits to $ 250,000 per account and allowed them to tap federal funds as needed through 2009 .
That allayed any fears that the agency itself might go bankrupt .﻿﻿
The bill allowed the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) to suspend the mark - to - market rule , which forced banks to keep their mortgages valued at present - day levels .
This meant that bad loans had to be valued at less than their probable true worth and could not have been resold in the panic - stricken climate of 2008 .
EESA included an extension of the Alternative Minimum Tax patch , tax credits for research and development , and relief for hurricane survivors .
The Senate vote gave the bailout plan new life with these tax breaks and kept six other provisions added by the House : ﻿﻿
An oversight committee to review the Treasury 's purchase and sale of mortgages — comprised of Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke , and the leaders of the SEC , Federal Home Finance Agency , and Department of Housing and Urban Development
Bailout installments , starting with $ 250 billion
The ability for the Treasury to negotiate a government equity stake in companies that received bailout assistance
Limits on executive compensation of rescued firms
Government - sponsored insurance of assets in troubled firms
A requirement that the president proposes legislation to recoup losses from the financial industry if any still existed after five years
Why the Bailout Bill Was Necessary
On September 16 , 2008 , the $ 62.6 billion Reserve Primary Fund was under attack as investors were taking out money too fast .
They worried that the Fund would go bankrupt due to its investments in Lehman Brothers .
The next day , businesses pulled a record $ 140 billion out of money market accounts and moved the funds to Treasury bills , causing yields to drop to zero .
Money market accounts had been considered one of the safest investments .
To stem the panic , the U.S. Treasury Department agreed to insure money market funds for a year .
The SEC banned short - selling financial stocks until October 2 to reduce volatility in the stock market .﻿﻿
The U.S. government bought these bad mortgages because banks were afraid to lend to each other .
This fear caused Libor rates to be much higher than the fed funds rate and sent stock prices plummeting .
Financial firms were unable to sell their debt , and without the ability to raise capital , these firms were in danger of going bankrupt , which is what happened to Lehman Brothers .
It would have happened to the AIG and Bear Stearns without federal intervention .
Congress debated the pros and cons of such a massive intervention .
Political leaders wanted to protect the taxpayer , but they also did n't want to let businesses off the hook for making bad decisions .
However , most in Congress recognized the need to act swiftly to avoid a further financial meltdown .
With banks afraid to disclose their bad debt , it became a case of fear feeding on fear — which would have led to a downgrade in their debt rating , a decline in their stock price , and an inability to raise capital .
The rumors and resulting panic locked up the credit markets .
Alternative Options
When the bill was introduced , many legislators were against it and proposed other ideas .
Here are some and their probable impacts :
Buy Mortgages
John McCain proposed having the government buy $ 300 billion in mortgages from homeowners who were in danger of foreclosing , which would have reduced the number of toxic mortgages on banks ' balance sheets .
It could have even helped stop falling housing prices by reducing foreclosures , but it did n't address the credit crisis , which was caused by banks being afraid to lend to each other and their consequent hoarding of cash .﻿﻿
Cut Taxes for Banks
The Republican Study Committee ( RSC ) proposed suspending the capital gains tax for two years , allowing banks to sell assets without being taxed .
Unfortunately , it was losses on assets that were the issue , not gains .
The RSC proposed transitioning Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to private companies and stabilizing the dollar , but neither of those addressed the credit crisis .
On the other hand , the RSC 's proposal to suspend mark - to - market accounting would have alleviated bank write - down of assets sooner .
The U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board eased the rule in 2009 .
Do Nothing
Some suggested just letting the markets run their course .
In that scenario , many businesses around the world would have likely shut down due to a lack of credit — creating a global depression .
The large - scale unemployment could have led to riots or another Great Depression .
Ms. Murkowski said Democrats had demanded significant changes , including measures to require more environmental study and to give the interior secretary discretion to determine whether the project was in the “ public interest . ”
Opponents , however , say the bill as they interpret it essentially directs the secretary to find that the proposal is in the public interest .
If that were to happen , the road could be financed by the state using money from the federal Highway Trust Fund , instead of an earmark , according to state transportation officials and Ms. Murkowski ’s office .
The road is not currently in the state transportation financing plan .
Versions of the bill have cleared key committees in the House and Senate and await floor votes .
However , given the economic bailout plans Congress is considering , the prospect of a measure passing this year “ looks grim , ” said Bill Wicker , a spokesman for the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources .
Image
If the road is not approved this year , it will not be the first time .
In 1998 , the Clinton administration opposed the road , being pushed by the Alaska delegation , and instead brokered a $ 37 million deal to provide a hovercraft across Cold Bay to improve transportation for medical evacuations ; the plan also upgraded a medical center in King Cove .
But the hovercraft just started operating last year , and residents say weather and high costs make its use unpredictable .
The local government also says it costs about $ 100,000 a month to operate .
Opponents of the road , however , say it , too , may be unusable in foul weather and they note that the hovercraft has conducted medical evacuations since it came into use .
Residents say the road is a matter of public and economic health .
“ They say those people over there will be killing all the ducks and ruining the environment and decimating the country , ” said Mayor Stanley Mack of the Aleutians East Borough , much of whose population is Native Aleut and Yupik .
“ Where do you get off saying that ?
We ’ve been out here for 4,000 years , protecting the country . ”
The Izembek National Wildlife Refuge has long been overshadowed by its northern cousin , the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , and the fight over building the gravel road has lacked the political tension of the fight over drilling for oil .
But environmental groups have also long felt that building a road , on an isthmus between two wildlife - rich lagoons in the refuge , would threaten the welfare of a dwindling caribou herd and hundreds of thousands of migratory birds , including Pacific black brant and the threatened Steller ’s eider .

Remember Whitney Harper ?
She was that 16 year old who did n’t know that downloading MP3 ’s from Kazaa was illegal and she pleaded ignorance when the RIAA set their hound dogs on her .
It actually worked because the judge ordered that she only had to pay $ 200 per song instead of $ 750 .
Well the RIAA has now apparently decided that the judge ’s award of $ 200 per song is totally unacceptable and they have told the judge to shove his $ 7,400 up where the sun do n’t shine .
Instead they have decided to force the whole matter to a federal jury trial and let the jury decide how much the RIAA deserves ( I ’m praying they award them $ 1 !
That would be poetic justice ! ) .
This decision just shows the RIAA ’s hypocrisy .
All along they have said that it ’s not about the money , that instead it ’s about teaching those darn downloaders a lesson .
If that ’s really the case , then why not just take the $ 7,400 ?
I do n’t think Whitney will be doing any more downloading anytime soon .
But to drag her now through a jury trial and rack up even more legal costs ?
That is just downright vindictiveness , nothing more , nothing less .
Why do n’t they just form the firing squad , put her against the wall and get the whole thing over with ?

Trying to appear moderate is not always the best strategy for capturing votes during an election , reveals a new study .
Extreme positions can build trust among an electorate , who value ideological commitment in times of uncertainty .
" The current political advantage of the Republican Party stems from the ability of its candidates to develop ' signature ideas . '
This strategy is rewarded even when the electorate has ideological reservations , " says University of Southern California economist Juan Carrillo , adding that this poses a challenge for the Democrats .
In the current issue of The Economic Journal , Carrillo and Micael Castanheira of the Université Libre de Bruxelles ( Belgium ) , show that voters who are unsure about the quality of a policy can be swayed by indications of trustworthiness .
As Carrillo explains , many tend to believe that a candidate 's platforms should be tailored to appeal to voters , particularly swing voters .
Instead , this research shows that instead of swinging voters , candidates should try to swing ideas by offering higher - quality positions that may be less popular .
In the United States , holding strong positions has already been shown to work on a few issues that have an ideological component , such as abortion and the death penalty , Carrillo notes .
" A rational electorate is reluctant to support someone who does not exhibit commitment to some ideology , " Carrillo says .
" Voters rightly perceive that someone without ideological commitment cannot have developed a valuable political program .
They reason that , ' If you tell me what I want to hear , it probably means that you do n't have any ideas of your own to share . ' "
Carrillo and Castanheira 's paper is an important challenge to the widely accepted median voter theorem .
In the median voter theorem , voters who are fully informed will use their understanding when casting a ballot , choosing the platform that is closest to their own beliefs .
Thus , it stands to reason that to attract the majority of votes , parties should try to appeal to the majority of voters .
But , as the researchers point out , it is rare for a voter to be fully informed in real life .
More likely , voters will have incomplete and sometimes inaccurate information about how left - leaning or right - leaning stances actually translate into high quality proposals for , say , withdrawing troops safely or reforms .
This information comes from the press and other sources , such as campaign advertisements .
" To attract a majority of votes , parties cannot simply try to appear ' median . '
Quite the contrary , " Carrillo says .
" Winning an election is generally about crafting a convincing philosophy that the electorate will view as superior to that of the opponents . "
The researchers point to several real - life examples , including the 1995 Belgian election .
According to the authors , the VLD – a traditionally right - wing party – sought the opinion of voters on a number of key issues and pledged to follow popular will if elected .
The experiment failed .
Four years later , the VLD returned to a rightist platform , and their candidate was elected prime minister .

Police have halted a wedding between a seven - year - old boy and a five - year - old girl in Pakistan , arresting the Muslim cleric officiating at the ceremony and the children 's parents .
A police raid prevented the cleric from going ahead with the ceremony in Karachi , which was attended by 100 guests , said the deputy superintendent of police , Malik Mazhar .
Pakistani law forbids marriage below the age of 18 , but some Muslim scholars deem it permissible if the bride and groom have reached puberty .
TV footage showed both children in traditional wedding clothes in the laps of policemen after the raid .
The girl , called Nisha , had tears running down her cheeks .
According to a report on Express News TV , the parents said the wedding had been arranged to end an eight - year feud between the two families .
Mazhar said he had heard about similar cases in rural areas but " it is shocking to have this right in the centre of the city " .
The parents would be brought before a court tomorrow , he said .
A Pakistan human rights commission official , Hina Gillani , said the maximum possible punishment for the parents was one month in jail and a fine equivalent to about £ 6 .
If you must break the law , do it to seize power : in all other cases observe it .

In 2000 , the long fought for and long admired democracy of the United States of America began a slow and steady decline toward fascism - a Bush family tradition - with the installment of a president - a man the citizens overwhelmingly rejected ( although the funny math told a still believed myth ) - by a few corrupt judges on the US Supreme Court .
That coup is now nearly complete and checkmate is all but unavoidable .
Let me first point you to the Bush administration 's so - called Wall Street bailout bill , here , so that you can see for yourself that this treachery is being conducted in the light of day .
Fascism is finally and formally out of the right - wing closet even if the F word is not yet openly being used ( although it should be , and often ) .
Now , if you do not yet understand that the Wall Street crisis is a man-made disaster done through intentional deregulation and corruption , I have a bridge in Alaska to sell to you ( or Sara Palin does anyway ) .
This manufactured crisis is now to be remedied , if the fiscal fascists get their way , with the total transfer of Congressional powers ( the few that still remain ) to the Executive Branch and the total transfer of public funds into corporate ( via government as intermediary ) hands .
Adam Davidson of NPR blogs about the so - called bailout bill as follows :
I would guess that this has to be one of the biggest peacetime transfers of power from Congress to the Administration in history .
( Anyone know ? ) .
Certainly one of the most concise .
The Treasury Secretary can buy broadly defined assets , on any terms he wants , he can hire anyone he wants to do it and can appoint private sector companies as financial deputies of the US government .
And he can write whatever regulation he thinks are needed .
Most importantly , Davidson points to this passage in the bill :
Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion , and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency .
The Bush family , in the form of Prescott Bush , has tried a more aggressive coup before in order to install fascism in this country .
This treasonous plot was called " the Business Plot , " because the high - level plotters - including Prescott Bush - were Wall Street men who openly supported fascism .
It seems this time around , the Bush family is trying the more subtle approach to open bloodshed : first create a crisis , then under the guise of addressing that crisis , overthrow democracy .
Yes , it does sound terribly conspiracy - theory - esque when explained just this way .
But what else does one call a criminal conspiracy to destroy Congressional powers permanently , alter Judicial powers permanently , and steal public funds ?
As I see it now , we have but two options and I have long alluded to hoping against hope that one of these options would not be the only one left to a peaceful people .
The first and frankly most preferable option is for Congress to immediately begin impeachment proceedings against the members of this latest Business Plot .
No time needs to be wasted on hearings as we already now have in writing , formally as presented to Congress , the intentions of this administration to nullify Congressional powers permanently , to alter Judicial powers permanently , and to openly steal public funds using as blackmail the total collapse of the US economy if these powers are not handed over .
You do see how this is blackmail , do you not ?
You do see how this is a manufactured crisis precisely designed to be used as blackmail , do you not ?
The other option , the one I have long prayed we would never need to even consider , is a total revolution .
But ,
If Congress wo n't act in its own self - defense , in the defense of democracy , in defense of us - the people who have elected them to protect us from this very danger - then what is left for us to do ?
I do n't want to see it come down to this , but I fear that it will .
Put your party politics aside right now .
We are in a crisis so dangerous that should these people succeed in their coup , your party affiliation will no longer matter , your American flag will be a nice collectible item of something that once was , and your version of God will be worshiped in secrecy because your freedoms will be owned by the few .
You are no longer Republicans , Democrats , or any shade of voter .
You do not live in a swing state or a solid colored state .
You are simply this : an American .
That is the only side that matters .
So call your members of Congress and demand , no , declare that unless they do their duty to the Constitution and to us , we will move to the streets - not because we want to , but because our founding fathers demanded this duty of each and every citizen in the face of such a domestic enemy .
Demand - as is your right - that this bill be voted against and demand - as is your right - that the people plotting this treachery be held to account .
We are either a nation of laws or we are no longer a democracy .
Pick a side , because there wo n't be another time , another moment , another chance to be a patriot .

The critics of the deal say India will gain little by embracing Washington
The Indo - US civil nuclear agreement , signed by President Bush after being approved by the US Congress , ends India 's nuclear isolation and recognises the world 's largest democracy as the de facto sixth nuclear power .
It is a historic breakthrough for India , which struggled against sanctions and denials of high technology as a nuclear pariah for more than three decades because it refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) and developed a weapons programme .
India won the recognition largely on its own terms and against strong opposition from the advocates of non-proliferation who saw the agreement as a blow to the NPT .
Under the deal , Delhi can keep its nuclear weapons and also buy nuclear fuel and technology for its civilian energy needs .
India got to have its cake and eat it too because the world recognised its huge energy needs , its growing strategic eminence in Asia and its clean non-proliferation record .
Crucial
The fact that nuclear energy is increasingly seen as a cleaner alternative also helped convince some countries whose approval was needed to get the deal past the 45 nation Nuclear Suppliers Group ( NSG ) which regulates nuclear commerce .
But in the end the personal commitment of the US President George Bush , who pushed critics both at home and abroad to accept the agreement , was crucial .
The passage of the deal represents a rare foreign policy victory for President Bush whose other adventures abroad have been less than successful .
In India he will be remembered for daring to go against 34 years of established US policy and for transforming India - US relations as a result .
The deal gives India access to US civilian nuclear technology
The US president spent major political capital convincing recalcitrant senators on Capitol Hill and other sceptical government of the importance of the nuclear deal with India .
Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh too went against the ingrained anti-Americanism of the Indian intelligentsia to push the nuclear agreement , putting the survival of his coalition government on the line .
While American non-proliferation hardliners condemn the deal , saying President Bush gave away the store and set a bad example , Indian critics claim India gained little for embracing the United States .
Clearly , both can not be right .
What is clear is that the old rules have been changed for the sake of one country and that in itself is pregnant with enormous geopolitical importance .
The fact that both China and Pakistan - India 's traditional rivals - opposed the deal means there is something India is getting that they are not .
The nuclear agreement will bring India and the United States even closer as the once estranged democracies become more engaged on common interests in Asia and the world .
The deal represents a major paradigm shift for both countries and fits neatly into their respective strategic visions .
Countering China
By helping India gain more strategic space , Washington is trying to ensure an Asia not dominated by any single country , mainly China .
India , by coming closer to Washington , increases its options in an increasingly inter-dependent world .
Not surprisingly , China was unhappy about the Indo - US nuclear deal and commentaries in official media questioned the wisdom of breaking international rules for a single country as the agreement was negotiated and cleared various hoops over the past three years .
PM Manmohan
Singh has campaigned strongly for the deal China 's unhappiness came to the fore when the US won a waiver for India from the strict rules of the Nuclear Suppliers Group .
It took a very strong letter from President Bush to the Chinese President Hu Jintao to end the delaying tactics of Chinese diplomats at the NSG last month , officials said .
The NSG waiver on 6 September was the most important international breakthrough because it opened many doors to India .
Ironically , the NSG was created in response to India 's first nuclear test in 1974 and strengthened over the years to curb technology from spreading .
India can now buy nuclear technology from all major suppliers such as France , Britain and Russia , not just the US .
Last week , the first fruits were already visible when Prime Minister Singh signed an agreement with France during a visit to Paris .
An agreement for more reactors from Russia is expected later this year .
' Maginificent bequest ' India plans to build 18 to 20 nuclear reactors at an estimated cost of $ 30 bn .
Ashley J Tellis , one of the architects of the deal , described the opening of the entire international nuclear market to Delhi as President Bush 's most magnificent bequest to India .
This is important in light of what Indian critics and officials maintain are areas of concern in the nuclear deal as approved by the US Congress .
Some say the deal with encourage proliferation Senators and Congressmen inserted riders and conditions limiting the scope of the deal as envisaged by President Bush and Prime Minister Singh .
The bill calls for termination of the agreement in case India conducts a nuclear test in the future .
It also says the US should prevail upon other countries to do the same .
Guaranteed fuel supplies for reactors the US builds for India are also in question .
US officials stress that Congressional demands are a statement of preference and that they are not binding .
The only document that India should worry about is the bilateral 123 agreement , which spells out the terms of nuclear cooperation between the two countries .
The signing of the agreement by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee , due to take place on Friday in Washington , will end three long years of negotiations and many difficult moments .

( CNN ) -- Kay Hagan erupted in anger Thursday over a television ad from Sen. Elizabeth Dole suggesting Hagan is " godless . "
" I think Elizabeth Dole has just gone to the lowest of the lows , " Hagan said of the ad during an appearance on a talk show on WPTF - AM in Raleigh , North Carolina .
" This is an attack on my Christian faith . "
Hagan , who described herself as a Sunday school teacher and an elder at a Presbyterian church in Greensboro , North Carolina , urged Dole to " pull this kind of despicable ad . "
Hagan , who is challenging Dole 's re-election bid , filed an application in a Wake County , North Carolina , court Thursday , seeking permission to file a complaint within 20 days , after the election is over .
" The advertisement purposely misstates facts about the plaintiff , " said the three - page application , which was filed in District Superior Court .
In the 30 - second ad , a narrator says that a leader of the Godless Americans Political Action Committee recently held a " secret fundraiser " for Hagan .
The ad then shows members of the group , which promotes rights for atheists and the separation of church and state , declaring that neither God nor Jesus exists .
" Godless Americans and Kay Hagan , " the ad continues .
" She hid from cameras .
Took ' Godless ' money .
What did Kay Hagan promise in return ? "
The ad ends with a picture of Hagan and a voice that sounds like hers declaring , " There is no God . "
But the application said Hagan never made that statement or accepted money from the group .
Lawyers representing Dole and her campaign defended the ad Thursday as " 100 percent factually accurate and truthful . "
The campaign for the GOP incumbent said it based its claims on Hagan 's attendance at a fundraiser in the home of a GAPAC adviser .
" Kay Hagan attended a fundraiser event in Massachusetts in September held in the home of two anti-religion activists , Wendy Kaminer and her lawyer husband , Woody Kaplan , " Dole 's attorneys said in a letter to Hagan 's lawyer .
They described Kaplan as a founder and advisory board member of the GAPAC .
The letter said Kaplan and Kaminer were advisory board members of The Secular Coalition for America , which it described as " the national lobby for atheists , humanists , freethinkers and other nontheistic Americans with the unique mission of protecting their civil rights . "
The lawyers also said Kaplan gave $ 2,300 to Hagan 's campaign .
" This is politics of the worst kind , and I know it has been rejected by North Carolinians at every level , " said Hagan .
Polls suggest Hagan -- a Democratic state senator from Greensboro who began the race at a major financial disadvantage to Dole -- is slightly ahead of the incumbent .

Grimsley died in February at 45 after he shot himself in the chest in what police ruled an accident .
Subsequent analysis of his brain tissue confirmed the presence of neurofibrillary tangles that had already begun to affect Grimsley ’s behavior and memory , said Dr. Ann C. McKee , an associate professor of neurology and pathology at the Boston University School of Medicine and a co-director of the new brain - study center .
Image John Grimsley , right , was found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy .
Credit ... Lou Witt / NFL
Of the six former N.F.L. players ’ brains that have been examined in this manner , Grimsley ’s was the fifth to be found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy , joining the former Philadelphia Eagles defensive back Andre Waters and the former Pittsburgh Steelers Mike Webster , Terry Long and Justin Strzelczyk .
( The condition can be confirmed only by post - mortem tissue analysis ; X -rays and magnetic resonance imaging tests cannot yet detect it . )
Because each player died relatively young , from 36 to 50 , they provided an opportunity to examine brain abnormalities that are exceedingly rare in someone of that age without a history of repetitive brain injury .
The only former N.F.L. player whose brain did not show C.T.E. was the former running back Damien Nash , who died last year at 24 after collapsing while playing basketball .
C.T.E. , believed to result from trauma endured over many years , has almost never been found in anyone that young .
“ I ’ve seen thousands of brains of individuals with neurogenerative diseases and debilitating diseases , ” McKee said .
“ I can say this is identical to the pugilistica dementia that I ’ve seen in boxers in their 70s and 80s .
It ’s milder because the patients are younger .
But once triggered , it seems to progress .
The people that develop this disease , most of them show symptoms 10 or 20 years after retirement .
It progresses inexorably until death . ”
As each case of C.T.E. in a former player has come to light , N.F.L. officials have contended that they are isolated incidents from which no conclusions can be drawn , often because there are no documented medical histories of the players ’ concussions in the N.F.L. or otherwise .
Players at all levels of football are known to not reveal their concussions for fear of being removed from games or being seen as weak .
At a league conference on concussions in June 2007 , Commissioner Roger Goodell pointed to the lack of concussion documentation from Strzelczyk ’s career and said , “ There ’s no record he may have had a concussion swimming . ”
He added : “ A concussion happens in a variety of different activities . ”
I keep up to date on Internet Explorer development for two reasons .
Firstly , most users are on Internet Explorer .
Secondly , browser innovation and competition is fascinating .
Anyone who thought browsers were mature a few years ago is now being proven very wrong .
And so I present some of the most interesting additions in IE8 .
( ( If you want to follow IE8 development , check out IEBlog .
It ’s nice to see Microsoft opening up their development process on such a vital piece of software . ) )
Seeing Microsoft compete on browser UI is interesting .
They ’re incorporating ideas from Google Chrome so fast , it ’s like they came up with them independently .
( ( Update : To be clear , IE8 Beta 2 came out 6 days before Chrome Beta 1 was released .
It really is possible they came up independently , but doubtful .
My bet is that Microsoft knew what Google was working on ( a lot of people internally at Google had seen Chrome ) , and of course Google had seen IE8 Beta 1 . ) )
Ha ha , just kidding .
IE8 users will notice :
Chrome ’s New Tab Page
Chrome and Safari’s Private Browsing Mode
Opera and Firefox ’s Automatic crash recovery
Somewhere between Chrome ’s and Firefox ’s Address Bar with search suggestions .
( ( I should give them some credit here .
Their implementation has what I think is a real innovation , which is the ability to delete any potentially scandalous history items from within the suggestion bar .
I love to see location bar innovation . ) )
Tab Grouping with automatic colour - coding - probably the most original and the weirdest thing they ’ve added to IE8
Okay , so it looks like they ’ve taken enough from other browsers to get users to upgrade .
This is good news , since the developer - side improvement from IE7 to IE8 will be a bigger jump than we ’ve seen this century .
Microsoft has been busily ( and sometimes controversially ) announcing standards - oriented developer features :
Adding Compatibility View , where developers or users can tell IE8 to emulate IE7
Adding the new developer tools that I posted about recently
Coming much closer to CSS 2.1 than IE7 was ; in my testing maybe 90 % closer
Prefixing all non-standardized CSS properties with - ms ; even CSS3 ones like word - wrap
Working on some performance gains , albeit nothing compared to The Other Guys
At the end of the day , it ’s a great time to be a web developer , since the lowest common denominator is rising .
It ’s also a great time to be a web user , since Safari , Firefox , and Chrome developers will have to push that much harder to stay ahead in the new browser wars .
How to have sweet dreams ... simply smell the roses
Bloomin ' lovely : Women who smelt roses in a study had sweeter dreams than usual
Sweet dreams are made of flowers , according to researchers .
Scientists say tests have shown that sleeping with roses in your bedroom may provoke pleasant dreams .
During a study , the scent of the blooms were pumped under the noses of 15 sleeping women for ten seconds over 30 nights .
The volunteers were then woken up and asked to record their dreams - which proved to be more pleasant than normal .
Further analysis showed that the smells had an affect on the emotions of the dreams but did not become part of the dream as women exposed to roses did not dream about roses .
Similar tests showed that the rancid smell of rotten eggs provoked negative feelings in their dreams .
The majority of the sleeping women who were in the Rapid Eye Movement part of their sleep said the eggs had provoked bad feelings in their dream .
The German researchers said it would be interesting to study nightmare sufferers and suggested a possible treatment of positive smells that could influence the mood of their dreams .
Parenting groups are also interested in the link between teenager 's smelly bedrooms and grumpy mood swings .
The average adult dreams for two hours a night , which adds up to around six years during a person 's lifetime .
The findings were presented at the 2008 American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery Foundation Annual Meeting in Chicago yesterday .
Editor 's Note :
This article was originally published in the February 1995 issue of Scientific American .
We are reposting it this week because Robert Tijan has just been named president of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute .
Asthma , cancer , heart disease , immune disorders and viral infections are seemingly disparate conditions .
Yet they turn out to share a surprising feature .
All arise to a great extent from overproduction or underproduction of one or more proteins , the molecules that carry out most reactions in the body .
This realization has recently lent new urgency to research aimed at understanding , and ultimately manipulating , the fascinating biochemical machinery that regulates an essential step in protein synthesis : the transcription of genes .
For a protein to be generated , the gene that specifies its composition must be transcribed , or copied , from DNA into strands of messenger RNA , which later serve as the templates from which the protein is manufactured .
Even before therapy became a goal , transcription had long captivated scientists for another reason : knowledge of how this process is regulated promises to clarify some central mysteries of life .
Each cell in the body contains the same genome , the complement of some 150,000 genes that form the blueprint for a human being .
How is it that the original cell of an organism — the fertilized egg — gives rise to a myriad of cell types , each using somewhat different subsets of those genes to produce different mixtures of proteins ?
And how do the cells of a fully formed body maintain themselves , increasing and decreasing the amounts of proteins they manufacture in response to their own needs and those of the larger organism ?
To answer these questions and design drugs able to modulate transcription , investigators need to know something about the makeup of the apparatus that controls reading of the genetic code in human cells .
After some 25 years of exploration , the overall structure of that apparatus is becoming clear .
Work in my laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley and at other institutions has revealed that one part of the apparatus — the engine driving transcription of most , if not all , human genes — consists of some 50 distinct proteins .
These proteins must assemble into a tight complex on DNA before a special enzyme , RNA polymerase , can begin to copy DNA into messenger RNA .
The putative constituents have now been combined in the test tube to yield a fully operational transcription engine .
Still other proteins essentially plug into receptive sockets on the engine and , in so doing , " program " it , telling it which genes should be transcribed and how quickly .
Critical details of these interactions are emerging as well .
Clues from Bacteria
When my colleagues and I at Berkeley began focusing on human genes in the late 1970s , little was known about the transcription machinery in our cells .
But studies begun early in that decade had provided a fairly clear picture of transcription in prokaryotes — bacteria and other primitive single - celled organisms that lack a defined nucleus .
That work eventually lent insight into human and other eukaryotic ( nucleated ) cells and helped to define features of transcription that hold true for virtually all organisms .
The bacterial research showed that genes are essentially divided into two functionally distinct regions .
The coding region specifies the sequence of amino acids that must be linked together to make a particular protein .
This sequence is spelled out by the nucleotides ( the building blocks of DNA ) in one strand of the DNA double helix ; the nucleotides are distinguished from one another by the nitrogen - rich base they carry — adenine ( A ) , thymine ( T ) , cytosine ( C ) or guanine ( G ) .
The other region of a gene has regulatory duties .
It controls the rate at which RNA polymerase transcribes the coding region of a gene into messenger RNA .
In bacteria , as in most prokaryotes , the regulatory region , called the promoter , resides within a stretch of nucleotides located a short distance — often as few as 10 nucleotides — in front of ( upstream from ) the start of the coding region .
For transcription to proceed accurately and efficiently , RNA polymerase must attach to the promoter .
Once it is so positioned , it slides over to the start of the coding region and rides along the DNA , like a train on a track , constructing an RNA replica of the coding sequence .
Except in very long genes , the number of RNA molecules made at any moment depends mainly on the rate at which molecules of RNA polymerase attach to the promoter and initiate transcription .
Interestingly , RNA polymerase is a rather promiscuous molecule , unable to distinguish between the promoter and other DNA sequences .
To direct the enzyme to promoters of specific genes , bacteria produce a variety of proteins , known as sigma factors , that bind to RNA polymerase .
The resulting complexes are able to recognize and attach to selected nucleotide sequences in promoters .
In this way , sigma factors program RNA polymerase to bypass all nonpromoter sequences and to linger only at designated promoters .
Considering the importance of sigma factors to the differential activation of genes in bacteria , my colleagues and I began our inquiry into the human transcription apparatus by searching for sigmalike molecules in human cells .
But we had underestimated the complexity of the machinery that had evolved to retrieve genetic information from our elaborate genome .
It soon became apparent that human sigma factors might not exist or might not take the same form as they do in bacteria .
Surprising Complexity
If there were no simple sigma factors in eukaryotes , how did such cells ensure that RNA polymerase transcribed the right genes at the right time and at the right rate ?
We began to see glimmerings of an answer once the unusual design of eukaryotic genes was delineated .
By 1983 investigators had established that three kinds of genetic elements , consisting of discrete sequences of nucleotides , control the ability of RNA polymerase to initiate transcription in all eukaryotes — from the single - celled yeast to complex multicellular organisms .
One of these elements , generally located close to the coding region , had been found to function much like a bacterial promoter .
Called a core promoter , it is the site from which the polymerase begins its journey along the coding region .
Many genes in a cell have similar core promoters .
Walter Schaffner of the University of Zurich and Steven Lanier McKnight of the Carnegie Institution of Washington , among others , had additionally identi fied an unusual set of regulatory elements called enhancers , which facilitate transcription .
These sequences can be located thousands of nucleotides upstream or downstream from the core promoter — that is , incredibly far from it .
And subsequent studies had uncovered the existence of silencers , which help to inhibit transcription and , again , can be located a long distance from the core promoter .
In a somewhat imperfect analogy , if the core promoter were the ignition switch of a car engine , enhancers would act as the accelerator , and silencers as the brakes .
Eukaryotic genes can include several enhancers and silencers , and two genes may contain some identical enhancer or silencer elements , but no two genes are precisely alike in the combination of enhancers and silencers they carry .
This arrangement enables cells to control transcription of every gene individually .
Discovery of these elements led to two related — and , at the time , highly surprising — conclusions .
It was evident that enhancers and silencers could not control the activity of RNA polymerase by themselves .
Presumably they served as docking sites for a large family of proteins .
The proteins that bound to enhancers and silencers — now called activators and repressors — then carried stimulatory or repressive messages directly or indirectly to RNA polymerase ( that is , pressed on the accelerator or on the brakes ) .
It also seemed likely that the rate at which a gene was transcribed would be dictated by the combined activity of all the proteins — or transcription factors — bound to its various regulatory elements .
A Human Factor Is Discovered
Nevertheless , we were hard - pressed to explain how proteins that bound to DNA sequences far from the core promoter of a gene could influence transcription of that gene .
As is true of other laboratories , we began attacking this puzzle by trying to isolate human transcription factors , none of which had yet been found ( with the exception of RNA polymerase itself ) .
We assumed that once we had pure copies of the factors we would be able to gain more insight into exactly how they function .
Because many proteins that bind to DNA play no role in reading genes , we could not find transcription factors efficiently by screening nuclear proteins solely according to their ability to associate with DNA .
My group therefore adopted a more discriminating strategy , looking for proteins that in a test - tube reaction both combined with DNA and stimulated transcription .
In 1982 William S. Dynan , a postdoctoral fellow in my laboratory , determined that some protein in a mixture of nuclear proteins fit all the requirements of a transcription factor .
It bound to a regulatory element common to a select set of genes — an enhancer sequence known as the GC box ( because of its abundance of G and C nucleotides ) .
More important , when added to a preparation of nuclear proteins that included RNA polymerase , the substance markedly increased the transcription only of genes carrying the GC box .
Thus , we had identified the first human transcription factor able to recognize a specific regulatory sequence .
We called it speci- ficity protein 1 ( Sp1 ) .
We immediately set out to purify the molecule .
One daunting aspect of this work was the fact that transcription factors tend to appear only in minuscule quantities in cells .
Typically , less than a thousandth of a percent of the total protein content of a human cell consists of any particular factor .
In 1985 James T. Kadonaga in my laboratory found a way to overcome this substantial technical barrier — and in the process introduced a powerful new tool that has since been used to purify countless transcription factors and other scarce DNA binding proteins .
Because Sp1 selectively recognized the GC box , Kadonaga synthesized DNA molecules composed entirely of that box and chemically anchored them to solid beads .
Then he passed a complex mixture of human nuclear proteins over the DNA , predicting that only Sp1 would stick to it .
True to plan , when he separated the bound proteins from the synthetic DNA , he had pure Sp1 .
From studies carried out by Mark Ptashne and his colleagues at Harvard University , we knew that bacterial transcription regulators are modular proteins , in which separate regions perform distinct tasks .
Once we learned the sequence of amino acids in Sp1 , we therefore looked for evidence of distinct modules and noted at least two interesting ones .
One end of the molecule contained a region that obviously folded up into three " zinc fingers . "
Zinc - finger structures , in which parts of a protein fold around a zinc atom , are now known to act as the " hooks " that attach many activator proteins to DNA .
But at the time Sp1 was only the second protein found to use them .
Aaron Klug and his colleagues at the Medical Research Council in England had discovered zinc fingers , in a frog transcription factor , just a short time before [ see " Zinc Fingers , " by Daniela Rhodes and Aaron Klug ; SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN , February 1993 ] .
The other end of Sp1 contained a domain consisting of two discrete segments filled with a preponderance of the amino acid glutamine .
We strongly suspected that this region played an important role during transcription because of a striking finding .
In test - tube experiments , mutant Sp1 molecules lacking the domain could bind to DNA perfectly well , but they failed to stimulate gene transcription .
This outcome indicated that Sp1 did not affect transcription solely by combining with DNA ; it worked by using its glutamine - rich segment — now known as an activation domain — to interact with some other part of the transcription machinery .
The question was , which part ?
In 1988 when we began searching for the target of Sp1 , we had some idea of where it lay .
Our guess was based on an emerging understanding of the so - called basal transcription complex , one part of which seemed to be a likely target .
Closing in on a Target
In the mid-1980s Robert G. Roeder and his colleagues at the Rockefeller University had shown that RNA polymerase cannot transcribe eukaryotic genes unless several other transcription factors — now called basal factors — also collect on the core promoter .
And over the course of the 1980s , Roeder 's laboratory and others had identified at least six of those essential factors , called A , B , D , E , F and H .
In a test tube , this assembly of factors enabled RNA polymerase to transcribe a bound gene at a basal — low and invariant —rate , but it could not by itself modulate that rate .
It was as if someone had constructed and switched on the engine of a car but had lost use of the steering wheel , the accelerator and the brakes .
For instance , when my group mixed the components of the complex ( including RNA polymerase ) with a gene containing a GC box , we obtained a low , unchanging level of transcription .
We saw a marked increase in transcription only when we incorporated Sp1 into the mixture .
By the late 1980s it was apparent that human cells harbor at least two separate classes of transcription factors .
Basal factors are required for initiation of transcription in all genes ; other proteins — activators and repressors — dictate the rate at which the basal complex initiates transcription .
Different genes are controlled by distinct combinations of activators and repressors .
We now suspect that in the body the basal complex arises spontaneously only rarely ; most of the time , cells depend on activators to initiate its construction .
These various discoveries suggested that the glutamine - rich domain of Sp1 enhanced transcription by contacting a basal factor .
More specifically , we suspected that Sp1 latched on to factor D , and facilitated its attachment to the promoter .
We focused on this subunit because Phillip A. Sharp and Stephen Buratowski of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had shown that it can land on the core promoter before all other basal factors and can facilitate assembly of the complete basal engine .
In fact , factor D is the only basal component able to recognize DNA .
It binds selectively to a sequence called the TATA box , found in the core promoters of many eukaryotic genes .
To pursue our hypothesis , we needed to know more about the composition of factor D , which we assumed was a solitary protein .
Other investigators also wanted to know its makeup , and so the race was on to attain pure copies .
Isolation from human cells proved more challenging than anyone anticipated .
Consequently , many groups eventually tried their luck with yeast cells .
Finally , in 1989 , several laboratories independently succeeded in isolating a yeast protein that displayed the expected properties of factor D . The protein , named TBP ( for TATA binding protein ) , recognized and bound selectively to the TATA box and led to a low level of transcription when it was joined at the core promoter by RNA polymerase and other constituents of the basal machinery .
Believing that the TBP protein was factor D itself , we undertook to test this idea in additional studies .
Once we did that , we intended to determine exactly which regions of TBP were contacted by Sp1 and other regulators .
Little did we know that we were about to be completely thwarted — and to make a critical discovery .
Unexpected Trouble
When B. Franklin Pugh in our laboratory replaced the impure preparations of factor D previously used in our test - tube reactions with purified molecules of TBP , he had no trouble replicating the earlier finding that such substitution in no way disrupted basal transcription .
To our surprise and consternation , though , he found that Sp1 was no longer able to influence the basal machinery .
We had to conclude that factor D and TBP were not , in fact , equivalent and that factor D actually consisted of TBP plus other subunits .
( It is now known that many transcription factors consist of more than one protein . )
Apparently , those subunits were not needed for operation of the basal machinery , but they were essential to regulation of that machinery by activators .
In other words , these additional components were not themselves activators , for they did not bind to specific sequences in DNA .
Nor were they basal factors , because low , unregulated levels of transcription could be achieved without them .
They seemed to constitute a third class of transcription factor , which we called coactivators .
We further proposed that coactivators , not TBP , were the targets for the protein binding domains of activators .
We envisioned that activators would bind to selected coactivators to speed up the rate at which the basal complex set molecules of RNA polymerase in motion .
We were attracted to this scenario because we had difficulty imagining how a single protein , TBP , would have enough binding sites to accommodate all the activators made by human cells .
But if the coactivators that were tightly linked to TBP bore multiple binding domains , the coactivators could collectively provide the docking sites needed to relay messages from hundreds or thousands of activators to the transcription engine .
It was Pugh who originally proposed that coactivators might function as such adapter molecules .
His data soon convinced me he was probably correct , but not everyone in our laboratory agreed .
Indeed , our weekly meetings in early 1990 were often punctuated by heated discussions .
Not surprisingly , when the coactivator concept was presented to other workers in the field , they , too , expressed considerable skepticism .
This reaction to an unexpected and complicating result was probably justified at that stage , because our data were only suggestive , not conclusive .
We had not yet isolated a single coactivator .
Coactivators : The Missing Links
To satisfy ourselves and the scientific community that we were correct , we had to devise an experimental procedure that would unambiguously establish whether coactivators existed and operated as the relays we envisioned .
For approximately two years after Pugh formulated the coactivator hypothesis , we struggled to purify an intact and functional complex containing TBP and all the other associated constituents of factor D. I must admit to some dark moments when it seemed the rather unpopular coactivator hypothesis might be based on some error in our studies .
The breakthrough finally came in 1991 , when Brian D. Dynlacht , Timothy Hoey , Naoko Tanese and Robert Weinzierl — graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in our laboratory — found an ingenious way to isolate pure copies of factor D. Subsequent biochemical analyses revealed that , aside from TBP , the complete unit included eight previously unknown proteins .
Because we did not yet have proof that these proteins could function as coactivators , we referred to them more generically as TBP - associated factors , or TAFs .
We became convinced that TAFs do indeed convey molecular signals from activators to the basal transcription apparatus after we separated the bound proteins from TBP and completed several more experiments .
For instance , we were able to show that mixing of the activator Sp1 with basal factors and RNA polymerase enhanced production of messenger RNA from a gene containing a GC box only when TAFs were added as well .
Later , Jin-Long Chen , a graduate student , combined purified TBP and the eight isolated TAFs in a test tube along with a human gene and the rest of the basal transcription machinery .
The various proteins assembled on the gene and proved able to respond to several different types of activator proteins .
These activators , we later showed , produced their effects by coupling directly with selected TAFs .
Together the coactivators in factor D do indeed constitute a kind of central processing unit that integrates the regulatory signals issued by DNA - bound activators .
A Universal Theme
The complexes formed by activators , coactivators and the basal machinery appear to be human equivalents of sigma factors ; they , too , draw RNA polymerase to specific genes at specific rates .
In a way , the complexes can be viewed as sigma factors that have been elaborated into many subunits .
Gratifyingly , recent evidence from our group and others suggests we have uncovered a universal mode of gene regulation in eukaryotes .
Those studies confirm that coactivators also exist in yeast and that factor D consists of multiple subunits in fungi as well as in humans .
As satisfying as these results are , they do not fully explain how binding of activators to enhancers and to coactivators influences the rate at which RNA polymerase transcribes genes in living cells .
It may be that linkage of activators to enhancers causes DNA to bend in a way that brings the enhancers closer to one another and to the core promoter .
This arrangement may help activators ( alone or in concert with one another ) to dock with coactivators and position factor D on the promoter .
This step , in turn , would facilitate assembly of the complete basal complex .
Formation of this complex may distort the underlying DNA in a way that enables RNA polymerase to begin its journey along the coding region .
Researchers know less about the functioning of repressors .
Nevertheless , many of us think repressors may also bind to coactivators at times .
This binding could inhibit transcription by preventing activators from attaching to their usual sites on coactivators .
Other times repressors might bypass the basal machinery , blocking transcription by preventing activators from connecting with enhancers .
Although there are gaps in our knowledge , we can now begin to sketch out an explanation as to why different cells make different mixtures of proteins during embryonic development and in mature organisms .
A gene will be transcribed at a measurable rate only if the various activators it needs are present and can successfully overcome the inhibitory effects of repressors .
Cells vary in the proteins they make because they contain distinct batteries of activators and repressors .
Of course , this scenario begs the question of how cells decide which transcription factors to produce in the first place , but progress is being made on that front as well .
Therapies of Tomorrow
How might investigators use our newly acquired knowledge of gene regulation to develop drugs for combating life - threatening diseases involving excessive or inadequate transcription of a gene ?
In theory , blocking selected activators from attaching to enhancers or coactivators should depress unwanted transcription , and stabilizing the transcription machinery on a gene should counteract undesirably weak transcription .
Blockade could be achieved by fitting a molecular " plug " into an activator , thereby preventing its interaction with a coactivator , or by enticing an activator to attach to a decoy that resembles a coactivator .
Stabilization of a complex might be achieved by deploying molecules that would strengthen the interaction between activators and DNA or between activators and coactivators .
Such approaches are remote today , but it is exciting to consider a sampling of the applications that might eventually be possible .
Take , for example , the human immunode ficiency virus ( HIV ) , which causes AIDS .
To reproduce itself in human cells , HIV needs the viral transcription factor TAT to enhance transcription of HIV genes .
If TAT could be inhibited by some agent that recognized TAT but ignored human transcription factors , replication of the virus might be halted without affecting production of proteins needed by the patient .
Conversely , treatment of some disorders — for instance , hypercholesterolemia — might involve enhancing the transcription of selected genes .
Hypercholesterolemia increases a person 's risk for heart disease .
Cholesterol accumulates to destructive levels in the blood when low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , otherwise known as the bad cholesterol , is not removed efficiently .
In theory , the disease could be corrected by turning up transcription of the gene for the LDL receptor in liver cells .
This receptor helps to clear LDL from the blood .
This idea may soon be testable , because studies by Michael S. Brown and Joseph L. Goldstein of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Dallas are teasing apart the specific molecular constituents of the apparatus that regulates transcription of the receptor gene .
Until recently , no one put much effort into screening small molecules , natural products or other compounds for their ability to modulate transcription .
Even so , a number of drugs already on the market have been found by chance to work by altering the activity of transcription factors .
One of these , RU 486 ( the French " abortion " pill ) , represses the function of particular steroid receptors , a class of activators that direct embryonic development .
Similarly , the immunosuppressants cyclosporine and FK506 suppress transcription of a gene whose protein product is needed by certain cells of the immune system .
These drugs act indirectly , however .
They activate an enzyme that impedes the functioning of a transcription factor for the gene .
As time goes by , the precise combination of transcription factors that regulate individual genes is sure to be identi fied .
And drug developers will probably use this information to devise sophisticated compounds for fighting cancer , heart disease , immune disorders , viral infections , Alzheimer 's disease and perhaps even the aging process .
How well these agents will succeed is anybody 's guess , but it is likely that therapies of the future will benefit in one way or another from basic research into transcription — research that began not out of a wish to design drugs but rather out of a simple desire to get to the heart of the molecular machinery that controls the activity of our genes .
The Bush Crisis Plan : Greatest transfer of wealth in world history
What U.S. could learn from China
The Bush Crisis Plan : Greatest transfer of wealth in world history
It 's been called ' financial socialism ' , ' socialism for the rich ' , and ' lemon socialism ' .
But whatever it 's called , the Bush administration ' bailout ' for financial institutions is the greatest transfer of wealth from ordinary working people to the rich in world history .
The proposed program to buy a mountain of non-performing housing loans and other worthless assets from banks and finance companies will cost an estimated $ 700 billion to $ 1 trillion U.S. dollars .
This money will come from U.S. taxpayers , most of whom are ordinary workers .
It amounts to taking around $ 2500 U.S. dollars , or 17,000 RMB , from every U.S. citizen - and giving it to the banks and finance companies .
The cost for each family of four is around $ 10,000 or 68,000 RMB .
This money could have been used for health care , for improved education , for scientific research , for social welfare program ; for environmental protect ; or a myriad of other socially useful purposes .
Alternatively , it could have been used to cut taxes for ordinary people , or even to help them buy their houses .
Instead it is being donated to banks and financial companies whose managements and owners are among the richest in the world .
These measures represent a massive redistribution of socially - produced wealth from working and poor people to the rich .
Learning from China
The argument of the Bush administration - echoed faithfully by the U.S. media - is that there is ' no other way ' .
The claim is that the U.S. system , and the jobs of U.S. workers within it , can only be safeguarded by this transfer of wealth to the banks .
In fact , this argument is incorrect .
Obviously the government must act to protect banking and finance in an economic crisis of this magnitude .
But if banks are bankrupt or insolvent , a fair solution would be to buy or nationalize the banks themselves , * not* their bad debts .
Then the taxpayers would receive something of value - a stabilized and accountable banking system belonging to the people instead of worthless debts .
In China , such a solution would seem almost common sense .
With its socialist market economy growing at about 10 % per year , Chinas ' government banks play a key role in providing a stable foundation for the financing of Chinese economic development ,
But the possibility of taking over or nationalizing U.S. banks has not even been mentioned by any mainstream U.S. political figures or mainstream media .
Instead , up to a trillion dollars or taxpayer money is being donated to institutions whose managements have shown themselves incompetent to manage their own funds .
Perhaps the economic interests of the powerful wall street companies , one of whose former CEO 's is U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , has something to do with this ' blind spot ' . `
Over the years China has resisted intense pressure from Paulson and other U.S. officials to radically deregulate its financial markets .
They have lectured China repeatedly on how deregulation of financial markets , and letting foreign financial capital operate freely in China - as in the U.S. - was in Chinas best interests .
" An open , competitive and liberalized financial market can effectively allocate scarcer resources in a manner that promotes stability and prosperity far better than government intervention , '' Paulson said in Shanghai in March last year .
" Time is of the essence . "
Now even the U.S. has been compelled to abandon this ' open financial markets ' approach .
With the sub - prime crisis now expanded into a full - blown crisis in the western financial sector , knowledgeable Chinese experts are thankful that China never accepted this laisez fair prescription for financial regulation .
" The U.S. crisis reflects regulatory problems in the U.S. and innovative financial products that ignored basic economic rules , '' former Chinese central bank deputy governor Wu Xiaoling told a financial conference in Beijing recently . "
" The U.S. crisis today would be China 's tomorrow if financial products such as securitization are introduced without proper risk - control measures . ''
Chinas ' cautious attitude , government banks , and regulatory framework have helped China to restrict its losses and write - downs from the credit - market crisis to less than 1 percent of the massive global total .
The feasibility of bank nationalizations , closer regulation , and banning certain types of transactions , such as derivatives , which carry excessive risk are all lessons which can be learned from China .
Banks , financial companies , and the wealthy should not be allowed to unload their bad debts onto ordinary workers and taxpayers .
It 's sheer madness to allow them to transfer a trillion dollars from workers and taxpayers to themselves .

One of the best concepts from Your Money or Your Life is that of the fulfillment curve .
Basically , the idea argues that there ’s a sweet spot for anything that maximizes the fulfillment you get out of it .
If you spend more , your fulfillment starts to actually decrease .
I often reflect on this concept .
I see it popping up again and again in my own life and I find that if I put in some effort finding that peak fulfillment , my money just falls into line right behind it .
I ’ve come to believe that if a person has their basic needs covered , overspending is caused by going over the far end of the fulfillment peak .
I hinted at these ideas
a while back , when I discussed the book in detail :
The middle portion of the first chapter focuses on the “ fulfillment curve , ” which basically refers to the idea that once you reach a certain level of luxury in your life , anything beyond that level is merely diminishing returns .
My conclusion at that time was to tie it to consumerism and clutter :
One of the deep problems of consumerism is that the average American tends toward buying more .
They would rather have more stuff that , per item , they have less time to enjoy than less stuff that , per item , they have more time to enjoy .
This is connected directly with the clutter problem , also discussed here .
This tendency to buy extra luxury items gradually fills a home with lots of clutter – unnecessary stuff that just sits there taking up space when the money invested could be used to help build a more fulfilling life .
Later reflection has led me to believe that it ’s not necessarily these factors .
It ’s more of a matter of finding balance , akin to riding a bicycle .
Here ’s a visual example of the fulfillment curve ( I ’ll explain the numbers below ) :
Let me give you two examples of how the curve works , both pulled from my own life .
Example # 1 : Video Games
1 – I ’d like to play some video games , but I do n’t own a console or a single game .
2 – I own a console and a single game , which is quite a bit of fun , but it gets boring after a while .
3 – I pick up one game a year from the used game store .
After the three month mark , though , I ’ve beaten the game and then I feel unfulfilled until I get another game several months later .
4 – I pick up a game every three months from the used game store , right in line with when I ’ve mastered and am getting tired of the previous game .
I always have something fresh to play and master and do n’t have to spend too much keeping up with the hobby .
5 – I get a game every month from the used game store .
It is n’t financially pinching me , but I ’m building up a pile of games I ’ve barely played .
6 – I get a mix of new and old games , two or three a month .
I can handle my credit card bills , but it ’s a little higher than I like .
I also do n’t like looking at that pile of unplayed games .
7 – I buy a new game every week .
I play it for about five minutes , then I feel guilty and I put it on a giant pile of games that are barely played , making me feel really guilty .
I do it so I can play the “ latest and greatest , ” but I usually just feel really guilty , and I ’m having a very difficult time keeping up with the credit card bills .
See the progression there ?
That middle point – 4 – is where I ’m really enjoying a hobby that I have .
I can easily afford it , I get to thoroughly enjoy each game I get , I have plenty of new stuff to play to keep me happy , and I have no guilty feelings about it .
If I spend less , I ’m not enjoying my hobby as much as I ’d like – I feel longing .
If I spend more , I start to build up games that I do n’t play , I build some guilt , and eventually it gets really expensive .
My experience with video game fulfillment A few years ago , I was somewhere around 6 on this fulfillment curve .
When I finally went through my big financial panic , I veered wildly in the other direction , selling everything and rushing back over that fulfillment peak to 0 .
As our financial life became stronger , I slowly climbed the curve and now stand fairly close to that peak – # 4 .
Here ’s another example ( with a picture of the curve again , for visual aid ) .
Example # 2 : Home Buying
1 – We ’re essentially homeless .
We live in our car .
2 – We live in an extremely cheap , extremely small old apartment .
The rent is extremely cheap , but there ’s barely enough room for sleeping space for everyone or room to do anything at all .
We ’re embarrassed to have guests at all .
3 – We live in a nice apartment or a small house .
There ’s enough room for everyone to sleep and have meals , but we ’re sometimes pinched for space and there ’s more clutter than we ’d like .
We have some of our friends over , but we feel pretty self - conscious about the place and do n’t have the dinner parties we ’d like .
4 – Our house is just the right size for our family .
We feel comfortable having any and all guests over , the housework does n’t overwhelm us , and the bills are completely manageable .
5 – Our house slightly exceeds what our family needs , but it gives us some room to grow .
The bills are slightly painful , but we can manage things .
We spend a bit more of our weekends on home cleaning and maintenance than we ’d like , but we feel quite proud giving dinner parties and inviting people over .
6 – Our house is a McMansion .
We can afford the bills , but just barely , and only if we eat everything at home .
The bills make me feel kind of guilty , and there are times where it feels like all we do is upkeep .
7 – We bought a house nine times our annual income on an ARM and it just adjusted .
Our house is mind - blowingly awesome , but we ’re getting foreclosed tomorrow .
We have no equity and we have no idea what we ’re going to do .
I wish we ’d never come here .
My experience with housing fulfillment
When we first got married , we lived in an apartment that was probably about a 2.5 on that curve – we were buckling down and saving .
After our first child was born , it slipped down to about a 2 – we were in a serious space pinch and we became sort of ashamed to have guests over because of the massive clutter .
We bought our first home and now we ’ve happily settled in at about a 4 , but we looked at some homes that would have been a 5 or a 6 on the curve , I ’m quite sure .
I think this house might slip to a 3.5 or a 3 if we have two more kids , but we ’ll cross that bridge when we get there .
Some Fulfillment Curve Thoughts and Strategies
What does this curve mean in your own life ?
How can it help you get ahead ?
Here are some suggestions .
The fulfillment curve applies to everything you spend money on .
The basic principle applies to almost everything in your life , from food to clothing to shelter up to hobby - oriented activities .
In almost every aspect of life , the point of maximum enjoyment is not the point of maximum spending – spending too much reduces fulfillment .
Guilt is one of the surest signs of the downside of the curve .
If you feel guilt about your spending in any area , you ’re likely spending more than your natural fulfillment peak .
It ’s likely that if you take the time to seriously look at every area in your life where you feel some guilt about money , it ’s a result of spending too much to try to chase fulfillment .
Pull back on that spending some and you ’ll almost always find that things become more enjoyable as a whole .
Your fulfillment curve peak might actually come with spending no money at all .
For example , I almost always find that when I spend much money on extra things for my kids , neither one of us gets much extra fulfillment out of it and a good chunk of the time I feel like I should n’t have spent the money .
Here ’s an example : the best time I ’ve spent with my kids recently was last Sunday when we went to the library , went to a free art festival , then went home and read books for an hour .
The cost was virtually nil , but it was a peak on that curve .
Fulfillment curve peaks do n’t have to cost you .
Routine frivolous purchases – like a $ 5 coffee each morning – are beyond the peak , whether you actively notice it or not .
If you do it every day , it ’s no longer a treat .
It ’s not something special to really bring you fulfillment .
Try drinking cheap coffee at the office all but one day a week .
You ’ll find that the one good coffee you do drink brings you far more fulfillment than it used to .
Spend some time understanding what things really fulfill you .
I feel much more fulfilled by a well - designed item that will last basically forever than just about anything .
Reliability is really a strong fulfillment point for me – I tend to like things that I ’ve had for a long time that still work like new .
That ’s why I often do so much research before a purchase – I know I ’ll get more fulfillment out of it if the item just does its job reliably and easily .
Good luck applying the fulfillment curve to your own life !
Neocon Desperation
Is Showing
The neoconservatives and their Republican allies did all they could after Thursday ’s vice presidential debate to turn Sarah Palin ’s peppy , personable but ultimately goofy performance into a turning point for another four - year lease on the White House .

But there was desperation in the air .
Reading the neocons ’ glowing reviews of Palin ’s upbeat recitation of her talking points was a bit like watching a few diehard fans try to start a “ wave ” when the home team is hopelessly behind .
Still , try they did .
Fred Barnes of the Weekly Standard wrote an article entitled “ Comeback , ” which read : “ The moment when Sarah Palin knew she was winning … came after the subject had turned to nuclear weapons .
Palin had talked about nukes as a deterrent and said it was important to keep them out of the hands of dictators who are enemies of America .
Then she turned to moderator Gwen Ifill and asked , ‘ Can we talk about Afghanistan real quick ? ’
“ Afghanistan ?
The impression Palin had left in television interviews with ABC's Charles Gibson and CBS 's Katie Couric was that she was ill - equipped to discuss issues like that .
…
But by that point in the debate – two - thirds the way through – Palin was brimming with self - confidence .
She knew she could handle any issue likely to be thrown at her by Ifill .
She knew [ Joe ] Biden would not outmatch her .
So she purposely tackled an issue on which he was expected to have an advantage .
…
“ She insisted the ‘ surge principles ’ that had proved effective in Iraq would work in Afghanistan .
Biden claimed the commanding general in Afghanistan disagreed .
Then Palin said , no , the general did n't disagree , and she spelled out how ‘ the counterinsurgency strategy ’ favored by McCain ( and her ) would work . ”
For all this gee - whiz boosterism , you might have expected Barnes to come dressed in a cheerleader outfit with pom-poms .
The reality of the debate , however , was quite different .
When Ifill posed the question , “ should there be a trigger when nuclear weapons use is ever put into play ? ” – Palin offered one of her chillingly sophomoric answers : “ Nuclear weaponry , of course , would be the be-all , end - all of just too many people in too many parts of our planet , so those dangerous regimes , again , cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons , period .
Our nuclear weaponry here in the U.S. is used as a deterrent .
And that 's a safe , stable way to use nuclear weaponry .
“ But for those countries – North Korea , also , under Kim Jong
Il – we have got to make sure that we 're putting the economic sanctions on these countries and that we have friends and allies supporting us in this to make sure that leaders like Kim Jong Il and [ Iranian President Mahmoud ]
Ahmadinejad are not allowed to acquire , to proliferate , or to use those nuclear weapons .
It is that important . ”
While some Americans were still trying to get their brains around Palin ’s bizarre use of the phrase “ be-all , end - all ” to refer to their mass incineration , the Alaska governor decided to shift back for a brief comment about Afghanistan .
She then let loose with a barrage of misinformation , starting with the slanderous canard that “ Barack Obama had said that all we 're doing in Afghanistan is air - raiding villages and killing civilians .
And such a reckless , reckless comment and untrue comment , again , hurts our cause . ”
Palin continued , “ That 's not what we 're doing there .
We 're fighting terrorists , and we 're securing democracy , and we 're building schools for children there so that there is opportunity in that country , also .
There will be a big difference there , and we will win in – in Afghanistan , also . ”
Palin ’s distortion about Obama derived from a statement that he made in 2007 , calling for increased troop levels in Afghanistan so that the United States would not have to continue relying on aerial bombings that were killing civilians and angering Afghanis .
What he actually said was : " We 've got to get the job done there and that requires us to have enough troops so that we 're not just air - raiding villages and killing civilians , which is causing enormous pressure over there . "
[ AP , Aug. 14 , 2007 ] Moving On After twisting Obama ’s meaning , Palin moved on to one of her major gaffes of the night , in disputing Biden ’s comment that the commanding U.S. general in Afghanistan had said an Iraq - style “ surge ” strategy would not work well there .
“ Well , first , McClellan did not say definitively the surge principles would not work in Afghanistan , ” Palin said .
“ The geographic differences are huge but the counterinsurgency principles could work in Afghanistan .
McClellan did n't say anything opposite of that . ”
Palin ’s reference to General McClellan , who was a top Union commander in the Civil War , left some listeners scratching their heads .
She apparently meant General David McKiernan , who as Biden said had disputed the applicability of transferring the lessons from the Iraq “ surge ” to Afghanistan .
Though Barnes had tried to put some substance into his praise of Palin , other neocon writers concentrated on her style .
For instance , David Brooks , a neocon columnist for the New York Times , wrote : “ It took her about 15 seconds to define her persona — the straight - talking mom from regular America — and it was immediately clear that the night would be filled with tales of soccer moms , hockey moms , Joe Sixpacks , main - streeters , ‘ you betchas ’ and ‘ darn rights . ’
Somewhere in heaven Norman Rockwell is smiling .
“ With a bemused smile and a never - ending flow of words , she laid out her place on the ticket — as the fearless neighbor for the heartland bemused by the idiocies of Washington .
Her perpetual smile served as foil to Biden ’s senatorial seriousness . ”
Yet , while Brooks may have been impressed , Palin may have reminded other viewers of a badly programmed Stepford Wife , who lacked fluency on complex issues both foreign and domestic – and kept circling back to scripted talking points that had been drilled into her brain by McCain ’s neoconservative advisers , like Randy Scheunemann .
The more important question in evaluating the debate may be whether Americans – facing two open - ended wars and a major financial crisis – are looking for an updated version of George W. Bush , the proverbial regular fellow who you ’d want to have a beer with , the faux populist who drops g’s from the end of gerunds and uses colloquialisms .
Palin ’s “ shout - out ” to some Alaska school kids and other folksy chatter might have charmed some casual voters , but Palin ’s casual style – masking a shallowness of knowledge – might have been unnerving to many other Americans who are in the mood for some gravitas .
In that way – contrary to the hopes of the neocon commentators – the real winner on Thursday night might have been Barack Obama , who selected the far more seasoned Biden who came across in the debate as a sage counselor or a prospective president .
Biden did get a bit tongue - tied at moments , but his mastery of policy details and his courtly manners sent a reassuring message to a nervous country .
Though Palin may not have melted down in the debate , neither did she display the experience and the knowledge to run the country .

Fresh from the Republican convention , Senator John McCain ’s campaign sees evidence that his choice of Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate is energizing conservatives in the battleground of Ohio while improving its chances in Pennsylvania and several Western states that Senator Barack Obama has been counting on .
Mr. Obama ’s campaign intends to focus heavily on the economy , especially in light of the mounting job losses , and to keep up the effort to tie the McCain - Palin ticket to the policies of President Bush .
It is banking on holding all the states Senator John Kerry won in 2004 and picking up the additional electoral votes it needs by flipping some combination of Ohio , Nevada , New Mexico , Colorado , Indiana , Iowa and Virginia into the Democratic column .
With just over eight weeks left until Election Day , the two sides are settling into an unusually broad set of state - by - state face - offs , with an increased focus on turning out supporters and tough decisions looming about where to invest time and money for new advertisements .
Yet the two men issued a joint statement on Saturday announcing that they would appear together at the World Trade Center site on Thursday , an idea that aides said originated last week when Mr. Obama called Mr. McCain to congratulate him on accepting the nomination .
A 50 million year old skull reveals that huge birds with a 5 metre wingspan once skimmed across the waters that covered what is now London , Essex and Kent .
These giant ocean - going relatives of ducks and geese also had a rather bizarre attribute for a bird : their beaks were lined with bony - teeth .
It may be a few weeks until the British pantomine season kicks - off , but this new fossil from the Isle of Sheppey is giving ‘ Mother Goose ’ an entirely new meaning .
Described today ( September 26 ) in the journal Palaeontology , the skull belongs to Dasornis , a bony - toothed bird , or pelagornithid , and was discovered in the London Clay , which lies under much of London , Essex and northern Kent in SE England .
The occurrence of bony - toothed birds in these deposits has been known for a long time , but the new fossil is one the best skulls ever found , and preserves previously unknown details of the anatomy of these strange creatures .
With a five metre wingspan , these huge birds were similar to albatross in their way of life .
Albatross have the largest wingspan of any living bird , but that of Dasornis was over a meter and half greater .
Despite these similarities , the latest research suggests that the closest living relatives of Dasornis and its fossil kin are ducks and geese .
“ Imagine a bird like an ocean - going goose , almost the size of a small plane !
By today ’s standards these were pretty bizarre animals , but perhaps the strangest thing about them is that they had sharp , tooth - like projections along the cutting edges of the beak ” explains Gerald Mayr , expert palaeornithologist at the German Senckenberg Research Institute and author of the report .
Like all living birds Dasornis had a beak made of keratin , the same substance as our hair and fingernails , but it also had these bony ‘ pseudo - teeth ’
“ No living birds have true teeth - which are made of enamel and dentine - because their distant ancestors did away with them more than 100 million years ago , probably to save weight and make flying easier .
But the bony - toothed birds , like Dasornis , are unique among birds in that they reinvented tooth - like structures by evolving these bony spikes . ”
So why did Dasornis have these pseudo - teeth ?
“ Its linked to diet ” says Mayr , “ these birds probably skimmed across the surface of the sea , snapping up fish and squid on the wing .
With only an ordinary beak these would have been difficult to keep hold of , and the pseudo - teeth evolved to prevent meals slipping away . ”
The fossil belongs to the collection of the Karlsruhe Natural History Museum
Peer reviewed publication :
The paper , “ A skull of the giant bony - toothed bird Dasornis ( Aves : Pelagornithidae ) from the Lower Eocene of the Isle of Sheppey ” by Gerald Mayr is published in the September 26th issue of Palaeontology .
Competing views on the right .
Ron Bonjean , longtime Republican communications guru , writes in The Arena that it 's the perfect way to broaden the debate :
Brilliant positioning .
Senator McCain now looks presidential by putting politics aside during this major financial crisis .
Suspending the campaign really plays to his “ Country First ” theme and allows him to project big picture thinking .
Americans are very concerned about the economy and their own pocketbooks .
If McCain continued to spar with Obama on the economy , he would n’t gain any traction .
In fact , it was a losing fight because voters see the back - and - forth mudslinging as politics as usual when our nation is in a dire financial situation .
What is fascinating about this move is that it now allows McCain to position himself as a leader and Senator Obama to seem ambitious .
It also shows Obama does n’t understand the severity of this crisis .
The McCain camp lost their momentum last week .
This changes the subject away from economic specifics and generates momentum towards McCain ’s strong suit of patriotism and sacrifice .
Ramesh Ponnuru , senior editor at National Review , thinks there are grave political and policy risks :
If Senator McCain believes that he can help to enact a plan that can stabilize the markets and lay the foundation for future growth , then suspending the campaign and going to Washington was the right thing to do .
But it is hard to see what McCain can do to help , and easy to see how his intervention could hurt .
He brings , as he himself has admitted in the past , no expertise to the table .
And wo n't Democrats be less likely to cooperate on a plan if doing so will help make McCain be the hero of the hour ?
So McCain 's move may have been a mistake on substance .
It may prove to be a political mistake too :
If McCain can't bring both parties together in an economic crisis after staking so much on it , wo n't voters draw adverse conclusions about his leadership ability ?

Snapchat has become insanely popular recently .
It is therefore not surprising at all that many people having been looking for a way to hack Snapchat accounts .
Especially due to the fact that there has been a lot of media coverage recently about Snapchat ’s security being breached .
It seems as if every other day there is a new breach in Snapchat ’s security which results in people ’s private images , videos and login details being leaked .
What does a Snapchat Hack do ?
A Snapchat Hack allows people to view any image or video that has been sent or received through any Snapchat account .
It works in a very peculiar way .
All someone needs to take advantage of these Snapchat hackers is the username of the target whose Snaps they want to view , and an internet connection .
They can then enter the Snapchat username of their target on the online hack and the rest happens automatically .
All the sent and received images that are associated with the account in question will be retrieved and can be viewed online .
Examples of Snapchat Hacks being used
A prime example is something called the #snappening where millions of Snapchat accounts were compromised .
Their login details were exposed to the public .
Many people had their photos and videos they sent through Snapchat exposed due to this Snaphack .
Who is to blame for these Snapchat hacks ?
The fact that people mainly use Snapchat to send images of themselves that they do not want to be permanent makes these Snapchat Hacks especially harmful .
The blame can thus not only be laid on the developers of these Snapchat hacking tools .
People should be more careful with who they give their username to , and with what they send through Snapchat .
In addition , Snapchat should heighten their security to prevent these hacks from existing .
However , one of the potential upsides of the recent Snapchat hacks is that one can only assume that people will be more cautious what kind of pictures they send through Snapchat , so maybe this has been an eye opener for people .
Is it safe to use a Snapchat Spy ?
Apparently , using a Snapchat spy is completely safe because all the traffic is routed through proxy servers and virtual private networks that encrypt and route your traffic through anonymous servers .
Therefore , it is completely unknown to anyone who exactly takes advantage of these Snapchat Spy tools and who is not .
How do I use the Snapchat Hack
Using the Snapchat Hack is very easy .
You can simple click the button that says “ continue to Snapchat Hack ” and you will be brought to an online Snapchat Hack website .
On this website you can enter the username of the account you want to hack .
From there you can spy on all the images , videos and chats they have sent and received .
Furthermore , the SnapSpy allows you to hack on any account , it does not matter what account it is .
Is a Snapchat Hack anonymous ?
Using a Snapchat Hacker is completely anonymous because as mentioned before , the Snapchat Hack is web based .
This means that you do not have to download / install the software to your device .
This results in there not being any trace of you having used a Snapchat Hack on your device .
Nobody will know that you have used a Snapchat Hack to Spy on Snaps .
The SnapHack is also very simple to use , and since it is web based , you can use it on any device .
It works on iPhones , Androids and PCs .
You can spy on Snapchat accounts as long as you have an active internet connection .

First amendment no longer exists in the new America
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Monday , August 4 , 2008
In the new America an endorsement of Congressman Ron Paul now gives the police probable cause to pull you over , ask you for identification and search your vehicle .
Much to their surprise Rick and Ingrid , friends from Las Vegas , discovered this recently when police pulled them over and cited a Ron Paul and an Infowars bumper sticker on the back of their car as having aroused suspicion .
The couple sent the following email explaining their experience :
It was late afternoon here Las Vegas and we were pulling into Sam ’s Town Casino and Hotel .
As we were pulling into the parking lot of Sam ’s Town we heard what sounded like a fog horn type of horn .
Anyway since I never have heard a police siren like that I figured it was some guy who was in a hurry going no where honking his weird horn .
We drove a little further and we saw the colored lights of the police in the rear window .
They were pulling us over !!!!
We pulled over and stopped and the police car pulled behind us .
There were two officers in the car , one of the officers got out on the drivers side of the police car and walked over to my friends window ( the drivers side ) and he ( my friend ) asked the officer is there problem and he responded by saying " I just want to know what is going on " .
Next he wanted to see his ID and had he ever been arrested .
He did not ask for the registration to the car or for proof of insurance .
I thought that was strange since every officer I ever encountered wanted to see all of the paperwork .
Then he asked for my ID , and I handed it to him .
Right after that another officer shows up on the passenger side and asked for my ID , I told him I gave it to the other officer and he said " Do n’t you have more than one ID " .?
I said no only one .
Then they told us get out of the car and put our hands behind our backs , and to stand in front of the police car .
We complied with their request and never once gave them any trouble .
Then one of the officers called me back to the side of the car , said he wanted to talk to me .
He asked me if there was anything illegal in this car , I said no .
He said you had better being telling the truth because we are going to search this car .
He then asked where we were before we came here , I replied we just came from Big Lots shopping .
Well ,
Alex they ( the police ) started searching my friend and myself .
They then they went to the car and told us to stay there and not turn around .
In the meantime Sam ’s Town security joined the cop sand they were eager to play " Lap Dogs " for the cops .
Finally they emerged from the car and told us we could go now .
As we are walking to the car one officer comes walking towards me and says " You know why we had to do this right " ?
I said pardon me officer , I do n’t know understand , he then repeated it .
Then he pointed at our RON PAUL and INFOWARS stickers on our car .
I was going to question his actions but my friend said let ’s just go .
Our stickers are still on the car and will remain there .
Sincerely , Rick and Ingrid from Las Vegas .
Rick and Ingrid clearly have not heard that in the new America you are not permitted to support a political figure such as Dr. Paul who rallies against big government , campaigns for individual liberty , as well as a strong economy free from endless borrowing and a fiat currency , has vehemently criticized aggressive and imperialistic U.S. foreign policy and the espouses the law according to the Constitution .
These views are now considered subversive .
Did the pair never see the reports of how fellow Ron Paul supporters were ordered to remove campaign signs from their own private property when the Congressman was running for President ?
Moreover , to endorse people such as Alex Jones and the freedom movement , and engage in first amendment rights in general is most certainly outlawed in the new America .
Citizens should never attempt to inform others of their views and insights , or provide them with materials such as flyers and DVDs , this is an arrestable offence .
They should not attempt to engage in any
form of protest against authorities or policies they do not agree with , this is also an arrestable offence .
A free press able to count on unimpeded documentation of events and occurrences in the new America is also now outlawed .

The trailblazing atheist and Truthdig contributor takes on Sarah Barracuda in the new Newsweek : “ When it comes to politics , there is a mad love of mediocrity in this country .
‘ They think they ’re better than you ! ’ is the refrain that ( highly competent and cynical ) Republican strategists have set loose among the crowd , and the crowd has grown drunk on it once again . ”
Newsweek :
Let me confess that I was genuinely unnerved by Sarah Palin ’s performance at the Republican convention .
Given her audience and the needs of the moment , I believe Governor Palin ’s speech was the most effective political communication I have ever witnessed .
Here , finally , was a performer who — being maternal , wounded , righteous and sexy — could stride past the frontal cortex of every American and plant a three - inch heel directly on that limbic circuit that ceaselessly intones “ God and country . ”
If anyone could make Christian theocracy smell like apple pie , Sarah Palin could .
Then came Palin ’s first television interview with Charles Gibson .
I was relieved to discover , as many were , that Palin ’s luster can be much diminished by the absence of a teleprompter .
Still , the problem she poses to our political process is now much bigger than she is .
Her fans seem inclined to forgive her any indiscretion short of cannibalism .
However badly she may stumble during the remaining weeks of this campaign , her supporters will focus their outrage upon the journalist who caused her to break stride , upon the camera operator who happened to capture her fall , upon the television network that broadcast the good lady ’s misfortune — and , above all , upon the “ liberal elites ” with their highfalutin assumption that , in the 21st century , only a reasonably well - educated person should be given command of our nuclear arsenal .
The point to be lamented is not that Sarah Palin comes from outside Washington , or that she has glimpsed so little of the earth ’s surface ( she did n’t have a passport until last year ) , or that she ’s never met a foreign head of state .
The point is that she comes to us , seeking the second most important job in the world , without any intellectual training relevant to the challenges and responsibilities that await her .
There is nothing to suggest that she even sees a role for careful analysis or a deep understanding of world events when it comes to deciding the fate of a nation .
In her interview with Gibson , Palin managed to turn a joke about seeing Russia from her window into a straight - faced claim that Alaska ’s geographical proximity to Russia gave her some essential foreign - policy experience .
Palin may be a perfectly wonderful person , a loving mother and a great American success story — but she is a beauty queen / sports reporter who stumbled into small - town politics , and who is now on the verge of stumbling into , or upon , world history .

\ " I am calling on the President to convene a meeting with the leadership from both houses of Congress , including Senator Obama and myself , \ " McCain said .
Presidential debate still pending
John McCain called Wednesday for the first presidential debate , scheduled for Friday in Mississippi , to be delayed and urged Barack Obama to join him in Washington for a high - level meeting of congressional leaders to address the financial crisis .
Obama responded that the debate should go on .
In a roll of the dice that jolted the presidential race , McCain said he is suspending his campaign - and his fundraising and campaign advertising - as of Thursday and will return to Washington .
He also scrapped a planned appearance on David Letterman .

President Bush , in his televised address to the nation Wednesday night , said he had invited both men to come to the White House on Thursday for a summit meeting with congressional leadership .
A McCain aide told Politico Wednesday night that the campaign is proposing to the Presidential Debate Commission and the Obama camp that if there 's no bailout deal by Friday , the first presidential debate should take the place of the vice presidential debate , currently scheduled for October 2 in St. Louis .
Under this scenario , the vice presidential debate would be rescheduled for a date yet to be determined , and take place in Oxford , Miss. , where the first presidential debate is currently slated to be held .
" I am calling on the president to convene a meeting with the leadership from both houses of Congress , including Senator Obama and myself , " McCain said .
" It is time for both parties to come together to solve this problem . "
Obama rebuffed the proposal , though there was no immediate reaction to the more detailed plan for swapping debates .
“ It ’s my belief that this is exactly the time the American people need to hear from the person who in approximately 40 days will be responsible with dealing with this mess , " he told reporters in Florida , where he has been prepping for Friday 's event .
" What I think is important is that we do n’t suddenly infuse Capitol Hill with presidential politics , " he said .
He also took a real shot at McCain : " Presidents are going to have to deal with more than one thing at a time , " Obama said .
" It ’s not necessary for us to think that we can do only one thing , and suspend everything else . "
Debate organizers also said they have no plans to postpone .
" We have been notified by the Commission on Presidential Debates that we are proceeding as scheduled , " said the University of Mississippi , which was to host Friday 's encounter .
" We are ready to host the debate , and we expect the debate to occur as planned , " Ole Miss said in a statement .
Obama aides also quickly countered that their campaign had first reached out to McCain - early Wednesday morning - to suggest that the two nominees put out a joint statement on the crisis that has roiled economic markets and brought Washington to a virtual standstill .
" At 8:30 this morning , Senator Obama called Senator McCain to ask him if he would join in issuing a joint statement outlining their shared principles and conditions for the Treasury proposal and urging Congress and the White House to act in a bipartisan manner to pass such a proposal , " said Obama spokesman Bill Burton in an email sent just minutes after McCain 's statement .
" At 2:30 this afternoon , Senator McCain returned Senator Obama ’s call and agreed to join him in issuing such a statement .
The two campaigns are currently working together on the details . "
McCain spokesman Brian Rogers cast the call in a different light : " Senator Obama phoned Senator McCain at 8:30 am this morning but did not reach him .
The topic of Senator Obama ’s call to Senator McCain was never discussed .
Senator McCain was meeting with economic advisers and talking to leaders in Congress throughout the day prior to calling Senator Obama .
At 2:30 pm , Senator McCain phoned Senator Obama and expressed deep concern that the plan on the table would not pass as it currently stands .
He asked Senator Obama to join him in returning to Washington to lead a bipartisan effort to solve this problem . "
The financial crisis already had all but hijacked the presidential contest , but McCain 's startling statment brought the race to a standing stop .
McCain said his goal was to have a bailout package in place by the start of next week .
McCain wants Obama , key committee chairmen and the congressional leadership to " lock themselves in a room for the next 100 hours or however long it is between now and Monday morning .
and achieve some
kind of consensus on something , " said senior McCain adviser Mark Salter .
" Right now , the American people . . . have no sense of confidence in what has occurred so far .
The deal did n't seem to be achieving consensus . "
In Congress , however , Democrats suggested that a summit attended by both nominees would slow the sense of progress toward a bailout deal that had built throughout the day on Wednesday .
" It would not be helpful at this time to have them come back during these negotiations and risk injecting presidential politics into this process or distract important talks about the future of our nation ’s economy , " said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
" If that changes , we will call upon them .
We need leadership ; not a campaign photo op . "
A Democratic source told Politico that Reid called McCain Wednesday and told him it " would n't be helpful " for him to come to Washington .
New York Sen. Charles Schumer told CNN that McCain 's suspension of his campaign was " weird and odd . "
Schumer said that the Senate had not heard " hide nor hair " from the Arizona senator during any of the negotiations prior to this announcement , save for a suggestion or two .
McCain was undeterred .
" I am confident that before the markets open on Monday we can achieve consensus on legislation that will stabilize our financial markets , protect taxpayers and homeowners , and earn the confidence of the American people , " he predicted .
" All we must do to achieve this is temporarily set politics aside , and I am committed to doing so . "
A top McCain aide also indicated that the campaign had grown suspicious that congressional Democrats were trying hang the possible passage of a bailout package on whether McCain would support it .
Democrats were " warily circling " McCain and were not going to commit toa deal unless he did , said the aide .
Rogers took direct aim at Reid : " Unfortunately , Senator Reid is putting partisan politics ahead of the business of the American people .
But there should be no mistake : 24 hours ago Reid and his Democratic colleagues on the Hill could n't have been more desperate for Senator McCain 's help in resolving this crisis .
Now they 've got it . "
McCain compared the financial crisis to 9/11 , saying national leaders must work together to find a solution .
" We must show that kind of patriotism now , " McCain said .
On Wednesday , McCain talked to President Bush , Republican leaders Sen. Mitch McConnell ( Ky. ) and John A. Boehner ( Ohio ) in Congress , Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) and Obama .
His action Wednesday was an extraordinary move , plainly aimed at appearing presidential and above the partisan fray at a time of great challenge .
But , coming a week after McCain struggled to find his footing on the crisis and as national and state polls show him slipping in large part because of voter concerns over the economy , it also amounts to a dare : How can Obama say no ?
Were the Democrat to insist on going forward with the debate and to continue to campaign as usual he'd walk right into McCain 's trap , seeming to place politics above what many are portraying as a dire national crisis and validating the Arizona senator 's slogan that it's he who puts " country first . "
McCain 's move is also designed to recast the financial debate as it relates to the presidential campaign .
Since last week , the Republican and his top aides have sought to broaden the discussion beyond the details of just what went wrong and how to fix the system and make the political question one of who is the better leader in a time of great national challenge .
With a Republican president in the White House presiding over the near - meltdown and voters favoring Obama on the economy , transforming the matter from one about policy to one about character and leadership is imperative .

Politics
In the late 1980s , Internet users adopted the word " troll " to denote someone who intentionally disrupts online communities .
Early trolling was relatively innocuous , taking place inside of small , single - topic Usenet groups .
The trolls employed what the M.I.T. professor Judith Donath calls a " pseudo - naïve " tactic , asking stupid questions and seeing who would rise to the bait .
The game was to find out who would see through this stereotypical newbie behavior , and who would fall for it .
As one guide to trolldom puts it , " If you do n't fall for the joke , you get to be in on it . "
When it becomes taboo to talk about certain topics , much less tie them together in the kind of truth that saves groups from themselves , the only people who speak the truth are some outsiders ( other outsiders are just loser posers ) .
Trolls -- using anonymity , hacker technique for obscurity , and some basic psychological knowledge -- are information terrorists for the truth .
Internet trolls tell us what we 're afraid to admit we see , even if they do it offensively .
Pollinators of the politically unacceptable yet valid analysis , they do us a service , even as they annoy us .

Okay , this is just scary .
Perhaps necessary ( I ’m going to wait for Chris in Paris to wake up and give us his two cents ( now only worth 1.5 ) , but on its face , we ’re talking about nationalizing banks .
What did the hell did the Republicans do to our country ?
And John McCain does n’t want to talk about the economy .
I guess if you have 12 homes you have that luxury .
From the NYT :
WASHINGTON — Having tried without success to unlock frozen credit markets , the Treasury Department is considering taking ownership stakes in many United States banks to try to restore confidence in the financial system , according to government officials .
Treasury officials say the just - passed $ 700 billion bailout bill gives them the authority to inject cash directly into banks that request it .
Such a move would quickly strengthen banks ’ balance sheets and , officials hope , persuade them to resume lending .
In return , the law gives the Treasury the right to take ownership positions in banks , including healthy ones .
UPDATE FROM ROB : Just a couple of hours ago this article was on CNBC debating whether this move was nationalization or not .
The article does a good job of explaining the precarious position we ’re in .
“ We are in the midst of an raging international credit meltdown and we do not have the luxury of waiting for ( the bailout fund ) to be implemented , ” argues Robert Johnson , a former managing director of Bankers Trust and Soros Fund Management executive .
“ Treasury needs to inject $ 500 billion of capital as soon as possible into at least the large 19 primary dealer banks and probably some large regional banks as well . ”
The direct recapitalization of ailing banks is “ high - impact ” money versus the “ low - impact ” approach that Treasury is pursuing through the bailout fund .
The article does a good job of describing the end of free market capitalism in the United States .
Canada will withdraw the bulk of its military forces in Afghanistan as scheduled in 2011 , Conservative Leader Stephen Harper pledged on Wednesday , saying the Afghan government " at some point has to be able to be primarily responsible " for the country 's security .
Speaking to reporters at a breakfast briefing in Toronto , Harper said the Canadian public has no appetite to keep soldiers in the war - torn country any longer than the pullout date agreed on by Parliament .
" You have to put an end date on these things , " Harper said .
He added that while Canada 's military leaders have not acknowledged it publicly , a decade of war is enough .
" By 2011 , we will have been in Kandahar , which is probably the toughest province in the country , for six years , " Harper said .
" Not only have we done our bit at that point , I think our goal has to be after six years to see the government of Afghanistan able to carry the lion 's share of responsibility for its own security .
" At that point , the mission , as we 've known it , we intend to end . "
The unusually candid remarks from Harper included the Tory leader acknowledging he cried the first time he had to call the family of a soldier killed in Afghanistan .
Troops would stay ' in some technical capacities '
The Tory government , supported by the Liberals , extended the military mission in Kandahar province to 2011 earlier this year , with a shift to emphasize the mission 's priorities to reconstruction and development in the region .
Harper has made past statements in support of a shift in Canada 's priorities in Afghanistan , but the prime minister 's latest comments appear to show for the first time his acceptance of a troop pullout by the date .
" It 's fair to say he was clearer and perhaps more forceful than before on what is going to happen in 2011 , " the CBC's Paul Hunter reported from the Harper campaign .
While there may be a few Canadian soldiers who stay on after 2011 as advisers , the bulk of the troops will be home by then , Harper said .
" I do n't want to say we wo n't have a single troop there , because obviously we would aid in some technical capacities , " he said .
Dion : Harper ' ambiguous ' with allies
Speaking to reporters in Ontario on Wednesday , Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion said Harper 's comments show " he knows now that Canadians want to leave in 2011 " despite sending mixed messages abroad .
" He 's saying that , but he has been ambiguous with our allies , " Dion said during a campaign stop in Walkerton .
" We have asked him many times in the House , ' Did you say that to them ? ' "
Dion added the only way for Canadians to ensure the government " will say to the world the mission will end in June 2011 is to vote Liberal . "
The prime minister 's assurances come as the death toll for Canadians in Afghanistan since troops deployed there in 2002 approaches 100 .
One Canadian diplomat has also died in the mission .
Taliban insurgents have stepped up their attacks in Afghanistan in the last month , in what they claim is an attempt to influence Canada 's federal election .

First words of brain - damaged girl , 6 , given power of speech by laser which tracks her eye movements
Elke Wisbey has been able to tell her mother she loves her for the first time
A severely handicapped little girl who cannot walk or talk has used a machine to tell her mother for the first time : ' I love you . '
Six - year - old Elke Wisbey , who was born brain - damaged , has been able to communicate with her family by using a high - tech gadget which tracks her eye movements .
The £ 17,000 MyTobii Smartbox machine from Sweden detects which icons Elke is looking at by using tiny lasers .
When her eyes settle on an icon on the screen of the Smartbox , a pre-programmed voice speaks the word or phrase for her .
Just a few days after setting up the equipment , Elke 's parents , Glynnis and Matt Wisbey , described how their daughter started using her eyes to repeat the words ' I love you ' over and over again .
Mrs. Wisbey , 43 , who also has a son , Galahad , aged nine , said : ' I thought it was stuck and then I realised what she was saying .
' She was looking at the " I love you " icon and I could n't believe it , she kept doing it .
' I said to Elke " are you telling Daddy you love him ? " and she pointed at the icon " yes " .
' It really choked me up , made me really emotional .
I 'm still emotional when I think about it .
' It was quite emotional .
It is mind - blowing really .
We have gone from somebody not being able to communicate to this .
' We did n't think Elke would ever be able to tell us how she was feeling , and now she can .
This will be amazing for us , absolutely phenomenal .'
Readers of a local newspaper raised money to buy the specially - adapted machine for the family from Bearsted , Kent .
The Wisbey family are all learning how to help Elke use the machine , but the little girl , who will never be able to walk or talk for herself or feed herself , has mastered it more quickly than any of them .
She has already got to grips with a number of words and phrases and can also play games and browse the internet with it .
Mrs Wisbey said : ' Elke is an absolute delight to know .
She smiles when she recognises people and places and she showers hugs on those she likes best .
' It 's going to change our lives completely .
We 've been overwhelmed by people 's support , it takes some people years to raise this kind of money and we 've done it in a summer . '
I 've removed the original post of a little time ago because after listening to the clip about two dozen times , what sounded like McCain saying " horseshit " actually comes through as having a hard " c " at the front of it .
My husband insists that McCain said " Course not . "
I think now my hubby 's right , although it 's very muffled .
You can hear the moment at around the 4:30 mark in this video .
I 'm sorry for mis-hearing this .
I 've heard McCain say worse in my presence ( and thought none the less of him for it ) so it was n't exactly bizarre .
[ Update : a reader persuasively says that McCain is saying " ' Course you can " and it sounds like " corshucan " . ]
[ Update II : I just listened to it all over again and now I 'm not clear again .
Oh , the joys of blogging in real time .
If anyone has another translation for what was an under - the - breath remark by McCain , I 'd be happy to air anything that makes sense .
I 'd email the McCain campaign but they wo n't answer blogger emails . ]
[ Update III : I listened to it on headphones .
Now I think my husband was right again .
McCain says : " ' Course ... Course not . "
Well : ' mutters angrily ' conveys the tone better . ]
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Emulating Java Enums in .NET - F# Edition Wednesday , October 1 , 2008
I 'm not usually one to follow up replies from another 's blog in my own , but some challenges need further analysis .
Ayende posted earlier about emulating the behavior of Java Enums in .NET .
Since the inception of C# , there has been a lot of back and forth between Java and C# in terms of features such as generics , attributes ( annotations ) , foreach statements , and lastly enums .
There are significant differences between the two , but let 's see if we can bridge that gap .
Enter Java Enums
Previous to Java 5.0 , Java had a standard way of delcaring an enumerated type as a constant .
This was neither type safe , brittle and rather uninformative ( what does 3 mean anyways ? ) .
Finally , come 5.0 , this feature was added to have simple enums such as we 've had in C# all along .
But , unlike C# , these were not capable of being cast to an integer , unsigned or otherwise .
A simple enum could look something like this .
public enum PriorityLevel { Low , Medium , High }
Not only can they hold the value just as C/ C++/ C# enums can , they can also hold behavior and data .
Let 's expand our PriorityLevel to hold an integer level equivalent .
public final enum PriorityLevel { Low ( " Low Priority " ) , Medium ( " Medium Priority " ) , High ( " High Priority " ) ; private static final Map < String , Status > lookup = getLookup ( ) ; private static HashMap < String , PriorityLevel > getLookup ( ) { HashMap < String , PriorityLevel > l = new HashMap < String , PriorityLevel >( ) ; for ( PriorityLevel p : EnumSet.allOf( PriorityLevel. class ) ) l.put(p.getLevel ( ) , p ) ; return l ; } private String level ; private PriorityLevel ( String level ) { this . level = level ; } public String getLevel ( ) { return level ; } public static Priority Level get( String level ) { return lookup.
get ( level ) ; } }
This gives us the ability to define a string equivalent for our given enum value .
This can be a powerful concept that the data is not just limited to integers .
So , this had me thinking about the possibilities of this in .NET .
Enter C# 3.0 and Extension Methods
Given that the ability of the Java enum has the ability to map itself to another data type 's equivalent quite easily , it was a matter of time before we tried something like that in C# .
With the birth of extension methods , we have the ability to add features onto given types , such as enums .
An example of taking the above example and using extension methods might look like this .
public enum PriorityLevel
{
Low ,
Medium ,
High
}
public static class Extensions
{
public static string GetLevel ( this PriorityLevel level )
{
switch ( level )
{
case PriorityLevel .
High :
return " High Priority " ;
case PriorityLevel .
Medium :
return " Medium Priority " ;
case PriorityLevel .Low :
return " Low Priority " ;
default :
throw new NotSupportedException ( ) ;
}
}
}
It 's not the best solution , but it certainly works .
Instead , let 's look at another language , and yes , one that I 've been talking a bit about recently in regards to F# .
Enter F#
When I was looking over Ayende 's post , it struck me that people were using Java enums in such a way that it looked like discriminated unions .
This is the ability to create a set of discriminators to use with pattern matching .
Each discriminator may hold different data types as well , which makes them extra powerful .
Let 's look at an equivalent of the above examples in F# .
# light
type PriorityLevel =
| Low
| Medium
| High
with member x .
GetLevel ( ) =
match x with
| Low -> " Low Priority "
| Medium -> " Medium Priority "
| High ->
" High Priority "
This is just a simple example of being able to add on behaviors to our discriminated union .
It could be expanded on to include more behaviors , but I think the point is well made .
The Challenge
Back to the challenge at hand , Ayende posted a quick code snippet of Java enum code that he wanted to transform into .
NET .
Let 's first look at the Java code and then the F# code sample that I put as an equivalent .
private static enum Layer { FIRST , SECOND ; public boolean isRightLayer ( WorkType type ) { if ( this == FIRST && type != WorkType.COLLECTION ) return true ; return this == SECOND && type == WorkType.COLLECTION ; } }
Now using the techniques I used above , let 's give a more complete code sample of what that might look like using F#. I 'll use discriminated unions and pattern matching once again to get the message across .
# light
type WorkType =
| Collection
| NonCollection
type Layer =
| First
| Second
with member x .
IsRightLayer ( workType ) =
match ( x , workType ) with
| l , w when l = First && w <> Collection -> true
| l , w -> l = Second && w = Collection
I was able to pattern match against not just the discriminator , but also the WorkType discriminated union as a tuple , so that they are treated as one .
From there , I can pattern match against it rather easily .
Any questions ?
Wrapping It Up
Java enums are definitely powerful ways of holding and describing data , but as you can see , discriminated unions using F# and pattern matching can do a pretty adequate job as well to express the data .
Using these concepts can get you most of the way there with replicating the behavior , but it 's not a 100 % solution by any means .
But , what I hope it does do is get you to look beyond C# to the polyglot lifestyle .
Now back to your regular programming .
Hopes for much - needed political stability in Pakistan have crumbled along with its ruling coalition .
Following Nawaz Sharif 's exit from the government Monday , the political stage looks set to be dominated by a power struggle , which will draw attention away from antimilitant efforts and a faltering economy .
Only a week after it celebrated the resignation of former president Pervez Musharraf , Pakistan 's fractious coalition broke when former prime minister Mr. Sharif , leader of the Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz ( PML - N ) , stormed out on the Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) .
He blames his former coalition partner for repeatedly reneging on its promise to reinstate 60 judges suspended by Mr. Musharraf last year .
Sharif was also angered by an announcement that Asif Ali Zardari , chairman of the PPP and widower of its former leader , Benazir Bhutto , would stand for president .
The coalition partners had agreed to back a nonpartisan candidate until the presidents ' powers were constitutionally pared down .
Observers had hoped Mr. Zardari and Sharif , who represent different constituencies , would counterbalance each other .
But Zardari looks set to grab as much power as he can while Sharif will seek to undermine him in opposition .
In the 1990s , Sharif and the PPP , under Ms. Bhutto , were bitter rivals and alternated terms in power .
Many Pakistanis dread a return to the rancor and chaos of those days , which resulted , in 1999 , in Musharraf 's bloodless coup .
The split is unlikely to prompt early elections because the PPP , which holds the most seats in parliament , but not a majority , should be able to attract the support of smaller parties .
Instead , the rivalry between the two men is likely to be played out in presidential elections , scheduled for Sept.
6 . In response to Zardari 's nomination , Sharif has named his party 's candidate : Saeed - uz - Zaman Siddiqui , a former chief justice .
Political pundits will also be keeping a close watch on the Punjab , Pakistan 's biggest and most politically influential province .
The PML - N has ruled the Punjab with the PPP , but without its support , it may be reduced to a minority .
Sharif will thus be looking to rally support , particularly among members of the PML - Quaid - e - Azam ( PML - Q ) , which splintered from the PML - N after Sharif was ousted in 1999 and then backed Musharraf .
The PML - Q knows its best bet in the national elections lies with Sharif , who remains the most popular politician .
Sharif is also likely to seek and score political points from Zardari 's refusal to reinstate the judges , a position that has caused anger and disappointment throughout Pakistan .
Talat Hussain , a political commentator and leading journalist , says the PPP could demonstrate that it would lead a stable government by immediately restoring the judges , " but Mr. Zardari has shown himself unwilling to do that . "
Zardari , who is likely to win the presidency next week , is believed to oppose the return of the judges because he fears they will repeal an amnesty on corruption charges granted him last year .
The former businessman has served more than eight years in prison on corruption and other criminal charges , but without being convicted .
Concerns about Zardari 's likely presidency extend beyond corruption charges .
" Zardari is a very unpredictable guy , " says Mr. Hussain , referring to the fact that Zardari apologized to Sharif on state television Monday night and asked him to rejoin the government .
" What kind of politics is he playing ?
That kind of inconsistency will be very bad for Pakistan . "
The United States , however , is believed to be more comfortable with the prospect of working with Zardari than with Sharif , who is remembered as a difficult prime minister during the 1990s .
A conservative Muslim with even more conservative followers , Sharif has said that he is intent on quashing militancy but would like to lower the profile of US involvement in the war on terror .
Zardari , by comparison , has adopted a hawkish tone in recent days , arguing that the Pakistani Taliban should be banned .
Analysts say that regardless of his political battle with Sharif , Zardari will have to demonstrate convincingly that he is taking control of Pakistan 's fight against terrorism if he is to enjoy any credence as president .
MOBILE , Ala . 
The McCain campaign ’s depiction of Barack Obama as a mysterious “ other ” with an impenetrable background may not be resonating in the national polls , but it has found a receptive audience with many white Southern voters .
In interviews here in the Deep South and in Virginia , white voters made it clear that they remain deeply uneasy with Mr. Obama  with his politics , his personality and his biracial background .
Being the son of a white mother and a black father has come to symbolize Mr. Obama ’s larger mysteries for many voters .
When asked about his background , a substantial number of people interviewed said they believed his racial heritage was unclear , giving them another reason to vote against him .
“ He ’s neither - nor , ” said Ricky Thompson , a pipe fitter who works at a factory north of Mobile , while standing in the parking lot of a Wal - Mart store just north of here .
“ He ’s other .
It ’s in the Bible .
Come as one .
Do n’t create other breeds . ”
Whether Mr. Obama is black , half - black or half - white often seemed to overshadow the question of his exact stand on particular issues , and rough - edged comments on the subject flowed easily even from voters who said race should not be an issue in the campaign .
Many voters seemed to have no difficulty criticizing the mixing of the races  and thus the product of such mixtures  even as they indignantly said a candidate ’s color held no importance for them .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Iraqi security forces raided the home of a provincial leader of U.S. - backed patrols on Tuesday , an incident that could raise tension at a time when the Baghdad government is taking over the program from the U.S. military .
Mullah Shihab al - Safi , leader of the “ Awakening ” movement for the volatile Diyala province north of Baghdad , told Reuters troops had raided his house before dawn , arresting his brother and father , in Buhriz , south of the provincial capital Baquba .
Safi said by telephone he was not at home at the time and was now moving from place to place to avoid capture .
He later said his brother and father were released after several hours .
Iraqi Interior Ministry spokesman Major - General Abdul Karim Khalaf said an operation had been carried out to capture suspects he said were accused of terrorism and murder .
He gave no further details and declined to comment on the identity of the suspects , but said no one would have been arrested without a criminal warrant .
The Awakening groups are made up mostly of Sunni Arabs and include many former insurgents who battled U.S. forces and the Shi’ite - led government in Baghdad but since have been recruited and paid by the U.S. military to run neighborhood patrols .
The Iraqi government has been taking over the program from the U.S. military , beginning this month in Baghdad and spreading to other provinces in coming months .
Iraqi officials say they will incorporate 20 percent of the patrol members into the army and police while finding civilian jobs or training for the rest .
But many Awakening leaders say they fear mass arrests from a government that remains hostile to them .
“ They have been arresting the leaders for a while .
The government are going back on their promises , ” Safi said .
Safi said the government troops had also raided the home of the provincial spokesman for the Awakening groups , Laith Saleh , and beat him before arresting him .
Diyala province has been one of the most volatile parts of Iraq , with Sunni militants staging frequent suicide and car bomb attacks .
The U.S. military says it is one of the areas where the militants have regrouped since being driven out of other areas .
The report highlighted the treatment of Tibetans Repression of religious freedom in some parts of China has intensified over the past year , the US government says .
The state department 's annual report on religious freedom around the world criticised Beijing 's actions in remote Xinjiang province and Tibetan areas .
Iran , Burma , Egypt and North Korea were all singled out for criticism , along with nations regarded as more tolerant such as Jordan and Algeria .
The report noted some improvements in Saudi Arabia and Vietnam .
Presenting the document , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said religious freedom was " at the core of our nation " .
" The United States rejects actions that are offensive to particular religious traditions , but we do not condone the prohibition of free speech .
That only weakens societies , " she said .
She was particularly critical of attempts to outlaw criticism of religions under a principle known as " defamation of religions " , which has been championed in the UN by Islamic countries .
" Instead of protecting religious practice and promoting tolerance , this concept seeks to limit freedom of speech and that could undermine the standards of international religious freedom , " she said .
Violators blacklisted
The lengthy report has individual sections dealing with each country separately and covers the period from July 2007 to July 2008 .
In China , the report highlighted the treatment of the Uighur people - a Muslim group living mainly in Xinjiang .
" The government reportedly continued to detain Uighur Muslim citizens for possession of unauthorised religious texts , imprison them for religious activities determined to be ' extremist ' , and prevent them from observing certain sacred religious traditions , " the report said .
It was also critical of the Beijing government 's handling of protests by Tibetans in March - particularly of the use of " patriotic education campaigns " in a bid to stifle dissent .

BEIJING  Local governments in a Muslim desert region in western China have imposed strict limits on religious practices during the traditional Muslim fasting month of Ramadan , which began last week , according to the Web sites of four of those governments .
The rules include prohibiting women from wearing veils and men from growing beards , as well as barring government officials from observing Ramadan .
One town , Yingmaili , requires that local officials check up on mosques at least twice a week during Ramadan .
The local governments administer areas in the western part of Xinjiang , a vast autonomous region that is home to the Uighurs , a Muslim Turkic people who often chafe under rule by the ethnic Han Chinese .
In August , a wave of attacks swept through Xinjiang , the largest surge of violence in the region in years .
Some local officials blamed separatist groups for the instability , and the central government sent security forces to the area .
The limits on religious practices put in place by local governments appear to be part of the broader security crackdown .
The areas affected by the new rules are near Kuqa , a town struck by multiple bombings on Aug. 10 .
I get five or so requests a week from people who want a PC at home that they can surf the web and check email from .
Most of them do n’t want to do anything much more complicated than watching YouTube videos .
I usually give them all the same recipe for doing this on the cheap , and thus I thought it ’d be worthwhile to present it to all of my readers .
If you want this kind of system , here ’s how you can get it for usually less than $ 100 .
Step 1 : Get the Basic Hardware You ’ll Need
Start off by hitting the yard sales and your social network for the basic pieces .
What you ’re looking for are the basic components of an old PC .
You ’ll need a monitor , the computer box itself ( which should include a CD drive or – preferably – a drive that can read DVDs , too ) , a keyboard , a mouse , and perhaps some speakers .
Many people upgrade their computers on a regular basis , tossing out old monitors that still work or other peripherals they do n’t need , so just ask around .
You wo n’t need much of a computer at all – anything above 1 gigahertz or with more than 384 megabytes of memory will do .
I purchased a computer seven years ago with substantially more hardware than that , so it should be easy to find without much expense at all .
Do n’t know much about computer specifics ?
Your best bet is to simply get ahold of the person you know with the most computer knowledge and tell them that you ’re looking for the pieces for a very low - end PC .
If you feel more comfortable , you can simply check out Dell.com or your local superstore and get the least expensive computer that they sell – this way , you can be sure the hardware is new , at least , though you ’ll likely spend $ 200 - 400 in this case .
Once you get it home , though , you should ignore the version of Windows that comes with it and continue below , because on a low - end system like that , Windows will run quite slowly – there is a better way .
This is the only part that will cost you any money at all .
The remaining steps wo n’t cost you a dime .
Step 2 : Get the Basic Software You ’ll Need
Do n’t just install Windows , as Windows will run extremely poorly on that old of a system ( and it ’s expensive , too ) .
Instead , get a user - friendly version of Linux called Ubuntu .
If you have a friend that can burn a few CDs for you , you can download it for free and have your friend make CDs of it .
Otherwise , you can request that they mail you a CD of it for free .
The free CD by mail takes quite a while , so you might want to get on it if you want to order one .
Do n’t let the unknown make you fearful – Ubuntu is easy to use .
I would happily install Ubuntu on the computer of even the biggest computer novice without much worry .
In fact , Ubuntu is currently running on one of my computers here at home – the only desktop PC in our home is running Ubuntu , not Windows .
When you ’ve put together that basic system ( plugged the mouse , keyboard , monitor , and speakers into the central unit , then plugged the central unit and monitor into the wall ) , just put the CD into the CD drive , then power it up .
The installation will walk you through the steps – easy as pie .
Remember , even if you have difficulty getting Ubuntu to work , you have n’t invested any money in it at all , so you can always back out and try using something else with no worries .
Once you ’re going with it , there ’s extensive online help that addresses just about every question you might possibly have on your home computer .
You will probably also want to set things up to allow yourself to play restricted media , like DVDs , mp3 files , and so forth .
Step 3 : Get the Other Software You ’ll Need
Ubuntu comes with most of the software you need – Firefox for browsing the web , Thunderbird for email , and lots of other software packages .
You may also be interested in getting OpenOffice ( free word processing , spreadsheets , and so on ) and KMyMoney ( free money management software , like Quicken ) .
In fact , the sole reason I have n’t switched to Ubuntu myself is the lack of a good replacement for Adobe Photoshop .
There are several applications which attempt to mimic it ( and do a solid job ) , but I use Photoshop for so many purposes that until they release a Linux version , I ’m going to be sticking with the Mac / PC world .
For almost everyone else , this is n’t really an issue , but I thought I ’d clarify my biggest reason for not jumping on board .
In short , if you just want a very basic home PC to check email and browse the web , this is the cheapest way to get one .
You can get a fully - functional , visually appealing , and rather speedy home computer for just the cost of a handful of component parts – most of which you can find very cheaply if you hunt around and tap your social network a bit .
NEW ORLEANS , Louisiana ( CNN ) -- Hurricane Gustav did n't pack the wallop of Katrina three years earlier , officials said Monday , but they urged almost 2 million evacuees to stay away from the Gulf Coast for another day .

" Tomorrow is not a day to start coming back to the city of New Orleans , " Mayor Ray Nagin said Monday night .
" Power lines are down all over the city ; there 's a significant number of homes and businesses that are without power , " Nagin said .
Still , he said , Gustav did n't do the damage feared a few days ago , a possible repeat of 2005 's Hurricane Katrina .
" I 'd probably call Gustav , instead of the mother of all storms , maybe the mother - in - law or the ugly sister of all storms , " Nagin said .
Across Louisiana , more than 800,000 people were without electricity , and some may not see it restored for two weeks or more , Gov. Bobby Jindal said .
At a news conference with Jindal , Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff urged Gulf Coast residents who evacuated to stay away until damage could be assessed .
But even those who fled faced hardships .
About 2,700 people who took up short - term residence Monday in the Louisiana State University Agriculture Center in Alexandria were told that the buildings generator power was not reaching the plumbing system , meaning no showers and no flushing toilets , said John Barnett , head of the facilities .
" It 's really crowded , and everybody 's just trying to do their best , " said Kesha Harlow , who was there with her daughter , 8 , and her son , 2 months .
" We 're just waiting for the storm to blow over . "
Gustav roared from the Gulf of Mexico into southern Louisiana on Monday as a Category 2 hurricane with sustained winds of 110 mph , bringing fierce winds and heavy rains from the Alabama - Florida border west into Texas .

In Baton Rouge , Louisiana , two people were killed when a tree fell on the house where they were staying after they had come from farther south to escape the storm , officials said .
A man was killed in a similar incident in north Lafayette , Louisiana , officials said .
Four hospice patients died while waiting for air ambulances to evacuate them from southern Louisiana , according to Richard Zuschlag , chairman and CEO of Acadian Ambulance .
Gustav was blamed for more than 60 deaths in the Caribbean , including 51 in southwestern Haiti .
At 10 p.m. CT , Gustav was a tropical storm with sustained winds of 60 mph , the National Hurricane Center said .
In New Orleans , Gustav drove sheets of water over the protective levees around the Industrial Canal early Monday afternoon , but the walls appeared to hold up under the onslaught as the winds faded .
Up to 6 feet of water spilled into an industrial park in the Upper 9th Ward late Monday morning , pouring through small gaps in the concrete flood walls before receding in the afternoon .

But as the storm eased , inspectors from the Army Corps of Engineers and parish levee boards went out to check on the earthen walls and have found nothing to raise alarm , said Col. Craig Gunter , a Corps of Engineers spokesman .

" The levees all held up , " Nagin said .
" I was hoping that this would happen , that we would be able to stand before America and before everyone and say we had some success with the levee system . "
With the water level in Lake Pontchartrain north of the city rising , the Army Corps of Engineers closed flood gates on the 17th Street Canal and the London Avenue Canal , two areas that caused some of the more severe flooding during Katrina .
Official feared late Monday afternoon that a private levee south of New Orleans was in danger of failing , but water levels receded , and sandbagging efforts appeared to have paid off .
" We have stopped the bleeding , and I am very encouraged by what we are seeing , " Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser said of the levee in Braithwaite .
Gustav made landfall Monday morning near the coastal town of Cocodrie , Louisiana , about 80 miles southwest of New Orleans .

The storm 's eastern bands , which generally pack the most powerful winds , also hammered Mississippi as Gustav moved to the west of New Orleans .
In Biloxi , Mississippi , iReporter Kevin Wise , who lives two blocks from the beach , said Gustav had pushed the Gulf waters into a highway about 100 yards from the normal shoreline .
" On the beach , it was blowing hard enough that you had to squat down to take a picture ; it could pretty much throw you around , " he said .
Wise said he and his wife ignored mandatory evacuation orders for his area .
Almost 2 million residents evacuated the Louisiana coast , but some in New Orleans opted to brave the storm .
" It really did n't look as vicious as , obviously , Katrina did , " Jack Bosma said .

He said the wind scattered his back gate across his yard , but his power was on , and neighbors had been congregating on his porch .
" It 's really , quite honestly , basically , just like a bad storm .
It does n't seem that drastic at all , " he said .

Meanwhile , forecasters said late Monday that Hurricane Hanna was nearly stationary in the Bahamas .
At 11 p.m. ET , Hanna had maximum sustained winds of 80 mph , making it a Category 1 storm .
Hanna could make landfall Friday near the Georgia / South Carolina border , possibly as a Category 2 storm with winds of 100 mph .
And in the far eastern Atlantic , Tropical Storm Ike formed Monday with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph , the National Hurricane Center said .
It was headed toward the Bahamas

BMW makes push for open - source in - vehicle electronics
At an electronics panel held yesterday in Detroit , BMW said it is developing an open - source platform for electronics that would allow third - party suppliers to develop plug - and - play applications for its vehicles .
This revolutionary move would allow the software industry to contribute code for in - vehicle infotainment systems , opening up a whole new world of possibilities , BMW says .
BMW was the only automaker involved in the panel - which included Chrysler , Ford , General Motors and Honda - that said they will have an open - source platform in a vehicle of 200,000 or more units within the next seven years , Automotive News reports .
BMW co-developed the open - source Linux system with Wind River Systems and Intel .
" We were convinced we had to develop an open platform that would allow for open software since the speed in the infotainment and entertainment industry requires us to be on a much faster track , " Gunter Reichart , BMW vice president of driver assistance , body electronics and electrical networks , said at the event .
" We invite other OEMs to join with us , to exchange with us .
We are open to exchange with others . "
GM and Chrysler also expressed strong interest in developing an open - source electronics system .
Honda and Ford , which use Microsoft - developed systems , were a little more cautious .
" We also need to make sure who will be responsible for such an open system architecture , " Honda 's Toyohei Nakajima said .
" Maybe we need to learn more about that from BMW . "
Nakajima was concerned that a strong firewall would need to be included to prevent users from unknowingly altering other systems in the vehicle .

On September 1st , 2008 , Google announced its new open source browser , Google Chrome .
The introduction of a new web browser by Google , a major player in the web by anyone 's standards , has predictably resulted in a flurry of attention , analysis and soothsaying .
The official announcement was preceded by a fair amount of buzz on the internet as the comic introduction that Google made to introduce Chrome made its first appearance before the announcement and before the release of the Windows beta of Chrome on September 2nd , 12 pm PDT .
InfoQ has taken some time to compile some of the perspectives and analysis from the community , news media and blogosphere in order to assemble comprehensive coverage of the Google Chrome launch and its impact .
Introducing Chrome
Google introduced the browser through a comic designed for journalists and bloggers , drawn by Scott McCloud , the well - known author of Making Comics .
The script was a collaboration between McCloud and the developers themselves , who McCloud interviewed and paraphrased .
The comic introduces some of the areas where Google tried to differentiate Chrome from its competition : a focus on serving applications rather than content , a process - oriented approach to achieve a separation between isolated , sandboxed processes , a simplified tab - centric user interface , fast rendering and javascript engines and a built - in incognito browsing mode .
Chrome features a very simple user interface with tabs , an address / navigation bar and an optional toolbar .
Although simplified interfaces are a common feature in modern web browsers , Google has taken this a step farther than most of its competitors .
As Ars Technica puts it :
Google 's approach with Chrome is different .
Rather than removing features from existing web browsers , Google has taken its brightly colored forearm and swept the table absolutely clean .
Forget about menu separators ; why even have a bookmarks menu ?
Hell , why have a menu bar at all ?
Start with nothing .
Assume nothing .
Add features only as needed , and only in service of a well - defined design concept .
It 's not that any particular feature of Chrome is so wonderful , or even that the sum of those features puts Safari back on its heels in the browser wars .
It 's the idea that someone other than Apple has taken such clear leadership in this area .
Google Chrome makes Safari 's user interface look conservative ; it makes Apple look timid .
And when it comes to innovation , overall daring counts for a lot more than individual successes or failures on the long - term graph .
This simplified interface is meant to distract less from the primary content : the web site or web application with which the user is interacting .
For web applications in particular , Chrome can be stripped down even further with an interface that lacks even the navigation toolbar and dedicated links so that the resulting window looks that much more like an application instead of a web browser .
Chrome also ships with Google Gears , whose primary purpose is to extend the capabilities of web applications and make them more like desktop applications , such as allowing them to function even when the user is disconnected from the internet .
Google has given the tabbed interface primary emphasis by placing the tabs at the top of the browser and allowing the tabs to be dragged not only within the frame but outside of it to create new windows or to move a tab from one window to another .
These tabs are isolated from each other and sandboxed so that they are treated more like individual applications , where one misbehaving tab wo n't spoil the experience for the entire web browser .
Although the comic introduction talks about process separation in some detail , the Chromium site goes into more detail of the four process models supported by Chromium and their strengths and weaknesses :
For its beta release , Chromium supports four different process models to allow experimentation and measurements , which will help us select a default model that best fits most users .
By default , Chromium uses a separate OS process for each instance of a web site the user visits .
However , users can specify command - line switches when starting Chromium to select one of the other architectures : Chromium can instead use one process per web site , or it can isolate each group of connected tabs , or it can place everything in a single process .
These models differ in whether they reflect the origin of the content , the browser 's user interface , or both .
Topics of processes and threads draw regular controversy and this announcement is no exception .
Chrome also contains a private browsing mode called Incognito which allows the user to browse in a read - only session that does n't save browser history and whose cookies are erased when the window is closed .
Technology and Internals
The Chrome browser is the result of the Chromium project , which connects the WebKit web browser engine with the new Google V8 JavaScript Engine , the Skia vector graphics engine , and Google Gears .
The WebKit browser engine began its life as a fork of the KDE project 's KHTML and KJS engines by Apple , becoming the basis of the Safari browser .
WebKit was later re-adopted by KDE .
Google already employs WebKit within their Android mobile phone platform , and it became the obvious solution for them .
As the comic introduction to Chrome states :
It uses memory efficiently , was easily adapted to embedded devices , and it was easy for new browser developers to learn to make the code base work .
Browsers are complex .
One of the things done well with WebKit is that it 's kept SIMPLE .
The version of WebKit used in the initial Windows beta seems to be WebKit 525.13 , which is not the most recent version , and has some security vulnerabilities ( see Security below ) .
Some users have also noticed rendering differences from Safari's WebKit rendering to Chrome 's , including antialiasing and shadows .
This may be the result of the Skia graphics engine used under the hood .
Talking about the integration with WebKit , the Chromium FAQ says :
The Chromium source code includes a copy of the WebKit source .
We frequently snapshot against the WebKit tip of tree or specific branches according to our release needs .
Our goal is to reduce the size and complexity of the differences between the copy we maintain in order to work more effectively as a participant in the WebKit community and also to make periodic updates occur more smoothly .
The V8 JavaScript Engine is open - source and hosted on Google Code , but was written for Chrome , rather than adopting an existing JavaScript engine .
V8 is written in ~ 100,000 lines of C++ and can be run standalone or embedded in C++ applications .
The foremost reason for V8 's creation seems to be performance .
The V8 Design Documentation states , " V8 is ... designed for fast execution of large JavaScript applications . "
The Chromium Blog on V8 is entitled " The Need for Speed " and states :
Google Chrome features a new JavaScript engine , V8 , that has been designed for performance from the ground up .
In particular , we wanted to remove some common bottlenecks that limit the amount and complexity of JavaScript code that can be used in Web applications .
V8 claims a number of performance improvements and innovations , from fast property access using hidden classes , dynamic machine code generation and efficient garbage collection ( stop - the - world , generational , accurate , compacting ) , small object hreaders , multi- threaded from the ground up .
The team that created V8 was headed by Lars Bak , who , as Avi Bryant says , was " the technical lead for both Strongtalk and the HotSpot Java VM , and a huge contributor to the original Self VM " and has a number of VM - related patents to his name .
V8 is not a virtual machine in the classic sense as Matthieu Riou points out : there 's no intermediate representation or byte - code .
As a result , you cannot write your own language that compiles to " V8 byte code " , although you can cross -compile to JavaScript .
Despite this , Dave Griswold believes that V8 could serve as the engine for other dynamic languages :
I think these properties will rapidly make V8 the dominant VM for dynamic languages .
It ought to make a great platform for Smalltalk .
Google Gears has also moved into the Chromimum Project , as pointed out in the FAQ :
With Gears as a plug - in to Chromium we 're carrying two copies of sqlite and two copies of V8 .
That 's silly .
We 're integrating the code so Gears can run great in Chromium .
We plan to continue to build Gears for other browsers out of the same code base .
Although Google Chrome supports plugins for content handling like Flash and PDF , it does not currently support browser extensions , although that is planned .
History
Niall Kennedy documented the history behind Google Chrome .
He starts by describing Google 's push for browser enhancements starting with its heavy use of Ajax and working with Ian Hickson on HTML5 and browser ' acid ' compliance , through to browser extensions like Google Gears , Browser Sync and Safe Browsing .
From there , he talks about Google 's Android project with its WebKit browser acquired with Reqwireless , the Skia vector graphics library and the GreenBorder security sandbox .
Finally , he describes the Chrome team headed by Ben Goodger and the V8 team headed by Lars Bak .
Wired 's Steven Levy also covers some of the back - story behind the development of Chrome with his Inside Chrome : The Secret Project to Crush IE and Remake the Web , tracing its genesis back to 2001 :
" The browser matters , " CEO Eric Schmidt says .
He should know , because he was CTO of Sun Microsystems during the great browser wars of the 1990s .
Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin know it , too .
" When I joined Google in 2001 , Larry and Sergey immediately said , ' We should build our own browser , ' " Schmidt says .
" And I said no . "
Levy covers the initial prototype , the V8 team , and despite some early leaks , the surprise launch :
It 's incredible that something as potentially game - changing as a Google browser has stayed under wraps for two years .
It was n't until mid-2007 , about a year into the project , that the team let employees outside the group even see what they were doing .
At the first of a series of Tech Talks featuring the current prototype ( events designed , in part , as a way of recruiting internally for the ever - growing team ) the reaction was volcanic .
Googlers broke into spontaneous applause when various features , like dragging a tab into a new window , were demo'd .
As the number of people who knew about Chrome increased , the inevitable occurred â€ ” word did leak out to a blog or two , yet nothing came of those stray items .
No reporter put it all together .
" I think it was because rumors about Google browsers have been around so long â€ ” it 's like sightings of Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster , " Upson says
The Launch : Windows - Only , Carpet - bombing , Privacy , EULA
Google 's launch truly began when the comic surfaced , after which there was a blog post and a day 's delay before the software beta became available .
In the meantime , the comic itself gathered a lot of attention .
Josh Evnin applauded the use of " actual Googlers " named in the comic and the way technical topics were both present and well - explained :
And another thing Google did well here was in not trying to over - engineer their explanations of highly technical processes .
They simplified their message down to bare essentials , and I felt enlightened after reading this document .
Most technical documentation talks down to people , assuming that all the basics are already understood .
Google removed some barriers to entry by explaining their new technologies in a way that almost anyone with a little technical know - how can understand .
This is something almost every other open source project out there fails at .
Technical documentation is far more than simply documentationâ€ ¦itâ€™s an implicit invitation to take part in the experience .
At the end of the day , Iâ€™m really impressed at the quality of this documentation .
I actually read the entire thing , which is much more than I can say about the technical documentation for any other software I use .
Who knew that I could find the difference between multiple threads and multiple processes interesting ?
Google Chrome is currenly only available in Beta form on Windows , although other platforms are due soon .
Both Mac and Linux versions have been referenced , but there are no explicit dates for their launch .
The Mac version of Chromium is eagerly anticipated , and made an appearance in the press when Sergey Brin said the lack of a Mac version was " embarassing " .
The Mac version of Chrome has been benefiting from the efforts of Mike Pinkerton , the Project Lead and Lead Developer of Camino as well as a Google employee working on Google Desktop for Mac .
Amanda Walker notes on the Google Mac that although the Chrome team includes people with a lot of expertise in particular operating systems , they 're still one team , and each member of the team contributes on all platforms .
On the current state and progress , Walker wrote :
Right now , both are in the " pieces build and pass tests , but there 's no Chromium application yet . "
While we 're working hard and fast on catching up to the Windows version , we 're not setting an artificial date for when they 'll be ready -- we simply can't predict enough to make a solid estimate , and we expect to learn a lot from the Windows public beta as well .
On the plus side , since the project is now public , you 'll be able to watch ( and maybe even contribute to ) the progress from week to week .
As these versions stabilize , we will create official betas , much as we are now for the Windows version .
While we can't give any dates yet , we 'll keep everyone informed as we get closer .
If you 're interested in following the development of Chromium for Linux and Mac OS X , the Chromium development site is probably the resource to watch .
The launch of Chrome has not gone without its share of missteps .
Chrome is apparently vulnerable to a carpet - bombing flaw that has been publicized and fixed in later versions of WebKit than Google has integrated .
Although Chrome is a beta product , the comic introduction touts the security inherent in its design .
Similarly , some people feel that Chrome oversteps its bounds in terms of privacy .
The omnibox ( location bar , to those of you not yet speaking Chrome 's lingo ) offers suggestions as you type , and in order to do so , regularly sends data to the selected search engine , which defaults to Google .
This leads some to argue that Chrome and privacy is a situation already worse than you think , although Google has already responded to concerns about the amount of this data that is retained .
Matt Cutts has spoken with the Google Chrome team to learn when Chrome " phones home " , and summarized :
I knew that as soon as Google Chrome launched , some readers would ask tough questions about privacy and how / when Google Chrome communicates with google.com .
So I decided to tackle this issue head - on .
I talked to the Chrome team to find out if thereâ€™s anything to worry about .
The short answer is no .
Despite these assurances , Germany 's federal office of information security is reported to have warned users to avoid Chrome .
The Terms of Service have also come under fire for implying that Google retains a license to all content viewed in Chrome .
Matt Cutts and Rebecca Ward , senior product counsel for Google Chrome agreed the terms were a mistake ; the terms were revised on Wednesday , September 3rd , and the controversy has largely quietened .
Browser Wars and Other Motives
Many people have heralded the launch as the renewal of the browser wars once fought between Microsoft and Netscape / Mozilla ( those were the primary contenders , although every browser has its contigent willing to trumpet its strengths ) .
Some are willing to count Chrome out already , while others are adopting a wait and see stance .
Many argue that Google does n't wish to compete with other browsers , simply to advance the state of network - delivered applications to where they are indistinguishable from desktop applications and in so doing , push the operating system into the background .
In particular , people telling this story love to cast Microsoft in the opposing role , so that one can imagine the two titans clashing .
Other Browsers : Comparisons and Impact
Some believe that Chrome is merely re-iterating what other browsers have already done .
Georgios Kasselakis argued on OSNews that Chrome 's process models are n't that different from IE8 and its tabs are pretty similar to those offered by Opera , a sentiment echoed by an Opera user .
Although V8 claims high speed backed by benchmarks , other browser manufacturers have been making similar claims to improved speed on their development lines .
Mozilla 's Firefox 3.1 has TraceMonkey , which offers speed improvements , and Brendan Eich has done some testing of his own .
He believes TraceMonkey is already faster than V8 in some categories , and " in the game " in other categories , although he notes :
V8 is great work , very well - engineered , with room to speed up too .
( And Chrome looks good to great -- the multi-process architecture is righteous , but you expected no less praise from an old Unix hacker like me . )
What spectators have to realize is that this contest is not a playoff where each contending VM is eliminated at any given hype - event point .
We believe that Franz &Gal - style tracing has more " headroom " than less aggressively speculative approaches , due to its ability to specialize code , making variables constant and eliminating dead code and conditions at runtime , based on the latent types inherent in almost all JavaScript programs .
If we are right , we 'll find out over the next weeks and months , and so will you all .
The WebKit team has already been working on a new JavaScript interpreter , dubbed Squirrelfish , as previously described on InfoQ .
John Resig has a detailed performance analysis in which Squirrel Fish seems to come out on top , at least in places .
What everyone agrees on is that a focus on JavaScript performance is a good thing for the end users , who 'll end up with much faster JavaScript engines no matter who 's building them .
Many wonder what the introduction of another web browser will do to the existing web browsers on the market .
Some feel that Microsoft is already losing ground as Internet Explorer continues to lose market share .
Others fear that Firefox is more likely to suffer as Internet Explorer and Safari come preinstalled on Windows and Mac OS X , and many users simply use these without making an explicit choice , while Firefox and Chrome will fight for the same , smaller segment of the market that makes an explicit choice to download a browser .
Early stats seem to support this .
Google counters by arguing that the increased attention will remind people that they have a choice in terms of what browser they use , perhaps a choice they will exercise .
Even Marc Andressen seems to feel that Chrome will bring a rising tide of competition to lift all ships .
Additional Analysis
Although this addresses the most common perspectives and analyses on Google Chrome , there are any number of smaller conversations going on about Chrome and its impact :
Carsten Knobloch has already released a portable version of Google Chrome , although non-German - speaking readers may want to read an english summary .
Some KDE developers feel as if their contributions to the origin of WebKit go uncredited too often .
The Chrome Help group operated by Google already contains more than 1500 feature requests and suggestions ( e.g. FTP support , themes , launching chrome in icognito mode , etc. )
A number of people seem to feel that Chrome is the next step in Google 's drive to cloud computing Information Week does a good job of assembling the zeigeist here .
Jesper notes in his first impressions that the WebKit inspector seems very out of place in Chrome .
Yakov Fain notes that Google Chrome requires Java 6 U 10 , which he believes will please JavaFX developers , who are already riding the Chrome hype with a JavaFX / Chrome demo .
New chrome users may be interested to get some tips , such as the special about pages .
Google 's Android may pick up parts of the Chrome stack , although details remain sketchy .
Toolkit fans may want to know how Google will be doing cross-platform development :
We 're too early in the port to have incorporated a toolkit .
Most of the custom drawing goes through a library called Skia , which is comparable to Cairo in that it draws lines and rectangles but not buttons and checkboxes .
Many people have strong opinions about the toolkit , and part of the reason it's so divisive is because both libraries are quite capable of meeting Chromium 's needs .
In fact , because most of Chromium is just custom rendering for showing a web page -- for example , even the popup of an HTML select control is custom - drawn by WebKit -- we anticipate the only real places the toolkit will be visible are in the way some form controls look and in various dialogs like the preferences and " save as " dialogs .
With all of that said , the plan is to use GTK .
It 's not due to any dislike of Qt , but just because there 's more experience on the team with GTK and it matches the existing Firefox dependency on Linux .
Please keep calm . :)

ECMAScript Harmony
It 's no secret that the JavaScript standards body , Ecma 's Technical Committee 39 , has been split for over a year , with some members favoring ES4 , a major fourth edition to ECMA - 262 , and others advocating ES3.1 based on the existing ECMA - 262 Edition 3 ( ES3 ) specification .
Now , I 'm happy to report , the split is over .
The Ecma TC39 meeting in Oslo at the end of July was very productive , and if we keep working together , it will be seen as seminal when we look back in a couple of years .
Before this meeting , I worked with John Neumann , TC39 chair , and ES3.1 and ES4 principals , especially Lars Hansen ( Adobe ) , Mark Miller ( Google ) , and Allen Wirfs - Brock ( Microsoft ) , to unify the committee around shared values and a common roadmap .
This message is my attempt to announce the main result of the meeting , which I 've labeled " Harmony " .
Executive Summary
The committee has resolved in favor of these tasks and conclusions : 1 . Focus work on ES3.1 with full collaboration of all parties , and target two interoperable implementations by early next year .
2 . Collaborate on the next step beyond ES3.1 , which will include syntactic extensions but which will be more modest than ES4 in both semantic and syntactic innovation .
3 . Some ES4 proposals have been deemed unsound for the Web , and are off the table for good : packages , namespaces and early binding .
This conclusion is key to Harmony .
4 . Other goals and ideas from ES4 are being rephrased to keep consensus in the committee ; these include a notion of classes based on existing ES3 concepts combined with proposed ES3.1 extensions .
Detailed Statement
A split committee is good for no one and nothing , least of all any language specs that might come out of it .
Harmony was my proposal based on this premise , but it also required ( at least on the part of key ES4 folks ) intentionally dropping namespaces .
This is good news for everyone , both those who favor smaller changes to the language and those who advocate ongoing evolution that requires new syntax if not new semantics .
It does mean that some of the ideas going back to the first ES4 proposals in 1999 , implemented variously in JScript .NET and ActionScript , wo n't make it into any ES standard .
But the benefit is collaboration on unified successor specifications to follow ES3 , starting with ES3.1 and continuing after it with larger changes and improved specification techniques .
One of the use - cases for namespaces in ES4 was early binding ( use namespace intrinsic ) , both for performance and for programmer comprehension -- no chance of runtime name binding disagreeing with any earlier binding .
But early binding in any dynamic code loading scenario like the web requires a prioritization or reservation mechanism to avoid early versus late binding conflicts .
Plus , as some JS implementors have noted with concern , multiple open namespaces impose runtime cost unless an implementation works significantly harder .
For these reasons , namespaces and early binding ( like packages before them , this past April ) must go .
This is final , they are not even a future possibility .
To achieve harmony , we have to focus not only on nearer term improvements -- on " what 's in " or what could be in -- we must also strive to agree on what 's out .
Once namespaces and early binding are out , classes can desugar to lambda - coding +
Object .
freeze and friends from ES3.1 .
There 's no need for new runtime semantics to model what we talked about in Oslo as a harmonized class proposal ( I will publish wiki pages shortly to show what was discussed ) .
We talked about desugaring classes in some detail in Oslo .
During these exchanges , we discussed several separable issues , including classes , inheritance , like patterns , and type annotations .
I 'll avoid writing more here , except to note that there were clear axes of disagreement and agreement , grounds for hope that the committee could reach consensus on some of these ideas , and general preference for starting with the simplest proposals and keeping consensus as we go .
We may add runtime helpers if lambda - coding is too obscure for the main audience of the spec , namely implementors who aim to achieve interoperation , but who may not be lambda - coding gurus .
But we will try to avoid extending the runtime semantic model of the 3.1 spec , as a discipline to guard against complexity .
One possible semantic addition to fill a notorious gap in the language , which I sketched with able help from Mark Miller : a way to generate new Name objects that do not equate as property identifiers to any string .
I also showed some sugar , but that is secondary at this point .
Many were in favor of this new Name object idea .
There remain challenges , in particular getting off of the untestable and increasingly unwieldy ES1 - 3.x spec formalism .
I heard some generally agree , and no one demur , about the ES4 approach of using an SML + self - hosted built - ins reference implementation ( RI ) .
We are going to look into stripping the RI of namespaces and early binding ( which it uses to ensure normative self - hosted behavior , not susceptible to " user code " modifying the meaning of built - ins ) , simplifying it to implement ES3.1 plus or minus ( self - hosted built - ins may require a bit more magic ) .
More on that effort soon .
ES3.1 standardizes getters and setters that were first implemented at Mozilla and copied by Apple and Opera .
More such de -facto standardization is on the table for a successor edition in the harmonized committee .
I heard good agreement on low - hanging " de- facto standard " fruit , particularly let as the new var , to match block - scoped const as still proposed ( IIRC ) in 3.1 .
Also some favorable comments about simple desugarings such as expression closures and destructuring assignment , and other changes in JS1.7 and 1.8 that do not require new runtime semantic models .
Obviously , these require new syntax , which is appropriate for a major post - 3.1 " ES - harmony " edition .
Syntax is user interface , there 's no reason to avoid improving it .
What 's more , the intersection semantics of extended ES3 implementations conflict and choke off backward - compatible * semantics * for syntax that may even parse in all top four browsers ( e.g. , functions in blocks ) .
Both the appropriateness of new syntax , and the need to make incompatible ( with ES3 extensions ) semantic changes , motivate opt - in versioning of harmonized successor edition .
I believe that past concerns about opt - in versioning requiring server file suffix to MIME type mapping maintenance were assuaged ( browsers in practice , and HTML5 + RFC 4329 , do not consider server - sent Content - Type -- the web page author can write version parameters directly in script tag type attributes ) .
Some expressed interest in an in - language pragma to select version ; this would require immediate version change during parsing .
It 's a topic for future discussions .
The main point , as important as cutting namespaces in my view , is that the committee has a vision for extending the language syntactically , not trying to fit new semantics entirely within some combination of existing " three of four top browsers " syntax and standard library extensions .
As Waldemar Horwat ( Google ) said on the final day , the meeting was seminal , and one of the most productive in a long while .
Much work remains on 3.1 and Harmony , but we are now on a good footing to make progress as a single committee .

GIBSON : Are you in favor of putting Georgia and Ukraine into NATO ?
PALIN : ( shrugs ) Ukraine , definitely yes ... and Georgia .
Putin thinks otherwise , obviously he thinks otherwise , but --
GIBSON : But under the NATO treaty , would n't we then have to go to war if Russia went into Georgia ?
PALIN : ( Nods ) P.. perhaps so .
I mean , if that is the agreement , when you are a NATO ally is that when another country is attacked , you 're going to be expected to be called upon and help .
Is anyone else reminded of Britney Spears inwhile watching this clip from Sarah Palin 's interview by Charles Gibson ?
This is what 's scary :
She 's clearly just throwing words around and making stuff up .
Her peeps like tough talk , so she 's talking tough .
Yes , folks , Sarah Palin wants to prove how big her penis is by going to war with Russia .
But hey , at least she 's not black , right ?
Who cares if she 's willing to provoke global thermonuclear war , at least she 's not a ni---- with a funny name .
And hey , she 's a hockey mom and you can see Russia from Alaska .
That makes her a Russian expert , right ?
In Idiot America , yes .

I started working at Starbucks after leaving another corporate franchise that was far deeper in the throes of economic difficulty than Starbucks is now .
Proex , a film developing lab with its own moderately - priced portrait studio , was having trouble competing with Target and Wal - Mart and their brand of simple shots of naked babies and one - hour , smudgy and blurry film processing .
( Not to mention digital cameras , which rendered everyday film use somewhat obsolete . )
I knew Proex was doing poorly when it introduced a $ 17 dollar member card that made their rates a bit closer to the Target across the street , and when they subsequently sent me to a class to be brainwashed into believing that the Frequent Photo Card was a great deal .
Our first exercise was to stand in a line and say our favorite thing about Frequent Photo Cards .
I said that I loved the pretty graphics .
The card was brown with predictable strips of film on the sides , and I had grown to hate looking at them for hours a day at work , taped all over the inside of our cashier island .
Proex had a simple strategy of dealing with the loss of sales , which I assumed was cooked up somewhere in the vicinity of David Ritz ( yes , of Ritz camera ; he had bought out many photo companies , including Wolff Camera ) .
That strategy was not to lower prices , but instead to penalize employees for being “ less than aggressive sellers . ”
I assume because people love to get their expensive photos with a side of a pushy salesperson .
It felt good to quit .
I was trained at Starbucks during my first week of college .
Their manual had an equal amount of regulated jargon cooked up by corporate thinktankers who I would eventually imagine sitting around all day eating party - size subs , discussing more ways to control their employees while iceberg lettuce fell out of their mouths .
The manual occasionally referenced another — unseen — training manual called “ The Green Apron Book , ” which gave fairly generic quotes about the harmony of good customer service .
I felt like I was entering into some Shaolin school and “ The Green Apron Book ” was the secret style of kung - fu you learned after proving you could slice watermelons with your hands .
At first , working at Starbucks was cool .
My manager was a mellow guy named Ed who played Paul Simon tracks all day and was n’t on the fast track to worshipping “ The Green Apron Book . ”
I preferred mixing steamed milk with peppermint syrup to combining the rancid chemicals that go into photo developing , and it was nice to work with people my age , to get the occasional free scone , and to knock back espresso shots to get through early shifts .
I also did n’t mind being able to give customers what they wanted , instead of always feeling forced to sell them something they did n’t want .
But Ed got a job managing at Dunn Brothers , and a new manager was sent in .
I wo n’t say her name , but she was bubbly and sweet — so bubbly and sweet that there was a hint of cultishness about her , like she had spent her teenage years hanging out with her church ’s youth group and had been oblivious to the fact that most kids were experimenting with pot and skanky shades of eye shadow .
She followed “ The Green Apron Book ” and other corporate mandates with the same ferocity with which I imagined she interpreted the Gospel .
Turns out the manual presented employees with an exact formula for greeting customers .
It was something like , “ Hello !
How are you today ? ”
At that point , the kids in the line of about 25 college students would give us a blank stare , or shout their drink order back at us .
If they answered with how they were , we had to ask them what they wanted , and instead of writing it down ourselves , we had to shout the order back to the ultra - busy baristas , who scrambled to use a broken charcoal pencil to write it on a cup .
The process was slow and clunky , and the wrong greeter took customers off guard and made them feel awkward .
That kind of reliably consistent service is more the territory of McDonald ’s and its fast food competitors than of cafés .
Years ago , cafés were stereotyped as off - kilter havens that attracted unique thinkers and artsy types .
Most of Hemingway ’s stories involve sipping whisky at café tables ; Van Gogh probably came up with ideas while sitting at a café , drinking too much absinthe .
On my college campus , the hippest cafés are rife with rude service , murky coffee , and graffiti - filled walls .
Do n’t get me wrong — the fact that the owner of our local Espresso 22 tells me that I endorse slavery every time I attempt to use a credit card for a purchase under $ 5 has made me head to the neighboring Starbucks a few times .
But for every lazy consumer like me , there are probably five devoted indie / environmentalist / vegetarian kids who swear their loyalty Espresso 22 and its thrown - together mix of garage sale chairs and authentic Italian - style drinks .
The expected closings of almost 1000 Starbucks outlets got me thinking about what a café actually is .
It ’s not a restaurant , and it ’s not a coffee house or a bar .
In France , Italy and the Netherlands , cafés sell alcohol .
In most other places , they do n’t , although historically they have .
Starbucks markets itself as a “ third place ; ” not home or work , but somewhere to escape from both .
Not a bad concept , so what ’s going wrong ?
In my opinion , Starbucks made three mistakes that are fairly simple to point out :
1 ) Starbucks ’ main competitors ( other than Caribou ) are local cafés .
Local cafés tend to gain a reputation by appealing to trendsetters ( the “ unique thinkers ” I mentioned above ) .
One of the most popular cafés by my house is called “ Hard Times Café ” and it is full of kids reading used copies of Sartre books and pretending not to be annoyed by overly loud music picked by baristas who hang out at record stores .
Starbucks realizes that this type of place is its competitor , and tries to create its own reflection of “ trendsetting culture , ” or , if I can say this word again , “ hipness . ”
Note their introduction of a small compact disc rack that usually sells compilations of music that vaguely and stereotypically represent foreign cultures .
The problem is that once something becomes corporate territory and mass - produced , it no longer qualifies as “ hip . ”
2 ) Bart Simpson once went to the mall ( I believe to get his ear pierced ) , and he found that he had to act quickly because every store was rapidly being turned into a Starbucks .
The Starbucks I worked at was in our student center , but if a person walked outside of the building and one block down the road , they ’d find another .
It ’s not hard to figure out that a saturation point has been reached .
3 ) Starbucks accidentally became a symbol of the somewhat nauseating degree of economic prosperity that America has enjoyed .
When I was an economically struggling college freshman , I was constantly aghast at the amount of people who returned every morning to buy lattes that cost more than $ 4 .
That kind of spending was n’t particularly notable until McDonald ’s introduced their McCafé , which created a foil for the ridiculously expensive price of coffee by serving quality products at a “ layman ’s ” price .
The fact that they stole customers proved that people were willing to give up the “ third place ” concept to save an extra dollar or so .
You know the U.S. is entering a recession when we do n’t have an extra buck a day for a “ third place . ”
So Starbucks has suddenly become a glaringly unhip enterprise that only affluent Americans can afford .
Sandy Banks from
The Los Angeles Times pointed out that most of the Starbucks that are closing are in poor neighborhoods and argues that , “ The losers are those loyal customers who considered it a privilege to join the cultural mainstream , sipping overpriced Frappuccinos , ” and that a Starbucks in a poor neighborhood represents “ a public stamp of approval ” and a “ symbol of hope . ”
Without too much making fun of Ms. Banks ( who also pointed out that she lives in a five - Starbucks neighborhood ) , let ’s just say the gentrification will have to wait for those communities .
If Starbucks intends to reverse its downward trend , the company should take note of Ms. Banks ’ statements , and move away from that type of thinking .
Café culture is n’t about inviting people to join the “ cultural mainstream . ”
That ’s fast food territory .
Instead they should take note of the success of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer .
Pabst has been a big failure since the 1980s , closing down factories and receiving bad reviews regarding its flavor .
But its distastefulness made it ripe to be adopted by a counter - culture located in Oregon , and for its underground popularity to spread .
But Pabst never marketed its newfound “ hipness ; ” instead it did n’t bother advertising much at all , and left itself culturally - ignored enough to remain a cult - phenomenon .
Not that Starbucks should quit advertising and shut down , but they could at least start by letting employees wear whatever shoes they want .
Loosen the corporate strings , and instead of blindly following what might be “ hip , ” think retro .
Think Hemingway and his whisky .
Starbucks appropriated Italy ’s style of serving espresso , so why not revolutionize some other tradition of drinking ?
Give those PBR kids some old fashioned absinthe , serve sake hot with a wet towel , and if they ’re very ambitious , look to the Netherlands for guidance .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama has a 47 % to 42 % advantage over John McCain among registered voters in the latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking three - day rolling average for Aug. 8 - 10 .
The pattern of Americans ' support for the two presumptive presidential nominees has shown little substantive change so far in August .
There have been eight Gallup Poll Daily tracking reports based on interviewing conducted entirely in the month of August , and in each of these Obama has received either 46 % or 47 % of the support of registered voters .
McCain has received between 42 % and 44 % support .
These estimates of support for the two candidates show no significant change , a finding that is not surprising given the attention being given to the Olympics by voters , the fact that Obama is on vacation , and the general lack of major news generating events from the presidential campaign front .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
The dramatic news of the sudden war which erupted in the Republic of Georgia has certainly been prominently displayed in newspapers , on television , and on Internet news sites , but the probability that these events will significantly change the U.S. presidential race is most likely low .
-- Frank Newport
Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from Aug. 8 - 10 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,648 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

It seems that I got too carried away writing about DHH keynote and forgot to mention other session I ’ve been to that day .
The first one was Hacking the Mid-End : Unobtrusive Scripting and Advanced UI Techniques in Rails , then Rails Software Metrics and Modeling Denormalization – The Speed You Need , the Order You Crave .
I ’m going to cover each one below .
Hacking the Mid-End
In Hacking the Mid-End : Unobtrusive Scripting and Advanced UI Techniques in Rails Michael Bleigh argued that there is a growing area between back - end ( which is Model & Controller layers in MVC ) and front - end ( which is View ) that he calls Mid-End .
In most Web 2.0 applications , the architecture is really something like MVC+I , where I is for Interaction .
This area contains all the non-trivial code in the presentation layer that usually can’t be done by HTML / CSS designers .
This includes various AJAX calls , progress bars , fancy file uploaders , drag ’n ’drop support and so on .
Michael said that Mid-End developer facilitates cooperation between front - end and back - end , providing helpers and tools for the front - end designer and building on a structures provided by back - end developers .
Mid-end developers goals are to make the application Fast , Accessible , Intuitive , and Responsive .
Then he showed two examples of what he understands by that .
The first was about making some slow action more responsive .
In the original version after clicking the link the user had to wait about 10 seconds before the resulting page loaded .
Michael ’s recipe was to make the link take the user to another page that displayed a warning that you might have to wait a little bit for the results .
The page loaded the results in background using AJAX call and then displayed them .
For the sake of accessibility , if JavaScript was unavailable , the page presented a link to ‘ Continue ’ .
The second example was about making simple dynamic tabs .
When user has JS enabled only one of the tabs is visible and clicking a tab header switches the visible part .
With no JS all the information is displayed as a list of sections with headlines and clicking a tab header jumps to the appropriate section .
Be sure to check out Michael ’s presentation if you ’re interested in mid-end and UJS ( Unobtrusive JavaScript ) .
Rails Software Metrics
Next session was Rails Software Metrics , presented by Roderick von Domburg .
Roderick started with saying that he talks only about tools , not some prescribed best practices .
The first tool he covered was , quite surprisingly , rake stats .
The results provided by this tool are not very interesting as such , but the key here is that you should graph them over time to make them much more useful .
Roderick showed graphs of lines of code , test - to - code ratio , average methods and lines per class or average lines per methods , all provided by rake stats .
Combining the graphs of these metrics may tell you many useful things about your code ( you are testing too little or too much , your methods are too long ) without installing any other tools .
The next tool covered was flog , which measures code complexity .
Flog works in a “ decidedly unscientific ” way , assigning arbitrarily chosen values to various constructs ( 6 points per eval , 1.2 point per if ) and reporting totals and averages for your classes and methods .
And again , while results of running flog once are useful ( you can see whether there are methods that require immediate refactoring ) , it becomes really cool when graphed over time .
You can observe negative tendencies and take countermeasures when appropriate .
Rcov was next but since we use it in all our projects , there was nothing new for me .
I ’m always surprised when people say ( like Roderick did ) that it ’s really hard to get 100 % code coverage ( I sometimes suspect they did n’t really try it , they just think it ’s too hard ) and you really should n’t try too hard because it ’s not worth it and 100 % code coverage does n’t prove anything anyway .
They say that with 100 % code coverage you test many trivial pieces of code that are not worth it anyway while many other non-trivial pieces are covered only accidentally .
This is mostly true except for the “ it ’s too hard ” part .
My team uses TDD methodology and we have no problems with achieving 100 % code coverage .
We do n’t find it too hard or too wasteful either .
Oh , and by the way , it ’s much easier to keep coverage at 100 % if you have 100 % from the start .
Roderick then covered briefly heckle , which mutates your code and checks if tests fail .
Heckle is still in experimental phase and it ’s not something you would want to run on every build but it ’s fun to play with , nonetheless .
The next tool was saikuro , which is a cyclomatic complexity analyzer .
It ’s similar to flog but has a more scientific approach .
It also generates nice HTML reports similar to rcov’s , so you can inspect any code that generates warnings .
The last tool covered was metric_fu , a plugin ( or set of rake tasks to be precise ) for CruiseControl.rb that runs all or selected metrics on your projects .
I ’m definitely going to have a look at it .
Modeling Denormalization
In Modeling Denormalization – The Speed You Need , the Order You Crave Duncan Beevers from Kongregate talked about how to use denormalization techniques to make your data retrievable faster .
Denormalization means duplicating data from one model to another and storing the results of each calculation in the database once you calculate it .
This technique is present in Rails in form of counter caches .
If your application is write - heavy , you should not go overboard with adding index .
Each index slows down writes .
Another advice was that real tables with calculated data are better than triggers and views .
The problem with triggers is that one update can fire several triggers and you do n’t have control about it .
It becomes a real issue when you have 20,000 users updating their statistics each second ( if I remember the number Duncan gave right ) .
In this case batch processing is much better .
Duncan ’s presentation had a little unexpected ending because he fainted after showing the last slide .
Some people from the first rows helped him up and gave him a glass of water and he was OK in a minute .
That accident awarded him much more cheerful reception from the audience .
I do n’t know if this is of any interest to you , but most of this article was written while traveling back from Berlin to Wrocław after the conference .
Ah , the joys of modern technology .
Collect Water in a Solar Still
Desert Survival
Text and Photos By Gregory T. Jones
There was the man in tattered clothing , his body sweaty , his swollen eyes squinting over miles of sand .
Cattle skulls and scorpions scattered the ground while vultures circled overhead awaiting their imminent feast .
In a futile last glance , he held himself up with shaking arms .
Then his head cocked to the side like a confused dog -- could it really be ?
Buried in the waves of heat rising from the sand , a small grove of palm trees rose far in the distance .
Struggling to balance himself , he broke into a clumsy run .
A gaping smile emerged from his cracked lips .
Then , just before a commercial break for the latest soft drink , the leathery victim either did the backstroke in a spring - fed pool of water or collapsed in the wake of a mirage .
As a transplant from the Midwest to the Sonoran Desert of Arizona , I grew up with Hollywood 's distorted images of the desert Southwest .
However , the reality of not having water in the true desert can be equally or dangerously more life - threatening .
The chance of falling upon a desert oasis or spring is extremely unlikely , and the possibility of finding a contaminated water source , such as mineral springs poisoned with arsenic , only decreases the chance for survival .
Even apparently healthy water sources can contain infectious organisms like giardia , causing humans to become ill and lose more bodily fluids .
In 100 + degree desert temperatures , a person can hope to survive only three days without water .
During this time , the person can expect the quality of their days to steadily decline .
Dehydration strikes quickly and overwhelms the mind with irrationality .
Physically , depletion of the body 's fluids causes the volume of blood to decrease .
Blood vessels then constrict because there is not enough blood to keep them expanded .
Nausea , headaches , muscle cramps and dizziness quickly follow .
Emergency Survival Tool
Fortunately , there is an emergency survival technique for gathering water from our driest deserts during their most brutal seasons .
It is commonly known as the solar still .
One of the most significant survival tools created in the last 40 years , the solar still was developed by two physicians working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Results of extensive testing in the Arizona deserts by the U.S. Air Force proved that when properly assembled , the still can save your life .
The solar still functions under the general principle of the " greenhouse effect " .
Solar energy heats the ground by passing through a clear plastic barrier .
Moisture from the soil then evaporates , rises and condenses on the underside of the plastic barrier above .
The still also has the ability to purify tainted water .
In fact , it condenses pure water from just about anything .
Even urine will produce clean , drinkable water .
( CAUTION : One fluid never to be used is radiator fluid , as its toxins will vaporize and poison the water . )
Materials
There are only 2 essential components to constructing the solar still -- a container to catch the water and a 6 x 6 - footsheet of clear plastic .
A shovel or trowel , a length of plastic tube and tape are all optional .
The container can be a collapsible cup , an empty plastic bottle , a small cooking pot or just about anything with a large enough opening to catch falling drops of water .
In a pinch , even tin foil or a sandwich bag can be fashioned into a workable receptacle .
The sheet of clear plastic can be a ground cloth used under tents when backpacking or a thin painting drop cloth .
Both work well as long as there are no tears or holes .
This is the one item that should be carried at all times , since there is no natural substitute out in the boonies .
I keep a 6 x 12 - foot plastic drop cloth taped inside my daypack , large enough to make two stills if necessary .
Some desert rats like to keep their plastic sheets folded inside a hip sack or as part of their first - aid kits .
A 6 - foot length of flexible plastic tubing , similar to the kind used in fish tanks is a non-essential but desirable addition to the still components .
This will allow you to drink accumulated water without needing to break down the solar still , inevitably affecting its efficiency .
Construction
The best part of this life - saving device is that for something that collects water from seemingly nothing , the solar still is amazingly simple to build .
Here 's how :
Dig a pit approximately 4 feet wide and 3 feet deep .
Use a shovel , hand trowel , a digging stick or even your hands in soft soil or sand .
Look for a sandy wash or a depression where rainwater might collect .
In the center of the pit , dig another small hole deep enough for the water container .
Place the container inside , then run the tubing from the container to the outside of the pit .
If there is tape available , tape the tubing to the inside of the container .
Blanket the pit with the plastic sheet , evenly on all sides , but not touching the bottom of the pit .
Anchor the corners with rocks .
Find a small rounded rock to place in the center of the sheet , over the water container .
This will keep the plastic centered and control any flapping from the wind .
Gently push down on the center weight until the sides slope to a 45 º angle .
If the pit is dug deep enough , this should leave the center weight just a few inches above the water container .
Next , secure the edges of the plastic sheet with rocks and dirt .
Make sure there are no places where moisture can escape .
Close the tubing end with a knot , or double it and tie it closed .
Within two hours , the air inside the still will become saturated with moisture and begin to condense onto the underside of the plastic sheeting .
Because of the angle of the plastic , water will run down towards the center .
Finally , drops will gather and fall from the apex down into the water container .
As the container fills , simply sip fresh , sterile water from the plastic tubing .
In especially dry conditions , water output can be increased by placing succulent plant material inside the still .
The solar still only takes about an hour to build .
If constructed correctly , it can yield about a quart of water a day .
And although the palm trees may be noticeably absent , you will have made your very own oasis in the desert , quicker than Hollywood could .
CAUTION : Solar stills are not a primary water source , nor a substitute for carrying adequate amounts of water in the desert .
Always carry a minimum of one gallon per day per person .

ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( CNN ) -- Republican presidential candidate John McCain criticized two of his future running mate 's hometown projects in broadsides in 2001 against congressional " pork - barrel " spending , records from the Arizona senator 's office show .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin campaigns in Lee 's Summit , Missouri , with Sen. John McCain Monday .
McCain and running mate Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin have criticized such spending as a central part of their campaign for the White House .
McCain has made pork - busting a centerpiece of his maverick pitch for years .
But when Palin served as mayor of her hometown of Wasilla , outside Anchorage , she obtained about $ 27 million in federal " earmarks " during her last four years in office , according to the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense .
In a 2001 statement opposing a transportation spending bill McCain singled out for criticism about $ 3 million worth of those projects .
McCain 's list of " objectionable " spending included a $ 2.5 million road project for the town that then had a population of 5,500 , as well as a $ 450,000 appropriation for an agricultural processing plant there .
McCain 's campaign responded Wednesday by saying the record on pork - barrel spending " is one we are eager to discuss . "
Watch McCain rail against earmarks »
" As mayor of Wasilla , Gov. Palin was forced to work within the current system to obtain critical funding for a growing city , " the campaign said in a statement .
By comparison , it said , Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama " has consciously attempted to manipulate the system by requesting nearly $ 1 million every working day he has been in the Senate . "
Palin already has been facing questions about her stump - speech claim to have said " ' Thanks , but no thanks ' for that bridge to nowhere up in Alaska . "
Palin originally supported construction of the infamous bridge from Ketchikan to its airport on sparsely populated Gravina Island , but canceled work on the span in 2007 after the price tag increased from about $ 200 million to nearly $ 400 million and it became a symbol of congressional excess .
The governor has n't faced reporters since August 29 , when McCain tapped her as his running mate .
But her lieutenant governor , Sean Parnell , said Palin has reversed her support for earmarked spending projects because " I think she saw what they were . "
" As you 're in office longer , you see the cumulative effect from Wasilla to Pensacola , and you see the corruption that can come from those , " Parnell said , referring to earmarks .
Parnell is now locked in a still - unresolved GOP primary with " Bridge to Nowhere " advocate Don Young , the state 's sole congressman for more than 30 years .
Palin backed his challenge to Young in the Republican contest .
But longtime Alaska journalist and former Palin staffer Larry Persily said the governor " is telling only half the story , as far as the earmarks . "
" She was hungry for funding from the federal government that could help her community , " Persily said .
Palin not only sought money from Alaska 's congressional delegation , but she hired the former chief of staff to veteran Alaska Sen .
Ted Stevens -- now under indictment in a wide - ranging corruption probe -- for help .
The result was that Wasilla won $ 600,000 for a new bus facility , $ 1.75 million to upgrade its dispatch center and $ 2.4 million to improve water and sewer facilities .
" We did well , " Palin scrawled in the margins of a City Council memo on federal funds from 1999 .
Since becoming governor , she has cut the amount of money her vast , oil - rich state asks for from the federal government .
But for the 2008 budget year , Alaska had more earmark requests per capita than any other state -- $ 500 for every resident .
Palin sought about $ 450 million in earmarks during her first two years in state office , according to federal records .
They include nearly $ 8 million to improve a remote airport in the Aleutian Islands , a former Navy airfield that handles eight scheduled flights a month ; $ 4 million to research sea crab stocks ; and $ 2 million to research rockfish .

A settler attack on a West Bank village in September left a trail of damage Hundreds of settlers are engaged in violence against Palestinians and Israeli soldiers , the senior Israeli commander in the West Bank has said .
Majr - Gen Gadi Shamni said diverting military resources to deal with settlers impaired the army 's ability to carry out operations against militants .
A recent UN report recorded 222 acts of settler violence in the first half of 2008 compared with 291 in all of 2007 .
Palestinians have long complained of settler harassment and intimidation .
They have also complained the Israeli military does little to stop or restrain the settlers .
' Significant change '
" In the past , only a few dozen individuals took part in such activity but today that number has grown into the hundreds .
That 's a very significant change , " Maj - Gen Shamni told the Israeli Haaretz newspaper .
The margins [ in the settler community ] are expanding , because they are enjoying a tailwind and the backing of part of the leadership , both rabbinical and public , whether in explicit statements or tacitly
Majr - Gen Gadi Shamni
West Bank violence breeds hatred " These hundreds are engaged in conspiratorial actions against Palestinians and the security forces .
It 's a very grave phenomenon . "
" This is harming our ability to carry out security missions in the territories .
We have to divert our efforts to there from other issues .
" The margins [ in the settler community ] are expanding , because they are enjoying a tailwind and the backing of part of the leadership , both rabbinical and public , whether in explicit statements or tacitly . "
The general said that in some cases Israeli soldiers who had intervened to stop settlers from attacking Palestinians had themselves been attacked by settlers .
" The majority [ of settlers ] here act normally .
We 're talking about a hard core of a few hundred activists , " Maj - Gen Shamni said .
' Wind of extremism ' Israeli political leaders have made comments along similar lines recently .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has spoken of an " evil wind of extremism " threatening Israel 's democracy .
This was in reaction to a pipe bomb attack on a leading Israeli academic and critic of the occupation of Palestinian land by presumed hard - line right - wingers .
Mr Olmert has also described a mass attack by settlers on the West Bank village of Asira al - Qabiliya as a " pogrom " .
Settlers have said the attack was in response to the wounding of a nine - year - old boy by a Palestinian who had been trying to set fire to an empty house in the near - by Yitzhar settlement .
Defence Minister Ehud Barak has urged tougher penalties for settlers who attack Palestinian property .
About 500,000 Jewish settlers live in the West Bank , including East Jerusalem , among a population of about 2.5 million Palestinians .
All settlements are consider illegal under international law , though Israel disputes this .

“ Election officials are unanimous in their commitment to ensuring every eligible American ’s right to vote , but in many places the system they oversee simply is n’t designed to handle anywhere near the number of voters that may turn out , ” said Doug Chapin , director of electionline.org , a project of the Pew Center on the States .
“ In previous elections , the question has been , ‘ Will the system work for each voter ? ’
But this year the real question is whether the system can handle the load of all these voters . ”
Poll worker training and ballot design will be more important than ever this year .
The election commission has predicted that at least two million poll workers will be needed in November , double the number in the 2004 presidential election .
In New Jersey , election officials placed advertisements in newspapers asking people to sign up to work the polls .
In California , election officials posted pleas on the Internet .
But many states face budget problems that make it hard to recruit poll workers .
New York City election officials have said they lack the money to pay the estimated 8,000 additional poll workers needed in November .
Several states have resorted to recruiting high school students .
Ms. Rodriguez said that the high level of turnover in the people who run state and local elections was also a concern .
More than two - thirds of the election directors in the nation ’s 50 largest counties were new to the office in 2004 , and the number may be even higher now , according to Election Data Services , a Washington consulting firm that tracks voting trends .
Many voters heading to the polls in November will receive a paper ballot for the first time .
The ballots are counted by optical scanners and provide a more reliable paper trail than touch - screen machines in case of a dispute or a malfunction .
A third of voters will use touch - screen machines , down from 38 percent in 2006 , while about 55 percent of voters will use paper ballots read by optical - scan machines , up from 49 percent of voters in 2006 , said Kimball W. Brace , president of Election Data Services .
The main issue with the paper ballots will be their unfamiliarity to voters , not the technology itself .
Ideally , in fact , paper ballots could reduce lines at polling places , because election officials would not have to set up a limited number of expensive touch - screen machines in each booth .
Paper ballots require only a writing surface , and far fewer optical - scan machines are needed to count them .

The Bush administration is trying to push through a wave of new regulations despite a promise by the White House to ban last - ditch rule - making in the waning days of the presidency , say watchdog groups and experts .
Every administration tries to pass last minute rules in hopes of leaving a lasting mark .
But experts say the Bush administration is expected to approve a greater number more quickly than previous administrations – something they said could lead to bad and costly policy .
" The administration wants to leave a legacy , " said Gary Bass , executive director of OMB Watch , which has been critical of these proposals .
" But across the board it means less protection for the public . "
The proposed regulations are of particular concern to watchdog groups who say they could hurt public safety , the environment and consumers .
Among the newest proposed regulations , according to OMB Watch :
Permit health care professionals at federally funded institutions to opt out of providing abortion and sterilization if such processes create " a problem of conscience for the provider . "
Women 's groups have attacked this proposals as a way to limit access to abortions .
Require drug testing for miners .
Critics have questioned why this would be a priority given the high safety concerns associated with mining facilities .
Change how occupational safety agencies calculate job - risk for miners , despite opposition from health and safety groups , which said it would " undermine " health rules .
Allow Interior Department officials to approve development projects without full consulting federal wildlife and habitat scientists on the impact on endangered species .
Ease rules for police on allowing them to launch criminal intelligence investigation if the target is suspected of links to terrorism .
Proponents say it brings policy in line with current process but critics say it infringes on first amendment rights .
" It 's safe to say that these regulations are designed to serve regulated industry and the conservative agenda , " said Bass .
Another key concern with the last - minute up tick in rule making is that agencies have less time to reviewing regulations .
( One study found that the volume of regulations in an outgoing administration 's final quarter - year were 17 percent higher than the number in non-elections years . )
" The real problem is that you have this massive inflow of regulations and yet the checks and balances and the people who do the checks are still the same , " said Veronique de Rugy , a research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and has studied so - called midnight regulations in past administrations .
" Hence all the regulations that are coming through are not given proper oversight . "
Already , some proposed regulations have seen the public comment period drop from the traditional 60 days to just over 30 days .
A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget noted in an email response that publicly available statistics show that the average review period has not gone down and said public comment periods were determined by each agency .
It was n't supposed to be this way .
In May , Josh Bolten , then - head of the Office of Management and Budget , which oversees regulatory approval , issued a memo barring new proposals after June .
It also required that all new regulations be completed by Nov. 1 .
That has n't been the case .
Many proposed regulations have yet to be finalized and new ones have already come out since the June deadline .
A spokesperson for OMB said in an email response that the Bolten memo " was n't intended to wholesale shut down work on important regulatory matters after November 1st , but to emphasize due diligence . "
She added : " Ensuring the integrity of the process is important to the Administration . "
If the regulations go through , there may be little anyone can do to change them in the short term , experts say .
A new administration could get Congress to overturn , but that has rarely succeeded and can be vetoed by the president .
A new administration could also restart a new regulatory process to change back the rules , but that is a lengthy process .
Or it could ask the court to stop regulations , but historically they have limited jurisdiction to intervene .
Either way , says de Rugy , " whether you think regulations are good or bad , one of the things we should all agree upon is that the process they have to go through is open and that it is rigorous and protects tax payers from bad regulations . "
But , she adds , the current process " is everything but transparent . "

Seven Years after 9/11 How Dangerous Is Al - Qaida ?

This is a slam - dunk in a way .
Fox is touting and Drudge is hyping a new poll showing a dramatic tightening in the presidential race .
Here 's their report today :
As the candidates make their closing arguments before the election , the race has tightened with Barack Obama now leading John McCain by 47 percent to 44 percent among likely voters , according to a FOX News poll released Thursday .
Last week Obama led by 49 - 40 percent among likely voters .
Seems pretty convincing , right ?
I mean : they use the same pollster .
But when you look at the internals , you find the following demographics .
Last week 's poll had a sample with the following mix :
Democrats 401 , ±5 percentage points ; Republicans 345 , ±5 ; independents 148 , ±8 Obama supporters 462 , ±5 ; McCain supporters 370 , ±5
This week's :
Democrat LV 379 , ±5 ; Republican LV 364 , ±5 ; independent LV 146 , ±8 , Obama supporters LV 439 , ±5 ; McCain supporters LV 405 , ±5

Google Inc. on Tuesday showed off a cellphone that could provide the first real challenge to Apple Inc. 's iPhone : a mass - market device with a sharp touch screen and slide - out keyboard that brings the experience of mobile Web surfing closer to that of a personal computer .
When it starts selling in U.S. stores Oct. 22 , the $ 179 G1 from HTC Corp. will be the first of many expected gadgets , from a wide variety of manufacturers , that run Google ’s new Android mobile operating system and have many of the Internet giant ’s services built in .
The G1 , which works on the T - Mobile USA network , marks another salvo in the intensifying cellphone wars as tech titans try to upend the wireless market and seize a major business opportunity .
The likes of Google , Apple and Microsoft Corp. are betting they can make billions by selling software and delivering ads for the new generation of increasingly powerful mobile devices .

“ The cellphone is the world ’s most popular device , and it is going to be the world ’s most popular way to access the Web , ” said Ross Rubin , an analyst at NPD Group .
For the tech giants , staking a claim on the mobile Web is vital .
Cellphones outnumber personal computers roughly 3 to 1 .
When it comes to connecting people to the Web , phones are still far behind computers .
But the iPhone , BlackBerry and other so - called smart phones are changing that .
Research firm IDC predicts that by 2012 , more mobile devices than computers will be used in surfing the Web .
These gadgets could be lucrative vehicles for advertising , particularly ads that alert phone users to shops and services near their precise locations .

Google executives predict the company will eventually make more money on the mobile Web than on the traditional Web .
Investment bank Collins Stewart says it expects the search giant to add $ 5 billion in revenue from cellphone ads by 2011 .
The G1 connects to Wi -Fi hot spots , features a keyboard and trackball and even has a compass , so when a user looking at Google Maps turns , the image does too .
But analysts say HTC and T - Mobile lack the marketing firepower to conquer the smart - phone market .
The BlackBerry , made by Research in Motion Ltd. and supported by all the major wireless carriers , dominates the corporate side of the market , while Apple ’s iPhone , which runs on the No. 1 AT&T ; network , is a consumer hit .
But Google , based in Mountain View , Calif. , hopes this is just the beginning .
Manufacturers such as Samsung and Motorola Inc. are also working on phones that run the Android operating system , for carriers including T - Mobile and Sprint Nextel Corp .
Sprint and China Mobile were supposed to launch Android phones in coming months but hit snags .

“ We set out to build Android so that we could enable a lot more people to access the Internet , ” said Andy Rubin , Google ’s senior director of mobile platforms .
“ We want to make the entire Web experience as good as possible on the small screen . ”
T- Mobile , the No. 4 U.S. carrier , raced to become the first provider to release a Google - powered phone to help it better compete against AT&T ; , Verizon Wireless and Sprint .
“ We tried to build a mass - market device that is affordable to consumers , ” said Cole Brodman , T - Mobile ’s chief technology and innovation officer .
“ We think it has got universal appeal . ”
If Brodman is right , “ Android could be a threat to all , ” said Needham & Co. analyst Charlie Wolf .

It was Apple , not Google , that incited the big revolution on the tiny screen when it launched the iPhone in June 2007 .
In addition to making calls , the iPhone lets consumers send and receive e-mail and instant messages , play music and videos and surf the Web .
Brent Bushnell , who works for a Los Angeles - based software company , recently landed in Boston and jumped on a train without thinking .
He pulled up a map on his iPhone to figure out where he was headed and find his hotel .
“ I bootstrapped my way without missing a beat , ” he said .
Apple started another iPhone bonanza in July when it opened an online store for downloadable programs .
Since then , the Cupertino , Calif. , company has sold or given away more than 100 million games , music programs and other applications for the iPhone through its App Store .

“ Consumers have benefited tremendously from the iPhone ’s introduction , ” said Ford Cavallari , a partner with Monitor Group , a consulting firm .
“ In making this effort , Google is going to make it an even better marketplace . ”
A key part of Google ’s strategy , like Apple ’s , is to spur innovation by giving software developers a shot at making applications .
In the past , wireless carriers set the rules and negotiated fees for software developers to gain that kind of access , but competition has forced carriers to open up .
Developer Steve Demeter has made $ 250,000 selling Trism , the iPhone game he created , so he quit his job programming ATMs for Wells Fargo Bank .
Advertisement
But he does n’t plan to make the game for Android - powered phones , preferring what he called Apple ’s “ stringent quality control ” over Google ’s more open system .
But Don Park , an independent developer in Portland , Ore. , said he would focus on Android phones for his location - tracking software because he likes that openness .
“ Phones were n’t interesting a few years ago , ” he said .
“ Now cellphones have become the new personal computer . ”

Here is the Cliff Notes version of the economic disaster .
1 . The banks and investment houses made up a bunch of products and sank their investors ' money into them .
2 . The banks and investment houses could n't convince you to buy those products .
3 . The banks and investment houses got the government to FORCE you to buy those products .
Any questions ?
So , all those bad assets are being moved off of their books and onto a gigantic cash sink run by the US Government and paid for by YOU .
Estimates of the total bailout just for this latest plan are a trillion dollars .
The prior bailouts of Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , AIG , etc. are another half trillion .
You know the saying , a trillion here and a trillion there and soon you are talking some real money !
Basically , Wall Street got into the same liquidity crisis as ordinary Americans .
Ordinary Americans got a check for $ 600 .
Wall Street gets trillions .
Go figure .
So , what will those banks and financial institutions do with the money magically reappearing in their accounts ?
Well , they probably will go back to doing what they have been doing all along .
They have no reason to rethink their policies and practices since they do n't have to pay the price for their failures .
Indeed , the bailouts are a disincentive to learn and evolve .
So , it 's back to endless credit card offers and high - risk loans and over - leveraging , and in the middle of this New York casino the women and booze will continue to flow in copious amounts , obscuring a simple truth .
As McCain admitted the other day , the entire US economy rests on the ability of US workers to earn a good living and pay all the bills ( and taxes ) .
And those same corporations whose stock is in play have been sending those high paying manufacturing jobs to other countries , aided by generous tax incentives by the US Government that now proposes to shackle you to the losses incurred by those corporations .
The US economy is a pyramid scheme , and Bush 's plan just spread the pyramid out along a wider foundation , but that foundation is already full of cracks .
If there are no jobs , then there is nothing to tax to pay the bills .
In the absence of real manufacturers to invest in , Wall Street will loan that trillion dollars out to any fly - by - night operator who promises a quick return .
The fact is that this added infusion of cash is going to put tremendous inflationary pressure on the dollar .
It 's not like the money that Wall Street lost vanished .
It 's still out there , just not where Wall Street wanted it to be .
Adding trillions more in liquidity makes all those dollars actually worth less .
Prices will go up .
Already commodities have started up on expectations of too much cash chasing too few goods and services .
This in turn will accelerate the trade imbalance , motivating foreign nations to start getting out of dollar reserves .
Foreign investors may start pulling out of the US markets rather than see their investments increase in dollar value but decrease in real worth .
That trillion ( actually trillions ) has to come from someplace .
Maybe government will cut spending , so goodbye to jobs , which cuts the tax base , and reduces retail purchasing .
Maybe more homes will foreclose .
Or the government will keep spending where it is and just raise taxes .
So , families have to cut back , buy fewer clothes , maybe skip needed medical care ; certainly they wo n't be buying any new flat - panel TV sets any time soon .
So , retail stores start to close , more people out of work , the tax base shrinks , more companies go out of business .
So no matter how you slice and dice it , this bailout does n't solve any problems .
It does n't bring NEW money into the system , it just shifts the debt around to make things look good for the election , but it does NOT really solve the underlying problems .
The fact of the matter is that Bush 's plan is at best a patch , to make it look like the government is doing something positive between now and the elections .
But it does n't really change anything .
The jobs are not coming back .
Homes are still in foreclosure .
We are mired in two pointless wars while Bush pushes for a new one in the hopes that red blood will obscure the red ink .
Meanwhile , the price tag you will pay for helping Bush pay for it all will run into the thousands for each and every one of you .
And all that will be accomplished is to put the final disaster off onto someone else 's administration .

Dorothy Parker ( August 22 , 1893 – June 7 , 1967 ) was an American writer and poet , best known for her caustic wit , wisecracks , and sharp eye for 20th century urban foibles .
From a conflicted and unhappy childhood , Parker rose to acclaim , both for her literary output in such venues as The New Yorker and as a founding member of the Algonquin Round Table .
Her letters , short stories , and articles are all brilliantly witty and I strongly recommend her work !
Quotes 1 – 5
1 . I do n’t care what is written about me so long as it is n’t true .
2 . Wit has truth in it ; wisecracking is simply calisthenics with words .
3 . You ca n’t teach an old dogma new tricks .
4 . I ’m never going to accomplish anything ; that ’s perfectly clear to me .
I ’m never going to be famous .
My name will never be writ large on the roster of Those Who Do Things .
I do n’t do anything .
Not one single thing .
I used to bite my nails , but I do n’t even do that any more .
5 . I might repeat to myself slowly and soothingly , a list of quotations beautiful from minds profound — if I can remember any of the damn things .
Quotes 6 – 10
6 . Four be the things I ’d have been better without : Love , curiosity , freckles and doubt .
7 . I require only three things of a man .
He must be handsome , ruthless and stupid .
8 . Take care of luxuries and the necessities will take care of themselves .
9 . Money can not buy health , but I ’d settle for a diamond - studded wheelchair .
10 .
The two most beautiful words in the English language are ‘ cheque enclosed . ’
Quotes 11 – 15
11 . The cure for boredom is curiosity .
There is no cure for curiosity .
12 . It serves me right for keeping all my eggs in one bastard .
( Said when leaving hospital after an abortion ) .
13 .
All I need is room enough to lay a hat and a few friends .
14 .
I like to have a martini ,
Two at the very most .
After three I ’m under the table ,
after four I ’m under my host .
15 . Ducking for apples — change one letter and it ’s the story of my life .
Quotes 16 – 20
16 . I ’ve never been a millionaire but I just know I ’d be darling at it .
17 .
If you want to know what God thinks of money , just look at the people he gave it to .
18 . When asked to use the word horticulture during a game of Can - You - Give - Me-A - Sentence , Parker replied :
You can lead a horticulture , but you ca n’t make her think .
19 . Of Ayn Rand ’s Atlas Shrugged , Parker said : “ This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly .
It should be thrown with great force . ”
20 . I ’ve been too fucking busy – or vice versa .

Here is a biographical and personality insight one would only turn up through a more careful examination of political pictures .
Last week , the NYT published a widely - read story about the way Sarah Palin treated her friends and foes as the Wasilla mayor .
The photo leading the article , supplied by the Heath family , shows Palin flanked by the council in 1998 , two years into her mayoral tenure .
If you scroll down , however , the article offers a second photo , also supplied by the family , of Palin when she was still a Wasilla councilwoman .
( Although undated , she was a city council member from ' 92 - ' 96 . )
The photo is one of those easy - to - pass - by , standard sitting - at - your - desk shots in front of your name plate .
The picture , however , is also one of those published by The Times you are invited to click to enlarge .
Doing so , what you can suddenly make out quite clearly is what Palin chose to be photographed attending to , which is a newsletter with a photo of a guy in a suit , the page headlined with the title : " Con-Con Call . " A " con-con " call , if ( like me ) you 're not versed in government - speak , is a call for a constitutional convention , intended to either revise or completely rewrite the constitution of a state or the federal government .
The point is , and what the photo telegraphs is that , even at this early stage of her local career , Palin is revealing herself as an activist officeholder with not just ambitious , but much larger and radical notions .
Update : 8:55 pm PST --
Thanks to a BNN reader for identifying the article by Don Fotheringham ( " Saving the Constitution : unbeknownst to most people , ten years ago the United States nearly had its Constitution rewritten under the guise of bringing the federal government to heel " ) published in the September 19 , 2005 issue of American Opinion Magazine .
American Opinion was the official publication of the John Birch Society .
The article outlines the effort by the Birch Society to oppose constitutional conventions where , as Fotheringham writes , " demagogues , internationalists , and think - tank reformers could get their hands on it . "
Totheringham explains how this and previous articles on the subject had been published or copied and distributed widely by the Birch Society to state government officials across the country to expose :
... the groups bent on a federal convention , which was now being promoted under almost any wishful pretext , such as term limits , the right to life , school prayer , anti-flag burning , and lately , same - sex " marriage . "
In the article , Fotheringham identifies himself as the author of the article Palin is holding , published in March 1995 in The New American , also a John Birch publication and the bi-weekly replacement of American Opinion .
The magazine features Utah's Governor Leavitt on the cover , as Leavitt was spearheading a legislative attempt in Utah to approve an constitutional convention in favor of a federal balanced budget amendment .
( Fotheringham describes how 32 of the necessary 34 states had already signed on . )
With a sense of urgency , 100,000 reprints of the article were made and distributed even before the actual magazine was printed .
Fotheringham goes on to explain how the efforts of the Birch society were instrumental in successfully blocking the effort to convene a constitutional convention to approve a balanced budget amendment , or anything else .
In light of this additional information and research , it is important for me to state that possession of this article does n't , in itself , suggest Sarah Palin was an advocate for any particular agenda .
Certainly , her posing with it could just as simply mean she was one of the thousands of state elected officials who were in receipt of this reprint distributed by the John Birch Society .
On the other hand , David Neiwert over at FDL examines the photo from the standpoint of the Palins attendance at Alaskan Independence Party gatherings ; the couple 's befriending of AIP leadership ; and Todd 's membership in the organization .
Given the John Birch Society 's sympathy for militias and Todd 's overlapping notion of the government as " illegitimate , " Neiwert sees ample possibility the Palins had more than a casual interest in the Birch society and its political philosophy .
Jed Report raises similar questions .
Update 2 : 9/19 . 9:41 am PST : Of course , it does n't help the argument that the visual association here is a completely innocent one after Palin anonymously quoted the right wing reactionary Westbrook Pegler in her RNC acceptance speech .
Pegler was primarily known with his attacks on government power , and his specific hatred for Roosevelt who he characterized as a dictator .
Pegler himself was a writer for the JBS publication , American Opinion , before being kicked out of the society in 1964 for his anti-semitic views .
Update 3 : 9/19 / 1:28 pm PST : A commenter at Huffington raises an interesting point .
Although the John Birch Society went out of its way to distribute this article to state elected officials with voting authority in the case of a constitutional convention vote , it is much less likely Palin would have been on such a distribution list as a member of a local city council .
Update 4 : 10/4/08 : David Neiwert has been interviewing people in Wasilla about Palin 's past .
Her connection with the far - right fringe makes him even more convinced the publication did n't just cross her desk by accident .

Advertisement " I 'm not voting for Obama , he 's black . "
Charles is a registered Democrat in Uniontown , Pennsylvania .
" If it was n't for Obama I would vote Democrat .
Blacks just cause trouble , that 's the taste I 've got in my mouth . "
Race is the question mark hanging over this election .
Barack Obama is ahead in the polls .
There 's a widespread feeling now that the election is his to lose .
But there is something that is worrying Democrats .
How accurate are the polls ?
How many voters are saying they will vote for Mr Obama because they do not want to be perceived as racist ?
Once they enter the polling booth will it be an entirely different story ?
Simply put , how many people out there think like Charles but are not admitting it ?
' Not from here '
Charles said the vast majority of his friends felt the same way as him .
Uniontown is a rural town in south - west Pennsylvania .
Its countryside is breathtaking , particularly now as the leaves change their colour from green to gold to burnt red .
But the area is poor and unemployment is high .
Traditionally it is staunchly Democrat - but race is an election issue .
Obama will get as many votes from the blacks , as he will not get from the whites
Todd Hackley
At a local restaurant a friendly waitress started chatting to us .
The conversation turned to politics .
She shrugged , she was not even sure when the election was to be held , she could not pronounce Mr Obama 's name .
" I like McCain because I can say his name , so I 'll probably vote for McCain . "
She was not well informed , but her views were clear .
" He 's from Africa or something .
I do n't even know where he 's from .
I know he grew up here , but he 's not from here .
I think American presidents should be from America . "
These are not isolated opinions - just not often voiced publicly .
In the primaries 12 % of voters across the state said race was a factor - and that is close to Mr Obama 's current lead in the polls here .
Recently , Congressman John Murtha had this to say about his home state : " There is no question that western Pennsylvania is a racist area " .
He did , however , predict that Mr Obama would still win the state , and he later apologised for the remarks .
The polls show Mr Obama is ahead in Pennsylvania , which also has a Democratic governor and traditionally huge Democratic majorities in the major cities - Pittsburgh and Philadelphia .
' A good show '
In Uniontown , of course I met Democrats who are voting for Mr Obama , and I also met a couple of Republicans who said they were voting Obama .
This is not about a town being racist , but rather how much the race issue is reflected in the polls .
He tries to put a good show for the people , but I do n't think he is American
Brandon Hafield
At a local hunting shop there were a variety of opinions .
Registered Democrat Tom Currens said he would vote for the Republican candidate John McCain , but not because he had a problem with Mr Obama 's racial background .
Todd Hackley , a registered Republican said he would vote for Mr McCain and had this to say on the race question : " Race is an issue , it has to be , not that we want it to be .
My thoughts are that Obama will get as many votes from the blacks , as he will not get from the whites .
" I do believe there are a lot of whites who wo n't vote for him because of the colour of his skin , but I believe there are a lot of blacks who will vote for him because of his colour . "
Todd has always voted Republican and when I asked him if colour was an issue for him he said it might have been years ago , but not now .
Brandon Hafield said said he was undecided who to vote for , but when I asked if Mr Obama was a patriot he said no .
When I asked if he was American , he said : " I think he tried to be , I do n't think he is , he tries to put a good show for the people , but I do n't think he is . "
I hate to think we would have racial prejudice entering into a campaign here , but I think perhaps we do
Russ Mechling Local radio presenter Bob Fultz , who hosts a regular talk show , says prejudice is definitely present , even though few callers are willing to discuss it openly .
" White voters are n't saying what they really think , whether that 's here in Fayette County or nationally .
I had one caller who said he thinks Obama is Osama with plastic surgery . "
However , Mr Obama has gained points for his perceived ability to handle the credit crunch - and Uniontown has its own financial woes .
Russ Mechling is a retired engineer who used to be the president of the local company Fayette Engineering .
He is a registered Democrat who will be voting for Mr Obama .
" There is a little bit of a racial backlash , but I think it 's becoming less and less as the economic situation gets worse and worse .
" I think that will probably cost McCain more votes than any other single factor . "

World 's First Walking House Can Avoid Natural Disasters , Uses Solar and Wind Power
October 21st , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
What if your house could simply walk away from natural disasters ?
This house can .
Designed by an art collective in Denmark , the 10 foot high house is solar and wind - powered and can walk across a variety of terrain .
It is equipped with a living room , bed , toilet , kitchen , and wood stove , and is controlled by an internal mainframe computer .
The house , which is built on six hydraulic legs , is supposedly a way for people living in flood - prone areas to escape high waters unscathed .
Eventually , the house ’s designers anticipate the £ 30,000 price tag going down enough for low - income families to afford it .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Be excited , but be scared .
A world of mind - blowing possibilities is suddenly being thrust upon the world of video gaming .
Detecting your thoughts : the EPOC headset is a breakthrough in brain - computer interfaces .
more photos »
The era of thought controlled games has arrived , and soon you could be required only to ' think ' to operate a video game .
Maybe you 'll even have the chance to be completely immersed in a video game ' world ' .
The Emotiv EPOC headset - the first Brain Computer Interface ( BCI ) device for the gaming market is the technology behind the revolution -- and the company claims to have already mastered thought control .
The EPOC detects and processes real time brain activity patterns ( small voltage changes in the brain caused by the firing of neurons ) using a device that measures electric activity in the brain .
In total , it picks up over 30 different expressions , emotions and actions .
The leap in technology has been met with excitement amongst many gamers .
Singapore enthusiast Samuel Lau has even made a video showing his hopes for the future of gaming .
But , for the creators , what possibilities does this open up for future video games ?
View gallery of gaming through the years »
According to experts , the sci - fi scenarios depicted in The Matrix , and Star Trek 's ' Holodeck ' are now comprehendible realities in the future .
President and co-founder of Emotiv Systems , Tan Le , said the brain - to - computer interface was undoubtedly the future for video games .
" Being able to control a computer with your mind is the ultimate quest of human - machine interaction .
When integrated into games , virtual worlds and other simulated environments , this technology will have a profound impact on the user 's experience . "
What do you think video games of the future will look like ?
Le envisaged the lines between games and reality continuing to blur .
" In the long run , the user 's interactions with machines will more closely mimic our interactions with other humans .
Our technology will ultimately bring communities of people closer together to richly share their experiences , " she said .
Rick Hall , production director at the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy , is also open - minded about possibilities in future gaming .
Hall , who has worked across machines such as the N64 , Sony PSP , PS2 , and Nintendo DS , told CNN that some of the concepts in The Matrix were now " eerily reaching towards theoretical possibility " .
" If we can interpret basic control thoughts now , it is n't far off where we 'll be able to interpret more complex thoughts , even potentially things you 're not consciously thinking of .
If we can now do it in a non-invasive fashion , it probably wo n't be long before we can read these things from across the room .
And if we can " read " complex thoughts , then should n't we also be able to " write " thoughts into a person 's brain ?
" So add that up : a wireless , remote , brain reading / writing device that can scan , interpret , and communicate with someone across the room , without them even knowing it .
Connect that to the Internet ... and talk about brainwashing possibilities .
What if some hacker could figure out how to write viruses to people 's brains ?
It 's actually a little scary . "
But , it 's not all optimism and imagination for the technology .
American gaming analyst Todd Greenwald believes it may be some time yet before brain to computer interfaces reach a marketable standard , saying it is " a bit too far out and speculative to say with any confidence " .
University of Ulster video gaming lecturer Darryl Charles told CNN he was also uncertain whether Emotiv 's technology would take off .
" It 's a little bit harder to see .
It 's quite a complex thing to force your thought on a television screen . "
However , Emotiv 's
Le strongly defended the headset , saying it " works on a vast majority of people and can adapt to a wide variety of thought patterns .
Emotiv has carried out tests with hundreds of people and so far we have had success on every single person , " Le said .
While the speed of the revolution pushing the gaming world is hotly debated , one thing all experts agree on is the underlying themes of future games .
Gamers can be certain that social interaction and strong storylines will strengthen to form the core of games .
Tan Le told CNN , " The one thing that we believe will be core to the future of gaming is the social experience .
Nothing a game developer can program can match the random nature of actually participating in a scenario with other live people . "
Le said the social aspect was the key to growth of the industry , as it was opening the door to fresh markets .
She acknowledged the new level of immersion offered with the Wii's interactive control had helped send the industry in the right direction .
Charles believed a move closer towards the movie and television entertainment realm was also imminent .
" The big blockbuster game is going to compete more with Hollywood movies .
They will be a lot more competitive in storylines ... there is a lot of production values already coming from cinema . "
Greenwald said downloading games straight from the producer could soon become a reality .
A market where simple games could be downloaded for free and then add - ons to significantly improve the game were sold at a premium , could be a more financially rewarding for the makers , he said .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- Smaller .
Faster .
More efficient .
These are the qualities that drive science and industry to create new nanoscale structures that will help to speed up computers .
Scientists at the University of California , Santa Barbara have made a major contribution to this field by designing a new nanotechnology that will ultimately help make computers smaller , faster , and more efficient .
The new process is described in today 's Science Express , the online version of the journal Science .
For the first time , the UCSB scientists have created a way to make square , nanoscale , chemical patterns –– from the bottom up –– that may be used in the manufacture of integrated circuit chips as early as 2011 .
It is called block co-polymer lithography .
Five leading manufacturers , including Intel and IBM , helped fund the research at UCSB , along with the National Science Foundation and other funders .
The university has already applied for patents on the new methods developed here , and it will retain ownership .
A multidisciplinary team led by Craig Hawker , materials professor and director of the Materials Research Laboratory at UCSB , with professors Glenn Fredrickson and Edward J. Kramer , have developed a novel process for creating features on silicon wafers that are between five and 20 nanometers thick .
Hawker explained that for the future we need more powerful microprocessors that use less energy .
" If you can shrink all these things down , you get both , " he said " You get power and energy efficiency in one package . "
He said that the industry is up against Moore 's law , a trend that Gordon Moore , Intel co-founder , first described in 1965 in which the power of the microprocessor doubles every 18 months .
" One of the problems is that the industry is now running into physical limitations , " said Hawker .
" You ca n't shrink things down any more with the current technology . "
One of the ways that microprocessors are made is by using a top - down technique called photolithography , which involves shining light onto the surface of a silicon wafer , and making patterns .
He explained that the size of the wavelength of light is becoming a limiting factor , and so his team has invented a new way of creating smaller patterns .
" We 've come up with this new blending approach , called block co-polymer lithography , or BCP , " said Hawker .
" It essentially relies on a natural self - assembly process .
Just like proteins in the body , these molecules come together and self assemble into a pattern .
And so we use that pattern as our lithographic tool , to make patterns on the silicon wafer . "
Using this technique , the size of the features is about the same as that of the molecules .
They are very small , between five and 20 nanometers .
" With this strategy , we can make many more features , " said Hawker , " and hence we can pack the transistors closer together and everything else closer together –– using this new form of lithography . "
When this technique has been tried before , the molecules spontaneously self assembled into hexagonal arrays ; they look like bee hives .
But since industry uses parallel lines on a square or rectangular grid , the hexagonal arrays have limited application .
" In this article , we 've actually shown that by changing the structure of the molecules , and using two self - assembling procedures at the same time , we 're actually able to get square arrays , for the first time , " said Hawker .
" So now you can start to marry the old technology with the new technology for the fabrication of microprocessors . "
Hawker said that the new technology was designed to be compatible with current manufacturing techniques , giving it the potential to be a " slip - in " technology .
" All the big microprocessor companies like Intel and IBM have invested billions of dollars in their fabrication plants , " said Hawker .
" They 're not going to throw out that technology anytime soon .
It is too big of an investment and would not make good business sense .
This allows them to introduce a new technology using current tools in the same fabrication plants .
So they do n't have to make huge up front investments to bring this to manufacturing .
That 's a key feature . "
An analogy that Hawker uses in describing the development of the new methodology of block co-polymers is that of mixing salad dressing .
" Think of the block co-polymers as oil and water , " said Hawker .
" When you make salad dressing you shake up the bottle because the oil and water do n't want to be together .
They separate into two layers .
You shake your salad dressing and you mix everything up into much smaller droplets .
What we 've done is taken two polymer molecules that hate each other and joined them together .
And so they want to separate just like the oil and water in your salad dressing .
But because we 've molecularly joined them , they can't .
And so they separate into very , very small droplets , or domains , based on the fact that they hate each other .
Those are the BCPs . "
He explained that the interesting feature about this work is that the scientists combined the repulsive force with another self - assembly force which is slightly attractive .
" What we do is take one BCP ( made of two components that hate each other ) another BCP ( again made of two components that hate each other ) and simply mix these together , " said Hawker .
" When we mix them together , we 've designed groups on one chain to be attracted to groups on a different chain , and so they actually start to blend and mix together .
It is this combination of all these forces trying to get away from each other , and attract to each other that allows us to make the square arrays .
Whereas what nature gives you is hexagonal , if you just use a single component system . "
The scientists design the BCPs to have specific structures .
And they use simulation to define the structures that are needed to prepare .
" We design the molecule by understanding what needs to happen during the self - assembly process , " said Hawker .
" We need one block to be oil - like and one block to be water - like .
So that 's our first level of sophistication .
We then design the molecular weight or the size of the molecule , to give us the desired feature size . "
In the next step , the scientists design into the oil block the sticky groups that will form this attractive interaction , and by controlling the number of sticky groups , different levels of phase separation and different structures are created .
Polystyrene is the oil - like block , and one of the water - soluble blocks is polyethylene glycol .
Polyethylene glycol is found in shampoos and many consumer products .
It 's a non -toxic , water - soluble , biocompatible polymer .
By putting those together , the polyethylene glycol loves the water and the polystyrene loves the oil , and they hate each other .
Polystyrene is found in disposable coffee cups , and according to the scientists is a fairly cheap commodity material that if designed in the right way , becomes a high value added application .
" The key to this work is that we put all the information into those molecules , " said Hawker .
" From a molecular level , we 've built all the information into them that will allow them to undergo controlled phase separation .
And the key is then just simply blending of two specifically designed materials , and then all we do is spin that down into a thin film on a silicon wafer .
And then we heat it , and all the information that is pre-built into the molecule does its thing , and gives us the structure .
And so that 's why it is a really cheap technique .
Because all you have to do is heat things up and you get the structures that you desire . "
So the team has created a bottom - up approach to making these nanostructures , whereas the standard photolithographic technique , shining light onto the wafer –– is a top down engineering approach that requires multimillion dollar equipment .

Ruby Web Services
The basic point of distributed programming is to let computers communicate between themselves .
The simplest and most common form of distributed programming is the web service .
Web services work on top of HTTP : they generally involve sending an HTTP request to a certain URL ( possibly including an XML document ) , and getting a response in the form of another XML document .
Rather than showing this document to an end user the way a web browser would , the web service parses the XML response document and does something with it .
Web services work well when there 's a server with some interesting data and many clients who want it .
From a high - level view , web service implementations can be broken down into two categories : servers and clients .
Most web services are based on one of three architectures : Representational State Transfer ( REST ) , Simple Object Access Protocol ( SOAP ) , or Extensible Markup Language Remote Procedural Calls ( XML - RPC ) .
REST is HTTP ; XML - RPC and SOAP are protocols that run on top of HTTP .
XML - RPC is n't used much nowadays .
Writing a RubyLearning SOAP server and client
Ruby 's built - in SOAP library ( implements both the client and server sides of the SOAP protocol ) handles the low - level details for you , leaving you free to focus on using the results in your program .
To write the SOAP service , we use Hiroshi Nakamura 's soap4r library .
It is part of the Ruby standard library and implements SOAP version 1.1 ( the soap4r library is not included in Ruby 1.9 ) .
Let 's say that RubyLearning wants to host a SOAP - based web service ( we are going to build a trivial one just to show how it is done ) using a standalone server ( SOAP : : Standalone Server that is , not as part of a Rails application ) .
Building our own SOAP server ( program p072soapserver.rb ) really requires only three simple steps :
Subclass the SOAP :: Standalone Server class .
In the initialize method , register the methods you want to expose and the arguments they should take .
Here we expose a method sayhelloto that expects one parameter , username :
require ' logger ' require ' soap/rpc/standaloneServer ' class MyServer < SOAP :: RPC ::StandaloneServer def initialize (* args ) super add_method ( self , ' sayhelloto ' , ' username ' ) # create a log file @log = Logger.new ( " soapserver.log " , 5 , 10 * 1024 ) end def sayhelloto ( username ) t = Time.now @log.info( " #{username} logged on #{t} " )
" Hello , # {username} on #{t} . " end end server = MyServer.new (' RubyLearningServer ' , 'urn : mySoapServer ' , ' localhost ', 12321 ) trap ( ' INT ' ) { server.shutdown} server.start
The above example runs on port 12321 on localhost ( you could host it on your own domain too ) .
It 's name is ' RubyLearningServer ' and its namespace is ' urn : mySoapServer ' .
We 've now built a complete SOAP server .
It uses the SOAP StandaloneServer and hosts one simple sayhelloto method that can be accessed at http://127.0.0.1:12321/ with a namespace of " urn:mySoapServer " .
We trap interrupt signals so that we can stop our server from the command line .
To test your service , start the above server in one Ruby session and then use the simple script ( p073 prclient.rb ) below in another Ruby session to call the method it exposes :
# p073prclient.rb require ' soap/rpc/driver ' driver = SOAP ::RPC ::Driver.new ( ' http://127.0.0.1:12321/', ' urn:mySoapServer ' ) driver.add_method(' sayhelloto ' , ' username ' ) puts driver.sayhelloto(' RubyLearning ')
The output is :
>ruby p073prclient.rb Hello , RubyLearning on Sun Nov 25 14:57:54 +0530 2007 .
> Exit code : 0

( Fortune Magazine ) -- For Martin Eberhard , there were many obstacles on the path to building the ultimate electric sports car .
There was the scientific challenge of creating a lithium ion battery pack stable enough to power a 2,650 - pound vehicle .
There was the belief that Americans would stick with their gas - guzzlers , no matter what the price of oil .
And there was , of course , the considerable resistance in the venture capital community to funding heavy industry .
But for Eberhard , the ultimate indignity came in early June of this year .
Just days before he was finally supposed to take possession of his Tesla Roadster , a gray beauty with orange racing stripes that he had devoted the past five years of his life to building , a technician who had been driving it on the 101 freeway relayed some bad news .
The most advanced car on the planet had rear - ended a truck .
Instead of sweeping triumphantly into Eberhard 's driveway , the Roadster was towed back to Tesla headquarters south of San Francisco where , under the exacting eye of the company 's chairman and financial backer , Elon Musk , it would be rehabilitated .
Even with its carbon - fiber front end shattered , the car was something to behold .
Eberhard had named the car for Nikola Tesla , an eccentric late - 19th - and early - 20th - century inventor whose name has become a byword for genius tethered to otherworldly ambition .
( His legacy ranges from the AC power systems we still use today to plans for a " death ray " that would help armies fight wars with electricity . )
The Tesla itself - 400 volts of electric potential wrapped in a carbon - fiber body - is as far - out as its namesake , styled like the cars you used to see only in cartoons but charged by a high - powered outlet in your garage .
Stomp the accelerator , and thick cables connecting the liquid - cooled lithium ion battery pack to a printed circuit board send all that current into a series of silicon transistors the size of your little fingernail .
They are capable of switching as much as 850 amps , which drive the AC motor as high as 14,000 rpm and send the rear - wheel - drive Roadster screeching off the line , with a range of 220 miles on a single charge .
Acceleration is so fast ( 0 to 60 in 3.9 seconds ) that you get pushed back in your seat for as long as you dare to keep your foot on the aluminum pedal .
That the Tesla exists at all is a small miracle .
For car geeks it has long seemed that electric vehicles are the car of the future - and always will be .
First tinkered with in the 1800s , the electric vehicle ( or EV ) had its fate sealed with the invention by 1900 of the internal - combustion engine , which was cheaper and could travel much farther than any battery - powered model .
There was another flurry of EV development during the energy crisis of the 1970s , and again in the early '90s because of a series of regulatory guidelines governing emissions .
But by the late ' 90s , California had defanged the electric - vehicle portion of its zero-emissions mandate and soon after , GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) , Toyota ( TM ) , Honda ( HMC ) , and Ford ( F , Fortune 500 ) all shut down their EV programs .
The most dramatic end would come for GM's EV1 , when the Detroit automaker famously ripped the cars away from ecstatic owners and sent them to the crusher , as detailed in the film Who Killed the Electric Car ?
That backdrop makes the story of the Tesla all the more remarkable .
The car was conceived by Eberhard , an engineer , serial entrepreneur , and inventor ( his name is on battery - cooling , electric motor , and power electronics patents filed by Tesla Motors ) .
He was convinced that if he could outfit an existing sports car chassis with loads of laptop batteries , it would be feasible to build and he'd find plenty of buyers among the speed - loving , planet - conscious Silicon Valley set and beyond .
But given that he had zero experience in the auto world and that gas was at a relatively cheap $ 1.50 a gallon , Eberhard , 48 , could n't find a VC firm willing to give him enough to build the car .
Which is how he came to Elon Musk .
The 37 - year - old Musk had co-founded PayPal , was forced out of the online - payment company , but cashed in when it was sold to eBay ( EBAY , Fortune 500 ) , giving him more than enough money to launch SpaceX , a private rocket company that aims to start shuttling people to the International Space Station by 2011 .
Big ideas , in other words , are Musk 's specialty .
After a two - hour meeting in February 2004 , Musk agreed to plow $ 6.3 million into Tesla .
He would become the company 's chairman ; Eberhard would be CEO .
In one sense , the duo's timing could n't have been better .
Tesla has begun delivering cars just as gas prices and fears about global warming have shot to all - time highs .
All those automakers that shelved plans have since restarted them .
Nissan ( NSANY ) , Mitsubishi , Daimler , Subaru , and boutique firms like Fisker Automotive are furiously working on new models - some all - electric , others range - extended EVs - but wo n't get to market till 2009 - 13 .
GM's Bob Lutz even credited his company 's relaunch to Tesla .
" If some Silicon Valley startup can solve this equation , " he told Newsweek , " no one is going to tell me anymore that it 's unfeasible . "
Brunel University ’s School of Sport and Education has reveals that , according to Dr Costas Karageorghis ’s latest research , carefully selected music can significantly increase a person ’s physical endurance and make the experience of cardiovascular exercise far more positive .
The study , due to be published in the U.S. periodical Journal of Sport & Exercise Psychology , is the latest from a 20 - year programme of work into the motivational qualities of music in sport and exercise .
The findings illustrate the considerable benefits associated with exercising in time to music : something that some elite athletes , such as marathon world record holder Haile Gebrselassie , have been doing for years .
Thirty participants exercised on a treadmill while listening to a selection of motivational rock or pop music , including tracks by Queen , the Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Madonna .
They were asked to keep in strict time with the beat .
The findings show that when carefully selected according to scientific principles , music can enhance endurance by 15 % and improve the ‘ feeling states ’ of exercisers , helping them to derive much greater pleasure from the task .
One significant new finding is that music can help exercisers to feel more positive even when they are working out at a very high intensity – close to physical exhaustion .
The scientific principles that guided this piece of research are about to be put into action through an ambitious and exciting sporting event due to take place on 5th October in Greenwich , London .
The Sony Ericsson Run To The Beat half - marathon will be the first to provide scientifically - selected live musical accompaniment along the entire length of the course .
Dr Karageorghis has selected and coordinated the music that will be played at 17 live music stations to accompany 12,500 runners .
Dr Karageorghis ’s latest research findings are particularly noteworthy for public health practitioners , given that treadmill - based exercise such as walking and running is often incorporated into the rehabilitation programmes of those in a primary care settings ( e.g. cardiac patients and those suffering from obesity ) .
Music has the power to make a considerable impact in the fight against public inactivity .
Moreover , the effects of music on mood and emotions open up the possibility that it can be used to improve compliance to exercise and therefore help people achieve their long - term health and fitness goals .
Dr Karageorghis , who is a reader in sport psychology at Brunel University , explains : “ The synchronous application of music resulted in much higher endurance while the motivational qualities of the music impacted significantly on the interpretation of fatigue symptoms right up to the point of voluntary exhaustion ” .

Another night in Oakland , another round of Prop 8 picketing .
This time a couple dozen people spread out on each of the four corners at MacArthur and High Sts. in east Oakland , California leading the fight against gay marriage .
The scene was , oddly enough , jumping .
Lots of teenagers , some grandmas , cheering , each with a sign .
The most popular were “ Prop 8 = Free Speech ” ( that ‘ equal ’ is making it into the anti-gay marriage push holds its own irony ) , and “ Honk if you Support Prop 8 ” ( the intersection was as loud as a a Manhattan thoroughfare ) .
Detractors , those with No on Prop 8 signs and vocal drivers provoked screaming ( “ God created Adam and Eve , not Adam and Steve ! ” ) , middle fingers out of car windows , lots of pointing against windshields , a real show of humanity .
I talked to a few picketers and found out they ’re all from area Mormon churches .
They ’ve been picketing every night at various spots across the Bay Area .
One young woman , Patricia , who ’s 18 , said she and her church go to a different intersection most every night .
I asked if she was going to vote .
“ Yeah , I ’m voting , yes on Prop 8 . ”
Who are you voting for for president ?
Her response might be what surprised me the most , after the jump .
“ I ’m not , ” she said .
“ I ’m only voting for Prop 8 , nothing else , that ’s the only thing that ’s important . ”
Seriously ?
She said it ’s so important because without it “ there will be gay marriage in my church . ”
While it ’s safe to say that the Mormon Church is n’t going to start blessing same - sex unions in their temples , the message she ’s sending is a strategic one .
The Church of Latter Day Saints has all but ordered its congregants to campaign for , and donate to ( the church has raised at least $ 10 million from its members ) , Prop 8 ’s passage .
From High Country News :
In June , the church ’s top prophets commanded Mormons “ to do all you can ” to work for Proposition 8 and donate money to the campaign .
Mormon leaders throughout California read the instructions to their congregations , which have more than 750,000 members .
Word spread everywhere in the Mormon realm .
In August , the prophets added pages of elaboration : “ The Church has a single , undeviating standard of sexual morality : intimate relations are proper only between a husband and a wife united in bonds of matrimony . …
Any dilution of the traditional definition of marriage will further erode the already weakened stability of marriages and family generally … with harmful consequences for society . ”
At least in Oakland its congregants are out in force , and there ’s no sign they ’re slowing down .
“ We ’ve seen a bunch of haters , ” said Patricia , “ but also a lot of supporters . ”
UPDATE : Kevin Drum looks at the latest Prop 8 poll numbers out today .
“ It ’s gonna be close , folks . ”
Carl Yastrzemski : Baseball Hall of Fame Great Hospitalized ( Photos )
, 68 , has been admitted to Boston 's Massachusetts General Hospital after experiencing chest pains .
According to his spokesman , , " Any time you are in the hospital , it 's got to be pretty serious . "
The popular Yaz was an All - Star a total of 18 times and spent his entire career in Boston from 1961 to 1983 , taking over left field for baseball great Ted Williams .
Carl helped to revitalize the franchise during the ' Impossible Dream ' season of 1967 .
He led the team to their first pennant since 1946 thought they lost the World Series to St. Louis in Game 7 .
His trademark way of holding the bat high over his head is legend and imitated by many kids .
The baseball great was elected to the Hall on the first ballot in 1989 .
The media shy athlete rarely makes public appearances but did throw out the first ball in the first game of the 2007 World Series , while flanked by his 1967 teammates - as seen in the photo at the top of this post .
Yaz , No. 8 , is one of five former Red Sox sluggers to have his number painted on the wall at Fenway Park .
Others include Ted Williams , Carlton Fisk , Bobby Doerr and Joe Cronin .

Nobody expected industrial capitalism to end up like this .
Nobody even saw it evolving in this direction .
I ’m afraid this failing is not unusual among futurists :
The natural tendency is to think about how economies can best grow and evolve , not how it can be untracked .
But an unforeseen road always seems to appear , and there goes society goes off on a tangent .
What a two weeks !
On Sunday , September 7 , the Treasury took on the $ 5.3 trillion mortgage exposure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , whose heads already had been removed for accounting fraud .
On Monday , September 15 , Lehman Brothers went bankrupt , when prospective Wall Street buyers could n’t gain any sense of reality from its financial books .
On Wednesday the Federal Reserve agreed to make good for at least $ 85 billion in the just - pretend “ insured ” winnings owed to financial gamblers who bet on computer - driven trades in junk mortgages and bought counter - party coverage from the A.I.G. ( the American International Group , whose head Maurice Greenberg already had been removed a few years back for accounting fraud ) .
But it is Friday , September 19 , that will go down as a turning point in American history .
The White House committed at least half a trillion dollars more to re-inflate real estate prices in an attempt to support the market value junk mortgages – mortgages issued far beyond the ability of debtors to pay and far above the going market price of the collateral being pledged .
These billions of dollars were devoted to keeping a dream alive – the accounting fictions written down by companies that had entered an unreal world based on false accounting that nearly everyone in the financial sector knew to be fake .
But they played along with buying and selling packaged mortgage junk because that was where the money was .
As Charles Prince of Citibank put it , “ As long as they ’re playing music , you have to get up and dance . ”
Even after markets collapsed , fund managers who steered clear were blamed for not playing the game while it was going .
I have friends on Wall Street who were fired for not matching the returns that their compatriots were making .
And the biggest returns were to be made in trading in the economy ’s largest financial asset – mortgage debt .
The mortgages packaged , owned or guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie alone exceeded the entire U.S. national debt – the cumulative deficits run up by the American Government since the nation won the Revolutionary War !
This gives an idea of just how large the bailout has been – and where the government ’s ( or at least the Republicans ’ ) priorities lie !
Instead of waking up the economy to reality , the government has thrown all its resources to promote the unreal dream that debts can be paid – if not by the debtors themselves , then by the government – “ taxpayers , ” as the euphemism goes .
Overnight , the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve have radically changed the character of American capitalism .
It is nothing less than a coup d’Etat for the class that FDR called “ banksters . ”
What has happened in the past two weeks threatens to change the coming century – irreversibly , if they can get away with it .
This is the largest and most inequitable transfer of wealth since the land giveaways to the railroad barons during the Civil War era .
Even so , there seems little sign that it even may end the free - market patter talk by financial insiders who have managed to avert public oversight by appointing non-regulators to the major regulatory agencies – and thus created the mess that Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson now says threatens the bank deposits and jobs of all Americans .
What he really means , of course , are simply the largest Republican campaign contributors ( and to be fair , also the largest contributors to Democratic candidates on key financial committees ) .
A kleptocratic class has taken over the economy to replace industrial capitalism .
Franklin Roosevelt ’s term “ banksters ” says it all in a nutshell .
The economy has been captured – by an alien power , but not the usual suspects .
Not socialism , workers or “ big government , ” nor by industrial monopolists or even by the great banking families .
Certainly not by Freemasons and Illuminati .
( It would be wonderful if there were indeed some group operating with centuries of wisdom behind them , so at least someone at least had a plan . )
Rather , the banksters have made a compact with an alien power - not Communists , Russians , Asians or Arabs .
Not humans at all .
The group ’s cadre is a new breed of machine .
It may sound like the Terminator movies , but computerized Machines have indeed taken over the world – at least , the White House ’s world .
Here is how they did it .
A.I.G. wrote insurance policies of all sorts of that people and businesses need : home and property insurance , livestock insurance , even aircraft leasing .
These highly profitable businesses were not the problem .
( They therefore will probably be sold off to pay the company ’s bad gambles . )
A.I.G.’s downfall came from the $ 450 billion – almost half a trillion – dollars it was on the hook for as a result of guaranteeing hedge - fund counterparty insurance .
In other words , if two parties played the zero-sum game of betting against each other as to whether the dollar would rise or fall against sterling or the euro , or if they insured a mortgage portfolio of junk mortgages to make sure that they would get paid , they would pay a teeny tiny commission to A.I.G. for a policy promising to pay if , say , the $ 11 trillion U.S. mortgage market should “ stumble ” or if losers placing trillions of dollars in bets on foreign exchange derivatives , stock or bond derivatives should somehow find themselves in a position that so many Las Vegas patrons are in , and be unable to come up with the cash to cover their losses .
A.I.G. collected billions of dollars on such policies .
And thanks to the fact that insurance companies are a Milton Friedman paradise – not regulated by the Federal Reserve or any other nation - wide agency , and hence able to get the proverbial free lunch without government oversight – writing such policies was done by computer printouts , and the company collected massive fees and commissions without putting in much capital of its own .
This is what is called “ self - regulation . ”
It is how the Invisible Hand is supposed to work .
It turned out , inevitably , that some of the financial institutions that made billion - dollar gambles – usually in the form of a thousand million - dollar gambles in the course of a few minutes or so , to be precise – could n’t pay up .
These gambles all occur in microseconds , at strokes of a keyboard almost without human interference .
In that sense it is not unlike alien pod people taking over .
But in this case they are robot - like machines , hence the analogy I drew above with the Terminators .
Their sudden rise to dominance is as unforeseen as an invasion from Mars .
The nearest analogy is the invasion of the Harvard Boys , World Bank and U.S.A.I.D. to Russia and other post -Soviet economies after the Soviet Union was dissolved , pressing free - market giveaways to create national kleptocracies .
It should be a worrying sign to Americans that these kleptocrats have become the Founding Fortunes of their respective countries .
We should bear in mind Aristotle ’s observation that democracy is the political stage immediately preceding oligarchy .
The financial machines that placed the trades that bankrupted A.I.G. were programmed by financial managers to act with the speed of light in conducting electronic trades often lasting only a few seconds each , millions of times a day .
Only a machine could calculate mathematical probabilities factored in regarding the squiggles up and down of interest rates , exchange rates and stock and bonds prices – and prices for packaged mortgages .
And the latter packages increasingly took the form of junk mortgages , pretending to be payable debts but in reality empty flak .
The machines employed by hedge funds in particular have given a new meaning to Casino Capitalism .
That was long applied to speculators playing the stock market .
It meant making cross bets , lose some and win some – and getting the government to bail out the non-payers .
The twist in the past two weeks ’ turmoil is that the winners cannot collect on their bets unless the government pays the debts that the losers are unable to cover with their own money .
One would have thought that this requires some degree of control over the government .
The activity probably never should have been licensed .
In fact , it never was licensed , and hence nor regulated .
But there seemed to be a good reason : Investors in hedge funds had to sign a paper saying that they were rich enough to afford to lose their money on this financial gambling .
Your average mom and pop investors were not permitted to participate .
Despite the high rewards that millions of tiny trades generated , they were deemed too risky for the uninitiated lacking trust funds to play with .
A hedge fund does not make money by producing goods and services .
It does not advance funds to buy real assets or even lend money .
It borrows huge sums to leverage its bet with nearly free credit .
Its managers are not industrial engineers but mathematicians who program computers to make cross-bets or “ straddles ” on which way interest rates , currency exchange rates , stock or bond prices may move – or the prices for packaged bank mortgages .
The packaged loans may be sound or they may be junk .
It does n’t matter .
All that matters is making money in a marketplace where most trades last only a few seconds .
What creates the gains is the price fibrillation – volatility .
This kind of transaction may make fortunes , but it is not “ wealth creation ” in the form that most people recognize .
Before the Black - Scholes mathematical formula for calculating the value of hedge bets , this kind of put and call option was too costly to provide much profit to anyone except the brokerage houses .
But the combination of powerful computers and the “ innovation ” of almost free credit and free access to the financial gambling tables has made possible a frenetic back - and - forth maneuvering .
So why has the Treasury found it necessary to enter this picture at all ?
Why should these gamblers be bailed out , if they had enough to lose without having to become public wards by going on welfare ?
Hedge fund trading was limited to the very rich , for investment banks and other institutional investors .
But it became one of the easiest ways to make money , loaning funds at interest for people to pay out of their computer - driven cross -trades .
And almost as fast as it was made , this revenue was paid out in commissions , salaries and annual bonuses reminiscent of America ’s Gilded Age in the years prior to World War I – years before the income tax was introduced in 1913 .
The remarkable thing about all this money was that its recipients did n’t even have to pay normal income tax on it .
The government let them call it “ capital gains , ” which meant that the money was taxed at only a fraction of the rate that incomes were taxed .
The pretense , of course , is that all this frenetic trading creates real “ capital . ”
It certainly does not do so in the classical 19th - century concept of capital .
The term has been decoupled from producing goods and services , hiring wage labor or from financing innovation .
It is as much “ capital ” as the right to conduct a lottery and collect the winnings from the hopes of the losers .
But then , casinos from Las Vegas to riverboats have become a major “ growth industry , ” muddying the language of capital , growth and wealth itself .
For the gaming tables to be closed and the money paid out , the losers must be bailed out – Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , A.I.G. and who knows what to come ?
This is the only way to solve the problem of how companies that already have paid out their revenue to their managers and stockholders instead of putting it in reserves are to collect their winnings from insolvent debtors and insurance companies .
These losers also have paid out their income to their financial managers and insiders ( along with the usual patriotic contributions to the political candidates on the key committees in charge of deciding the nation ’s financial structuring ) .
This has to be orchestrated well in advance .
It is necessary to buy politicians and give them a plausible cover story ( or at least a well - crafted set of poll - tested euphemisms ) to explain to voters just why it was in the public interest to bail out gamblers .
Good rhetoric is needed to explain why the government should let them go into a casino and let them keep all their winnings while using public funds to make good on the losses of their counterparties .
What happened on September 18 - 19 took years of preparation , capped by a faux ideology crafted by public - relations think tanks to be broadcast under emergency conditions to panic Congress – and voters – right before the presidential election .
This seems to be our September election surprise .
Under staged crisis conditions , Pres. Bush and Treasury Secretary Paulson are now calling for the country to come together in a War on Defaulting Homeowners .
This is said to be the only hope to “ save the system . ”
( What system is this ?
Not industrial capitalism , or even banking as we know it . )
The largest transformation of America ’s financial system since the Great Depression has been compressed into just two weeks , starting with the doubling of America ’s national debt on September 7 with the nationalization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
( My computer ’s spellchecker will not permit me to use the euphemism “ conservatorship ” that Mr. Paulson applied to bailing out the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fraudsters . )
Economic theory used to explain that profits and interest were a return for calculated risk .
But today , the name of the game is capital gains and computerized gambling on the direction of interest rates , foreign currencies and stock prices – and when bad bets are made , bailouts are the calculated economic return for campaign contributions .
But this is not supposed to be the time to talk of such things .
“ We must act now to protect our nation ’s economic health from serious risk , ” intoned Pres. Bush on September 19 .
What he meant was that the White House must make the Republican Party ’s largest group of campaign contributors whole – Wall Street , that is – by bailing out their bad gambles .
“ There will be ample opportunity to debate the origins of this problem .
Now is the time to solve it . ”
In other words , do n’t make this an election issue .
“ In our nation ’s history there have been moments that require us to come together across party lines to address major challenges .
This is such a moment .
” Right before the presidential election !
The same guff was heard earlier on Friday morning from Sec. Paulson : “ Our economic health requires that we work together for prompt , bipartisan action . ”
The broadcasters said that half a trillion dollars was discussed for this day ’s maneuverings .
Much of the blame should go to the Clinton Administration for leading the call to repeal Glass - Steagall in 1999 , letting the banks merge with casinos .
Or rather , the casinos have absorbed the banks .
That is what has put the savings of Americans at risk .
But does this really mean that the only solution is to re-inflate the real estate market ?
The Paulson - Bernanke plan is to enable the banks to sell off the homes of five million home mortgage debtors faced with default or foreclosure this year !
Homeowners with “ exploding adjustable - rate mortgages ” will lose their homes , but the Fed will pump enough credit into the mortgage - lending agencies to enable new buyers to go deeply enough into debt to take the junk mortgages off the hands of the gamblers who presently own them .
Time for another financial and real estate bubble to bail out the junk mortgage lenders and packagers .
America has entered into a new war – a War to Save Computerized Derivative Traders .
Like the Iraq war , it is based largely on fictions and entered into under seeming emergency conditions – to which the solution has little relation to the underlying cause of the problems .
On financial security grounds the government is to make good on the collateralized debt obligations packaged ( CDOs ) that Warren Buffett has called “ weapons of mass financial destruction . ”
Hardly by surprise , this giveaway of public money is being handled by the same group that warned the country so piously about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
Pres. Bush and Treasury Secretary Paulson have piously announced that this is no time for partisan disagreements over this shift of public policy to favor creditors rather than debtors .
There is no time to make the biggest bailout in election history an election issue .
Not an appropriate time to debate whether it is a good thing to re-inflate housing prices to a level that will continue to oblige new home buyers to go so deeply into debt that they must pay some 40 percent of their take - home pay on housing .
Remember when President Bush and Alan Greenspan informed the American people that there was no money left to pay Social Security ( not to mention Medicare ) because at some future date ( a decade from now ? 20 years ? 40 years ? ) the system might run a deficit of what now seems to be merely a trivial trillion dollars spread over many , many years .
The moral was that if we ca n’t figure out how to pay , let ’s plow the program under right now .
Mr. Bush and Greenspan did have a helpful solution , of course .
The Treasury could turn Social Security and medical insurance money over to Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers and their brethren to invest at the “ magic of compound interest . ”
What would have happened to U.S. Social Security had this been done ?
Perhaps we should view the past two weeks ’ events as having assigned to Wall Street gamblers all the money that has been set aside since the Greenspan Commission in 1983 shifted the tax burden onto FICA wage withholding .
It is not retirees who are being rescued , but the Wall Street investors who signed papers saying that they could afford to lose their money .
The Republican slogan this November should be “ Gambling insurance , not health insurance . ”
This is not how the much - vaunted Road to Serfdom was mapped out to be .
Frederick Hayek and his Chicago Boys insisted that serfdom would come from government planning and regulation .
This view turned upside down the classical and Progressive Era reformers who depicted government as acting as society ’s brain , its steering mechanism to shape markets – and free them from income without playing a necessary role in production .
The theory of democracy rested on the assumption that voters would act in their self - interest .
Market reformers made a kindred happy assumption that consumers , savers and investors would promote economic growth by acting with full knowledge and understanding of the dynamics at work .
But the Invisible Hand turned out to be accounting fraud , junk mortgage lending , insider dealing and a failure to relate the soaring debt overhead to the ability of debtors to pay – all of this mess seemingly legitimized by computerized trading models , and now blessed by the Treasury .

With only three months left in office , U.S. President George W. Bush appears increasingly determined to calm the international waters he so vigorously churned up , especially during his first term .
In just the last several days , he has effectively rehabilitated a charter member of the " Axis of Evil "  North Korea  by agreeing to take it off the State Department ’s list of state sponsors of terrorism in exchange for Pyongyang ’s agreement to resume its dismantling of a key nuclear facility and cooperate with U.S. and international inspectors .
As for the other surviving member of the Axis , Iran , leaks from the State Department and elsewhere over the last several days suggest that Bush will announce Washington ’s intention to open a U.S. interest section in Tehran shortly after the Nov. 4 presidential elections here , effectively reestablishing diplomatic relations that were broken off 29 years ago .
Although both moves were foreseen already last summer , neoconservatives and other hawks in and outside the administration who have steadfastly opposed any détente with either country are furious .
" It is the final crash and burn of a once - inspiring global effort to confront and reverse nuclear proliferation , thereby protecting America and its friends , " wrote former UN Ambassador John Bolton in Monday ’s Wall Street Journal about the North Korea deal .
" Having bent the knee to North Korea , Secretary [ of State Condoleezza ]
Rice appears primed to do the same with Iran , despite that regime ’s egregious and extensive involvement in terrorism and the acceleration of its nuclear program , " continued Bolton , who is often thought to express the off - the - record views of Vice President Dick Cheney .
He predicted that Washington will actually open its interest section " within days " after the election despite the fact that Tehran has not yet given its approval .
" Hard as it is to believe , there may be worse yet to come , " Bolton concluded .
Worse for the hawks , the two moves also tend to undercut the foundering election campaign of Republican presidential candidate , Sen .
John McCain , in precisely those very few remaining areas  national security and the " war on terror "  in which , according to public opinion polls , he is generally perceived as stronger and more experienced than his Democratic rival , Sen. Barack Obama .
McCain , who has joked about bombing Iran on the campaign trail , until recently opposed any direct diplomatic engagement with Tehran unless it complied with UN Security Council demands that it freeze its uranium - enrichment program .
And he reacted to the latest agreement with Pyongyang by effectively withholding his support .
" I expect the administration to explain exactly how this new verification agreement advances American interests and those of its allies , " he said after the State Department announced that it would take Pyongyang off the terrorism list .
Obama , on the other hand , called the deal a " modest step forward . "
Indeed , on a range of key foreign policy issues  including the priority to be given to Israel - Palestinian peace talks , Afghanistan , Pakistan , Russia after its intervention in Georgia , and even Taiwan , to which McCain supports several big - ticket arms systems currently opposed by both the administration and Obama  Bush now appears closer to the Democratic candidate than to his - fellow Republican .
Many of McCain ’s closest advisers include neoconservatives and nationalist hawks whose views were decisive in shaping what became known as the " Bush Doctrine " and inspiring the fateful U.S. invasion of Iraq during the president ’s first term .
In that respect , Bush ’s latest moves reflect the culmination of a " realist restoration " during his second term , one that has witnessed a gradual decline in the hawks ’ influence and a return to a more traditional reliance by Washington on diplomacy and multilateralism , particularly in coordination with key Western allies , as the preferred option for solving international problems .
That restoration has been led by Rice and senior career diplomats in her Department , the intelligence community , and , since late 2006 , by Pentagon chief Robert Gates and the Joint Chiefs of Staff whose conviction that the U.S. armed forces are badly overstretched and cannot afford to fight yet another war , be it on the Korean peninsula , the Middle East , or , for that matter , in the Caucasus , has clearly had an impact in the Oval Office .
The current financial crisis has no doubt enhanced the White House ’s appreciation for the degree to which the United States is dependent on foreign powers  not all of them necessarily friendly  and their cooperation , thus strengthening the realists ’ position as the administration plays out its term .
Their efforts  and now Bush ’s , too  are directed primarily at trying to undo the damage to Washington ’s global position inflicted by the hawks not only during their period of dominance from 9/11 to the end of the first term , but also as a result of their furious rearguard actions during the second term against realist efforts to engage North Korea and Iran .
While North Korea ’s nuclear - weapons program was effectively frozen by a series of accords between Pyongyang and the Bill Clinton administration between 1994 and 2001 , Bush ’s refusal to continue where Clinton left off  as he had been advised by his realist secretary of state at the time , ret .
Gen. Colin Powell  led to Pyongyang ’s withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) and eventually to its detonation of a nuclear device in Oct. 2006 .
Bush finally yielded to Rice ’s appeal to engage Pyongyang directly , a mission undertaken by her Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs , Christopher Hill .
By then , however , Washington ’s hand had been so badly weakened that Hill was forced to settle for a denuclearization accord that inevitably fell short of Bush ’s one - time promise of a virtually full - proof verification regime that would permit inspectors to go virtually anywhere at any time to suspected , as well as known , nuclear sites .
To the bitter protests of the hawks , last weekend ’s announcement that North Korea had been removed from the terrorism list in exchange for its agreement to a more limited inspection regime confirmed that Bush had once more retreated from his maximalist demands .
" This is n’t diplomacy , it ’s lunacy , " one unnamed former administration official told The Weekly Standard ‘s Stephen Hayes , who is also known to be close to Cheney .
Realists  including members of the 2006 Iraq Study Group headed by former secretary of state James Baker  have long urged Bush to drop preconditions for direct negotiations with Tehran .
In June , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs , Adm. Michael Mullen , called for a " broad dialogue " with Iran .
Less than one month later , Bush sent a senior State Department official to participate for the first time in talks between the other permanent UN Security Council members , Germany , and Iran , amid reports that Iran had successfully tested advanced centrifuges that would permit it to accelerate its uranium enrichment program .
He also tentatively agreed to Rice ’s idea of opening an interest section at that time , but the announcement was reportedly put off when Cheney and others opposed to the move argued that it could harm McCain ’s election chances .
The well - connected Washington Post columnist David Ignatius reported Sunday , however , that the announcement will be made after the election in mid-November , a report echoed by Bolton the following day .
( Inter Press Service )
“ Not only have individual financial institutions become less vulnerable to shocks from underlying risk factors , but also the financial system as a whole has become more resilient . ” — Alan Greenspan in 2004
George Soros , the prominent financier , avoids using the financial contracts known as derivatives “ because we do n’t really understand how they work . ”
Felix G. Rohatyn , the investment banker who saved New York from financial catastrophe in the 1970s , described derivatives as potential “ hydrogen bombs . ”
And Warren E. Buffett presciently observed five years ago that derivatives were “ financial weapons of mass destruction , carrying dangers that , while now latent , are potentially lethal . ”
One prominent financial figure , however , has long thought otherwise .
And his views held the greatest sway in debates about the regulation and use of derivatives — exotic contracts that promised to protect investors from losses , thereby stimulating riskier practices that led to the financial crisis .
For more than a decade , the former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has fiercely objected whenever derivatives have come under scrutiny in Congress or on Wall Street .
“ What we have found over the years in the marketplace is that derivatives have been an extraordinarily useful vehicle to transfer risk from those who should n’t be taking it to those who are willing to and are capable of doing so , ” Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee in 2003 .
“ We think it would be a mistake ” to more deeply regulate the contracts , he added .
Olbermann examines McCain 's ties to anti-abortion ' terrorist ' sympathizer Nick Juliano and David Edwards

Why does it matter that a candidate for president knew Bill Ayers and Jeremiah Wright ?
" The answer , we are told , has to do with Barack Obama 's judgment and character , " MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann said Wednesday night .
He devoted a segment to exploring " what we learn applying this litmus test to John McCain . "
Olbermann ends up dissecting the implications of McCain 's appearance at a fundraiser for the the ultra- right wing Oregon Citizens Alliance in 1993 .
Earlier this week , RAW STORY reported that McCain shared the stage with Marilyn Shannon , who during her own speech praised a local woman who had shot a doctor because he performed abortions .
" Unlike Ayers who did not endorse terrorist activities during his meetings with Obama , this woman , Shannon , said of the shooter -- as McCain sat there -- quote ' she's a fine lady , ' " Olbermann said .
" A judge who later sentenced his fine lady for a campaign of yes , bombing women 's clinics , said quote , ' Though I am loathe to call anyone a terrorist , you are a terrorist . ' "
As Jed Lewison notes Olbermann 's segment does not mention that McCain voted against making abortion clinic bombings a federal crime three months after the OCA appearance .
The Countdown segment also unearthed photos of Shannon as a delegate for President Bush during the 2004 Republican convention , where she wore a purple heart band - aid to mock John Kerry , and at the 2008 convention , which she attended as a McCain delegate wearing a " Shut Up and Drill " T - shirt .
Olbermann also explored more details of McCain 's links to the US Council for World Freedom , an ardently anti-Communist group that included Nazi sympathizers , and his endorsement from the widow of the philanthropist who established the Annenberg Foundation , which employed Ayers and Obama .
While McCain continues to attack Obama over the past Ayers connection , he has so far refused to address his own coterie of questionable connections .

From the beginning , the McCain campaign has been high drama .
Internal fights , new campaign managers , bickering — it all spilled into the media .
The trouble starts at the top , of course .
McCain is an erratic manager .
However , when “ McCain campaign officials ” start spilling to the press with just 25 days to go til the election , it ’s not about strategy , it ’s about cover .
( Yeah , CYA . )
We ’ll start to see more of these “ off - the - record ” comments as top GOP operatives try to distance themselves from the impending disaster :
Top McCain campaign officials are grappling with how far to go with negative attacks on Sen.
Barack Obama in the final weeks of what is turning into a come - from - behind effort .
Sen .
John McCain has allowed a series of increasingly harsh broadsides in new campaign ads and in speeches by his wife , Cindy , and his running mate , Gov. Sarah Palin .
But the Arizona Republican has rejected pleas from some advisers to launch attacks focusing on Sen.
Obama ’s former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
Some McCain campaign officials are becoming concerned about the hostility that attacks against Sen. Obama are whipping up among Republican supporters .
During an internal conference call Thursday , campaign officials discussed how the tenor of the crowds has turned on the media and on Sen. Obama .
Those “ McCain campaign officials ” are really more concerned about their careers and reputations at this point .
Let them spill the dirty laundry .
The more time they spending covering their butts , the less time they ’ll have to work on getting out the GOP vote .
Republican campaigns up and down the ticket are having the same kind of internal battles .
They ’re fighting within the McCain campaign .
Republican candidates are fighting the McCain campaign .
It ’s all beautifully self - destructive .
Terry Pratchett at the Discworld premiere
Last year Terry Pratchett , the bestselling author of the Discworld fantasies , was diagnosed with Alzheimer's .
How does the writer cope with a disease that whittles away at his brain ?
When writer Terry Pratchett was told he had Alzheimer 's disease , his first thought was " that 's a bit of a bugger " .
That , and " I hope they hurry up and find a cure quick . "
In December 2007 , at the age of 59 , the Discworld author was diagnosed with a rare early - onset form of the disease called Posterior Cortical Atrophy , or PCA .
It was last summer when he first started to suspect all was not well , and went to see his doctor .
Given a brain scan and a Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) , a brief 30 - point questionnaire commonly used by medics to screen for dementia , he was told that all was well .
" I passed the test - it 's actually quite hard to fail I think . "
FIND OUT MORE The NHS Postcode Lottery : It Could Be You is on Monday 18 August at 2030 BST See the Panorama website for more details
Or catch up with the iPlayer But as time wore on , he remained convinced that all was not well .
" We had what I called a Clapham Junction day , when you know the phones were ringing .
There were lots of things to do and I was just kind of flat - lining almost .
I just could n't deal with it and I thought ' there 's more , there 's more ' . "
He was referred to Addenbrooke 's Hospital in Cambridge , where the diagnosis was finally made .
Firing on all cylinders
In the most common form of Alzheimer 's , the main symptom is loss of memory , but PCA affects the back of the brain and so it is motor skills and vision which are hardest hit .
Still thinking and speaking coherently , Pratchett 's typing has gone downhill " It 's unusual because people deal with me and they refuse to believe I have Alzheimer 's because at the moment I can speak very coherently , I can plot a novel , " Pratchett says .
" I type badly - if it was n't for my loss of typing ability , I might doubt the fact that I have Alzheimer's .
" It 's now hunt and peck , and there will be a moment sometimes when the letter A just totally vanishes and I do n't quite know what happens .
" It 's as if the keyboard closes up and the letter A is not there anymore .
Then I 'll blink a few times and then the letter A comes back . "
But though his typing has slowed , the good news for his many fans is that his imagination remains undimmed , " going on at the same old rate " .
It is this imagination that conjured up Discworld - a parallel universe filled with magical characters who live on a flat world sitting on the backs of four elephants , who are in turn standing on the shell of a giant turtle .
He has sold more than 55 million books worldwide and his work has been translated into 33 languages .
But life as an in - demand public figure posed specific problems when it came to diagnosing his condition .
" The basic test , for example , will ask you questions like what day of the week is it , what is the date ?
I have a PA so there are really only two types of day - is my PA in or is my PA out ?
What day of the week is it ?
Well if he's not here then it 's probably the weekend . "
A rock hyrax is not the first animal many would think to list And as a writer of fantasy fiction , and therefore a keen observer of the outlandish , this further complicated matters for those seeking to make a diagnosis .
" One of the questions was how many animals can you name .
" And I said ' let me think ...
There 's the rock hyrax which is the closest living relative to the elephant , and then there 's the thylocene which is the possibly extinct Tasmanian werewolf .
How many more would you like me to name ? ' "
Best money can buy
But his status as the UK 's biggest selling author after JK Rowling does bring huge benefits .
He has the money to pay for facilities and treatment - particularly the drug Aricept , without which he says he can't function properly .
I sent out a message saying 'it 's only worth asking me if you can help if you 're high - end brain specialist '
" My wife said ' you would pick up the shirt and look at it as if you were looking at some kind of new thing that you had to wear .
And now you just put it on and just do the buttons up and you do n't think about it ' . "
And continuing to write keeps his ailing brain in good condition , as does walking , gardening , watching films and playing computer games .
" One piece of advice I was given by a specialist was ' surround yourself with toys ' .
He did n't mean buy stuff , but try to make your life as interesting as possible keep yourself active , keep yourself interested . "
Once news of his illness was announced , another great source of advice were his numerous readers , whom he refers to as " the Greek Chorus " .
" My fans across the world started to contact me , and in fact the website fell over and it was just getting ridiculous .
So I sent out a message saying ' it 's only worth asking me if you can help if you 're a high - end brain specialist ' .
" About a dozen or more contacted me saying ' I do n't know about high - end but I 'm head of the department of whatever at so - and - so university ' . "
While he has yet to be slipped some secret healing potion , what these medical boffins have done is offer expert opinions on the research going on behind closed doors .
" Something like a cure I suspect is in the pipeline .
But I think it 's a fairly long pipe , so I do n't think it will be in time for me .
One lives in hope . "
Pratchett admits that his disease does pose immense challenges .
" You get dark days .
It 's one step beyond can't find your mobile phone , can't find your car keys . "
But although he knows his is a degenerative condition for which at present there is no cure , he refuses to be defeated .
" In addition to his bladder , his hairstyle and his sense of humour , my father willed to me his stoicism , " Pratchett says .
His father died of cancer aged 86 , and remained active throughout .
" If there 's nothing you can do about something , then do n't do it .
You have to learn to program your life around the fact . "
Below is a selection of your comments .
What an inspiration he is to all people with long term illnesses .
Kim , London
We have all of Terry Pratchett 's Discworld books , together with the Tiffany Aching series and just love them so much .
He is the only author whose writing is capable of making me giggle uncontrollably , which can be slightly funny in the coffee shop !
Reading this article and having an advanced techie for a husband , I wonder if Terry could learn to work with a voice activated computer and dictate his thoughts ?
Then he would not need to worry about typing .
I love his imagination and truly pray for more witchy books - more Tiffany Aching , and more Guards books .

Terry might try aerobic exercise in addition to walking since it increases blood flow and will help slow down its progression and improve memory .
Having been close to a colleague 's wife who succumbed to it over an extended period of time , it is worth the fight , and keeping abreast of new treatments .
Candace , New Jersey , US
My husband was diagnosed with early onset dementia at age 52 and , 5 years later , although his health is deteriorating , we still live a reasonably normal life .
Every day we get up we discuss what we are going to do with the day and concentrate on that .
We simply ignore what we can't do and plan ahead to give us both something to look forward to .
That allows us to stay as positive as you can with this illness .
We are also very fortunate that we have a superb consultant who literally leaves no stone unturned and took whatever steps were necessary to ensure that my husband has access to all the drugs currently available .
That is no mean feat in today 's NHS .
The big drawback for us is that there is virtually no support by way of respite , even for a few hours once a week , to allow me some much needed " me time " .
That would be of immeasurable help for both of us as it would also enable my husband to have some variety of life away from me .
A combination of this lack of respite and no proper drug treatment however would make an already bleak outlook completely desolate .
We owe it to the increasing numbers of people who have this desperate illness to do everything we are capable of to help in every possible way .
Phredd , South Yorkshire Pratchett is a brilliant writer who uses his humour and well - developed sense of morality to tell wonderful stories .
I should hope he uses these talents to help publicise the continuing requirement for stem cell research funding .
This research offers by far the best hope to find cures for degenerative brain illnesses like Alzheimer's .
Huw Evans , Brighton
It 's critical for well - known people like Mr. Pratchett to publicly speak out in as many forms as possible about such afflictions .
By doing so he is providing the best - palliative medicine to individuals and their caretakers with the dreaded A - disease .
Simply , invaluable service that money can't buy .

Mark Guardado - Hells Angels Leader Shot Dead
, the president of Hells Angels of San Francisco , was shot and killed outside a bar Tuesday night after a brawl .
Mark " Papa " Guardado , 45 , was found with gunshot wounds around 10:30 p.m. about a mile from the group 's clubhouse .
He was transported to San Francisco General Hospital where he died a short time later .
According to witnesses Guardado and the gunman struggled before the shooting and the suspect fled on a motorcycle .
The murder is under investigation and suspicion has already been cast on rival motorcycle club , the Mongols , who have long feuded with Hells Angels .
At the street corner where Guardado was shot , a makeshift memorial written in large , black letters reads , " RIP Papa Frisco . "
" His friends loved him , " Guardado ’s lawyer , Patrick Ciocca , told the Chronicle .
" He really was an all - around good guy .
There are hundreds , if not thousands , of people who are going to miss him dearly . "
The San Francisco chapter is one of the oldest Hells Angels branches in the country .
The Boston Globe has assembled a beautiful gallery of images of the Sun .
This LASCO C2 image , taken 8 January 2002 , shows a widely spreading coronal mass ejection ( CME ) as it blasts more than a billion tons of matter out into space at millions of kilometers per hour .
The C2 image was turned 90 degrees so that the blast seems to be pointing down .

We keep sending missions to Mars with the key objective to search for past or present life .
But what if a huge impact early in the Red Planet ’s history hindered any future possibility for life to thrive ?
Recent studies into the Martian “ crustal dichotomy ” indicate the planet was struck by a very large object , possibly a massive asteroid .
Now researchers believe that this same impact may have scrubbed any chance for life on Mars , effectively making the planet sterile .
This asteroid may have penetrated the Martian crust so deep that it damaged the internal structure irreparably , preventing a strong magnetic field from enveloping the planet .
The lack of a Mars magnetosphere thereby ended any chance for a nurturing atmosphere …
Mars looks odd .
Early astronomers noticed it , and today ’s observatories see it every time they look at the red globe .
Mars has two faces .
One face ( the northern hemisphere ) is composed of barren plains and smooth sand dunes ; the other face ( the southern hemisphere ) is a chaotic , jagged terrain of mountains and valleys .
It would appear the crustal dichotomy formed after a massive impact early in the development of Mars , leaving the planet geologically scarred for eternity .
But say if this impact went beyond pure aesthetics ?
What if this planet - wide impact zone represents something a lot deeper ?
To understand what might have happened to Mars , we have to first look at the Earth .
Our planet has a powerful magnetic field that is generated near the core .
Molten iron convects , dragging free electrons with it , setting up a huge dynamo outputting the strong dipolar magnetic field .
As the magnetic field threads through the planet , it projects from the surface and reaches thousands of miles into space , forming a vast bubble .
This bubble is known as the magnetosphere , protecting us from the damaging solar wind and prevents our atmosphere from eroding into space .
Life thrives on this blue planet because Earth has a powerful magnetic solar wind defence .
Although Mars is smaller than Earth , scientists have often been at a loss to explain why there is no Martian magnetosphere .
But according to the growing armada of orbiting satellites , measurements suggest that Mars did have a global magnetic field in the past .
It has been the general consensus for some time that Mars ’ magnetic field disappeared when the smaller planet ’s interior cooled quickly and lost its ability to keep its inner iron in a convective state .
With no convection comes a loss of the dynamo effect and therefore the magnetic field ( and any magnetosphere ) is lost .
This is often cited as the reason why Mars does not have a thick atmosphere ; any atmospheric gases have been eroded into space by the solar wind .
However , there may be a better explanation as to why Mars lost its magnetism .
“ The evidence suggests that a giant impact early in the planet ’s history could have disrupted the molten core , changing the circulation and affecting the magnetic field , ” said Sabine Stanley , assistant professor of physics at the University of Toronto , one of the scientists involved in this research .
“ We know Mars had a magnetic field which disappeared about 4 billion years ago and that this happened around the same time that the crustal dichotomy appeared , which is a possible link to an asteroid impact . ”
During Mars ’ evolution before 4 billion years ago , things may have looked a lot more promising .
With a strong magnetic field , Mars had a thick atmosphere , protected from the ravages of the solar wind within its own magnetosphere .
But , in an instant , a huge asteroid impact could have changed the course of Martian history forever .
“ Mars once had a much thicker atmosphere along with standing water and a magnetic field , so it would have been a very different place to the dry barren planet we see today . ” – Monica Grady , professor of planetary and space sciences at the Open University .
Losing its magnetic field after the deep asteroid impact catastrophically damaged the internal workings of the planet , Mars quickly shed its atmosphere , thereby blocking its ability to sustain life in the 4 billion years since .
What a sad story …

Once upon a time I thought it would be “ good for me ” to learn denotational semantics .
It looked like people were doing cool things with it , it looked like languages that leaned on it heavily ( like ML ) were worth learning , so I got a couple of books and started reading .
A couple books later I was still as confused as ever .
And mad , too .
Even in an introductory text I got the sense that the authors were trying to make themselves look smart at their readers ’ expense .
A page into a new chapter and they ’d whip out a completely new symbol ( a crippled - looking M , or a Q doubled - over in agony ) , surround it with a constellation of superscripts and italic subscripts , then incant “… it is therefore obvious that … ” and be off into the galactic void , sky - writing with half of the goddamn Greek and Egyptian alphabets .
I felt stuck in mud , dumb as a sack of bricks , and seriously doubting that giving the authors unsupervised access to TeX had been a good idea .
I can see myself in a course using that book as a text . . . well , no I can ’t .
I ’d wind up in a corner muttering about wacko square - brackets with candy - striped uprights and the semantics of lambda - something - or - other under zeta - prime reduction .
I think my head is built wrong when it comes to mathematical notation .
I see a gaggle of heiroglyphs in close formation and I have to think hard about operator precedence and how the particles in the statements need to be parsed , and in what order .
Vanilla math , no problem .
Calculus , I have to think about the ‘ dx ’ stuff .
Denotational semantics , well , I nearly threw one book across the room when the author started using undefined operators from out of the blue ; no definition , nothing to help me understand the particular rabbits on that page .
Okay , professor , I hereby declare ( goofy squiggle ) to mean “ my prof is a poopy head , x dx , ” put that in your theorem prover and smoke it .
But you ’ll never figure out what ( goofy squiggle ) really means , because I wo n’t define it anywhere .
It seems only fair that way .
Is this how academic feuds start ?
So I went back to writing tools and operating systems , an ignorant man , a person upon whom attempts at enlightenment had been squandered , but a happier one .
Reader @guy_fraser would like to remind us :
*MICROSOFT confirm end to IE6 pain !*
Internet Explorer 6 has official “ End of Life ” from Microsoft on 13 - Jul - 2010 – see this page on their website : http://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifesupsps/#Internet_Explorer.
After this date , Microsoft will treat the browser as ‘ dead and buried ’ , they will not provide any support whatsoever , including security updates ( this is a great way to explain to customers why they need to rid their networks of IE6 ) .
Good news , eh ?
Now we just need to spread the word and make sure all developers actively inhibit IE6 support after that date ( sooner would be better ) .
Please post this fact and link to M$ site on your home page to make everyone very aware that IE6 is finally going to die !
You ’ll note the browser has already been EOL on several platforms / SPs 🙂 As with any EOL product , developers / designers can ( and should / must ! ) easily charge extra 200 % or more for working with EOL software as there is no vendor support to back them up ( not that there ever was ) .
As a follow - up to “ The Missing Link “ , I ’ve written a fairly lengthy document that presents a number of alternatives for creating a more flexible and robust linking mechanism .
The important core of the piece comes first , identifying a generic problem and covering some pros and cons of various ways to address the problem .
After that comes a much longer section which presents reasons to add linkability to various elements in the HTML5 specification .
I did not consider WebForms elements , but instead the list of 91 elements found in the primary list in Simon Pieters ’ excellent HTML5 Elements and Attributes guide .
The important thing in that long list is not the exact mechanism I propose , but that I was able to find use cases for 30 HTML5 elements .
Each one is described briefly and accompanied by one or two markup examples .
Another 18 ( listed at the end of the document ) seemed initially to be good candidates , but I failed to find reasonable use cases for them .
The remaining 43 elements were n’t even considered , since they all seemed to be obviously poor choices .
One example is video , which would likely suffer if it were a hyperlink– resolving what to do when a user clicks on the video controls was completely unclear to me .
Now , as to why I ’m blogging this instead of taking it to one or another of the relevant mailing lists : I ’m looking for community input in order to strengthen the document .
Did I miss any alternative solutions in that first section ?
Are there more pros and cons for the various alternatives ?
What use cases did I miss in that last list of 18 ; or , for that matter , what are some strong use cases for the list of 30 that I did n’t include ?
Are there any elements among the 43 I omitted that do , in fact , have strong use cases for being linkable ?
I ’ll do my best to keep up with comments .
Have at it , folks !
Update 11 Jun 08 : I ’ve updated the document to incorporate ideas from commenters , and added a few extra bits of information at the end of the document .
It ’s worth another look , especially since I ’ve gotten some semi-official encouragement to submit the proposal to the HTML Working Group .

Regnery ’s latest book ( by its own executive editor , no less ) is all about how the Confederacy was Teh Awesome and totally misunderstood :
The politically correct history that dominates our schools and universities today insists that Jefferson Davis was another Hitler , Robert E. Lee was the equivalent of Rommel , and the Confederate States of America was our own little version of the Third Reich — a blot on American history .
But reality , as always , was different : the Old South , as H. W. Crocker III explains in The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Civil War , had immense charm , grace and merit — and a very strong Constitutional case .
This book is a joyful myth - busting rebel yell that shatters today ’s Leftist and demeaning stereotypes about the South and the Civil War — and shows why , in the words of G. K. Chesterton , “ America and the whole world is crying out for the spirit of the Old South .
(…)
This is the Politically Incorrect Guide that every Civil War buff and Southern partisan — and everyone who is tired of liberal self - hatred that vilifies America ’s greatest heroes — will have to have on his bookshelf , in his classroom , and under his Christmas tree .

In the MSNBC video here , Bush 41 unabashedly wears a ball cap with an owl , the mascot of the Bohemian Grove Club .
After the video loads , scrub to 2 minutes , 20 seconds to see George ’s hat .
The initiation ceremony totem animal of Bohemian Grove is the owl , which figures prominently in occult symbolism as the fusion of “ wisdom ” and nature .
So important is the occultic owl to our rulers , it long ago found a place on our fiat currency ( see this illustration ) .
Bush , of course , is a fixture at Bohemian Grove , although the vast majority of the people are ignorant of this fact .
And maybe that ’s why George is rubbing this in our faces , as the elite are wont to do , even on national television .

Overview
Fallout 3 is the third game in the Fallout series and the first to feature a first person perspective .
Developed and published by Bethesda Softworks , it was released on October 28 , 2008 on the PC , Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 ; the game takes place approximately thirty years after the events in Fallout 2 .
Although set in the same universe , Fallout 3 takes place in the Capital Wasteland in and around the Washington D.C. area , rather than California .
The game blends design elements and approaches from both the Fallout and Elder Scrolls franchises , resulting in fan debate about Fallout 3's legitimacy as a " real " Fallout game .
Like Oblivion , enemies and items spawn relative to the player 's current level .
This keeps the difficulty of the game consistent , along with opening the majority of the game up to the player from the beginning .
This is a change from the previous Fallout games , which featured zones that posed a huge risk to a low - level character if visited too early by the player .
However , the system is markedly different from that of Oblivion in that , once an area is discovered , the environment is locked down to the level at which the player found it , preventing unrealistic jumps in enemy levels over the course of the game .
Bethesda supported the game post - release with a number of downloadable content packs .
Most of the pieces took place outside of the Wasteland .
The downloadable content was initially exclusive to the Xbox 360 and PC versions of the game , but was later released on the PlayStation 3 .
Gameplay
Vault - Tec Assisted Targeting System ( V.A.T.S. )
V.A.T.S. in action
In addition to the real - time first person action , Fallout 3 introduced a feature called V.A.T.S. ( Vault - Tec Assisted Targeting System ) which pauses the game and allows the character to queue attacks on specific enemy body parts while calculating the odds of each shot hitting the target .
The percentage chance of a hit and the damage done by each queued attack depend on several factors including player level , distance from target , perks obtained and skills , and weapon used .
Each shot queued in V.A.T.S. requires a certain number of action points ( AP ) depending on weapon power ; expending slightly less than a quarter with a single shot with some pistols , while expending them all with weapons such as the Fat Man .
After use , the AP must then regenerate in real - time .
However , continued combat in real - time while they are regenerating will cause them to fill up slower .
Players can also take Jet , a Chem that briefly increases the amount of AP available to their character .
Health & Item Degradation
Shoot their legs to slow them down
When taking damage , the player 's general health or limb health may be affected .
General health meaning , of course , the life bar that shrinks as they take damage .
However , Fallout 3 also has a specific limb system in place that can affect several things .
Each limb has its own health bar , and when a player takes damage to that limb , it may become crippled .
A crippled limb will affect certain things depending on which limb it is .
For example , if the player has a crippled leg , they will walk much slower .
If one of their arms is crippled , their accuracy will suffer .
If the head gets crippled , the perception ( ability to see enemies on the compass / radar ) will decrease .
The crippled system means that shooting for the head in V.A.T.S. may not always be the best idea .
An example of this would be for Deathclaws .
Deathclaws are extremely fast and strong opponents , so shooting and crippling their legs will prevent them from getting close .
Stimpaks can be applied to individual limbs ( rather than used to heal general health ) to fix them .
Radiation is also common in Fallout 3 .
Food and untreated water will give the player small amounts of radiation when they are consumed .
There are also areas throughout the game that may be contaminated , such as nasty radiation pools , that will affect the player .
The effects of radiation exposure are cumulative , and after being exposed beyond certain thresholds of tolerance , the player will get different levels of radiation sickness .
The sicknesses will affect the players stats , or can kill the player if it 's untreated and builds to extreme levels , although certain perks mitigate the penalties or even provide benefits through mutation such as repairing broken limbs when suffering from advanced radiation poisoning .
Radiation levels can be reduced or brought back to zero by using certain medicines or getting treated by a doctor or home medical station .
Another very important aspect of the game is item degradation .
Equipped armor and weapons will become damaged over time .
The condition is represented by a bar .
As an item becomes more and more damaged , it becomes less effective .
Weapons lose damage and jam , and armor loses damage resistance .
Items can be repaired by using parts of another item that is the same ( for example , an assault rifle can be repaired by using parts of another assault rifle ) or by paying certain people to do it .
The repair skill dictates how much the player can repair their equipment ( up to a certain percentage of full condition ) .
Just like real life , take it easy with the Chems
Throughout their travels , players will encounter Chems ( also known as drugs in the real world ) that can be used to affect their performance .
There are several different kinds , and if used too much , the player may become addicted .
This leads to negative withdrawal symptoms if they do n't take some of the drugs they are addicted to at regular intervals .
The player can also become addicted to alcohol , and addictions can be cured by a doctor .
Weapons
The main character will begin by finding a standard array of basic weapons , like pistols , knives , and assault rifles .
As the game progresses , however , players will find many unique weapons like the Alien Blaster , Lincoln 's Repeater , and Mesmetron .
These exotic weapons keep in tone with the 1950 's sci- fi theme present in the Fallout universe .
Weapon Types
Big Guns : Encompasses heavy weapons like miniguns , missile launchers , and the Fat Man mini nuke launcher .
Big Guns are the heaviest weapons in the game and the most expensive to keep stocked with ammunition .

Energy Weapons : Includes both Plasma and Laser weapon types .
These weapons are powerful and more accurate than Small Guns , but rarer too .

Throwables : Everything that can be thrown , namely grenades and mines .
V.A.T.S. can be used with throwables .
Interaction
Fallout 3 features an extensive dialogue system in which players can interact with almost every NPC in the game .
Players are presented with multiple lines of speech to choose from , and the person they are talking to will react accordingly to the one they choose .
Most dialogue options will have a " good " line and a " bad " line .
Through interactions , players can pick up quests and gain information .
They also have the potential to talk themselves out of certain situations .
Occasionally , players are presented with a Speech challenge , represented by a dialog option marked " Speech " with a percentage next to it .
The percentage represents the player 's chance of success , based on their current Speech level .
If they succeed , the player can often gain information about whatever they are talking about .
If they fail , they will get nothing from it .
Passing a Speech challenge also awards the player with experience points .
Random Encounters
While exploring the Wasteland , the player may experience a random event / encounter .
Below is an incomplete list of the possible random occurrences in the game .
A Wastelander being attacked by a creature ( such as a mole rat ) .
A Wastelander running up pleading for help after Raiders strapped explosives to their chest .
The player may encounter Uncle Leo , who is one of two friendly Super Mutants in the game .
A Wastelander in possession of the Wasteland Survival Guide may provide the player with criticism based on how they completed the objectives .
Based on their Karma level , the player may be attacked by a squad of Regulators ( Evil Karma ) or Talon Company Mercs ( Good Karma ) from time to time .
A UFO may suddenly explode overhead , dropping the very powerful Firelance ( unique Alien Blaster ) and some ammo for it .
The player may encounter Donovan , a member of Reiley 's Rangers , battling Super Mutants near Girdershade .
Lockpicking and Hacking
Lockpicking and hacking are two ways of accessing areas , containers , information , or functions that would otherwise be inaccessible .
Each is associated with a skill ( Lockpicking and Science ) , dictating whether the player can attempt each of the 5 difficulty levels of locks and terminals ( Very Easy , Easy , Average , Hard , and Very Hard ) .
The player can also attempt to force the lock .
The player can try to pick locks on many objects throughout the Wasteland , including doors , ammunition boxes , and safes .
Having at least one bobby pin is required to pick a lock .
Lockpicking Minigame
The game will pause and an image of the lock will appear along with a bobby pin and a screwdriver .
Using the left stick , the player can move the bobby pin around the keyhole .
With the right stick , the player applies torque to the bobby pin to try and open it .
If in the right spot , the lock will completely turn .
If in the wrong spot , the lock will stop and the controller will vibrate .
If one continues moving the bobby pin down in the same direction and the lock stops sooner , one is going the wrong way .
Hacking is less frequent than lockpicking and is a bit more difficult .
Computers that must be hacked can contain backstory or important quest - related info , or allow environment - related functions like unlocking doors or deactivating turrets .
Hacking Minigame
Hacking a terminal
When the player chooses an incorrect password , they 'll see a fraction on the screen like 2/9 correct .
This does not just mean that two of the letters are correct ; rather , two of the letters are in the correct position .
For example , suppose that the real password is FALLOUT .
The player chooses ROLLOUT , and is 5 / 7 correct , because LLOUT is in the same position in both words .
Conversely , if EFFECTS was chosen , it would be 0/7 correct , because while it shares letters with FALLOUT , none of the positions are the same .
Some groups of characters are inside square brackets or parentheses .
If the player clicks on these groups of characters , the terminal will either remove one incorrect password from the screen or it will replenish the amount of attempts .
By doing this , the player can sometimes narrow down the amount of choices to just one word , allowing them to unlock the computer within a minute .
Karma
The Karma system implemented in Fallout 3 rates the player 's actions throughout the game and portrays them as either a Good , Neutral , or Evil character depending on their choices .
For instance , stealing , killing innocents and generally being horrible will earn bad Karma resulting in an Evil character .
Karma Levels range from Very Evil to Very Good
Whereas good deeds , such as helping hobos and treating people well will result in positive Karma and a Good character .
A balance of these actions means the character will stay neutral .
Many quests have different outcomes , and the player can usually choose which of these to pursue .
The easiest way to do something often ends up with a lot of dead people and bad Karma , but the more skill based , reasonable or long winded methods usually have a reward of positive Karma .
Being a Good character leads to helpful items and such from Neutral or Good NPCs , and vice versa for evil characters .
The flip side to this is that evil or good characters will also run into heavily - armed hit groups with a contract for their head .
Also , the karma status of the player can determine what kind of followers they can acquire .
For example , Evil characters get Jericho and Clover , Good characters get Fawkes and Star Paladin Cross , and Neutral characters get Butch and Sergeant RL - 3 .
The player 's Karma is points based and starts at zero .
As the player performs Good and Evil actions they are evaluated and given the appropriate status :
Actions that alter Karma
Killing an Evil character or creature :
No gain or loss in Karma
Killing a very Evil character or creature : 100 Karma gain
Killing a good creature : - 50 Karma
Killing a good person : - 100 Karma
Stealing : - 5/item
Good act during a quest : 50
Evil act during a quest : - 50
Consuming a dead body : - 1 ( Perk needed )
Karma Classification
Based on the number of points , the Karma system classifies the player as :
Below - 750 : Very Evil
- 750 to - 250 : Evil
- 250 to 250 : Neutral
250 to 750 : Good
Above 750 : Very Good
Furthermore , the Vault Dweller will be given a title based on their karma and current level , with Neutral , Evil and Good Karma titles unique for each level .
There are 30 different Karma levels in Fallout 3 .
S.P.E.C.I.A.L. System
The SPECIAL system used in Fallout 3 is similar to that found in previous Fallout games .
It is a set of seven attributes that govern each of the game 's skills , as well as certain character stats .
They are first encountered during early childhood , when the player finds a picture book called " You 're SPECIAL " and assigns points to the SPECIAL attributes .
Each one starts at a level of 5 , and at this moment the player is asked to split up a further 5 total points between the skills .
There is little use in leveling one attribute up to 10 , because then it cannot be improved later in the game .
SPECIAL can't exceed 10 or drop lower than 1 , so if they reach these caps even if an item is equipped or a chem or foodstuff consumed that could add a point to one of them , there will be no change .
SPECIAL stands for :
Strength
Affects : Melee Weapons , Carry Weight , Melee damage bonus
Affects : Melee Weapons , Carry Weight , Melee damage bonus Perception

All skills , Critical chance , Accuracy , random encounters
Skills
Skills dictate the player character 's effectiveness in specific elements of gameplay .
They are affected by the player 's SPECIAL stats , as well as certain equipment , perks , and temporary effects .
The player is asked to " tag " three skills at the beginning of the game , which grants a bonus of fifteen points to each .
While Fallout 1 and 2 both had 18 skills in total , Fallout 3 reduces the number to 13 , partly by merging similar skills - Doctor and First Aid are replaced by a general Medicine skill , for instance , and disarming traps is governed by Explosives or Repair , rather than a dedicated Traps skill .
The Gambling and Outdoorsman skills are not carried forward in any form .
A Vault Boy bobblehead for each skill can be found hidden somewhere in the game world , adding 10 points to that skill when used .
Skill Description Barter Affects prices when trading with merchants .
Big Guns Affects damage done with Big Guns ( Fat Man , Flamer , Minigun , etc. ) Energy Weapons Affects damage done with Energy Weapons ( Laser Pistol , Laser Rifle , Plasma Rifle , etc. ) Explosives Affects explosives damage ( Frag grenades , plasma grenades , landmines , etc. ) as well as the ability of handling explosive traps .
Lockpick Affects which level of locks can be picked ( easy , average , hard ) .
Chance for a successful " force lock " attempt .
Medicine Affects hit points restored by Stimpaks , Effectiveness of Rad-X and RadAway .
Melee Weapons
Affects damage done with Melee Weapons ( Knife , Baseball bat , Sledgehammer , etc. ) .
Repair Affects ability to repair items .
Science Affects which level of terminals can be hacked , various dialogue options .
Small Guns Affects damage done with Small Guns ( 10 mm Pistol , Hunting Rifle , Assault Rifle , etc. ) .
Sneak Affects how difficult it is for enemies to detect the Vault Dweller .
Speech Affects the ability to win speech checks .
Unarmed Affects damage done while unarmed .
Perks
" Perks " Menu Screen
Fallout 3's perks are gained every level rather than every three like the old games ( hence the original Fallout 's level cap of 21 the nearest multiple of three to 20 ) .
Since the Traits system has been removed which gave both positive and negative effects to the player , some of them were incorporated in to the available perks .
There are about 58 perks total in the original release of Fallout 3 .
Most of the perks range from simple skill increases like Gun Nut ( which increases small guns and repair by 5 ) , but there are other unique perks that range from things like Lead Belly ( 50 % less radiation from radiated water sources ) , to Lawbringer ( Enemies ' ears are lootable and can be turned in for karma ) .
Also , each perk has it's own set of requirements of either skill , SPECIAL stats , or both .
There are also exclusive , and missable , quest perks that can only be obtained by completing quests .
An example would be the Power Armor Training perk that has be to obtained to allow the use of Power Armor .

Story
A conversation with Dad in Vault 101
Fallout 3 begins with the birth of the player character , where character gender , name , and appearance can all be customized .
Followed shortly after by the death of the character 's mother , who dies in childbirth due to cardiac arrest , the story then jumps ahead to when the character begins walking .
This is the first introduction to the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system , allowing for further character customization .
Shortly after , the player enters their 10th birthday party , where they receive their Pip - Boy .
Following a few altercations , the player reaches age 16 and takes the G.O.A.T. exam , determining their skills .
Another advance occurs , and the player is awoken by Amata , who informs the character that their father , James , has left the vault without warning and under mysterious circumstances .
This desertion attracts the ire of The Overseer , who attempts to apprehend the player character for questioning through his security force .
The player fights their way to the father 's lab , where they find the body of Jonas .
In that lab , the player receives a message from their father , explaining that he had to leave and they should not follow .
After persevering further through the vault , the player encounters Amata being questioned ( or tortured ) by her father .
After securing her escape , the player learns of a secret exit through the Overseer 's office , and fights their way to the exit .
After leaving the vault , they venture out into an utterly destroyed Washington DC , though the wasteland is far from lifeless .
Three Dog has info about James , but wants a favor in return
The first town the Lone Wanderer runs across is the town of Megaton , a gated community built in a crater around an unexploded atomic bomb .
It is here that the player is given the choice to either disarm the undetonated bomb for their father 's whereabouts from Lucas Simms , or pay off Colin Moriarty .
Eventually , they learn that James ventured into the ruins of Washington DC , searching for a radio station , called Galaxy News Radio , located within .
Following a perilous journey into the city , the player has their first encounter with a large contingent of the Brotherhood of Steel along with one of the leaders of the Brotherhood of Steel , Sarah Lyons .
A large push occurs to reach the radio station , fighting through waves of Super Mutants , eventually resulting in an encounter with a Behemoth .
Following their entry to the radio station , the player is introduced to the man that runs Galaxy News Radio , Three Dog .
In return for information Three Dog has about James , the player must travel to the Museum of Technology within the DC ruins , in search of a new relay dish capable of broadcasting Galaxy News Radio across the Capital Wasteland .
After mounting this new dish on the Washington Monument , the player returns to Three Dog , who recalls that James had come to ask about Rivet City , a settlement built in an old aircraft carrier .
The Lone Wanderer sets off again , follows in James ' footsteps .
One of the game 's more surreal interludes
After a thorough security check to gain entry to Rivet City , the Wanderer is referred to an old acquaintance of James , one Dr. Li , who reveals exactly what their father 's goals were .
The player learns that their father left the Vault in order to complete a project from before the Lone Wanderer was born , a water purifier that would supply clean water for all living things , called Project Purity .
She tells the Lone Wanderer of the former lab that housed Project Purity and that their father might have gone there .
The Lone Wanderer visits the Jefferson Memorial and finds out through a series of audio notes that their father went to Vault 112 in search of a G.E.C.K. , which was the last component needed to cause Project Purity to complete it 's function .
The Wanderer themselves then travels to Vault 112 , where they are greeted by a Robobrain ushering them into a stasis chamber , only to discover that the residents , along with James , are all trapped within these chambers .
All of the residents existed within a simulation , with Stanislaus Braun , disguised as a young girl , pulling the strings .
The player is forced to either end the simulation , killing everyone inside , or comply with Braun 's twisted desires and go on a murder spree .
Following this , when the player is allowed to leave the simulation , they learn that James was trapped inside the simulation as well , disguised as a dog , watching all of the player 's actions .
Regardless of choice , the Wanderer and James escape Vault 112 and make their way back to Rivet City .
James convinces Dr. Li to accompany the Wanderer and him , along with her team back to the Jefferson Memorial to restart Project Purity .
Once inside , the entire team beings work to restore Project Purity to it 's former glory , and the Wanderer and James enjoy their short reunion .
Unfortunately , shortly after the team begins their repair , the Enclave comes to the Jefferson Memorial and tries to take over the project for their own purposes .
During the confrontation , James and Colonel Autumn are locked inside the main chamber in a standoff for control .
Eventually , James sacrifices himself and kills several Enclave soldiers ( including , apparently , Col. Autumn ) by flooding the testing chamber with lethal amounts of radiation .
Enclave troops are just bad news for everyone
After the sacrifice , the Lone Wanderer escapes the lab with Dr. Li and some of hear team through some underground tunnels and eventually ends up in the Citadel , the East Coast headquarters of the Brotherhood of Steel .
After recovering and a short respite , Dr. Li pleads Elder Lyons to aid the Wanderer to finish Project Purity by finding a G.E.C.K. and take Project Purity back from the Enclave .
Following a discussion with Scribe Rothchild , the player learns that they must travel through the Little Lamplight Caverns to reach Vault 87 , which is believed to contain a G.E.C.K .
The Lone Wanderer eventually reaches Little Lamplight , but is stopped by Mayor MacCready , who will only allow entry to the player , ( barring excellent speech skill or the Child at Heart Perk ) if they can rescue some children who were captured by slavers .
Following the breakout from Paradise Falls , the Wanderer gains entry to Little Lamplight and eventually enters Vault 87 .
It is here that they learn that Vault 87 was used to create and test the F.E.V. ( Forced Evolutionary Virus ) and is the breeding source of the Super Mutants in Washington DC .
Following the discovery and aid in extradition of Fawkes , the Lone Wanderer acquires the G.E.C.K .
After parting ways with Fawkes while leaving the vault , the Lone Wanderer is ambushed by the Enclave , who knock him out and bring them to their headquarters in Raven Rock , commandeering the G.E.C.K. for themselves .
Awakening in their cell in Raven Rock , the Lone Wanderer is briefly interrogated by the revived Colonel Autumn , before being interrupted by President John Henry Eden , who allows the Lone Wanderer access to his control room .
As the Lone Wanderer makes their way to the control room , Colonel Autumn goes against President Eden 's orders and commands the Enclave soldiers to intercept the player .
The Wanderer fights their way to the control room , and discovers that the President is actually a supercomputer who was given control of the United States .
In the event of an end of the world scenario , President Eden was enacted to continue running the government sectors .
The President and the Wanderer have a lengthy conversation , with Eden eventually imploring the player to feed a modified F.E.V. into Project Purity .
This strain would kill anything with mutations that drinks from the purified water , allowing the Enclave to begin a new , mutation free society .
Unfortunately , this would also kill most of the allies the Wanderer has encountered , weighing the decision heavily .
If the Wanderer had the skill , ( or the override code stolen from Col. Autumn ) they can in fact destroy Raven Rock , crippling the Enclave forces immensely .
After the Lone Wanderer escapes Raven Rock , they are reunited with Fawkes , who aid in their return to the Citadel .
The Brotherhood of Steel is preparing an all out assault on the Jefferson Memorial , planning to strike while the Enclave is off balance .
Fortuitously , along to help the assault is Liberty Prime , who had regained function through the use of Dr. Li's research .
Sarah Lyons invites the player to join Lyons ' Pride , and the assault begins .
With the aid of Liberty Prime in removing barriers , and the assault force of the Brotherhood , eventually the alliance is able to decimate the Enclave defenders which allows the Lone Wanderer to enter the control room .
It is there the Wanderer and Lyons ' Pride confront Colonel Autumn , who could be forced to stand down either through violence or persuasion .
Following the confrontation , the player is then informed by Dr. Li through the intercom that Project Purity has been damaged in the attack will overload if someone does n't activate it .
Unfortunately , the chamber must be sealed with the start - up sequence begins , and the one who activates it will be bathed in lethal doses of radiation .
Before entering the chamber , the player is faced with the choice of injecting the modified F.E.V. into Project Purity effectively killing everyone , or allowing mutants and wastelanders to continue to exist .
The Lone Wanderer will then have the choice to activate Project Purity , tell Sarah Lyons she must activate it , or do nothing and allow it to be destroyed .
The regular game ends on that decision and continues with a epilogue that varies based on the Lone Wanderer 's karma throughout the game , along with the decisions they made throughout the main and side missions .
The game would continue if the Broken Steel DLC pack was downloaded .
Factions
There are numerous factions present in the Capital Wasteland , both hostile and friendly .
Brotherhood of Steel - Situated in the ruins of the Pentagon ( now called the Citadel ) , they are on the East
Coast to battle the Super Mutant threat in the DC area .
The player sides with the Brotherhood of Steel in the game to battle the Enclave .
Key Members :
Enclave -
The remnants of the United States government , the Enclave is more of a corrupt military force than
anything .
They eventually become the primary antagonists of the game .
They operate from within Raven Rock , located in the upper left hand portion of the map , and the force is lead by Colonel Autumn and President John Henry Eden .
Key Members :
Raiders -
This faction consists of bandits that are not under the rule of a known leader .
They are somewhat disorganized , as evident by the scattered groups that pillage , kidnap , murder , and steal their way through the Capital Wasteland at will .
Super Mutants -
The terrifying group of mutated humans that were transformed into hulking beasts through modification via FEV .
All of them are immediately hostile towards the player except for two .
One of the friendly Super Mutants , Uncle Leo , is encountered via a random event and the other is Fawkes , one of the most powerful companions in the game .

Downloadable Content
Bethesda has currently announced 5 downloadable packs for PC , Xbox 360 , and PlayStation 3 .
Each are said to be roughly the same size as the Knights of the Nine pack that was made available for The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion .
Originally these content packs were available exclusively for PC and Xbox 360 but on May 19 , 2009 , Bethesda announced that all of the downloadable content will be made available for the PlayStation 3 during the Summer of 2009 .
Bethesda has also announced that the DLC will be available at retail stores on disc for the Xbox 360 and PC , and also in a Game of the Year edition .
Operation : Anchorage :
Chinese Base in Alaska
An add - on featuring a virtual simulation of the liberation of Anchorage , Alaska from the Chinese Communist invaders which is known as the Anchorage Reclamation and took place from 2067 to 2077 .
In the simulation , the player experiences the beginning of this operation , in which the first power armor units were used and U.S. forces ultimately drove out the Chinese presence .
In the virtual simulation the player will first have to secure a mountainside and then fight his / her way into a Chinese base .
The add - on mainly focuses on the combat / stealth paths and gives the player new tools to use .
The new tools include interactive Strike Teams that are placed under the player 's command .
The mission takes about four to five hours for the player to complete .
The add - on also contains new weapons , armor and achievements and a new perk called " Covert Ops . "
The new weapons and armor include top - secret technology used by both sides during the war , some of which the player can then use throughout the main game .
The player is able to access the simulation via a new quest and map marker .
It is accessible at any level , as soon as the player has left Vault 101 .
Operation : Anchorage was released on January 26 , 2009 at a cost of 800 Points ( $ 9.99 ) on the Xbox Marketplace .
It was released on the PSN on September 9 , 2009 .
The Pitt
Welcome to the Pitt
The add - on allows the player to journey to the ruins of Pittsburgh , raider - infested city known as The Pitt .
Unlike Washington D.C. , Pittsburgh was n't directly hit by bombs .
Instead , the large river that runs through the city became heavily irradiated and the place was left to rot and decay .
It does still harbor a working steel mill and a " fighting area " .
The add - on contains new quests ( several repeatable ) , enemies , items , perks and achievements .
The player will gain access to the Pitt when he / she encounters an escaped slave .
The player will first have to take on the role of a slave ( and give up all items ) to gain access , but once the quest is completed the player can return at any time .
New items in the Pitt include several new Raider Armors , a new stylized Power Armor , a new melee weapon called the AutoAxe , and a new silenced / scoped automatic rifle named " The Infiltrator " .
The vicious Auto - Axe
New perks include one that adds to the killing efficiency of the AutoAxe , one that is related to all of the high - dose radiation the player will encounter in the Pitt , and one that will be rewarded after completing a " Pitt fight " .
The pack includes four new achievements related to The Pitt .
Three are awarded after completing different stages of the main quest and a fourth one is awarded after the player finds all of the ‘ Steel Ingots ’ found throughout the area .
The Pitt was released on March 24 , 2009 for 800 MS Points ( $ 9.99 ) on Xbox Marketplace .
It was released on the PSN September 30 , 2009 .
Broken Steel
Broken Steel starts off with the player replaying the ending and surviving the incident whichever way they chose to end it , and if they start a new game with Broken Steel , it will simply state that their level cap has been lifted to 30 once they initially leave Vault 101 .
The player then starts working for the Brotherhood of Steel in various missions to remove the Enclave 's presence from the Capital Wasteland .
Liberty Prime
The add - on raised the level cap to 30 , added new story related locations , added more weapons and armor , such as a Tesla Cannon , a Tri-Beam Laser Rifle , and Hellfire armor , and more challenging enemies , such as the Super Mutant Overlord , a super mutant that is supposed to be the gap between the Super Mutant Master , and Super Mutant Behemoth .
These challenging enemies carry Gatling lasers and Tri-Beam Laser Rifles .
Other encounters have been added such as random raider attacks on the newly formed water caravans .
Broken Steel was released on May 5 , 2009 , for 800 Microsoft Points ( $ 9.99 ) on Xbox Marketplace .
It was released on the PSN September 23 , 2009 .
Point Lookout
Be prepared to kill some hillbilly mutants
Point Lookout is a large swampland area that features new terrain , enemies and weapons .
The content begins with taking a ferry from the the Capital Wasteland , across the Chesapeake Bay , and over to Maryland where Point Lookout is located .
Maryland was not hit directly by the nuclear attack like Washington DC , but was affected nonetheless .
The most noticeable effect the attacks had on Point Lookout were on its citizens , who are best described as fairly disfigured hillbillies .... although it is heavily implied , if not openly stated , that instead of being mutated by radiation , these particular miscreants are just inbred .
The majority of the combat in Point Lookout involves taking out its more than mildly warped citizens with a variety of shotguns .
Bethesda has reported that the content is more difficult than the previous DLC packages and recommends that players be at least level 17 before entering Point Lookout .
Point Lookout was released on June 23 , 2009 for 800 Microsoft Points ( $ 9.99 ) on Xbox Marketplace .
It was released on the PSN October 7 , 2009 .
Mothership Zeta
The aliens have returned , and they 're pissed .
Experience an alien abduction first hand .
The entire DLC will take place aboard the abducting alien ship , taking a major departure from the Capital Wasteland setting .
Upon receiving a strange signal , the Wanderer investigates and come upon a crashed alien ship ( which was originally an Easter egg in the Wasteland , but Bethesda fleshed this out to a full on expansion ) and are abducted .
Mothership Zeta was released on August 3rd , 2009 for Xbox 360 and PC for $ 9.99 .
It was released on the PSN on October 7 , 2009 .
The Garden of Eden Creation Kit ( GECK )
Named after a mythical device used to restore life to the wasteland that players are tasked with finding in Fallout 2 , the GECK is actually the official editor kit for the PC .
The program allows users to edit and create content for use within the game .
It was released on December 11 , 2008 as a free download from the Fallout 3 website .
As each month the DLC has come out , there has been a version of the G.E.C.K. to update to .
It is currently version 1.5 as of the release of Mothership Zeta DLC .

Development
Bethesda's Dev Team
Fallout 3 was originally being developed by Black Isle Studios and was codenamed Van Buren .
However , Black Isle Studios was suddenly closed down when their owner , Interplay Entertainment , went bankrupt .
Bethesda first announced it had acquired the rights to the Fallout series from Interplay in 2004 , although no information about Fallout 3 was released until 2007 , when a teaser video and concept art were released .
Bethesda purchased the license from struggling Interplay for just over $ 1 million and considered an upfront payment on future royalties .
Bethesda only got the rights to make single - player Fallout games , while Interplay retained the rights to develop a Fallout MMO .
Reactions to the acquisition in the gaming community were generally positive .
Bethesda , having achieved critical and financial success with Morrowind , and nearing the final stretch of development for the much hyped Oblivion , had become a well - respected developer in the RPG genre , establishing a considerable pedigree .
Controversy among Fallout fans abounded , however , when it became apparent that Fallout 3 was going to move away from its traditional top - down , isometric view from the original games .
Van Buren
Van Buren was the codename for Black Isle ’s version of Fallout 3 .
It was canceled in 2003 when Black Isle went out of business , although the game itself was nearing completion .
It would have had a multiplayer mode and a combat system where the player could wield two weapons .
A tech demo was created , but Bethesda will not be releasing it to the general public .
Inventory in the Van Buren Tech Demo
The story took place around the year 2250 and unfolded across Utah , Colorado , Arizona , and Nevada .
The player was going to find him or herself in prison for crimes that they were either innocent or guilty of .
One day they ’d wake up in a different cell than they had gone to sleep in .
Then an attack on the prison would rupture the walls and give the player ( and many others ) a chance to escape into the Wasteland .
Once free , the player would be besieged by robots and questions .
The villain was a man called Presper .
He was a mad scientist who planned on using remaining nuclear weapons to totally obliterate all the life on the planet , as he deemed it unworthy .
The attack on the prison was one step in that plan .
The prisoners were all marked as contaminated with a virus similar to FEV called Limit 115 .
When a large majority of prisoners were returned to the Quarantine Zone ( otherwise known as the prison ) a Super AI called Ulysses that controlled it would scan and purge the world 's contaminated zones to prevent further contagion .
The problem was that so much of the world was tainted it would result in a new and more devastating nuclear strike than what had come before .
Presper was counting on this and those he deemed Pure would survive on in his Boulder Dome until a time he decided the Earth was safe for resettlement .
At that point they ’d ascend to the surface and start again .
The player 's mission was to uncover his plot and stop it .
Ultimately , though , the player would at least partially fail .
In the critical moments some nukes would launch and it was up to the player to decide exactly what got hit and what did n't .
In the Fallout continuity , all the events of Van Buren are considered non-canon .
Rating Controversy
On July 4 , 2008 , Fallout 3 was refused classification by the OFLC in Australia , thus making the game illegal for sale in the country .
In order for the game to be reclassified , the offending content in the Australian version of the game would have to be removed by Bethesda Softworks and the game resubmitted to the OFLC .
According the OFLC board report , the game was refused classification due to the " realistic visual representations of drugs and their delivery method ( bringing ) the ' science - fiction ' drugs in line with ' real - world ' drugs .
However , just a month later , Australian retailer Gamechip started taking pre-orders for a drug - free version of the game .
It now looks like the
And with all the heads exploding , you can see why .
game has been modified for release instead of outright banned though nothing is official .
Australia is no stranger to banning games , in 2008 Dark Sector , Shellshock 2 : Blood Trials and Fallout 3 were banned .
In August of 2008 , however , the Australian Office of Film and Literature Classification ( OFLC ) granted a rating of MA15 after changes were made to in - game drug references , particularly the renaming of morphine to " Med - X . "
In their report on the revised edition of the game , the OFLC found that " The drug references within this revised version are justified by context and lend a strong playing impact to the game . "
The report also notes that drugs in the game are now " depicted as stylized icons on a menu with the drug use itself not depicted . "
Original ruling
The original ruling by the OFLC 's stated that " the game contains the option to take a variety of drugs known as " chems " using a device which is connected to the character 's arm .
These " chems " have positive and some negative effects ( lowering of intelligence , or the character may become addicted to the chem ) .
The positive effects include increase in strength , stamina , resistance to damage , agility , and hit points .
Corresponding with the list of various " chems " are small visual representations of the drugs ; these include syringes , tablets , pill bottles , a crack - type pipe , and blister packs .
In the Board 's view , these realistic visual representation of drugs and their delivery method bring the ' science - fiction ' drugs in line with ' real - world ' drugs .
The player can also select and use Morphine ( a prescribed drug ) which has the positive effect of enabling the character to ignore limb pain when the character 's extremities are targeted by the enemy . "
Further Controversy
Japan
Some changes were made to the Japanese version of Fallout 3 .
In terms of content , the biggest change was the elimination of the " Power of the Atom " side - quest , where players had the option to detonate the unexploded nuclear bomb , thereby destroying the town of Megaton .
The quest - giver - Mr. Burke - was also removed from this version .
Another major change renames the " Fat Man " mini - nuke launcher .
Other small changes include the renaming of creatures , as well as a reduction in the amount of blood and corpses found in the game .
Another mini-controversy caused by the game appeared at Game Developers Conference in San Francisco , where the game 's developer Emil Pagliarulo asked the audience what landmarks in Japan could be destroyed for the game .
India
Microsoft India canceled its plans to release Fallout 3 for the Xbox 360 in India , which was earlier set to release in the country on October 28 2008 .
A press statement issued by Microsoft states that the game included certain content that could potentially hurt Indian sensibilities .
Due to distribution issues in the region , Microsoft had taken up the role of distributor for Fallout 3 in India , while the PlayStation 3 and PC versions of the game were never scheduled for release in the country .

A man who decapitated his girlfriend and paraded the head around a village on the Greek island of Santorini is now fighting for his life in hospital .
Athanassios Arvanitis , a 31 - year - old chef , was shot five times by police before his arrest .
He has wounds to his lungs and is in intensive care .
The authorities believe the deadly rampage was triggered by his dismissal as a chef in a hotel .
Three women injured during the police chase are said to be out of danger .
The trail of violence began when the man used a butcher 's knife to decapitate his girlfriend 's dog on the balcony of their home in the village of Vourvoulos , near Santorini 's main town Fira .
Next , Mr Arvanitis allegedly killed his girlfriend , a 25 - year - old teacher called Adamantia Karkali , by stabbing her in the armpit .
He then cut her head off and began parading it around the streets .
During a dramatic chase , Mr Arvanitis tried and failed to behead a policeman .
He was then shot five times and arrested .
Doctors at Santorini 's medical centre say that despite his injuries they found it almost impossible to restrain him .
Two women doctors knocked from their motorbike by Mr Arvanitis as he tried to get away in a police jeep are said to be out of danger , as is a Greek woman tourist who was hit by a ricocheting bullet as she watched the sunset .
People living in Santorini say they have not witnessed such savagery on this iconically beautiful island since the Germans carried out executions during the World War II occupation .

WASHINGTON , DC — ( TYDN )
Carrying placards reading " COVID - 19 out of my uterus , " and " Coronavirus not in my backyard , " tens of millions of people across the nation took to the streets Tuesday to protest the spread of the virus .
The rallies were the biggest the nation has seen following the largest - ever rally protesting the $ 2 increase per month for Netflix memberships .
Meantime , the main theme behind latest march , which drew record - sized crowds in many big cities across the nation , was that Americans were tired of being bullied around by the novel coronavirus .

Similar stories were told at other rally hotspots as well .
" My housecleaners and gardeners wo n't even come over right now .

Palin ’s lawyer is at it again …
Remember him ?
Thomas Van Flein ?
Last time I wrote about him , I talked about my irresistable urge to pronounce his name with an accent .
It ’s such a good villain name .
Well now , not only am I typing his name with an accent , but in light of his new shenanigans , I ’ll add a thin twirly moustache .
So what have you been up to now … .
Van Fleinnn ??
After his last attempt to derail the ethics investigation into Palin ’s firing of Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan falied , he ’s trying again .
This time , instead of Senator Hollis French , he ’s going after retired prosecutor turned special investigator Stephen Branchflower .
“ Steve Branchflower is a highly respected prosecutor and public servant , ” said Sen. Hollis French , D - Anchorage .
“ If there were wrongs committed , he will find them .
If there were not , he has the professional experience and good judgment to say so . ”
Apparently Mr. Van Flein has another opinion .
He says that both Hollis French , and Stephen Branchflower are friends of Walt Monegan , but did n’t say upon what he was basing that statement .
He also requested copies of all emails having to do with the hiring of Branchflower , and emails among the legislative council to Branchflower and French .
In July , Palin said she did nothing wrong and that she welcomed an investigation .
Now , after becoming McCain ’s running - mate , and with the outcome of the investigation set to come on October 31 , just 5 days before election day , any roadblock will do .
No more welcome wagon .
So far , the Legislature has successfully dodged attempts to delay the investigation .
Will they be able to fend off Van Flein ’s latest diabolical scheme ?
Stay tuned .
The Federal Reserve and the Treasury attempted to identify private - sector approaches to avoid the imminent failures of A.I.G. and Lehman Brothers , but none was forthcoming .
In the case of A.I.G. , the Federal Reserve , with the support of the Treasury , provided an emergency credit line to facilitate an orderly resolution .
The Federal Reserve took this action because it judged that , in light of the prevailing market conditions and the size and composition of A.I.G. ’s obligations , a disorderly failure of A.I.G. would have severely threatened global financial stability and , consequently , the performance of the U.S. economy .
To mitigate concerns that this action would exacerbate moral hazard and encourage inappropriate risk - taking in the future , the Federal Reserve ensured that the terms of the credit extended to A.I.G. imposed significant costs and constraints on the firm ’s owners , managers , and creditors .
The chief executive officer has been replaced .
The collateral for the loan is the company itself , together with its subsidiaries .
1 ( Insurance policyholders and holders of A.I.G. investment products are , however , fully protected . )
Interest will accrue on the outstanding balance of the loan at a rate of three - month Libor plus 850 basis points , implying a current interest rate over 11 percent .
In addition , the U.S. government will receive equity participation rights corresponding to a 79.9 percent equity interest in A.I.G. and has the right to veto the payment of dividends to common and preferred shareholders , among other things .
In the case of Lehman Brothers , a major investment bank , the Federal Reserve and the Treasury declined to commit public funds to support the institution .
The failure of Lehman posed risks .
But the troubles at Lehman had been well known for some time , and investors clearly recognized  as evidenced , for example , by the high cost of insuring Lehman ’s debt in the market for credit default swaps  that the failure of the firm was a significant possibility .
Thus , we judged that investors and counterparties had had time to take precautionary measures .
While perhaps manageable in itself , Lehman ’s default was combined with the unexpectedly rapid collapse of A.I.G. , which together contributed to the development last week of extraordinarily turbulent conditions in global financial markets .
These conditions caused equity prices to fall sharply , the cost of short - term credit  where available  to spike upward , and liquidity to dry up in many markets .
Losses at a large money market mutual fund sparked extensive withdrawals from a number of such funds .
A marked increase in the demand for safe assets  a flight to quality  sent the yield on Treasury bills down to a few hundredths of a percent .
By further reducing asset values and potentially restricting the flow of credit to households and businesses , these developments pose a direct threat to economic growth .
The Federal Reserve took a number of actions to increase liquidity and stabilize markets .
Notably , to address dollar funding pressures worldwide , we announced a significant expansion of reciprocal currency arrangements with foreign central banks , including an approximate doubling of the existing swap lines with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank and the authorization of new swap facilities with the Bank of Japan , the Bank of England , and the Bank of Canada .
We will continue to work closely with colleagues at other central banks to address ongoing liquidity pressures .
The Federal Reserve also announced initiatives to assist money market mutual funds facing heavy redemptions and to increase liquidity in short - term credit markets .
Despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve , the Treasury , and other agencies , global financial markets remain under extraordinary stress .
Action by the Congress is urgently required to stabilize the situation and avert what otherwise could be very serious consequences for our financial markets and for our economy .
In this regard , the Federal Reserve supports the Treasury ’s proposal to buy illiquid assets from financial institutions .
Purchasing impaired assets will create liquidity and promote price discovery in the markets for these assets , while reducing investor uncertainty about the current value and prospects of financial institutions .
More generally , removing these assets from institutions ’ balance sheets will help to restore confidence in our financial markets and enable banks and other institutions to raise capital and to expand credit to support economic growth .

JUNEAU , Alaska , Aug. 29 ( UPI ) --
The office of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is the target of an investigation involving the firing of the state 's top public safety official , authorities said .
Walt Monegan , fired in July as Public Safety Commissioner , told The Washington Post Friday that Palin repeatedly talked with him about her ex-brother - in - law , Michael Wooten , after Monegan was named commissioner in December 2006 .
Monegan said the governor 's husband , Todd Palin , gave him a dossier containing information about Wooten , a state trooper who engaged in a child - custody battle with Palin 's sister .

Monegan also said Gov. Palin sent him e-mails on the matter , the Post said .
The governor has said her decision to release Monegan in July had nothing to do with his refusal to fire Wooten .
In an interview with CNBC Aug. 1 , she said it is " a governor 's prerogative , a right " to choose cabinet members .
Sarah Palin at first said neither she nor anyone in her administration pressured Monegan to fire Wooten , but she disclosed this month that Boards and Commissions Director Frank Bailey -- in a February phone call to a state trooper lieutenant -- outlined complaints against Wooten and indicated the governor and her husband wondered why Wooten was still on the force .
The governor said the call could be perceived as her office pressuring the Public Safety Department but said that was n't the case , the Anchorage ( Alaska ) Daily News reported .
Palin's office last week announced Bailey was relieved of his duties , pending a legislative investigation .
Before the legislative probe , however , the governor directed the Department of Law to conduct its own inquiry .
" Obviously the governor is not happy with that phone call but we do n't know what the investigation is going to show in total , " said Palin spokesman Bill McAllister .
Palin has said she was shocked to learn of the call , adding it was " absolutely inappropriate that he appeared to be representing me . "

HONG KONG / BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Savvy Internet users in China began avoiding the version of Skype offered by its Chinese partner two years ago , but news it filtered and recorded text messages has sparked new worries about the global firm ’s commitment to privacy .

The U.S. - owned Web communications firm faces a backlash at home and in China for apparently allowing core principles to be compromised in order to meet the demands of Chinese censors , analysts warned .
“ We may never know whether some of those people whose conversations were logged have gone to jail or have had their lives ruined in various ways as a result of this , ” said Rebecca MacKinnon , an Internet expert at Hong Kong University .
“ This is a big blow to Skype ’s credibility , despite the fact that Skype executives are downplaying it as not such a big deal . ”
Skype , with its promises of total security and privacy , has long been popular with Chinese looking to keep their conversations away from the prying eyes of government censors .
But the eBay - owned firm had to apologize on Thursday after a report revealed that its Chinese service not only monitors text chats with sensitive keywords , which it had earlier admitted , but also stores them along with millions of personal user records on computers that could easily be accessed by anybody .
Skype added however that only messaging conversations where one or more people were using the Chinese software were affected .
The censorship provoked little surprise among some of China ’s more knowledgeable Web users , however .
Suspicious of the software provided by TOM Online Inc. , majority owners of the TOM - Skype joint - venture in China , they had already sought out the original version .
“ We already knew that their software would not pass on messages with some words in them , so we understood they had some deal with the government and we avoided them , ” said Wang Lixiong , an author with dissident views .
Many spread the word over blogs and through other networks that the TOM - Skype version was not secure .
The Skype homepage in China apparently redirected would - be users to download that version rather than the international one .
OVERSATISFYING BEIJING
Still , there was outrage at the extent of a cooperation that many saw as another example of once - admired Western Internet giants bending their principles in order to do business in China .
“ The problem with Skype is that they did more than what people expected .
They over - satisfied the government , ” said Isaac Mao , one of China ’s earliest and best known bloggers .
Yahoo Inc. has been widely criticized for its role in helping the Chinese government identify Shi Tao , a reporter accused of leaking state secrets abroad .
He was jailed for 10 years in April 2007 .
Google Inc. , which has the corporate motto “ Do n’t be evil ” , upset some by launching a self - censoring Chinese site .
TOM said only that the company adhered to Chinese rules and regulations , and declined to answer any further questions .
Their defense was mocked by the people they aimed to monitor .
“ We must interrogate you : the constitution stipulates that citizens have freedom of correspondence and of secret correspondence .
Have you complied with this mother of laws ? ” one post on an online message board asked .
Author Wang said government controls on phones and other Internet programs left him with little choice but to take Skype at its word and continue using its original software , but even that has a security flaw that he worries about constantly .
He says the program allows one user to open their account on two separate computers , with no notification to the first .
“ If our password is stolen , everything that we do on Skype can be seen or copied on another computer without us knowing .
And in fact stealing a password is very easy for Internet police or hackers , ” he added .

This article is from the September / October 2008 issue of Dollars & Sense magazine .
I find it curious that not many , if anyone , challenges our money system that is debt - based .
Just think about it – if money can only be created through debt , i.e. , borrowing into existence , at interest , then the debt can never be repaid .
For example , if I , the government , borrow $ 10 to make up the country 's money supply , and I have to pay back $ 11 , and you ( the Fed ) have a monopoly on creating money , then the debt can never be repaid , because the $ 1 for the interest on the debt has not yet been created , and can only be created through more debt .
This sort of scheme , perpetrated by the Rothschilds ( the name in German means “ red shield ” ) a couple of centuries ago , has led a large part of the world toward the global plantation that is planned for us all .
The debt incurred by any government in this way , if ever paid ( though that is impossible ) , would lead to no money in the system , resulting in an economic collapse .
By its very structure , this kind of money system ultimately has to result in an unpayable debt ( such as our national debt ) and a collapse of the monetary system .
There are examples in our history of leaders that have understood this and tried to do something about it .
The most notable ones that come to mind are Abe Lincoln and John Fitzgerald Kennedy , who both got assasinated for doing the right thing – creating debt - free money .
Lincoln created the “ greenback ” , understanding that he did n't need a private bank to do this for him .
When he created this alternate form of money , the London Times of that time reported :
“ if that mischievous financial policy , which had its origin in the North American Republic , should become indurated down to a fixture , then that Government will furnish its own money without cost .
It will pay off debts and be without a debt .
It will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce .
It will become prosperous beyond precedent in the history of the civilized governments of the world .
The brains and the wealth of all countries will go to North America .
That government must be destroyed , or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe . ”
JFK also figured out that , if the US Treasury could issue Treasury Bonds , it might just as well issue “ US Notes ” to act as legal tender , and not have to “ borrow ” them from anyone at interest .
Of course , as with with Lincoln , his untimely death was followed by the first official act in Lyndon Johnson 's presidency rescinding the executive order ( # 11110 ) that created the JKF “ notes ” .
Establishing debt - free money , as mandated by the Constitution , is one of the prerequisites for liberty .
Of course , money based on nothing ( as Linclon 's “ greenbacks ” ) can be freely printed to allow all kinds of government mischief ( Lincoln printed only $ 441 Million ) .
This is why our founders mandated that our money be based on gold and silver , for the reason that real gold and silver , used as money throughout history , cannot be printed at will , thus putting a lid on government largesse and corruption .
These reasons are why Ron Paul advocates abolition of the Federal Reserve , a private bank whose books are kept secret , and establishing a money system that is not only a measure of value , but also a “ store of value ” – money whose growth is limited by its redeemability by some asset , such as gold and silver .
The following statement was presented on the floor of The House of Representatives after Congressman Kucinich voted against the Wall Street bail out plan , H.R. 1424 , the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 :
The public is being led to believe that Congress has reconsidered its position because we have before us a better bill than we had a few days ago .
It is the same bill plus hundreds of new pages for hundreds of millions of tax breaks .
What does this have to do with the troubles of Wall Street ?
Driven by fear we are moving quickly to pass a bill , which may produce a temporary uptick for the market , but nothing for millions of homeowners whose misfortunes are at the center of our economic woes .
People do not have money to pay their mortgages .
After this passes , they will still not have money to pay their mortgages .
People will still lose their homes while Wall Street is bailed out .
The central flaw of this bill is that there are NO stronger protections for homeowners and NO changes in the language to ensure that the secretary has the authority to compel mortgage servicers to modify the terms of mortgages .
And there are NO stronger regulatory changes to fix the circumstances that allowed this to happen .
We should have created a mechanism for our government to take a controlling interest in mortgage - backed securities and use our power to work out a new deal for the homeowners .
We could have done this .
We should have done this .
But we did n't .
Now millions of Americans will face the threat of foreclosure without any help .
And the numbers will soon rise for a number of reasons .
Not only because of the Alt - A , jumbo mortgages which will soon be reset at higher interest rates , but because the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) is pushing up rates on adjustable mortgages and more than half of the US adjustable mortgage rates are tied to LIBOR .
Homeowner defaults will grow in significant numbers .
Let 's see if Congress will be as quick to help homeowners on Main Street as they were to help speculators on Wall Street .
Now the government will have to borrow $ 700 billion from banks , with interest , to give banks a $ 700 billion bailout , and in return the taxpayers get $ 700 billion in toxic debt .
The Senate " improved " the bailout by giving tax breaks to people in foreclosure .
People in foreclosure need help paying their mortgage , they do not seek tax breaks .

Across our Nation , foreclosures continue to devastate our communities , people are losing their jobs , and the prices of necessities are skyrocketing .
This legislation , just like the one we defeated last week , will do nothing to solve the problems plaguing American families or help them to get out from underneath the oppressive debt they have been forced to take on .
Unfortunately , there has been no discussion of the underlying debt - based economy and the role of our monetary system in facilitating the redistribution of wealth upwards .
It is not as though we had no choice but to pass the bill before us .
We could have done this differently .
We could have demanded language in the legislation that would have empowered the Treasury to compel mortgage servicers to rework the terms of mortgage loans so homeowners could avoid foreclosure .
We could have put regulatory structures in place to protect investors .
We could have stopped the speculators .
This bill represents an utter failure of the Democratic process .
It represents the triumph of special interest over the triumph of the public interest .
It represents the inability of government to defend the public interest in the face of great pressure from financial interests .
We could have recognized the power of government to prime the pump of the economy to get money flowing through out society by creating jobs , health care , and major investments in green energy .
What a lost opportunity !
What a moment of transition away from democracy and towards domination of America by global economic interests .
Years ago , in a Cleveland neighborhood , I saw a hand - scrawled sign above a cash register in a delicatessen .
The sign said : " In God We Trust , All Others Pay Cash . "
The sign above the Speaker 's rostrum reads " In God We Trust , " but we are paying the cash to Wall Street .
It is not as if we had no other choice but to pass this bill .
DETROIT / NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - General Motors has had talks with smaller rival Chrysler LLC about a merger that would combine the No. 1 and No. 3 American automakers at a time when both are struggling to cut costs and shore up cash , according to a source briefed on the matter .

Separately , Ford Motor
Co , plans to sell shares from its $ 1.4 - billion stake in Japan ’s Mazda Motor Co , a second source said .
Barron ’s reported that GM was preparing to approach the U.S. Federal Reserve about borrowing money from the central bank ’s discount window because of the logjam in credit markets that has shut it out of other borrowing .
The moves come as all three Detroit - based automakers are struggling with a plunge in U.S. sales to 15 - year lows and facing tough questions from investors and creditors about whether they have the cash to ride out a deepening downturn .
Analysts said urgent steps by all three U.S. automakers to shore up cash could be expected as the global financial crisis begins to dampen auto sales in what had been fast - growing markets in Europe , Asia and South America .
But they also questioned whether an outright merger with Chrysler could serve GM ’s interests .
“ On the surface , it frankly does n’t make sense , ” said Aaron Bragman , an analyst with Global Insight .
“ The acquisition of Chrysler would n’t solve and problems GM has and would only make some existing ones worse . ”
Representatives of Cerberus Capital Management , the private equity firm that owns an 80.1 - percent stake in Chrysler , were not immediately available for comment .
Chrysler declined comment .
GM declined to comment on whether it had any talks with Chrysler but said talks with other automakers were a routine part of business .
“ GM officials routinely discuss issues of mutual interest with other automakers , ” said GM spokeswoman Renee Rashid - Merem .
“ As a policy , we do not confirm or comment publicly on those private discussions , which in many cases , do not lead anywhere . ”
Cerberus is also in exploratory talks with other parties , including Renault - Nissan , to sell Chrysler , the source said .
But any deal would hinge on the completion of the sale of Daimler AG ’s remaining 19.9 - percent stake in Chrysler to Cerberus , the source said .
Cerberus last month said it had approached Daimler to buy that remaining stake .
Chrysler ’s private owners and GM have had “ very early ” and “ very exploratory ” talks about a merger , the source said .
The talks between GM and Cerberus , first reported by the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal , began more than a month ago and are not certain to produce a deal .
The Journal said that Cerberus had proposed a swap of assets with GM that would give the private equity firm full ownership of finance company GMAC .
In exchange , GM would get the loss - making auto operations of Chrysler , the newspaper said .
Cerberus currently owns 51 percent of GMAC , GM ’s former captive finance company which has been hobbled by its exposure to the U.S. mortgage market .
GM owns the remainder of GMAC .
Global Insight ’s Bragman said a deal structured in that way would benefit Cerberus since the private equity firm would end up with GMAC just as a $ 700 billion U.S. government bailout fund to buy up distressed debt begins operations .
“ They would get rid of an auto company that has weighed on their results and they would get full control of GMAC just as the government is about to come to the rescue , ” Bragman said .
LONG PROCESS
The reported talks between the two sides would revive discussions between Chrysler and GM about a potential merger in early 2007 when Germany ’s Daimler AG began the process of selling off Chrysler that culminated in a deal later that year to sell the automaker to Cerberus .
GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner also said last year that he saw some potential for Cerberus to combine GMAC with Chrysler Financial , the finance company affiliated with the No. 3 automaker .
Analysts have questioned Chrysler ’s ability to survive as a stand - alone automaker , given its reliance on sales to North America for some 90 percent of its revenue .
But a combination with GM would match two companies with overlapping weaknesses , analysts said .
For one thing , both GM and Chrysler have been hurt by their reliance on sales of trucks and SUVs .
For another , both have been struggling to cut union - represented production jobs in reaction to weaker U.S. sales .
“ It would be taking two cash - burning companies and putting them together so they burn cash faster , ” said Erich Merkle , an auto industry consultant with Crowe Horwath .
Chrysler , which no longer discloses results as a private company , has also had discussions about a tie - up with India ’s Tata Motors and Italy ’s Fiat in recent months .
GM shares fell to near a 60 - year low this week on fears the global financial crisis could derail its turnaround plans .
GM and Ford both ruled out on Friday seeking bankruptcy protection .
John McCain has opted to enlist a group of foreign nationals to write positive letters to the editors to “ get out a positive message ” about John McCain and Sarah Palin .
Phil Tuchman , a McCain campaign worker , tells his ghostwriting team that they can be whomever they choose to be when writing these letters .
It matters not .
Just write something positive about McCain and have several people send out similar letters to various editors around the country .
Salon reports this from one of those ghostwriters , Margriet Oostveen , who is Dutch .
“ You can be whoever you want to be , ” says an inviting Phil Tuchman .
“ You can be a beggar or a millionaire .
A mom or a husband .
Whatever .
You decide ! ”
Today he is training six ghostwriters .
What on earth is the appeal of McCain for the former Soviet bloc ?
Last time I was here , an exuberant Polish guy was phone banking next to me .
Today , a Russian in yellow suspenders is shimmering at the same table , looking just like an actor who is famous in the Netherlands for star turns as a genius who suppresses his dark side with painstaking self - control .
The assignment is simple :
We are going to write letters to the editor and we are allowed to make up whatever we want — as long as it adds to the campaign .
After today we are supposed to use our free moments at home to create a flow of fictional fan mail for McCain .
“ Your letters , ” says Phil Tuchman , “ will be sent to our campaign offices in battle states .
Ohio. Pennsylvania .
Virginia .
New Hampshire .
There we ’ll place them in local newspapers . ”
Place them ?
I may be wrong , but I thought that in the USA only a newspaper ’s editors decided that .
“ We will show your letters to our supporters in those states , ” explains Phil .
“ If they say : ‘ Yeah , he / she is right ! ’ then we ask them to sign your letter .
And then we send that letter to the local newspaper .
That ’s how we send dozens of letters at once . ”
No newspaper can refuse a stream of articulate expressions of support , is the thought behind it .
“ This way , we will always get into some letters column . ”
It is the day after Sarah Palin ’s speech at the Republican convention .
Today , she is our main subject .
The others are already enthusiastically hammering their keyboards .
I am struggling with a tiny writer ’s block .
“ Dear Editor … ”
( snip )
“ That is why Senator John McCain could count on my vote from day one . ”
“ With Sarah Palin , I have even more reason to trust in victory .
She represents my heart . ”
“ Sincerely … ” I leave the dots for somebody else ’s signature .
Phil bends over my computer screen and reads .
This takes a while .
I am expecting roars of laughter or to be kicked out .
Then he says drily : “ I like that .
It appeals to the hearts of people .
Can you write more letters ? ”
The Original Motivation for the Hoax
The original motivation for the Georgia Body hoax was the attempt by sheriff deputy Matt Whitton , and used car salesman Rick Dyer , to offer expeditions like the BFRO .
Bigfoot expeditions looked like a great business to them , because the BFRO 's expedition often sell out months in advance .
They saw an opportunity to attract the people who did n't sign up for the BFRO 's trips in time .
This same motivation was shared by the infamous hoaxer Carmine ( Tom ) Biscardi .
Years before this hoax Biscardi had started a company called the " Great American Bigfoot Field Research Organization " ( GABFRO ) in a blatant attempt to confuse people who had heard about BFRO expeditions .
Biscardi , a former Las Vegas promoter , eventually changed the name of his business entity to " Searching for Bigfoot , Inc . "
Even with a relentless publicity campaign to advertise his expeditions , no one signed up .
As his money started to run out he became increasingly desperate for media attention .
He saw the potential in the Georgia body story for a lot of free publicity , so he jumped in to advise and partner with the Georgia boys .
With the help of tantalizing press releases television he managed to bring nation - wide TV coverage to his bizarre , self - promoting press conference in Palo Alto .
This press conference fulfilled the fantasy he had for decades -- a live press conference wherein he could command the attention ( momentarily ) of all major news media networks , and thereby proclaim himself to be " the real bigfoot hunter " ...
It was both madness , and a scam .
The YouTube Videos by the Georgia Boys
In the process of trying to draw attention to their phony expedition business , the Georgia boys noticed that some incredulous critics suddenly became extremely polite , and even helpful , when the boys began claiming that they had in their possession the body of a dead bigfoot .
That particular lie struck a curious chord in many people , as if the boys claimed to have had a vision of the Virgin Mary .
Like a vision of the Virgin Mary , the claim of having the body of a dead bigfoot touched a nerve in many people -- a superstitious nerve that makes them both fearful and hopeful at the same time .
The Georgia boys saw this happening so they began promoting the " dead bigfoot " lie with full force , and even more ludicrous videos on YouTube .
The fact that Whitton was a sheriff deputy is ultimately what made the hoax go as far as it did .
Most people , including those in the media , assumed that a sheriff deputy would not put his reputation and career on the line by promoting a hoax that was bound to unravel in disgrace .
It did n't make sense , so the Georgia boys were given the benefit of the doubt by the world media .
When Biscardi stepped into the picture he convinced the two Georiga boys that there was a way for everyone involved to make a lot of money quickly .
He convinced them that they had nothing to worry about , and they would all make out like bandits before the hoax finally unravelled .
The Georgia Boys took the matter as far as they did because they knew hoaxes are was not illegal , if the claims were only made to the news media and the boys never made a false report to local authorities .
The two Georgia boys did make a few thousand dollars from the hoax , but deputy Whitton lost his career in disgrace .
His partner and motivator , Rick Dyer , lost nothing in the process because he had no career to lose in the first place .
He was living hand - to - mouth as a self - employed used car dealer .
Biscardi hoped to make a windfall before the hoax unravelled , but it appears now that he made very little from the hoax and is now destitute .
The BFRO Debunks the Hoax and Identifies the Costume Used
The BFRO had been tracking the antics of the Georgia boys several weeks prior to the press conference .
We tried to warn everyone via our public discussion forum of the impending hoax a full week prior to the press conference , after it was learned that the Georgia boys joined forces with veteran hoaxer Biscardi .
Based on his past tactics we knew that Biscardi would shoot for maximum publicity , and would come up with a scheme to make a windfall of money from the intense curiousity on the Internet generated by the media publicity .
As the BFRO first announced , two days prior to the press conference , the " body " was a widely available Halloween costume stuffed into a large cooler , and filled with rotting animal entrails .
Confusion with Legitimate Bigfoot Researchers
At this stage everyone in the bigfoot research community would like nothing more than to wisk this hoax into the dust bin of history .
Unfortunately we have to keep this page available and prominent a while .
Because , unfortunately , many people who heard about the hoax were only listening with half an ear , or heard distorted details from other people .
In several instances people mistakenly assumed the BFRO was " the group that said they had a dead bigfoot " ... rather than the ones who debunked it .
In one example , a misinformed person assumed that the man who held the press conference ( the self - described " real bigfoot hunter " ) must be " that professor from Idaho " .
No , wrong guy , and wrong organization .
It 's a shame that we have to straighten that out with people , because it means we will be straightenning it out for a long time into the future .
The self - described " real bigfoot hunter " was the notorious charlatan and scam - artist Carmine ( Tom ) Biscardi , a former Las Vegas promoter .

A New Form of Punishment
An interesting consequence of this hoax was the creation of a new form of public punishment / humiliation for those who use the Internet ( and particularly YouTube ) to promote fraud schemes -- the permanent documentation of the scam on YouTube .
A very clever person saved and re-posted on YouTube the very same videos they used to promote their scam , which they tried to removed from YouTube prior to their big press conference .
These YouTube videos will haunt the Georgia boys and Biscardi for the rest of their lives .
It will prevent them from obtaining positions of trust and responsibility in the future .
More importantly , it will prevent them from perpetrating more hoax - scams .
The Rap Sheet on Carmine ( Tom ) Biscardi
When the Georgia boys first received some press attention in Georgia , the press attention attracted the notorious Carmine ( Tom ) Biscardi .
Biscardi had been pushing hoaxed bigfoot evidence for several years .
He seemed to pop up wherever the bigfoot subject was getting local press attention -- a sort of Reverend Al Sharpton of the bigfoot world .
But unlike Sharpton , who has become a respectable defender of minority rights , Biscardi 's ploys had won him the well - deserved reputation among the bigfoot research community as a charlatan , a parasite , a hoaxer , and a scam artist .
Biscardi did n't start the Georgia hoax , but instead latched onto to it once it got traction in the media in Georgia .
Biscardi's plot was to hype the " discovery " as legitimate , then collect money in various ways as the world grew eager to get a look at the specimen ... then later claim he was " hoodwinked " about the body so as redirect blame away from himself .
This was the second time Biscardi orchestrated this type of hoax .
This first time was on a nationally syndicated radio talk show -- Coast to Coast AM with George Noory .
The element that made this hoax attractive for Biscardi was that one of the Georgia boys , Matthew Whitton , was a sheriff deputy .
Biscardi knew the law enforcement factor would help the story appear more believable to the media , for a little while at least .
That was all Biscardi needed .
On Friday , August 15 , 2008 , Biscardi held a hyped press conference in Palo Alto , California , after assuring the press that he would " shock the world " with his evidence .
He introduced the Georgia boys , who told an implausible story about how they found the body , but they did n't show the body at the press conference .
Instead Biscardi showed some fake photos , and some DNA results which essentially proved that they did not have a bigfoot corpse ...
Click here to see the entire bizarre press conference .
It is 43 minutes of lies from a professional liar .
After Biscardi was publicly busted and humiliated in 2005 for a different version of a bigfoot body hoax , he claimed he was " hoodwinked " by some bad people who had deceived him ( all the while he was raking in money from a phony pay - per- view " surveillance " project ) .
Roll forward to 2008 .
After the Georgia Body hoax unravlled prematurely , Biscardi claimed he was " hoodwinked " ... again ...
He subsequently claimed that he was going to take legal action against the Georgia Boys ... in an attempt to distract legal action against himself , by prosecutors , for fraud .
At the height of the Internet storm of curiosity , Biscardi was charging $ 2 ( on SearchingForBigfoot.com ) to see the photos of the fake body .
Millions of people around the world wanted to see the photos .
Biscardi hoped to rake in a tidy sum .
No one knows how much , if anything , Biscardi raked in this way .
$ 50,000 for the Georgia Boys
After the body was revealed to be a fake to the mass media , some newspapers reported that Biscardi was swindled out of $ 50,000 by the Georgia Boys .
That is incorrect .
Biscardi persuaded a man in Indiana to front $ 50,000 to the Georgia Boys in exhange for the " body " .
Biscardi promised to pay the man back in 90 days .
But once it became clear that the body was fake , Biscardi urged the man to sue the Georgia guys in order to get his money back .
The Impact on Legitimate Bigfoot Research
Consider a historical parallel -- the " Alien Autopsy Video " Hoax .
In the 1990's an unscrupulous television producer perpetrated a television hoax with a video of a phony autopsy of a phony alien body .
The video was touted by a particular television network as a potentially authentic piece of video footage .
The same video producer and television network later revealed their own hoax in a subsequent program .
This televised hoax got high ratings , and they all cashed in , but it was n't illegal .
Everyone talked about this hoax for a while .
Many people were very willing to throw the baby out with the bath water .
But the rational reality remained : The Alien Autopsy Video Hoax had no bearing whatsoever on the question of whether extraterrestrial life exists ...
Though many people were heard to say , in the weeks and months following the hoax , " See , I told ya ' that UFO stuff was all just a bunch of BS ... "
People do n't generally say that nowadays .
They only chuckle about that program , if they can remember it at all ...
This will be the historical fate of the Georgia Body Hoax and the unscrupulous Carmine Biscardi .
In time people will merely look back and chuckle about it , if they remember it at all .
They will continue to hear about sightings of sasquatches / bigfoots from various credible witnesses .
Over the course of time , society will come to accept and embrace their existence , whether or not a corpse is ever collected .
There are many aspects to bigfoots that humans should emulate to some extent .
There is nothing to suggest that famines , epidemics or wars occur among bigfoots , because they do not overpopulate .
Even in those areas where their numbers could dramatically expand , given the quantity of food resources available to them , their numbers are still very low .
They do not exist in large numbers anywhere , even by ape standards .
They range widely , but not densely .
They 've never become a nuisance to humans , or human livestock .
And unlike gorillas and chimps they do not live in large enough groups to make them easy to hunt by humans .
Their impact on the land is so subtle that it takes a trained eye to even notice it .
There are many other good reasons to study their behavior , and diet , and lifestyle .
Humans will benefit from these apes in ways that most people do not appreciate at present .
Around the world , working women are facing brutally hard choices about whether to stay home with their children , if they have n’t already been laid off .

House Republicans defended their “ free enterprise principles ” as keeping the government from selling Main Street out for Wall Street .
Economists not keen on GOP bailout
A number of economists may be questioning Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ’s plan to rescue the financial markets , but they really do n’t like an emerging House Republican alternative .
“ I ca n’t manage to find any reason to doubt that the House Republicans ’ plan would destroy the U.S. financial system , ” economist Robert Waldmann wrote on the Angry Bear blog .
Advertisement
Admittedly , Washington think tankers and Wall Street players have n’t seen more than a one - page “ economic rescue principles ” released by aides to House Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( R - Ohio ) .
But what they ’ve seen has them scratching their heads .
The most prominent Republican alternative , drafted by Reps. Eric Cantor of Virginia and Paul Ryan of Wisconsin , would federally insure all mortgage - backed assets at a price and premium established by the government .
But that proposal has yet to be embraced by the entire House GOP Caucus .
The plan centers on insuring mortgage - backed assets at prices and premiums set by the government , creating a virtual backstop for the debt .
This would not require an initial outlay of taxpayers ’ funds in the neighborhood of Paulson 's $ 700 billion .
Democratic leaders say Paulson does n’t believe a mortgage insurance proposal will work , though he has n’t said so publicly .
“ I frankly do n’t understand how this is supposed to work , ” said Douglas Elmendorf , an economist at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution and an outspoken critic of the Paulson rescue plan .
People generally buy insurance for events that are unlikely to happen ; a homeowner pays out a couple hundred dollars for fire insurance , and if their house burns down they get hundreds of thousands of dollars from their insurance company , provided by premiums collected from other policyholders , he explained .
“ But with mortgage - backed securities , the bad thing has already happened , ” Elmendorf said .
“ They ’ve lost their value . ”
The emerging GOP alternative does not resolve the problem of how the government prices the toxic assets at the heart of the crisis , experts said .
In the Paulson plan , the government has to figure out how much to pay for the assets .
But in the GOP alternative , the government would have to determine the premium prices to insure against the risk that the mortgages behind the assets do n’t get paid off .
Many observers were buoyed by the modifications unveiled Thursday by Democrats and Senate Republicans that would allow the federal government to take out warrants — the option to buy shares — on some of the companies ’ participating in the rescue .
That way , if Treasury paid way too much for a firm ’s assets , taxpayers would share in the windfall to the company .
Doubt and dismissals of the new Republican plan came from some of the harshest critics of the Paulson plan , now nearly a week old .
Matt Kibbe , president and chief executive officer of the conservative grass - roots group FreedomWorks , defended Boehner and Cantor for trying to offer a workable policy framework as opposed to Paulson , whose plan Kibbe believes borders on unconstitutional .
“ The problem with it is you ’re sort of ex-post going back and insuring things once they ’ve already become uninsurable , ” Kibbe said , “ and the question is , does it just create a two - step process : one step where we create an insurance program , and the second step … where we have to step in and bail them out anyway . ”
The emerging Republican alternative is a “ distraction , ” said Simon Johnson , a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and a fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics who criticized Paulson ’s plan .
“ I ’m sympathetic to anybody who feels that people were trying to railroad them this week , but I do n’t think that is going to get us anywhere , ” Johnson continued .
“ If they ’re really digging in [ on the alternative package ] , that would be really unhelpful and bad . ”
House Republicans , though , defended their “ free enterprise principles ” as keeping the government from selling Main Street out for Wall Street .
“ We are moving forward on a plan that is better for the American taxpayer , on a plan that guarantees that Main Street merchants and Main Street consumers will have a part of whatever action takes place by the end of this weekend , ” Rep. Adam Putnam ( R - Fla . ) , chairman of the House Republican Conference , told reporters at the Capitol Friday .
Asked if the insurance proposal would be part of the final bailout package , Boehner noted the Republican goal was “ to come to an agreement [ and ] to do our best to protect the American taxpayers . ”
“ There are a lot of options in terms of how we do that , and we 're not going to negotiate here , ” he told reporters .
“ Last time I looked , you did n't have a vote . ”
THE BOGUS FLAG STORY ….
It seems Fox News and some far - right blogs are excited about the latest in a series of lies from the McCain campaign — the notion that thousands of American flags from the Democratic convention were going to be thrown away .
Like far too many of the stories pushed by the McCain campaign , and embraced by Fox News and far - right blogs , it ’s not true .
Days before the anniversary of September 11 , on the same morning that John McCain and Barack Obama released a joint statement pledging to avoid politics in light of the anniversary of the terrorist attacks , McCain ’s campaign accused Democrats of throwing away 12,000 American flags .
“ The campaign says the flags were recovered from Invesco Field after the Democrats concluded their convention there , ” Fox News reported , “ and they are going to be used as part of the warm - up ceremonies before McCain takes the stage ” for a rally in Colorado Springs , Col .
But according to a senior official involved in organizing the Democratic convention , the McCain camp is simply lying about the flags .
“ All of the flags at Invesco were picked up and put in bags and into storage , along with the unused flags and campaign signs .
The flags were going to be donated , and the signs were going to be sent out to be used elsewhere , ” the official said , speaking anonymously since he was not authorized to talk to the press .
The “ story ” — I use the word loosely — has been promoted by Fox News ’ Carl Cameron , perhaps best known for promoting fabricated nonsense about John Kerry four years ago .
In other words , consider the source .
A Democratic convention official told the Huffington Post , “ It ’s pretty reprehensible on their part .
Someone made an assumption , took the flags , and essentially lied about what was going to happen to them .
I mean , c’mon , we were never ever going to throw out flags . ”
It ’s hard not to get the impression that Republicans are looking for some kind of symbol to help them avoid discussing substance .
For a while , it was arugula .
Then flag pins .
Then Paris Hilton .
Soon after , it was tire gauges .
Now , it ’s convention flags .
Whether it ’s true or even coherent is apparently irrelevant .
“ This election is not about issues , ” McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said this week .
I thought Davis was offering an assessment , but it was apparently some kind of promise .
