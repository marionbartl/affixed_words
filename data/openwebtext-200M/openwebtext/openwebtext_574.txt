LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
A group of experts from around the world will hold a first of its kind conference Thursday on global catastrophic risks .
Some experts say humans will merge with machines before the end of this century .
They will discuss what should be done to prevent these risks from becoming realities that could lead to the end of human life on Earth as we know it .
Speakers at the four - day event at Oxford University in Britain will talk about topics including nuclear terrorism and what to do if a large asteroid were to be on a collision course with our planet .
On the final day of the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference , experts will focus on what could be the unintended consequences of new technologies , such as superintelligent machines that , if ill - conceived , might cause the demise of Homo sapiens .
" Any entity which is radically smarter than human beings would also be very powerful , " said Dr. Nick Bostrom , director of Oxford 's Future of Humanity Institute , host of the symposium .
" If we get something wrong , you could imagine the consequences would involve the extinction of the human species . "
Bostrom is a philosopher and a leading thinker of transhumanism , a movement that advocates not only the study of the potential threats and promises that future technologies could pose to human life but also the ways in which emergent technologies could be used to make the very act of living better .
" We want to preserve the best of what it is to be human and maybe even amplify that , " Bostrom said .
Transhumanists , according to Bostrom , anticipate an era in which biotechnology , molecular nanotechnologies , artificial intelligence and other new types of cognitive tools will be used to amplify our intellectual capacity , improve our physical capabilities and even enhance our emotional well - being .
The end result would be a new form of " posthuman " life with beings that possess qualities and skills so exceedingly advanced they no longer can be classified simply as humans .
" We will begin to use science and technology not just to manage the world around us but to manage our own human biology as well , " Bostrom said .
" The changes will be faster and more profound than the very , very slow changes that would occur over tens of thousands of years as a result of natural selection and biological evolution . "
Bostrom declined to predict an exact time frame when this revolutionary biotechnological metamorphosis might occur .
" Maybe it will take eight years or 200 years , " he said .
" It is very hard to predict . "
Other experts are already getting ready for what they say could be a radical transformation of the human race in as little as two decades .
" This will happen faster than people realize , " said Dr. Ray Kurzweil , an inventor and futurist who calculates technology trends using what he calls the law of accelerating returns , a mathematical concept that measures the exponential growth of technological evolution .
In the 1980s , Kurzweil predicted that a tiny handheld device would be invented early in the 21st century , allowing blind people to read documents from anywhere at anytime ; this year , such a device was publicly unveiled .
He also anticipated the explosive growth of the Internet in the 1990s .
Now , Kurzweil is predicting the arrival of something called the Singularity , which he defines in his book on the subject as " the culmination of the merger of our biological thinking and existence with our technology , resulting in a world that is still human but that transcends our biological roots . "
" There will be no distinction , post - Singularity , between human and machine or between physical and virtual reality , " he writes .
Singularity will approach at an accelerating rate as human - created technologies become exponentially smaller and increasingly powerful and as fields such as biology and medicine are understood more and more in terms of information processes that can be simulated with computers .
By the 2030s , Kurzweil said , humans will become more non-biological than biological , capable of uploading our minds onto the Internet , living in various virtual worlds and even avoiding aging and evading death .
In the 2040s , Kurzweil predicts that non-biological intelligence will be billions of times better than the biological intelligence humans have today , possibly rendering our present brains obsolete .
" Our brains are a million times slower than electronics , " Kurzweil said .
" We will increasingly become software entities if you go out enough decades . "
This movement towards the merger of man and machine , according to Kurzweil , is already starting to happen and is most visible in the field of biotechnology .
As scientists gain deeper insights into the genetic processes that underlie life , they are able to effectively reprogram human biology through the development of new forms of gene therapies and medications capable of turning on or off enzymes and RNA interference , or gene silencing .
" Biology and health and medicine used to be hit or miss , " Kurzweil sad .
" It was n't based on any coherent theory about how it works . "
The emerging biotechnology revolution will lead to at least a thousand new drugs that could do anything from slow down the process of aging to reverse the onset of diseases , like heart disease and cancer , Kurzweil said .
By 2020 , Kurzweil predicts a second revolution in the area of nanotechnology .
According to his calculations , it is already showing signs of exponential growth as scientists begin to test first generation nanobots that can cure Type 1 diabetes in rats or heal spinal cord injuries in mice .
One scientist is developing something called a respirocyte , a robotic red blood cell that , if injected into the bloodstream , would allow humans to do an Olympic sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath or sit at the bottom of a swimming pool for hours at a time .
Other researchers are developing nanoparticles that can locate tumors and one day even eradicate them .
And some Parkinson 's patients now have pea-sized computers implanted in their brains that replace neurons destroyed by the disease ; new software can be downloaded to the mini computers from outside the human body .
" Nanotechnology will not just be used to reprogram but to transcend biology and go beyond its limitations by merging with non-biological systems , " Kurzweil said .
" If we rebuild biological systems with nanotechnology , we can go beyond its limits . "
The final revolution leading to the advent of Singularity will be the creation of artificial intelligence , or superintelligence , which , according to Kurzweil , could be capable of solving many of our biggest threats , like environmental destruction , poverty and disease .
" A more intelligent process will inherently outcompete one that is less intelligent , making intelligence the most powerful force in the universe , " Kurzweil writes .
Yet the invention of so many high - powered technologies and the possibility of merging these new technologies with humans may pose both peril and promise for the future of mankind .
" I think there are grave dangers , " Kurzweil said .
" Technology has always been a double - edged sword . "

Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer , who 's watched his company 's PC business come under immense pressure from Apple , used a forum this week to discount the Mac maker 's potential for future share gains and designate its mobile phone business as a doomed initiative that will " lose out " in the long run .
Microsoft aims at Apple integration
In July , Ballmer issued a widely publicized email to employees acknowledging the looming threat presented by Apple , in which he outlined a cause of action that , among other things , suggested Microsoft follow the example set forth by its rival in providing the same " narrow but complete " experience to its customers going forward .
Among the changes he proposed were a shift in relations with Microsoft hardware vendors designed to mimic the experience offered by Apple 's tightly - controlled Mac platform .
Likewise , he called for a similar approach in the mobile phone arena , vouching to create " great end - to - end experiences " akin to that of Apple 's closed ecosystem , where it maintains tight control of nearly every aspect of a product 's design .
Ballmer 's 180 on integration
Ballmer was quick to criticize those same strategies during a dinner at the Churchill Club in Silicon Valley this week .
He said Nokia , Research in Motion and Apple will all lose out as the market expands over the next five years , because they control their own proprietary software , which is then tied too closely to their own hardware .
Today , Nokia leads the worldwide smartphone market with a 30 percent share .
" If you want to reach more than that , you have to separate the hardware and software in the platform , " he said , suggesting that the same strategy that helped Microsoft dominate the PC market will inevitably win out in the mobile space as well .
Of those mobile platforms left standing and battling for the biggest piece of the pie will be the open source Symbian OS , mobile versions of Linux , and his very own Windows Mobile , Ballmer claimed .
The market indicates otherwise
According to mobile market tracker Canalys however , it has been Microsoft 's Windows Mobile share of the market that has slid precipitously , falling from 23 % in the first quarter of 2004 to 18 % the next year , and 12 % in 2006 , where it remained through 2007 .
In the fourth quarter of 2007 , Apple grabbed 7 % of the worldwide smartphone share , despite being limited to one model and primarily one provider in one country .
It 's expected that Apple will match or overshadow Windows Mobile sales worldwide this year , and the iPhone has already trounced Windows Mobile in the US and as a browsing platform .
Symbian 's smartphone platform has similarly fallen from a commanding 72.8 % lead share in late 2006 to today 's 55 % share under the assault of integrated phones including RIM's BlackBerry , Apple 's iPhone , and Motorola 's closed Linux phones sold in Asia .
Symbian partner Sony Ericsson is struggling with weak sales , and Symbian itself reported earlier this month that revenues had tumbled 14 % as its software royalty payments per phone continued to fall .
Nokia is buying out its Symbian partners to take the platform open source for the very reason that there is little business model left in selling the phone software .
Add in Google 's free Android platform , and Microsoft is left as the last vendor trying to sell a commercial software platform for smartphones .
This has led many observers to expect that Microsoft would attempt to release its own ' Zune phone ' model , but the company has said no such product is the works , and instead has pointed to the release of Windows Mobile 7 late next year .
Ballmer dismisses the iPhone in 2007 while touting Windows Mobile
Microsoft expects
Mac to do as poorly as iPhone
Ballmer similarly argued that Apple will fail to see further Mac share gains or make strides in the enterprise market because it wo n't license the Mac OS to third - party hardware vendors .
" Apple 's a good company , I wo n't take anything away from them , but they have a certain kind of strategy , " Ballmer said .
" They believe in putting the hardware and software together , they do n't believe in letting other people make it . "
" I'm not saying there is n't a threat " he added .
But if we " do our jobs right , there 's really no reason Apple should get any footprint in the enterprise . "
As you can probably figure out from the title , the purpose of this post is to track how CouchDB is saving a document on the disk .
We have already tracked how much of CouchDB works , including some fascinating pieces such as btree : lookup and btree : query_modify .
Now it is time to dig ourselves from the trenches and have a slightly higher level view of what is going on .
We start with the recently refactored couch_httpd_db module .
The fun starts with handle_request .
It took me a few seconds to realize what is going on here .
Again , some of the problem is that I am not used to the function declaration being such an important role in the function behavior .
In this case , the function declaration decompose the request into several parameters .
The case statement is used to dispatch based on the arguments .
If we have a PUT or DELETE requests with just the DB name , we know that we need to create / delete a database .
Otherwise , we assume we have some other operation on the database directly , and we send a function for it to execute .
The reason for that becomes clear when you check the rest of the code .
As we can see , the create_db_req and delete_db_req have different disposal semantics than do_db_req .
do_db_req will just open / close the database and then execute the function in the cotext of this database handle .
This is quite a common pattern in functional programming , and it used frequently in Ruby .
I am using it as much as I can in C# as well , since it is a very natural syntax to use with anonymous delegates and lambdas .
Anyway , what we are interested in today is the actual process of getting data from the request and putting it on the disk , so let us move along and see what is going on here .
The next place of interest , of course , is db_req itself , which we pass into do_db_req .
This is fairly interesting in its own , since it deals with all the commands that the server can support ( from bulk_docs to compactions to purging ) .
That is n't really interesting to me at this time , so we will move to the first code sample and look at the last clause .
This is where we are handling with a request for a specific document .
couch_util : dict_find is where we need to look now ...
This is simply a way to do a lookup into a dictionary with a default value .
So what does this code do ?
Well , it lookup in the DbUrlHandlers ( which we got passed to the method ) and defaults to the db_req if it is n't found there .
But what is this DbUrlHandlers ?
I 'll save you the trouble of finding out on your own and guide us directly to the location that we care about .
Here is a section from the couchdb.ini configuration :
[ httpd_global_handlers ]
/ = {couch_httpd_misc_handlers , handle_welcome_req , <<" Welcome " >>}
_utils = {couch_httpd_misc_handlers , handle_utils_dir_req , " %localdatadir%/www " }
_all_dbs = {couch_httpd_misc_handlers , handle_all_dbs_req}
_config = {couch_httpd_misc_handlers , handle_config_req}
_replicate = {couch_httpd_misc_handlers , handle_replicate_req}
_uuids = {couch_httpd_misc_handlers , handle_uuids_req} [ httpd_db_handlers ]
_view = {couch_httpd_view , handle_view_req}
_temp_view = {couch_httpd_view , handle_temp_view_req}
If this looks like erlang code , you are almost right .
This is actually just an .ini file , but it is format like erlang on purpose , since this is a simple mapping of a url to its handler in the code .
This is a new extension mechanism to CouchDB that was added just yesterday .
This is a really nice way of handling extensibility , but enough beating around the bush , where is the save document code path ?
It starts with this function clause :
So we need to go to the do_doc_req to see what else is going on here .
And in the db_doc_req , we just need to find the PUT handler , which will create a new document .
And here it is :
Let us examine this in depth. couch_httpd:json_body ( Req ) just takes the request body and decode the JSON information there .
I 'll save you the way JSON is parsed using erlang .
Suffice to say that I do n't think it is pretty .
couch_doc : from_json_doc is interesting , though .
First , take a look at this code :
This is the equivalent of this code :
var allowedSpecialMembers = new [ ] {
/* see list above */ } ; foreach ( var prop in Props )
{
if ( allowedSpecialMembers.Contains ( prop ) ) continue ;
throw new DocValidationexception ( ' Bad special document member " + prop ) ; }
The method is doing a few extra things that are n't really interesting to us at the moment , basically taking the JSON object that we got and turning that into this object :
Going back to db_doc_req , we can see that next we just get the appropriate revisions and then we extract the header revision , whatever that may be ...
This is merely dealing with ensuring that if we specified the etag header , it will match the current revision .
Not sure why this is important for PUT request , however .
This make sense for POST ( update ) request , however .
Taking that as a given , we then call update_doc ( which seems to serve double duty as create_doc ) and send as JSON response back to the user .
This means that we finally have a lead , and can move from couch_httpd_db to couch_db :-)
update_doc just forward the call to update_docs ( plural ) .
That should be interesting , but it would n't be today .
President Bush has the worst record on job growth of any president since Herbert Hoover .
The typical worker has seen her wages decline over the eight years of the Bush presidency , and she has seen none of the benefits of the period 's productivity growth .
In addition , tens of millions of homeowners are seeing the bulk of their wealth disappear in the housing crash .
This is the record senator John McCain has embraced by making Bush 's tax cuts the centrepiece of his economic agenda .
Choosing an economic policy that has been a proven failure is a bold and risky strategy in a presidential campaign , but McCain is betting that the media will be so incompetent that they will not notice .
He may be right .
For example , last week National Public Radio ( NPR ) did a report on the tax cut proposals of McCain and senator Barack Obama .
The report correctly told listeners that the McCain 's proposals will give more money to the wealthy , while Obama 's would give more money to the middle class .
However , after presenting a solid analysis of the distributional impact of the tax cut proposals , NPR decided to tell its listeners about the " big ideas " behind these two proposals .
We were told that the big idea behind the Obama plan was " fairness " , which could also be called " redistribution " .
It was nice for NPR to tell its listeners what pejorative term can be used to describe the tax cut .
I suppose it can also be called " socialism " , " communism " or " Arthur " , but NPR was good enough to stop at redistribution .
However , the reporting really got outrageous when NPR told us that the big idea behind the McCain plan was " growth " .
We could perhaps have an interesting debate about whether giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in the country is a good way to promote growth , if we did n't already know the answer .
We have had almost eight years of Bush tax cuts , and the record is as clear as it could possibly be .
When it comes to producing economic growth that benefits the middle class , the tax cuts were dismal failures .
The economy is now in the process of sinking into the second recession of the Bush administration .
At the current rate of job loss , it is entirely possible that Bush will have created fewer private sector jobs in his entire eight years in office than the 2.6 million jobs the Clinton administration created annually .
The average worker 's wage will almost certainly be lower when Bush leaves office in January of 2009 than when he took office in January of 2001 .
This means that most workers will have seen nothing from the benefits of productivity growth over the last eight years .
Certainly Bush cannot be blamed for everything that went wrong , but it does not make sense to claim that his policies bear no responsibility for this economic failure .
Bush was left in charge of the store ( he also controlled both houses of Congress through most of his presidency ) , and we got cleaned out .
Imagine if some big government Democrat had this track record .
This is why it is absurd for McCain to present himself as the candidate of jobs and growth .
We are doing his policies now – and they do n't work .
McCain should be embarrassed to push these policies given the huge failure sitting in front of our faces , but he is counting on the media to turn the issue into a he said / she said .
McCain is betting that the media will treat the failure of the Bush - McCain economic policy as a matter of partisan contention , rather than as a fact , like gravity .
Thus far he has been right .
He did a test run of media gullibility a couple of weeks ago when he proposed drilling for oil offshore in environmentally sensitive areas .
He proposed this as a response to $ 4 - a - gallon gas .
This was McCain 's way of showing that he cares for the working stiff .
Of course , McCain knows that the amount of oil potentially available offshore in environmentally sensitive areas is too small to have a noticeable impact on prices and that it will take a decade before we even see a drop .
But , he wanted the media frame of being the guy who was willing to sacrifice the environment in order to help Joe Sixpack .
It worked like a charm .
The media contrasted Obama 's concern with the environment ( portrayed as out of touch and elitist ) with McCain 's concern for jobs and growth .
If McCain could look good proposing a policy that jeopardises the environment for no visible economic benefit , why not push an economic policy that is a proven failure , as though the past eight years never happened ?
As PT Barnum should have said : " No one ever lost an election underestimating the gullibility of the US media . "
One of my favored books in the 1980s was ‘ A Taste of Smalltalk ’ .
This was a very short book that gave you the flavor of Smalltalk programming ( the language and IDE ) as compared to Pascal , C , and Lisp .
I believe it is always important to show multiple programming languages for concepts and this book followed that rule .
The goal of this post - series is to take ‘ A Taste of Smalltalk ’ and apply it to Scratch ( a visual programming language ) .
This is the third of my comparisons in this series , where the first one was in Ruby .
You can find the original book here :
Given the original book is available online , I will not repeat it .
You can both see the example in Scratch and get tools and background on the Scratch project at :
Tower of Hanoi .
The scratch tools and the community web site are free .
Tower of Hanoi — Object - Oriented ( V4 ) — Scratch
The standard pattern for this series is to translate as closely as possible each of the chapters in “ A Taste of Smalltalk ” to the new target language .
This worked reasonably well for Ruby and Flex — the Smalltalk was translated and interesting features of the language came out with each translation .
But this approach utterly fails for Scratch because the first two ‘ models ’ of the Hanoi algorithm are completely dependent on recursion , which Scratch does not have .
Even the third , stack - less version of Hanoi requires inter - object calls that Scratch can not handle .
So _none_ of the algorithms within “ A Taste of Smalltalk ” can be directly translated to Scratch .
This might appear to be a limitation of the language ( and in some ways it certainly is ) , but somewhat impressively , I believe thinking about this problem , with the restrictions of Scratch , actually leads to a better design solution than any of the ones in the book .
It is certainly a very object - oriented solution , where the ‘ Hanoi Disks ’ have a lot of intelligence and are made as responsible as possible for figuring out what to do next .
This version of the algorithm , I will call ‘ V4 ’ .
The V4 Algorithm
The V4 Algorithm works as follows :
Ask each of the disks whether they have a legal move Decide which of the disks with a legal move should move
Tell that disk to move
The interesting parts of this algorithm are that :
Step 1 can be completely parallel .
You can ask 1 to 1000000 disks at the same moment whether they have a legal move .
Step 2 is really trivial : just do n’t move the same disk you did last time
Compared to the V3 version , the V4 version puts more intelligence in the disks ( and less in the tower ) , couples them less , and supports mass parallel - execution .
The parallel - execution is not useful in Hanoi , but the concepts behind it are definitely very interesting — and Scratch ’s restrictions forces this kind of ‘ sophisticated ’ approach [ or at least it forced me down this path to maintain code - sanity and maintainability ] .
The main Scratch Player view
Scratch is designed to be an easy - to - learn language and environment .
Its heritage is along the lines of the spirit of Logo : there is a Stage drawing area and a default Sprite ( a Cat ) that you interact with for animation and drawing .
But this Stage can also show the variables involved with the program .
So it produces a nice overview of the whole Hanoi program :
Not all application variables are shown , but those shown are the most important ones .
The details of the variables will be gone over later , but some are self - evident :
num - disks :
The number of disks ( the height ) of the Tower of Hanoi
pole -# : A List ( treated as a Stack ) of Disk identifiers , where ‘ 6 ’ = a base ( immovable ) disk
movable - disks : A List of disks that can be moved .
This is transitory for each iteration of the algorithm .
If you click the ‘ Green Flag ’ , the program executes and on pretty much every step the display is updated , so you can see disks being proposed and moved ( in both animation and variables ) .
Independently of Scratch having a graphical programming language , it has a very nice graphical development and run environment .
Application Variables
The application variables are shown below .
All of these are ‘ Globals ’ and can be accessed by any object .
Those variables colored in red are lists and those colored in orange are numbers / strings / etc .
All the variables that have check - marks next to them are being displayed on top of the Stage above .
There is no such thing as a ‘ local ’ variable ( private to a block of code ) , so it might be useful to use a naming prefix to differentiate between ‘ local ’ variables ( like ‘ potential - disk ’ ) from instance variables and even ‘ parameter ’ variables that go with a broadcast ( ‘ next - disk ’ ) .
But in - the - small , that is not particularly important .
Application Initialization
Now that we have an overview of the application and its global state variables , we can start working through the algorithm itself .
The main ‘ Object ’ in Scratch is the Stage , and I made this own the outer - most aspects of the Hanoi application and algorithm .
The first activity is ‘ Initialization ’ , which is triggered by the ‘ Green Flag ’ [ my particular choice ] .
Because this is the first example of Scratch , I will walk through the sections of the code and what they do with a few visual marker numbers ( see the right column of blue ) .
When the Stage gets the Green Flag event :
It sets the number of disks to ‘ 5 ’ .
This is hard - coded because Scratch is currently unable to clone Sprites ( objects ) on the fly , so we have to precreate all the needed sprites .
In any case , this is simple enough to change if someone wants .
The additional variable ‘ base - disk ’ is defined so it can be used below .
‘ base - disk ’ is just a local variable and is never used again .
After this , we just clear the lists so they are ‘ clean ’
Next we add the ‘ base - disk ’ to the bottom of each pole .
The base - disks are invisible and immovable ( no matching Sprite / Object ) , so this is a very clean way of making the algorithm simpler later on .
Next we add the disks to ‘ pole - 1 ’ using what should be another local variable .
Later I reuse this variable [ something I do n’t like doing ] just because we otherwise have a clutter of variables .
Next we send out a broadcast to _all objects_ telling them to initialize themselves .
There is no direct message send to an object , so it is up to the other objects to know what to respond to and what to ignore .
The broadcast waits until all object ’s acknowledge they are finished .
Finally , we go into the main loop .
Until all the disks have moved to a new pole , we will execute ‘ find - next - disk ’ which both finds and moves the next disk .
When we are done , we make a noise 🙂
Find and Move Next Disk
The main part of the algorithm has some nice aspects and some nastier aspects .
The nice side :
We simply send out a broadcast of ‘ propose - next - disk ’ , which all Disks should respond to by adding themselves to ‘ movable - disks ’ if they have a desire to move .
This will only ever be one or two movable disks at any given time .
One of those disks may have been moved immediately previously , so we skip over it .
The selected disk is put into ‘ next - disk ’ and another broadcast goes out “ move - next - disk ” .
The second broadcast is not really a broadcast .
It is a message send to ‘ next - disk ’ , but it is only by the disks themselves ignoring a broadcast that is n’t to them that it becomes a message send .
So that is slightly nasty .
In any case , the code is pretty clean and concise , and this ends the code on the Stage itself .
The rest of the algorithm is on the Disks .
Disks Variables
The Disks have access to all the Stage global variables .
In addition , each Sprite can have its own instance - private variables , which are either true instance variables ( ‘ disk-id ’ , ‘ pole ’ , ‘ previous - pole ’ ) or would be local variables if Scratch supported them ( ‘ can - move ’ , ‘ am - on - top ’ , etc . )
Instance variables can be displayed on the Stage also , but this becomes overwhelming if all instances are turned on .
Disk Initialization
Upon receiving the ‘ initialize ’ broadcast , all Disks set their ‘ disk - id ’ ( which must be different for each disk ) , and then set themselves up properly in size , color , and move onto the correct pole .
Propose Next Disk
Scratch has certain deficiencies that rear their heads badly in the Hanoi code .
The concept of Propose Next Disk is as simple as :
If * I am on - top of a pole * And I can move to a new pole ( with a bigger disk on its top ) *
And that new pole is n't the pole I just came from Then *
Add myself to the movable - disks list
But because Scratch ( or my knowledge of Scratch ) is deficient in dynamic referencing of variables , the ‘ propose - next - disk ’ code needs to expand all the potential pole values from 1 through 3 .
Fortunately this is only a three - valued expansion , but the code looks quite nasty for being as simple as the above .
Move Next Disk
The Move Next Disk code has ( 1 ) the filter on the broadcast ( in this case by ‘ disk - id ’ ) to make it only go to a single object and ( 2 ) a ton of noise due to ‘ pole ’ expansion mentioned above .
But the code gets the job done and it looks fairly colorful 🙂
Conclusions
I was impressed that Scratch was able to get Tower of Hanoi to run properly .
Scratch has actively avoided certain features that the Scratch team finds are difficult to understand .
But the toolbox of event processing , broadcasts , lists , and Sprites ( objects with Stage presence 🙂 ) are rich enough that a pre-sized Hanoi can be created and will run correctly .
A dynamic Hanoi would require Sprite cloning , which is not in Scratch 1.3 .
The nastiest aspect to Scratch was its inability to dynamically reference the pole lists .
And a missing feature to Scratch are simple procedures ( for example , the ‘ glide ’ code is repeated twice ) .
The missing recursion is clearly another missing feature , but in this case getting rid of that recursion made the algorithm somewhat nicer .
On the whole , Scratch is a very inspiring visual language and development environment , and it did a good job with this ‘ offbeat ’ test .
Stanley North Dakota is Newest Oil Mecca and Boom Town ( Photos )
Stanley , North Dakota is a town that sits on an area that geologists say could hold 4 billion barrels of oil .
The area is called the Bakken Formation , a vast region below North Dakota , Montana and a portion of Canada .
A regional geologist , Kevin Frederick said : " the continual amount of oil in North Dakota is three times as much as Texas .
We 're doing as much as we can to try and get it out . "
Stanley Mayor
Hynek indicates the region is so flush with oil that it is nearly impossible to drill a well and come up dry .
The oil boom has brought people flocking to the area seeking a piece of the action .
They are seeing 20 - year - olds bring in $ 70,000 working the oil field .
A water hauler , Gary Dazell is earning $ 100,000 a year bringing water to the oil field .
One of the Stanley 's fortunate citizens is Herb Geving , who has struck it rich with three oil wells .
He acknowledges that people have always known there was oil under their land but technology made it difficult to harvest .
Foreign oil used to be cheaper than the potential cost of drilling in North Dakota .
That was then and this is now .
Technology has improved and the soaring cost of oil has brought new focus to the region .
Real estate in Stanley has skyrocketed .
The average home was $ 30,000 before boom .
The same homes are now going for $ 100,000 .
The town 's population has gone from 1,250 people to 1,600 in the past seven months , causing a temporary housing shortage as more people show up to find work .
A local RV trailer park is also busting at the seams .
Herb has been working his ranch for over 40 years and now smiles broadly when he hits his mailbox once each month to find a whopping check .
The rancher acknowledges that the area was suffering like the rest of the country under a bad economy .
It gives him great pleasure to see that things are turning in a positive direction .
Geving is pleased to be able to plan for the future of family members with his newfound wealth .
He drafted a will recently and will be able to leave 70 family members with a sizable nest egg each .
CNN has dubbed Herb Geving ' North Dakota 's real life Jed Clampett ' - a reference to the 60's hit show The Beverly Hillbillies .
The process of working on an oil rig is not without peril .
OSHA recently investigated the death of a 21 year - old Montana man who was working on a site 11 miles south of Stanley in mid May .
According to sheriff Ken Halvorson , the worker fell after removing a clamp bolt , leading to excessive gas pressure that blew apart some of the equipment .
He was pronounced dead at the scene .
The death of Nathaniel Zinn marked the 11th death of a worker in North Dakota 's oil patch in the past 10 years .

Chrome : Full Metal Jacket Ecosystem
Economic Times , September 12 , 2008 , reported that Google ’s Sergey Brin sees Chrome as a challenger to Microsoft Windows .
The story “ It ’s Not Just IE , Google Is Eyeing Windows ’ Desktop Pie Too ” by Stephen Wildstrom ( Business Week ) is here .
For me the key part of the article is that it puffs up a beta browser into a big bazooka .
The article chastises Google for a flawed initial effort .
I agree .
But the most important statement attributed to Sergey Brin , one of Google ’s founders , was :
“ What we want is a diverse and vibrant ecosystem …
We want several browsers that are viable and substantial choices . ”
Let ’s take this at face value .
Why will the existence of multiple browsers help Google achieve its objective ?
What ’s the rush ?
Internet Explorer and Firefox have market share .
Google is sufficiently realistic about the speed of migration from one browser to another .
Google is taking a long view .
The Google browser is not a browser .
I know this is a different position from the millions of words written about Chrome .
My research suggests that Chrome is a way for Google to bring control to certain applications and operations ; namely , an icon on the desktop that launches a cloud based service .
To the user , there ’s no browser present .
Google ’s patent documents for the Programmable Search Engine suggest that Google will build its own data stores from bits and pieces of existing data .
If this is an accurate reading of the PSE February 2007 patent applications , Google wants to become the semantic Web and probably “ the Internet ” .
Chrome is a puzzle piece , not the solution to the puzzle .
Chrome adds steroids to some 95 pound weakling issues with Google ’s current enterprise offerings .
Think “ air lock ” between the organization and the Google cloud .
Agree ?
Disagree ?
Send me your facts .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Pregnant women who live through wars are more likely to give birth to a child who develops schizophrenia , U.S. researchers reported on Thursday in a study linking prenatal stress with the mental illness .

Babies born to women who were in their second month of pregnancy during the height of the 1967 Arab - Israeli “ Six - Day ” War were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia as adults , they found .
Similar patterns are likely among many stressed women , said Dr. Dolores Malaspina of the New York University School of Medicine , who led the study .
“ The stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane , a terrorist attack , or a sudden bereavement , ” Malaspina said in a statement .
Writing in the BioMed Central journal BMC Psychiatry , the researchers said they studied data from 88,829 people born in Jerusalem from 1964 to 1976 .
“ The raw data suggest a two - to three - fold excess of schizophrenia in the cohort born in January 1968 , whose mothers would have been in the second month of pregnancy in June 1967 , ” they wrote .
“ The population of Jerusalem would have been most stressed during the three days of bombardment on June 5 - 7 . ”
Because the war was so short , they consider the situation a natural experiment .
Now the team is looking to see if perhaps people with a genetic predisposition were more or less likely to be affected .
It may not necessarily be the case , said Karine Kleinhaus , also of NYU , who worked on the study .
“ The hypothesis is that it may induce epigenetic changes , but we did n’t look at blood here , ” Kleinhaus said in a telephone interview .
Epigenetic changes affect how a gene works , but not the DNA sequence itself .
Schizophrenia , which affects about 1.1 percent of the population globally , is know to have some genetic causes but many cases have no known family links .
“ It could affect people without a family history , ” Kleinhaus said .
Several studies show that stress in pregnancy can lead to type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure and other types of heart disease in the offspring .
In this study , the effects were seen more in women than in men , with females who had been in their second month of gestation during the conflict 4.3 times more likely to develop schizophrenia than females born at other times .
Males were 1.2 times more likely to develop schizophrenia if their mothers were pregnant during the war .
“ The placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother .
These hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war , ” Malaspina said .
Some evidence suggests that male fetuses are more likely to be miscarried if the mother is stressed , so it may be that female fetuses survive with the damage that eventually leads to schizophrenia , the researchers said .

Sales of electric bikes have spun into high gear this year â€ ” some merchants like Amazon are reporting a 6000 % increase this summer from last year .
This is good news , because , for short trips , the efficiency and convenience of electric bikes is hard to beat .
Here are some statistics that still amaze me : 40 % of all trips are made within two miles of the home , and 50 % of workers commute five miles or less to work .
I recently heard about an inexpensive electric bike conversion kit that appears to be of good quality .
Itâ€™s offered by a family - run company called AmpedBikes .
You will have to provide your own batteries â€ ” hereâ€™s a FAQ page with some suggestions for finding them ( scroll to the bottom ) .

Getting Your Financial Assets Out Of The U.S. Protecting what you own and making sure it is available to you in your new home
If you have an IRA , a 401( k ) , RRSP , pension fund , savings account or other monetary assets in the United States , you will probably want to move them offshore to protect yourself from the declining value of the dollar , and the meltdown of the U.S. economy that is sure to follow in the wake of America 's enormous budget and trade deficits .
You 're going to be living in a foreign economy and paying for everything in a foreign currency , so the dollar exchange rate matters to you much more than it does to the average American living at home .
For this reason , you will need to prepare yourself , before you leave , to begin to transfer your assets out of the U.S. and into an offshore bank account or other financial instrument so your funds will be readily available to you as you need them .
This will require some advance planning , as it can have some serious consequences for you , particularly in terms of taxes and ease of transfer of the funds .
The first thing you need to be aware of is that , as a " U.S. person , " the United States government severely restricts where and under what terms you , as an American , can open a bank account , invest in a mutual or hedge fund , transfer money to and from , and engage in other economic activities that facilitate the protection of and access to your assets .
Ostensibly , this has been done in the name of fighting money laundering , but it has the effect of severely restricting your freedom of financial movement .
For this reason , I would strongly recommend that you discuss your situation with a certified public accountant or certified financial planner , one who is familiar with these issues as they relate to expatriates , and with your investment advisor if you have one .
Between the two of them , they should be able to come up with a plan that enables you to get your money safely out , and into a situation where you can have a reasonable degree of security and ready access to it .
There are at least two creative methods of quickly getting your money out of the States , regardless of the amount : Perth Mint Certificates and Swiss annuities .
A Perth Mint Certificate is a depository receipt for your purchase of gold .
You buy the certificate in the United States from an authorized dealer , and leave the physical gold on deposit with the Gold Corporation , a corporation that is owned by the government of the State of Western Australia and is located in that state 's capital , Perth .
Since the certificate is legally merely a " receipt , " it is neither cash nor a negotiable monetary instrument , and therefore need not be declared for customs or treasury purposes .
Once you arrive in your new destination , you then sell the certificate to an authorized dealer nearest your destination , outside the U.S.
There are authorized dealers in Panama , the Bahamas , Australia , Singapore , Indonesia , and Switzerland where this can be done .
The dealer then wires the proceeds to your new bank account in your new home .
Note that your new bank account should be a non -dollar account , and the transfer should be denominated in a non-dollar currency ; otherwise , the transfer , if greater than $ 5000 , will likely be routed through the United States anyway , and will be subjected to examination and approval by U.S. Federal Reserve .
See below .
The Swiss annuity is a refundable annuity contract you buy from a Swiss insurance company through an authorized broker .
Most Swiss annuity contracts can be cashed in at any time ; so you buy it in the States , and when you arrive in your destination country , you notify your broker that you would like to cash it in , and have him wire the proceeds to your new bank ( see the comments in the paragraph above about the wire transfer ) .
I am not in a position to be able to recommend any of the hundreds of Swiss insurance brokers ; you can do a Google search and find dozens of their web sites .
Because it is a contract , it is a non-negotiable document ( an asset , not a money instrument ) and since it is n't a monetary instrument , it need not be declared to a customs inspector or reported to the U.S. treasury .
Since Swiss annuities can be denominated in a range of currencies , and Perth Certificates are based on the value of gold , they are both also good vehicles to guard against the decline of the value of the dollar while you are in the process of moving your money .
Some of the mechanics of moving money around of which you should be aware :
Other countries cooperate closely with the United States in restricting what " U.S. Persons " can do with regards to bank accounts and investments , as well as wire transfers involving U.S. dollars .
Foreign countries and banks have little choice - so they will frequently restrict what types of bank accounts you , as a U.S. Person , can set up , what kinds of securities you can invest in , and how much money you can transfer in and out of your local bank account , and where it can come from or go to .
Check with the banks in the destination country when you are on your exploratory trip , on what they will let you , as a U.S. Person , do .
This is very important !
Once you , as a U.S. Person , own or have signatory authority over any foreign bank account (s ) , you are required by U.S. law to report the details on any and all of them to the U.S. Treasury Dept. on Treasury form TDF 90.22 by the end of June each year , every year .
This requirement will remain , regardless of the balance in that account , for as long as you remain a U.S. person and a signatory on such an account , regardless of where you are resident .
Another reason why you want to drop that U.S. passport just as soon as you possibly can !
The United States has imposed reporting restrictions on any wire transfer of more than $ 5,000 involving a U.S. bank .
So you thought buying a house involved a lot of paperwork ?
Wait till you see what is in store for you if you try to transfer more than five grand in or out of the U.S. !
Offshore , the paperwork is usually much less , but that does n't help you if you are in the States or wish to retain the privacy of your transactions .
It is best to liquidate all your real estate assets before you leave .
Selling property from abroad entails all manner of subtle risks and tax consequences , both at home and abroad , and it can be exceedingly difficult to do in a fully secure manner .
So it is best to dump not just your house , but that rattletrap rental and the Arizona cactus you own before you go .
Many third world countries do not honor credit cards , and getting a cash advance on a credit card can be difficult or impossible .
In countries where corruption is a problem , credit cards are often limited in availability and acceptance , so do n't figure that you can plastic your way around foreign countries like you are used to in the States , except , if you 're lucky , in the classier tourist venues .
Better be prepared to pay cash for everything .
I paid cash for my car and even my house when I moved to Costa Rica .
This is why a local bank account is so vitally important - in many countries , bills , big and small , are often paid by making transfers from your account to the creditor 's account - so make sure it is possible for you , as an American , to open one .
Checks are surprisingly well accepted in most parts of the world , but figure that you wo n't have access to your purchase for as much as two months .
They take an enormous amount of time to clear - not because the process is time consuming for the bank , but because the bank likes to use your money for free for as long as they think they can reasonably justify .
Dollar checks on U.S. banks , for example , take 45 days to clear in Costa Rica - even though they will typically be debited from your U.S. account within three days .
Many foreign banks do not guarantee the security of wire transfers .
Most will happily perform them - for a price , of course - but they do n't guarantee the success or security of the transfer .
Best to transfer money in relatively small amounts , several times as needed , to get the sums transferred that you require .
Small transfers usually go through much more quickly and cleanly than large ones .
Also , keep in mind that $ 5,000 limit in the States - and expect to fill out paperwork in the foreign country as well , if the transfer is larger than $ 5,000 .

Most foreign banks are not insured , and many are quite risky .
To some degree , you can protect yourself through diversity - have your money in several banks and keep an eye on the stability of each of them .
Big granite buildings and marble lobbies are not an indication of the soundness of the bank or the liquidity of the banking system - just ask the Argentinians .
If you are going to be living in the third world , it is best to keep your money in a secure offshore bank ( such as a Channel Islands bank ) , and transfer it into the country as needed and only when needed .
Having it in several banks will ensure that if one gets placed in receivership and the accounts are frozen , you can still get cash to live on .
Wire transfers denominated in U.S. dollars that involve more than $ 5,000 in most cases are transfered through the United States routinely , through correspondent banks in the States , and must be approved by the Federal Reserve Bank , even if neither the sending nor receiving bank is American .
This process greatly complicates the logistics of the transfer as well as reducing its security , because many more entities are handling the transfer .
This means your big transfer can take several weeks , while the Federal Reserve gets around to approving the transfer .
I know of one person who waited three weeks for a transfer of only $ 13,000 to be completed - and almost lost her home as a result of the delay .
One more reason to get those assets offshore and denominated in another currency .
You can usually manage to transfer up to $ 5,000 every two weeks indefinitely without invoking a reporting requirement .
This might be a way to get some money out , but if the amount is very large , it might take awhile .
You may have to arrange for automatic transfers if your bank will do this for you .
Better to use one of the methods mentioned above to get it all out quickly .
Since the U.S. government severely restricts what U.S. persons can do in terms of bank accounts and investments abroad , best to check with your certified public accountant regarding what restrictions are in place in the country of your destination before you commit to moving there .
Carrying large amounts of cash or negotiable monetary instruments on your person across international borders is exceedingly risky .
Besides the robbery problem , most countries require that you declare money you are carrying , larger than a certain dollar amount , and any non-cash negotiable monetary instruments regardless of denominated amount of those instruments .
If this ends up being significantly more than the minimum reporting requirement , expect to be hassled by the customs authorities going into the country of your destination .
You should expect to have to answer some questions .
In fact , a lot of questions .
And if you are entering a third - world country , do n't be surprised to be relieved of your instruments as a price for your continued freedom .

Buses are rolling in the Radnor School District for the first time in months .
Students started to return Tuesday for in - person classes as the district transitions from all virtual to hybrid learning .
Jason Haist 's arrival in the U.S. was a complete accident .
After nearly drowning in rapids on the Niagara River , he washed ashore on American soil , where he was promptly informed he faced charges for entering the country illegally and could be detained for up to three weeks while officials try to determine his intentions .
Before departing Queenston on a Sea - Doo around 10 a.m. Saturday , Haist , 28 , called the U.S. Coast Guard to ask whether he was free to roam the water around the Queenston - Lewiston bridge near Niagara - on - the - Lake , one of the busiest points of entry between Canada and the U.S.
He said officials told him as long as he did n't dock on U.S. land , it would n't be anything illegal .
" There were no signs indicating that we were n't allowed to go upstream , " Haist told the Star in a phone interview from New York state , where he remains at an immigration detention facility .
Tour boats , departing from Niagara - on - the - Lake , regularly cruise the same waters , but do not dock on U.S. territory .
Haist said he and a group of friends departed from a dock on Princess St. in Queenston .
Still traumatized from his near - drowning , Haist said he does n't remember exactly what happened after that but thinks he travelled south to the Whirlpool Rapids , where he was tossed into the swirling water .
" All he remembered was he went under with the Jet Ski , then the Jet Ski took off and he went down with the current , " his partner , Catherine Kerr , said at their Toronto home .
Haist 's lungs filled with water and he was knocked unconscious .
His cousin , Edward Haist , 21 , tried to save Jason , but could n't get to him , Kerr said .
Boaters in the area called for help .
" That 's when the Coast Guard got involved , " Kerr said .
Jason was taken to hospital and Edward was arrested by Border Patrol officials , supervisory U.S. Border Patrol agent Jason Ciliberti confirmed yesterday .
Jason was taken to Mount St. Mary 's Hospital in Lewiston , NY , a hospital spokesperson confirmed .
Jason Haist , who was put on an IV drip after having fluid pumped from his lungs , said he could hear a border official using a walkie - talkie outside his hospital room .
" He was on machines all night , " Kerr said .
Haist was discharged from the hospital around 3 a.m. and arrested shortly after .
" He told them , ' I almost died .
I did n't plan on washing up on your land , ' " Kerr said .
The men will remain in custody at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility until they can appear before an immigration judge .
" They 're here illegally , " Ciliberti said , because they turned up at an unauthorized point of entry , a U.S. customs violation .
It does n't help Haist 's case that he did n't have any identification in his wetsuit .
All he had was his boater 's card , Kerr said .
Ciliberti said the pair received notices to appear before a judge and explain their circumstances .
If they choose to cancel the notice to appear and return to Canada voluntarily , Ciliberti said , " you 're admitting you 're in the States illegally . "
And if they do n't appear , they will be deported and denied entry to the U.S. for at least five years .
Ciliberti said the circumstances surrounding Haist 's case are " extremely rare , " but added he could not comment on specifics due to privacy legislation .
He added that if they did not intend to enter the country illegally , it may make a difference in their case .
Ciliberti said the wait times for cases vary , but said he did n't believe this case would take three weeks .
A spokesperson with Canadian Foreign Affairs could not be reached yesterday for comment .
" They said he could be there as long as three weeks , we do n't know how busy they are , " Kerr said .
Yesterday , Kerr received a call from the wife of another detainee of the facility where Haist is being held . .
" She told me he was under distress , " she said .
" She said they 're gonna take their time , no matter how much you push . "
Kerr is taking time off her job at Swiss Chalet , work she needs more than ever to pay for hospital and lawyers ' bills , to drive to Buffalo and deliver money , I.D. and fresh clothes to her partner , who she says suffers from severe anxiety .
" I can't sleep , I 'm so worried about his safety and health ... I keep telling him to relax and calm down so he does n't stress himself . "

Haist said his doctor told him , " I can't believe they 're doing that .
You had water in your lungs and you almost died . "

A controversial new US tactic to mount counter - terrorist operations inside Pakistan has met with fresh hostility , it emerged yesterday , as Pakistani tribesmen representing half a million people vowed to switch sides and join the Taliban if Washington does not stop cross - border attacks by its forces from Afghanistan .
Reacting to American missile attacks in north Waziristan last week , which followed an unprecedented cross - border ground assault earlier this month , tribal chiefs from the area called an emergency meeting on Saturday .
" If America does n't stop attacks in tribal areas , we will prepare a lashkar [ army ] to attack US forces in Afghanistan , " tribal chief Malik Nasrullah announced in Miran Shah , north Waziristan 's largest city .
" We will also seek support from the tribal elders in Afghanistan to fight jointly against America . "
The development threatens to widen the conflict , with previously moderate people from Pakistan 's tribal border region with Afghanistan in danger of joining Taliban militants based in the area .
They have reacted furiously to intensified American missile attacks on targets in the tribal territory in recent weeks .
The issue is likely to feature in talks between Gordon Brown and Pakistan 's new president , Asif Ali Zardari , this week .
Zardari , who is on a private visit to Britain , is due to meet Brown tomorrow .
The prime minister is likely to press for greater Pakistani action against militants in the tribal area and may go along with US calls to integrate the tribal territory into the conflict in Afghanistan as one theatre of war , an idea Pakistan will fiercely resist .
Zardari and Pakistan 's prime minister , Yousaf Raza Gilani , said in a joint statement at the weekend : " The sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country should be respected at all cost . "
During the past month , there have been seven US missile strikes in the tribal area , about the same number as in the whole of last year .
A US ground assault in south Waziristan provoked a sharp rebuke from the Pakistan army .
Washington believes that Taliban and al - Qaida militants fighting the western coalition in Afghanistan are using Pakistan 's tribal area as a safe haven .
But Ayaz Wazir , a retired Pakistani diplomat who is a tribal chief from south Waziristan , warned : " If the Americans are coming to sort it out with force , they would create more enemies .
The Americans might have supersonic jets and we might have to fight with stones in our hands , but we will stand up . "
Up to now , only a tiny minority of the tribesmen have joined the Pakistani or Afghan Taliban movements , but incursions by the US could ignite the area .
The heightened US activity comes just as some Pakistani tribes have risen against the Taliban in the border areas of Dir and Bajaur .
But hatred of America would far surpass any dislike for Islamic extremists .
Two years after the breakup of the Soviet Union , British economist Paul Seabright was talking with a senior Russian official who was visiting the UK to learn about the free market .
“ Please understand that we are keen to move towards a market system , ” the official said , “ But we need to understand the fundamental details of how such a system works .
Tell me , for example : who is in charge of the supply of bread to the population of London ? ” [ 1 ]
The familiar but still astonishing answer to this question is that in a market economy , everyone is in charge .
As the market price of bread goes up and down , it informs our collective behaviour : whether to plant a new wheat field , or leave it fallow ; whether to open that new bakery you ’ve been thinking about opening on the corner ; or simply whether to buy two or three loaves of bread this week .
The price thus aggregates an enormous amount of what would otherwise be hidden knowledge from all the people interested in the production or consumption of bread , that is , nearly everyone .
By using prices to aggregate this knowledge and inform further actions , the market produces outcomes superior to even the brightest and best informed individuals .
Unfortunately , markets do n’t always aggregate knowledge accurately .
When participants in a market are mistaken in systematic ways , markets do n’t so much aggregate knowledge as they aggregate misunderstanding .
The result can be an enormous collective error in judgement ; when the misjudgement is revealed , the market crashes .
My subject in this essay is not economics , it ’s science .
So what ’s all this got to do with science ?
The connection involves the question of what it means to understand something .
In economics , many basic facts , such as prices , have an origin which is n’t completely understood by any single person , no matter how bright or well informed , because none of those people have access to all the hidden knowledge that determines those prices .
By contrast , until quite recently the complete justification for even the most complex scientific facts could be understood by a single person .
Consider , for example , astronomer Edwin Hubble ’s discovery in the 1920s of the expansion of the Universe .
By the standards of the time , this was big science , requiring a complex web of sophisticated scientific ideas and equipment – an advanced telescope , spectroscopic equipment , and even Einstein ’s special theory of relativity .
To understand all those things in detail requires years of hard work , but a dedicated person like Hubble could master it all , and so in some sense he completely understood his own discovery of the expansion of the Universe .
Science is no longer so simple ; many important scientific facts now have justifications that are beyond the comprehension of a single person .
For example , in 1983 mathematicians announced the solution of an important longstanding mathematical problem , the classification of the finite simple groups .
The work on this mathematical proof extended between 1955 and 1983 , and required approximately 500 journal articles by 100 mathematicians .
Many minor gaps were subsequentely found in the proof , and at least one serious gap , now thought ( by some ) to be resolved ; the resolution involved a two - volume , 1300 - page supplement to the proof .
Although mathematicians are working to simplify the proof , even the simplified proof is expected to be exceedingly complex , beyond the grasp of any single person .
The understanding of results from the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) will be similarly challenging , requiring a deep knowledge of elementary particle physics , many clever ideas in the engineering of the accelerator and the particle detectors , and complex algorithms and statistical techniques .
No single person understands all of this , except in broad detail .
If the discovery of the Higgs particle is announced next year , there wo n’t be any single person in the world who can say “ I understand how we discovered this ” in the same way Hubble understood how he discovered the expansion of the Universe .
Instead , there will be a large group of people who collectively claim to understand all the separate pieces that go into the discovery , and how those pieces fit together .
Two clarifications are in order .
First , when I say that these are examples of scientific facts beyond individual understanding , I ’m not saying a single person ca n’t understand the meaning of the facts .
Understanding what the Higgs particle is requires several years hard work , but there are many people in the world who ’ve done this work and who have a solid grasp of what the Higgs is .
I ’m talking about a deeper type of understanding , the understanding that comes from understanding the justification of the facts .
Second , I do n’t mean that to understand something you need to have mastered all the rote details .
If we require that kind of mastery , then there ’s no one person who understands the human genome , for certainly no - one has memorized the entire DNA sequence .
But there are people who understand deeply all the techniques used to determine the human genome ; all that is missing from their understanding is the rote work identifying all the DNA base pairs .
The examples of the LHC and the classification of the finite simple groups go beyond this , for in both cases there are many distinct deep ideas involved , too many to be mastered by any single person .
Science as complex as the LHC and the classification of finite simple groups is a recent arrival on the historical scene .
But there are two forces that will soon make science beyond individual understanding far more common .
The first of these forces is rapid internet - fueled growth in the number of large - scale scientific collaborations .
In the short term , these collaborations will mostly just crowdsource rote work , as is being done , for example , by the galaxy classification project Galaxy Zoo , and so the results will pose no challenge to individual understanding .
But as the collaborations get more sophisticated we can expect to see many more online collaborations that delegate large amounts of specialized work , building up to a whole whose details are n’t fully understood by any single person .
The second of these forces is the use of computers to do scientific work .
A nascent example is the proof of the four - colour theorem in mathematics .
A small group of mathematicians outlined a proof , but to complete the proof , they had to check a large number of cases of the theorem , more than they could check by hand .
Instead , a computer was used to check those cases .
This is n’t an instance of science beyond individual understanding , though , because mathematicians familiar with the proof feel the computer was simply doing rote work .
But the people doing computational science are getting cleverer in how they use computers to make discoveries .
Machine learning , data mining and artificial intellgience techniques are being used in increasingly sophisticated ways to produce real insights , not just rote work .
As the techniques get better , the number of insights found will increase , and we can expect to see examples of science beyond individual understanding generated this way : “ I do n’t understand how this discovery was made , but my computer and I do together ” .
More powerful than either of these forces will be their combination : large - scale computer - assisted collaboration .
The discoveries from such collaboration may well not be understood by any single individual , or even by a group .
Instead , it will reside inside a combination of the group and their networked computers .
Such scientific discoveries raise challenging issues .
How do we know whether they ’re right or wrong ?
The traditional process of peer review and the criterion of reproducibility work well when experiments are cheap , and one scientist can explain to another what was done .
But they do n’t work so well as experiments get more expensive , when no one person fully understands how an experiment was done , and when experiments and their analyses involve reams of data or ideas .
Might we one day find ourselves in a situation like in a free market where systematic misunderstandings can infect our collective conclusions ?
How can we be sure the results of large - scale collaborations or computing projects are reliable ?
Are there results from this kind of science that are already widely believed , maybe even influencing public policy , but are , in fact , wrong ?
These questions bother me a lot .
I believe wholeheartedly that new tools for online collaboration are going to change and improve how science is done .
But such collaborations will be no good if we ca n’t assess the reliability of the results .
And it would disastrous if erroneous results were to have a major impact on public policy .
We ’re in for a turbulent and interesting period as scientists think through what ’s needed to arrive at reliable scientific conclusions in the age of big collaborations .

Another child has died because his parents put faith ahead of common sense :
Their son , 16 - year - old Neil Jeffrey Beagley , died June 17 of complications from a urinary - tract blockage .
A deputy state medical examiner said the boy apparently suffered for years from the intensely painful but medically treatable condition .
The blockage ultimately caused kidney failure , uremic poisoning and heart failure , according to autopsy results .
When Neil Beagley died at his grandmother ’s Gladstone home , he was surrounded by dozens of church and family members .
Some of those present told police that Neil Beagley , despite his prolonged suffering , chose faith healing over medical care .
…
After Beagley died , a medical examiner ruled his death could have been prevented had his family taken him to a doctor .
Based upon findings from the grand jury , the Clackamas County Circuit Court issued arrest warrants Wednesday for Jeffrey Dean Beagley and Marci Rae Beagley in connection with their son ’s death .
Today , Neil ’s parents turned themselves in to authorities .
They face charges of “ criminally negligent homicide . ”
This death should n’t be a shock to their church .
They ’re used to their youth dying unnecessarily :
According to a 1998 analysis by The Oregonian , at least 21 of the dozens of children buried since the 1950s in the Followers of Christ church cemetery south of Oregon City could have been saved by medical intervention .
None of the deaths from that era resulted in prosecution .
Let ’s hope the parents get locked away for a long time and at least some members of the church come to their senses and get the hell out of there .

EVIAN , FRANCE
PREPARE for a new America :
That ’s the message that the Rev. Jesse Jackson conveyed to participants in the first World Policy Forum , held at this French lakeside resort last week .
He promised “ fundamental changes ” in US foreign policy – saying America must “ heal wounds ” it has caused to other nations , revive its alliances and apologize for the “ arrogance of the Bush administration . ”
The most important change would occur in the Middle East , where “ decades of putting Israel ’s interests first ” would end .
Jackson believes that , although “ Zionists who have controlled American policy for decades ” remain strong , they ’ll lose a great deal of their clout when Barack Obama enters the White House .
“ Obama is about change , ” Jackson told me in a wide - ranging conversation .
“ And the change that Obama promises is not limited to what we do in America itself .
It is a change of the way America looks at the world and its place in it . ”
Jackson warns that he is n’t an Obama confidant or adviser , “ just a supporter . ”
But he adds that Obama has been “ a neighbor or , better still , a member of the family . ”
Jackson ’s son has been a close friend of Obama for years , and Jackson ’s daughter went to school with Obama ’s wife Michelle .
“ We helped him start his career , ” says Jackson .
“ And then we were always there to help him move ahead .
He is the continuation of our struggle for justice not only for the black people but also for all those who have been wronged . ”
Will Obama ’s election close the chapter of black grievances linked to memories of slavery ?
The reverend takes a deep breath and waits a long time before responding .
“ No , that chapter wo n’t be closed , ” he says .
“ However , Obama ’s victory will be a huge step in the direction we have wanted America to take for decades . ”
Jackson rejects any suggestion that Obama was influenced by Marxist ideas in his youth .
“ I see no evidence of that , ” he says .
“ Obama ’s thirst for justice and equality is rooted in his black culture . ”
But is Obama – who ’s not a descendant of slaves – truly a typical American black ?
Jackson emphatically answers yes : “ You do n’t need to be a descendant of slaves to experience the oppression , the suffocating injustice and the ugly racism that exists in our society , ” he says .
“ Obama experienced the same environment as all American blacks did .
It was nonsense to suggest that he was somehow not black enough to feel the pain . ”
Is Jackson worried about the “ Bradley effect ” – that people may be telling pollsters they favor the black candidate , but wo n’t end up voting for him ?
“ I do n’t think this is how things will turn out , ” he says .
“ We have a collapsing economy and a war that we have lost in Iraq .
In Afghanistan , we face a resurgent Taliban .
New threats are looming in Pakistan .
Our liberties have been trampled under feet . . .
Today , most Americans want change , and know that only Barack can deliver what they want .
Young Americans are especially determined to make sure that Obama wins . ”
He sees a broad public loss of confidence in the nation ’s institutions : “ We have lost confidence in our president , our Congress , our banking system , our Wall Street and our legal system to protect our individual freedoms .
. .
I do n’t see how we could regain confidence in all those institutions without a radical change of direction . ”
Jackson declines to be more concrete about possible policy changes .
After all , he insists , he is n’t part of Obama ’s policy team .
Yet he clearly hopes that his views , reflecting the position of many Democrats , would be reflected in the policies of an Obama administration .
On the economic front , he hopes for “ major changes in our trading policy . ”
“ We cannot continue with the open - door policy , ” he says .
“ We need to protect our manufacturing industry against unfair competition that destroys American jobs and creates ill - paid jobs abroad . ”
Would that mean an abrogation of the NAFTA treaty with Canada and Mexico ?
Jackson dismisses the question as “ premature ” : “ We could do a great deal without such dramatic action . ”
His most surprising position concerns Iraq .
He passionately denounces the toppling of Saddam Hussein as “ an illegal and unjust act . ”
But he ’s now sure that the United States “ will have to remain in Iraq for a very long time . ”
What of Obama ’s promise to withdraw by 2010 ?
Jackson believes that position will have to evolve , reflecting “ realities on the ground . ”
“ We should work with our allies in Iraq to consolidate democratic institutions there , ” he says .
“ We must help the people of Iraq decide and shape their future in accordance with their own culture and faith . ”
On Iran , he strongly supports Obama ’s idea of opening a direct dialogue with the leadership in Tehran .
“ We ’ve got to talk to tell them what we want and hear what they want , ” Jackson says .
“ Nothing is gained by not talking to others . ”
Would that mean ignoring the four UN Security Council resolutions that demand an end to Iran ’s uranium - enrichment program ?
Jackson says direct talks would n’t start without preparations .
“ Barack wants an aggressive and dynamic diplomacy , ” he says .
“ He also wants adequate preparatory work .
We must enter the talks after the ground has been prepared , ” he says .
Jackson is especially critical of President Bush ’s approach to the Israel - Palestine conflict .
“ Bush was so afraid of a snafu and of upsetting Israel that he gave the whole thing a miss , ” Jackson says .
“ Barack will change that , ” because , as long as the Palestinians have n’t seen justice , the Middle East will “ remain a source of danger to us all . ”
“ Barack is determined to repair our relations with the world of Islam and Muslims , ” Jackson says .
“ Thanks to his background and ecumenical approach , he knows how Muslims feel while remaining committed to his own faith . ”
Amir Taheri ’s next book , “ The Persian Night : Iran Under the Khomeinist Revolution , ” is due out next month .
Starting with the so - called Anti-Drug Abuse Act in 1988 , the IRS has possessed this authority temporarily , with occasional multiple - year lapses .
A 1999 internal report said the IRS had 126 " trained undercover agents " working in field offices at the time .
This is the first time that such undercover authority would be made permanent .
Even worse are the IRS agents who engage in undercover drug transactions so they can bust drug dealers for failing to report income .
Every law enforcement agency wants a piece of the drug war , but for the IRS to get involved is ridiculous misuse of resources .
( And an ineffective means of tax collection , since drug dealers rarely save money that can be used to pay back taxes . )
We do n't need IRS sting operations .
There is no shortage of tax evasion schemes for agents to pursue without trying to sting taxpayers into committing new crimes .
Increasing the audits of the wealthy taxpayers who are most likely to abuse the system would be a more reasonable approach to tax crime enforcement .
DENVER  Senator John McCain is giving up on his efforts to win the state of Michigan , his campaign said Thursday , in the latest sign that the faltering economy has reshaped the presidential race and cost Mr. McCain support in crucial states .
Ceding Michigan is a major blow to the McCain campaign , which had spent heavily on television commercials there and where Mr. McCain had campaigned repeatedly in the hopes that he could appeal to enough blue - collar voters , so - called Reagan Democrats and independent voters , to bring the state back into the Republican column in November .
But as the rippling financial crisis shook up the presidential election , and Mr. McCain ’s somewhat unsteady response to it appeared to cost him support in a number of recent polls of battleground states , his campaign decided to pull out of Michigan and redirect its resources to other swing states where they felt Mr. McCain had a better chance .
The McCain campaign has spent nearly $ 8 million on ads in Michigan , according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group , a company that monitors political advertising , and now it has no more plans to advertise there , campaign officials said .
And Mr. McCain canceled a visit he had planned to make to Michigan next week .
In the information age , we all have a data shadow .
We leave data everywhere we go .
It 's not just our bank accounts and stock portfolios , or our itemized bills , listing every credit card purchase and telephone call we make .
It 's automatic road - toll collection systems , supermarket affinity cards , ATMs and so on .
It 's also our lives .
Our love letters and friendly chat .
Our personal e-mails and SMS messages .
Our business plans , strategies and offhand conversations .
Our political leanings and positions .
And this is just the data we interact with .
We all have shadow selves living in the data banks of hundreds of corporations ' information brokers – information about us that is both surprisingly personal and uncannily complete – except for the errors that you can neither see nor correct .
What happens to our data happens to ourselves .
This shadow self does n't just sit there :
It 's constantly touched .
It 's examined and judged .
When we apply for a bank loan , it 's our data that determines whether or not we get it .
When we try to board an airplane , it 's our data that determines how thoroughly we get searched – or whether we get to board at all .
If the government wants to investigate us , they 're more likely to go through our data than they are to search our homes ; for a lot of that data , they do n't even need a warrant .
Who controls our data controls our lives .
It 's true .
Whoever controls our data can decide whether we can get a bank loan , on an airplane or into a country .
Or what sort of discount we get from a merchant , or even how we 're treated by customer support .
A potential employer can , illegally in the U.S. , examine our medical data and decide whether or not to offer us a job .
The police can mine our data and decide whether or not we 're a terrorist risk .
If a criminal can get hold of enough of our data , he can open credit cards in our names , siphon money out of our investment accounts , even sell our property .
Identity theft is the ultimate proof that control of our data means control of our life .
We need to take back our data .
Our data is a part of us .
It 's intimate and personal , and we have basic rights to it .
It should be protected from unwanted touch .
We need a comprehensive data privacy law .
This law should protect all information about us , and not be limited merely to financial or health information .
It should limit others ' ability to buy and sell our information without our knowledge and consent .
It should allow us to see information about us held by others , and correct any inaccuracies we find .
It should prevent the government from going after our information without judicial oversight .
It should enforce data deletion , and limit data collection , where necessary .
And we need more than token penalties for deliberate violations .
This is a tall order , and it will take years for us to get there .
It 's easy to do nothing and let the market take over .
But as we see with things like grocery store club cards and click - through privacy policies on websites , most people either do n't realize the extent their privacy is being violated or do n't have any real choice .
And businesses , of course , are more than happy to collect , buy , and sell our most intimate information .
But the long - term effects of this on society are toxic ; we give up control of ourselves .

TRENTON -- The Human Services Police Department ( HSPD ) and the Division of Mental Health Services are again seeking the public 's help in trying to identify a woman who has been in state psychiatric hospitals for 14 years .
" We 're hoping that someone recognizes her , " said HSPD Lt. Eduardo Ojeda .
" She may have family or friends who have been worrying for years about her . "
The woman , who is believed to be in her 60s or 70s , and Hispanic , was first brought to Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital in November 1994 after being found wandering inside of Woodbridge Shopping Mall .
She was transferred to Ancora Psychiatric Hospital when Marlboro closed in 1997 and has since been transferred to Hagedorn Psychiatric Hospital .
Though she said her name was Elba Leonor Socarras , authorities were never able to confirm her identity and amnesia has prevented her from sharing any other identifiable information .
She also at times has indicated her name might be Anna .
The woman was well - dressed and wearing a wedding ring when she was found .
HSPD has repeatedly checked missing person records , foreign consulates and worked with law enforcement agencies nationwide in an attempt to identify her .
Previous efforts to get the public to provide information also have proved unsuccessful .
She is registered with the New Jersey State Police Missing Persons Unit ; also the Camden County Sheriffs Office worked on the case while she was at Ancora .
" We do n't know if she lived in the area , came in from New York , or from another country , " Ojeda said , noting that DHS is also sending an alert to foreign press outlets .
" We 're hoping the public will help us . "
Anyone with any information that can help to identify the patient is asked to call Ojeda at ( 609 ) 633-3673 .
Let ’s talk about the position property .
I know beginners are curious about this .
Here ’s a question I got recently :
I am fairly new to web design , and have n’t mastered the differences in positioning of elements .
I know there is absolute , fixed , and relative .
Are there any others ?
Also , do they majorly differ ?
And when should you use which ?
Short answer
There are two more : static , which is the default , and sticky , which is a whole fancy thing .
Yes , all of these majorly differ !
Each of them is incredibly useful and which you should use of course depends on the desired result .
Longer answer
An important concept to understand first is that every single element on a web page is a block .
Literally a rectangle of pixels .
This is easy to understand when you set the element to display : block ; or if that element is block - level by default like a < div > .
This means you can set a width and a height and that element will respect that .
But elements that are display : inline ; , like a < span > by default , are also rectangles , they just flow onto the page differently , lining up horizontally as they can .
Now that you are picturing every single page element as a block of pixels , we can talk about how positioning is used to get the blocks of pixels exactly where you want them to go .
.el { position : static ; position : relative ; position : absolute ; position : fixed ; position : sticky ; position : inherit ; }
static
This is the default for every single page element .
Different elements do n’t have different default values for positioning , they all start out as static .
Static does n’t mean much ; it just means that the element will flow into the page as it normally would .
The only reason you would ever set an element to position : static ; is to forcefully remove some positioning that got applied to an element outside of your control .
This is fairly rare , as positioning does n’t cascade .
relative
This type of positioning is probably the most confusing and misused .
What it really means is “ relative to itself ” .
If you set position : relative ; on an element but no other positioning attributes ( top , left , bottom or right ) , it will have no effect on it ’s positioning at all , it will be exactly as it would be if you left it as position : static ;
But if you do give it some other positioning attribute , say , top : 10 px ; , it will shift its position 10 pixels down from where it would normally be .
I ’m sure you can imagine , the ability to shift an element around based on its regular position is pretty useful .
I find myself using this to line up form elements many times that have a tendency to not want to line up how I want them to .
There are two other things that happen when you set position : relative ; on an element that you should be aware of .
One is that it introduces the ability to use z- index on that element , which does n’t work with statically positioned elements .
Even if you do n’t set a z - index value , this element will now appear on top of any other statically positioned element .
You ca n’t fight it by setting a higher z - index value on a statically positioned element .
The other thing that happens is it limits the scope of absolutely positioned child elements .
Any element that is a child of the relatively positioned element can be absolutely positioned within that block .
This brings up some powerful opportunities which I talk about here .
absolute
This is a very powerful type of positioning that allows you to literally place any page element exactly where you want it .
You use the positioning attributes top , left , bottom , and right to set the location .
Remember that these values will be relative to the next parent element with relative ( or absolute ) positioning .
If there is no such parent , it will default all the way back up to the < html > element itself meaning it will be placed relative to the page itself .
The trade - off ( and most important thing to remember ) about absolute positioning is that these elements are removed from the flow of elements on the page .
An element with this type of positioning is not affected by other elements and it does n’t affect other elements .
This is a serious thing to consider every time you use absolute positioning .
Its overuse or improper use can limit the flexibility of your site .
fixed
A fixed position element is positioned relative to the viewport , or the browser window itself .
The viewport does n’t change when the window is scrolled , so a fixed positioned element will stay right where it is when the page is scrolled .
This might be used for something like a navigation bar that you want to remain visible at all times regardless of the pages scroll position .
The concern with fixed positioning is that it can cause situations where the fixed element overlaps content such that is is inaccessible .
The trick is having enough space to avoid that , and tricks like this .
sticky
Sticky positioning is really unique !
A sticky element will just sit there like a static element , but as you scroll past it , if it ’s parent element has room ( usually : extra height ) the sticky element will behave as if it ’s fixed until that parent element is out of room .
It sounds weird in words like that , but it ’s easy to see what ’s happening in a demo .

MANCHESTER , New Hampshire ( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama 's spokesman on Saturday accused Sen. John McCain of " cynically running the sleaziest and least honorable campaign in modern presidential campaign history . "
Obama , speaking to a crowd Saturday in Manchester , New Hampshire , said , " John McCain wants to have a debate about national security ; let 's have that debate .
I warned that going into Iraq would distract us from Afghanistan .
John McCain cheerleaded for it .
John McCain was wrong , and I was right . "

"
McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds criticized Obama for showing " zero restraint " given the storm and said the " attacks mark a new low from Barack Obama . "
The Obama campaign 's response was even tougher .
" We will take no lectures from John McCain , who is cynically running the sleaziest and least honorable campaign in modern presidential campaign history , " said Obama spokesman Bill Burton .
" His discredited ads with disgusting lies are running all over the country today .
He runs a campaign not worthy of the office he is seeking . "
At the start of his rally , Obama did put politics aside , encouraging the thousands in attendance to think about those in Texas dealing with the fallout from Hurricane Ike .

The ad is set to air in Colorado , New Mexico and Nevada , all crucial states in November with significant Hispanic voting populations .

Detroit Free Press columnist :
So Sarah Palin did n’t indulge the critics ’ lowest expectations in her Thursday night debate with Joe Biden .
She did n’t stumble or stammer , commit any awful gaffes or make a fool of herself .
But it ’s only by the shallowest of standards that her performance could be called creditable or impressive .
Palin surfed through the questions by skimming over the topics , offering little in the way of depth , context or understanding .
When she was asked for substance , she too often respond with clichés .
When she was asked something directly , she too often dodged with a change of subject … .
Palin did score some style points with her consistent efforts to connect with ordinary Americans ; she kept her delivery folksy and salted her answers with colloquial phrases and jabs at Washington insiders .
If it had been coupled with any sign that she has given serious thought to the issues that face this country , it would have been a slam dunk win for her .
As it is , her biggest accomplishment was to heighten the fears that she is woefully unprepared for the job she is seeking .

When the New World was discovered , pirates branched out and started stealing loot , or booty if you will , from exotic new places like the Caribbean .
There they were apparently forced to deal with skeleton warriors and family - friendly fights to the death .
Why it Sucked :
Despite what you may think after seeing Kiera Knightley 's extremely well - groomed piratess , the real world of pirates tended to involve a lot more wallowing in filth and near - starvation .
They did n't exactly have refrigerators on the boats , so basically they were restricted to eating the kind of shit that can sit in a barrel for months without rotting into slime .
Hard tack was a staple of a pirate diet , dry biscuits made of flour , water and salt .
They were often eaten in the dark , tapping them on the table a few times to make the weevils crawl out .
When even that was unavailable , they 'd occasionally resort to eating leather or slaves , if they had some handy .
That 's a weevil .
That 's what a weevil is .

It will ‘ be fought in the electromagnetic spectrum ’
July 8 , 2008
Reposted from the G2 Bulletin with permission – The G2 Bulletin is a subscription only news source .
Did the Chinese military cause the largest blackout in the history of North America ?
That is the assertion of Tim Bennett , the former president of the Cyber Security Industry Alliance , who says U.S. intelligence officials confirmed to him the People ’s Liberation Army gained access to a network that controlled electric power systems serving the northeastern U.S. in 2003 .
Some 50 million people were affected by the 9,300 - square - mile blackout that hit parts of New York , Canada , Michigan and Ohio .
The official explanation for the power outage was that overgrown trees came into contact with strained high - voltage lines in Ohio .
But the story of this possible skirmish in the “ electromagnetic spectrum ” is widely whispered about in defense and intelligence circles .
It is referred to by some as the first battle of World War III â€ “ a conflict to be fought asymmetrically in cyberspace and with weapons that might seem like science fiction .
The Moscow newspaper Zavtra reported only a week ago that Russia has developed “ special powerful electromagnetic impulse generators that may be used in design of new type radars and as a basis of electromagnetic weapons that will render enemy electronics inoperable . ”
“ The U.S. Army is convinced meanwhile that the Russians have already designed ‘ kinetic weapons ’ and ‘ directed energy weapons ’ ( apparently lasers ) for ASAT warfare , ” the article continued .
“ In any event , the Americans suspect that the recent episode with the Chinese laser that damaged an American spysat became possible precisely because Moscow had made this technology available to China . ”
The superweapons being developed for the next global conflict began coming into sharper focus last winter when China destroyed one of its own aging , low - Earth - orbit weather satellites while it was circling at an altitude of 500 miles , using a ground - based , direct ascent anti-satellite weapon .
This year , the U.S. , using its sea- based Aegis missile defense system , shot down a disabled American intelligence satellite at 100 or so miles altitude as it tumbled uncontrollably toward the planet .
The Defense Department says China is developing non-kinetic means of attacking satellites , such as jamming and blinding , and using lasers , microwave , particle beam and electromagnetic pulse weapons .
Cyber - warfare , one of the proven strengths of the Chinese military , can also be used as an anti-satellite capability .
In congressional testimony this year , the director of national intelligence stated , “ Counter - command , control and sensor systems , to include communications satellite jammers and ASAT weapons , are among Beijing ’s highest military priorities . ”
Bennett , meanwhile , told the National Journal he believes Chinese cyber - hackers were also responsible for another U.S. blackout last February in Florida â€ “ one that affected 3 million customers .
Bennett told the National Journal he decided to speak publicly about the incidents to point out that security for the nation ’s critical electronic infrastructures is weak and to emphasize that government and company officials have n’t sufficiently acknowledged these vulnerabilities .
The National Journal said a second information - security expert independently corroborated Bennett ’s account of the Florida blackout .
Asked point blank by the National Journal if Washington knew of hacker involvement in the two blackouts , Joel Brenner , the government ’s senior counterintelligence official , said : “ I ca n’t comment on that . ”
But he added , “ It ’s certainly possible that sort of thing could happen .
The kinds of network exploitation one does to explore a network and map it and learn one ’s way around it has to be done whether you are going to steal information , bring down , or corrupt it .
The possible consequences of this behavior are profound . ”
In response to what observers agree is an increasing number of attacks in cyberspace , the U.S. Air Force is in the process of setting up a Cyberspace Command , headed by a two - star general and comprising about 160 individuals assigned to a handful of bases .
It is reportedly dedicated to the proposition that “ the next war will be fought in the electromagnetic spectrum . ”
And the weapons and tactics of that war will not be limited to planting program viruses in computer systems .
According to several sources , the Chinese , Russians , Americans , British and French have all made progress in the development of electro - magnetic pulse weapons and directed - energy weapons .
In May , for instance , the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5658 , the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of 2008 by a vote of 384 to 23 .
The bill included $ 5 million for acceleration of the Directed Energy and Electronic Weapons Systems program and specifically the Electromagnetic Railgun at Dahlgren .
The Railgun was successfully tested last October .
It fires non-explosive projectiles at high speeds , using electricity rather than gun powder .
The technology could increase the striking range of U.S. Navy ships more than tenfold by the year 2020 .
The railgun works by sending electric current along parallel rails , creating an electromagnetic force so powerful it can fire a projectile at tremendous speed .
Another form of new electromagnetic weaponry is the portable EMP device .
These are devices that can be mounted or carried aboard vehicles , aircraft , ships , even missiles .
While the stage of development of such weapons remains a shadowy question , U.S. military as well as foreign military sources suggest America already has portable EMP devices and has at least considered using them in the Afghan and Iraq theaters .
Since these weapons are non-lethal and used mainly to disrupt electronics and communication , their use might not even be detected by enemies .
Portable EMP weapons can be used quickly , irrespective of weather conditions , and against a wide variety of targets with minimal risk to civilian populations .
Some form of EMP weapon would almost assuredly be used in the kind of surprise attack scenarios being developed , for example , against Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
But even Iran is said to be experimenting with EMP weapons .
More than four years after a stunning report about America ’s vulnerability to a nuclear electromagnetic pulse attack was released to Congress , the House Armed Services Committee will hear testimony from the scientist who issued the warning and who believes Iran is pursuing such an option , WorldNetDaily reported today .
William R. Graham , President Reagan ’s top science adviser and the chairman of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse ( EMP ) Attack , will update the committee Thursday morning .
Graham warned in 2005 that Iran was not only covertly developing nuclear weapons , but was already testing ballistic missiles specifically designed to destroy America ’s technical infrastructure with the aim of neutralizing the world ’s lone superpower .
The radical Shiite regime has conducted successful tests to determine if its Shahab - 3 ballistic missiles , capable of carrying a nuclear warhead , can be detonated by a remote - control device while still in high - altitude flight , Graham said in his report .
Graham said then there was no other plausible explanation for such tests than preparation for the deployment of electromagnetic pulse weapons â€ “ even one of which could knock out America ’s critical electrical and technological infrastructure , effectively sending the continental U.S. back to the 19th century with a recovery time of months or years .
Iran would have that capability â€ “ at least theoretically â€ “ as soon as it has one nuclear bomb ready to arm such a missile .
Iran surprised intelligence analysts by describing the mid-flight detonations of missiles fired from ships on the Caspian Sea as “ successful ” tests .
Even primitive Scud missiles could be used for this purpose .
And top U.S. intelligence officials reminded members of Congress that there is a glut of these missiles on the world market .
They are currently being bought and sold for about $ 100,000 apiece .
Others agree with Graham ’s sobering assessment .
“ A terrorist organization might have trouble putting a nuclear warhead ‘ on target ’ with a Scud , but it would be much easier to simply launch and detonate in the atmosphere , ” wrote Sen.
John Kyl , R - Ariz. , in the Washington Post in 2005 after reading Graham ’s report .
“ No need for the risk and difficulty of trying to smuggle a nuclear weapon over the border or hit a particular city .
Just launch a cheap missile from a freighter in international waters â€ “ al - Qaida is believed to own about 80 such vessels â€ “ and make sure to get it a few miles in the air . ”
The Iranian missile tests were more sophisticated and capable of detonation at higher elevations â€ “ making them more dangerous .
Detonated at a height of 60 to 500 kilometers above the continental U.S. , one nuclear warhead could cripple the country â€ “ knocking out electrical power and circuit boards and rendering the U.S. domestic communications impotent .
From a longtime reader …
A week ago , as the McCain campaign continued to drive the media narrative and consolidate its lead in the polls , you wrote :
“ … I take it that their position now is that they ’re not going to get knocked off their game .
Instead they ’re staying focused on the ground game in the dozen and a half states where they believe the race will be won or lost … .
So we ’re left to take it on faith that they know what they ’re doing , without having much way of seeing for ourselves . ”
It ’s a fair point .
And though it ’s tempting now to dismiss the last few weeks as a rapidly - dissipating bounce , and to applaud the Obama campaign for sticking to its game plan , the truth is that we do n’t know much more about how the campaign is unfolding on the ground than we did a week ago .
If the polls did n’t tell the whole story then , they ’re not much more enlightening now .
With that in mind , it ’s worth paying attention to a little - noted development this week in Michigan .
The Obama campaign filed suit in state court to block the GOP ’s “ Lose your home , lose your vote ” scheme , a plan to challenge the eligibility of voters whose homes have entered foreclosure – despite the fact that many remain resident in those homes .
It ’s a typical GOP disenfranchisement campaign , and it ’s nice to see the Obama folks taking a proactive position .
But the really interesting part of the filing is the effort by the Obama campaign to demonstrate , in a court of law , that this behavior is “ part of a broader state and nationwide campaign by the Republican Party to suppress the vote . ”
And , upping the ante , the filing alleges that “ Defendant Republicans have a long history of engaging in coordinated , systematic campaigns to suppress and deny the right to vote of American
citizens .
Those campaigns are often targeted at various racial groups , language minorities , or individuals of low or modest economic circumstances whom Defendant Republicans believe are unlikely to support them in political campaigns . ”
The filing is aimed at a particularly egregious and politically ill - advised initiative .
Not only are the Republican claims here tendentious , but they ’re targeted at a sympathetic group – largely white , financially - struggling voters , caught up in the economic crisis .
But the suit invites the court to go a step further – to recognize a persistent pattern of egregious misconduct ; to find that this is a local instance of a state and national campaign ; and in so doing , to link this initiative with other , less politically toxic drives .
The court is more likely to rule narrowly than to recognize those claims in its decision .
But by intervening directly in a local case , the Obama campaign is signaling that a national campaign to disenfranchise voters will receive a national response .
And by reframing a technical debate over local election laws as a broader discussion of fundamental rights , the Obama campaign has already won .
The GOP has long employed the chimerical notion of “ voter fraud , ” and preyed upon unpopular groups
like students , non-Anglophone Americans and ex-felons .
But they made a strategic miscalculation by going after homeowners suffering foreclosures .
And by linking this effort at disenfranchisement to the others , the Obama campaign is going to make them pay .

Kenneth Rau , the Bismarck , North Dakota , man who suffers the dubious distinction of being the first person in the United States prosecuted under laws criminalizing the possession of salvia divinorum , has been offered a plea deal under which he would serve five years in state prison , he told the Chronicle this week .
( Update : Charges have been downgraded to possession -- Rau still faces up to five years , but as a charge he can fight , not a plea bargain -- DB via Phil , 8/19 . )
Kenneth Rau
Salvia is not illegal under federal law .
The DEA considers salvia a drug of interest , but despite several years of observation has yet to move to place it under the Controlled Substances Act .
A DEA spokesman told the Chronicle recently that the plant is being reviewed to see if it meets the criteria for inclusion on the list of controlled substances .
But driven by little more than the now infamous YouTube videos of young people under the influence acting strangely and the story of one Delaware youth whose parents blamed his suicide on salvia , state legislators have not waited for the DEA 's measured considerations to act .
Since Delaware became the first state to ban salvia , at least eight others , including North Dakota , followed suit .
Moves are currently afoot in a number of other states to join the club , with Florida and Virginia being the latest states to pass laws criminalizing the plant .
Salvia became illegal in North Dakota on last August 1 , after a bill sponsored by three Republican lawmakers , state Sens. Dave Oelke and Randel Christmann and state Rep. Brenda
Heller , sailed through the legislature earlier that year .
None of the three legislators responded to Chronicle requests for comment this week .
Rau has said he did not know the drug was now illegal when he bid on an eight - ounce bunch of salvia leaves and was pleasantly surprised when his $ 32 bid came in highest .
The local TV station 's web site has inadvertently supported Rau 's contention .
When the Chronicle first wrote about Rau's case in April , that site 's online version of the news report about Rau 's arrest was still pulling up salvia ads by Google .
( From the east coast at least it is still doing so as of this writing . )
Rau emailed the link to Drug War Chronicle , proving that the salvia ads are showing up on computers in North Dakota .
Burleigh County States Attorney Cynthia Feland did not respond to Chronicle calls seeking confirmation or denial of the plea deal .
Rau said the deal was offered through his attorney , Benjamin Pulkrabek , from just across the Missouri River in Mandan .
" My lawyer told me she offered me five years if I pleaded guilty , " said Rau .
" He said he did n't think I would take it , but he had to ask .
He was right -- I am not going to accept that .
I just do n't think depriving someone of his freedom for some dried plant leaves is right . "
Rau , a bottling plant worker with an interest in herbalism , altered states , and religion and spirituality , was arrested by Bismarck police on April 9 when they searched his home looking for his adult son , who was on probation for drug charges .
Police found a marijuana pipe , eight ounces of salvia leaf , a quantity of amanita muscaria mushrooms , and a number of other herbal products .
Although Rau bought the salvia leaf on eBay for $ 32 , he faces a possible 20 - year sentence after being charged with possession of the now controlled substance with the intent to distribute , based on prosecutors ' assertions that the leaf contained hundreds of possible doses .
He also faces a marijuana possession charge for the pipe .
Although prosecutors originally charged him with possession of psilocybin because of his amanita muscaria mushrooms , they have since figured out that amanita does not contain psilocybin and have dropped that charge .
Salvia divinorum , a member of the Mexican mint family , has been used by Mazatec shamans for hundreds of years .
Smoking or chewing the leaves , or more commonly , concentrated extracts , can produce intense , albeit short - lived hallucinogenic experiences .
While the plant has become notorious through YouTube videos of young people smoking it and behaving strangely , it is also of interest to " psychonauts , " or people attempting to explore consciousness through herbal means .
Researchers say that while salvia 's effects on consciousness may be disquieting , the plant has not been shown to be toxic to humans , its effects are so potent it is unlikely to be used repeatedly , and its active property , salvinorin A , could assist in the development of medicines for mood disorders .

Daniel Siebert is a salvia researcher and host of the salvia information web site Sage Wisdom .
In Siebert 's view , while salvia should be subject to some sort of regulation , sending someone like Rau to prison for years for possessing it is almost obscene .
I think salvia should be regulated in the same way we regulate alcohol , " he said .
" Its effects are quite different , but there are some parallels in terms of the possible dangers from its use .
Like alcohol , people can exhibit dangerous behavior if they take excessively high doses .
That 's why we prohibit driving while intoxicated or allowing minors to drink .
But it 's obvious that many , many people can enjoy alcohol without getting into trouble with it , and they should not be subjected to harsh penalties .
Neither should adults who want to use salvia . "
Not that the drug will ever be a popular recreational drug , he said .
" Salvia can be very strange and interesting , but it 's not something most people consider fun , it 's not a recreational kind of experience , " he said .
" Most people find it bewildering ; it 's not something most people are motivated to repeat .
It wo n't ever become a popular drug .
The main reason people seem interested in it is because the media keeps putting out these sensational stories comparing it to LSD or marijuana .
That creates a misleading impression , and people who try salvia expecting something like that are usually disappointed . "
salvia ( and criminal defense ) ads on web version of ND news station report on Rau 's bust
" Siebert was sympathetic to Rau 's predicament .
" I 'm shocked and appalled that they can put people in prison for using salvia for personal use , " he said .
" The drug had just been made illegal there , and he says he did n't know it was illegal .
I think that 's believable -- most people would n't know about an obscure law being passed . "
Kenneth Rau now faces a lonely struggle .
North Dakota is not noted for its abundance of attorneys skilled in defending cases involving arcane plants , and national organizations have yet to respond to his entreaties for help , Rau said .
Still , Rau is trying to get a defense together .
" I 'm hoping to take depositions from people like Dr. Andrew Weil or Daniel Siebert or other experts , " he said .
" I 'm looking for attorneys in their vicinities who might be willing to take a deposition . "
And he hinted that he may also attempt a jury nullification strategy .
" My defense will be to fall back on the fact that the jury is the ultimate judge of the law , " he said .
" They do n't have to listen to the judge ; they have the power .
Let the jury decide what kind of state they want to live in , " he said .
No trial date has been set yet .
In the meantime , Rau continues working full - time for a soft drink bottler and subjecting himself to court - ordered humiliations .
" I 'm trying to live my life , " he said .
" I 've got a full - time time job and another one on the weekends .
I also have to take pee tests twice a week and pay them $ 26 a week for that privilege , on top of trying to pay for lawyers . "

Operation Cable Splicer and Garden Plot are the two sub programs which will be implemented once the Rex 84 program is initiated for its proper purpose .
Garden Plot is the program to control the population .
Cable Splicer is the program for an orderly takeover of the state and local governments by the federal government .
FEMA is the executive arm of the coming police state and thus will head up all operations .
The Presidential Executive Orders already listed on the Federal Register also are part of the legal framework for this operation
Executive Orders associated with FEMA that would suspend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
These Executive Orders have been on record for nearly 30 years and could be enacted by the stroke of a Presidential pen : ...
Unfortunately , upon further research by myself , they are not all sinister as purported to be .
If you can follow the trail of Executive Orders , you are a better scholar than me .
A constitution lawyer should be the one to track these Executive Orders

NOTE ; A person named Terry Kings wrote an article on his discoveries of camps
located in southern California .
His findings are as follows :
Over the last couple months several of us have investigated three soon - to - be prison
camps in the Southern California area .
We had heard about these sites and wanted
to see them for ourselves .
The first one we observed was in Palmdale , California .
It is not operating as a prison
at the moment but is masquerading as part of a water facility .
Now why would there
be a facility of this nature out in the middle of nowhere with absolutely no prisoners ?
The fences that run for miles around this large facility all point inward , and there are
large mounds of dirt and dry moat surrounding the central area so the inside area is
not visible from the road .
There are 3 large loading docks facing the entrance that can
be observed from the road .
What are these massive docks going to be loading ?
We observed white vans patrolling the area and one came out and greeted us with a
friendly wave and followed us until we had driven safely beyond the area .
What would
have happened had we decided to enter the open gate or ask questions ?
This facility is across the street from the Palmdale Water Department .
The area around
the Water Department has fences pointing outward , to keep people out of this dangerous
area so as not to drown .
Yet , across the street , the fences all point inward .
Why ?
To keep people in ?
What people ?
Who are going to be it ’s occupants ?
There are also signs posted every 50 feet stating : State of California Trespassing
Loitering Forbidden By Law Section 555 California Penal Code .
The sign at the entrance says : Pearblossom Operations and Maintenance Subcenter
Receiving Department , 34534 116th Street East .
There is also a guard shack located
at the entrance .
We did n’t venture into this facility , but did circle around it to see if there was anything
else visible from the road .
We saw miles of fences with the top points all directed inward .
There is a railroad track that runs next to the perimeter of this fenced area .
The loading
docks are large enough to hold railroad cars .
I wonder what they are planning for this facility ?
They could easily fit 100,000 people in
this area .
And who would the occupants be ?
Another site is located in Brand Park in Glendale .
There are newly constructed fences
( all outfitted with new wiring that point inward ) .
The fences surround a dry reservoir .
There are also new buildings situated in the area .
We questioned the idea that there
were four armed military personnel walking the park .
Since when does a public park
need armed guards ?
A third site visited was in the San Fernando Valley , adjacent to the Water District .
Again , the area around the actual Water District had fences logically pointing out
( to keep people out of the dangerous area ) .
And the rest of the adjacent area which
went on for several miles was ringed with fences and barbed wire facing inward
( to keep what or who in ? )
Also , interesting was the fact that the addition to the tops
of the fences were fairly new as to not even contain any sign of rust on them .
Within
the grounds was a huge building that the guard said was a training range for policemen .
There were newly constructed roads , new gray military looking buildings , and a landing
strip .
For what ?
Police cars were constantly patrolling the several mile perimeter of the
area .
From the parking lot of the Odyssey Restaurant a better view could be taken of the area
that was hidden from site from the highway .
There was an area that contained about
100 black boxes that looked like railroad cars .
We had heard that loads of railroad cars
have been manufactured in Oregon outfitted with shackles .
Would these be of that
nature ?
From our position it was hard to determine .

Pamela Schuffert reporting from Idaho and the PACIFIC NORTHWEST -
The concerned locals near Bonners Ferry , Idaho , have led me directly to the Cheney Haliburton detention camp being
rapidly constructed near Bonner 's Ferry and the Canadian border .
And the very railroad tracks that lead to it along highway 95 north , up from Coeur D'Alene , ID , are being rapidly
refurbished and improved to accommodate the infamous PRISONER BOXCARS WITH SHACKLES that will transport
countless NWO resisters and good American Patriots and Christians , etc. , to their persecution and death ( termination )
at this camp under COMING MARTIAL LAW .
I have watched as modern RR equipment is rapidily replacing old worn out RR track parts and strengthening the
RR tracks , OBVIOUSLY to accommodate the anticipated INCREASED USAGE IN THE FUTURE .
Concerned people here want to DO or SAY SOMETHING about this .
We are exploring possibilities that include :
PRAYER VIGILS , PROTESTING / PICKETIN G AT THE SITE , and other options .
By now , for many locals I interviewed , the grim WRITING IS ALREADY ON THE WALL .
The American people
are not stupid .
There is a DIFFERENCE between IGNORANCE and STUPIDITY .
While many Americans have been ignorant of this NWO / MARTIAL LAW AGENDA in the PAST , many are
waking up through research such as mine and many others , plus WHAT THEY NOW EVIDENTLY SEE
( construction of the CHENEY HALIBURTON DETENTION CAMPS ) , and finally understand THE TRUTH
about the coming AMERICAN HOLOCAUST .
THE LOCALS ARE NERVOUS AND FEEL INTIMIDATED BY THIS !
IN fact , as I printed and handed out
reports to locals , one man held his hands behind his back and said , " I KNOW it 's real , and I do n't even want to
be seen holding your literature .. .. "
He was afraid !
Is the coming POLICE STATE USA closer than we think ???

News story : Feb. 14 , 2008 - NEW ORLEANS ( AP ) - Authorities say they will step up efforts to move hurricane victims out of more than 35,000 trailers now that tests indicate possibly high levels of formaldehyde contamination .
Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator David Paulison made the announcement Thursday .
The Centers for Disease Control has said fumes from 519 tested trailer and mobile homes in Louisiana and Mississippi were on average about five times what people are exposed to in most modern homes .
FEMA and KATRINA :
Can FEMA Be Fixed ?
by Russell S. Sobel and Peter T. Leeson
This article appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer on July 11 , 2006 .
As Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco complained , " No one ... even those at the highest level , seems to be able to break through the bureaucracy . "
FEMA turned away generators needed by hospitals , refused Amtrak 's offer to evacuate victims , and would n't return calls from the American Bus Association .
Sheriff Dennis Randle of Carroll County , Indiana , who had a team ready to help , was never able to navigate FEMA 's approval process to enter New Orleans .
FEMA failures caused millions of pounds of ice to be shipped mistakenly to Maine and Arizona , and firefighters and rescue squads to be sent to areas where they were of little help .
A mobile communications unit with a chartered private plane sat in Germany for nine days because FEMA did n't return its calls .
FEMA confiscated medical supplies for Methodist Hospital and fuel purchased by Jefferson Parish , and even prevented the Red Cross from entering New Orleans .
The day before Katrina , Coca - Cola needed no permission to deliver Dasani bottled water to New Orleans , so why would anyone want to erect hurdles preventing those deliveries when they were needed most ?

Dee , I suspect Seneca Army Depot in central New York state may also be a potential camp .
It was de-commisioned years ago ,
maybe 5 ? and I went by there a couple years later , and the fences have new sections , the gates by the RR track area are all new .
I neglected to note which way the barbed wire on top was pointed , but there is also a landing strip immediatly south from this base ,
less than a mile .
I talked to a man who mustered out of the Army from there , and he told me there are numerous levels of underground facilities
there , he was only allowed to go down 4 , but was sure there were at least 7 levels .
I would not be surprised to learn the airstrip to the south was connected by tunnels .
The rock there is easy to dig .
This site is east of Sampson State park , and it was a basic training station during WW11 .
I will have to take a ride this summer and see which way the wire is pointed .
submitted by S.C .
Demonstrations to close the facility From July 4 through November 1983 , the depot was the focus of antiwar and antinuclear activists , when the
Seneca Women 's Encampment for a Future of Peace and Justice was established .
Groups of demonstrators staged civil
disobedience protests , climbing the fence surrounding the depot .
During one protest in November 1983 , Dr. Benjamin Spock
climbed the fence and was arrested .
Writer / activist Grace Paley , and feminist artist Helene Aylon were also among the
demonstrators .
On three occasions -- July 4 , August 1 , and November 3 , 1983 , Aylon covered the fence surrounding the depot
with women 's pillowcases that in 1982 were filled with " rescued earth " from nuclear sites across the country during her
" Earth Ambulance " voyage and sleep - out at the United Nations .

This article is part of a package on the modern slave trade .
To read personal narratives from the book To Plead Our Own Cause read " I Was a Slave " and for more personal narratives in an online exclusive feature , click here .
Most people imagine that slavery died in the 19th century .
Since 1810 , more than a dozen international conventions banning the slave trade have been signed .
Yet today there are more slaves than at any time in human history .
And if you ’re going to buy one in five hours , you ’d better get a move on .
First , hail a taxi to JFK International Airport and hop on a direct flight to Port - au - Prince , Haiti .
The flight takes three hours .
After landing , take a tap - tap , a flatbed pickup retrofitted with benches and a canopy , three - quarters of the way up Route de Delmas , the capital ’s main street .
There , on a side street , you will find a group of men standing in front of Le Réseau ( the Network ) barbershop .
As you approach , a man steps forward : “ Are you looking to get a person ? ”
Meet Benavil Lebhom .
He smiles easily .
He has a trim mustache and wears a multicolored striped golf shirt , a gold chain , and Doc Martens knockoffs .
Benavil is a courtier , or broker .
He holds an official real estate license and calls himself an employment agent .
Two - thirds of the employees he places are child slaves .
The total number of Haitian children in bondage in their own country stands at 300,000 .
They are restavèks , the “ stay - withs , ” as they are euphemistically known in Creole .
Forced , unpaid , they work in captivity from before dawn until night .
Benavil and thousands of other formal and informal traffickers lure these children from desperately impoverished rural parents with promises of free schooling and a better life .
The negotiation to buy a child slave might sound a bit like this :
“ How quickly do you think it would be possible to bring a child in ?
Somebody who could clean and cook ? ” you ask .
“ I do n’t have a very big place ; I have a small apartment .
But I ’m wondering how much that would cost ?
And how quickly ? ”
“ Three days , ” Benavil responds .
“ And you could bring the child here ? ” you inquire .
“ Or are there children here already ? ”
“ I do n’t have any here in Port - au - Prince right now , ” says Benavil , his eyes widening at the thought of a foreign client .
“ I would go out to the countryside . ”
You ask about additional expenses .
“ Would I have to pay for transportation ? ”
“ Bon , ” says Benavil .
“ A hundred U.S. ”
Smelling a rip - off , you press him , “ And that ’s just for transportation ? ”
“ Transportation would be about 100 Haitian , ” says Benavil , “ because you ’d have to get out there .
Plus , [ hotel and ] food on the trip .
Five hundred gourdes ” — around $ 13 .
“ OK , 500 Haitian , ” you say .

Now you ask the big question : “ And what would your fee be ? ” Benavil ’s eyes narrow as he determines how much he can take you for .
“ A hundred .
American . ”
“ That seems like a lot , ” you say , with a smile so as not to kill the deal .
“ Could you bring down your fee to 50 U.S. ? ”
Benavil pauses .
But only for effect .
He knows he ’s still got you for much more than a Haitian would pay .
“ Oui , ” he says with a smile .
But the deal is n’t done .
Benavil leans in close .
“ This is a rather delicate question .
Is this someone you want as just a worker ?
Or also someone who will be a ‘ partner ’ ?
You understand what I mean ? ”
You do n’t blink at being asked if you want the child for sex .
“ Is it possible to have someone who could be both ? ”
“ Oui ! ” Benavil responds enthusiastically .
If you ’re interested in taking your purchase back to the United States , Benavil tells you that he can “ arrange ” the proper papers to make it look as though you ’ve adopted the child .
He offers you a 13 - year - old girl .
“ That ’s a little bit old , ” you say .
“ I know of another girl who ’s 12 .
Then ones that are 10 , 11 , ” he responds .
The negotiation is finished , and you tell Benavil not to make any moves without further word from you .
You have successfully arranged to buy a human being for 50 bucks .
It would be nice if that conversation were fictional .
It is not .
I recorded it in October 2005 as part of four years of research into slavery on five continents .
In the popular consciousness , “ slavery ” has come to be little more than just a metaphor for undue hardship .
Investment bankers routinely refer to themselves as “ high - paid wage slaves . ”
Human rights activists may call $ 1 - an - hour sweatshop laborers slaves , regardless of the fact that they are paid and can often walk away from the job .
The reality of slavery is far different .
Slavery exists today on an unprecedented scale .
In Africa , tens of thousands are chattel slaves , seized in war or tucked away for generations .
Across Europe , Asia , and the Americas , traffickers have forced as many as 2 million into prostitution or labor .
In South Asia , which has the highest concentration of slaves on the planet , nearly 10 million languish in bondage , unable to leave their captors until they pay off “ debts , ” legal fictions that in many cases are generations old .
Few in the developed world have a grasp of the enormity of modern - day slavery .
Fewer still are doing anything to combat it .
President George W. Bush has been urged by several of his key advisers to vigorously enforce the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 , a U.S. law that sought to prosecute domestic human traffickers and cajole foreign governments into doing the same .
The Bush administration trumpeted the effort in addresses to the United Nations General Assembly in 2003 and 2004 .
But even the quiet and diligent work of some within the U.S. State Department , which credibly claims to have secured more than 100 anti-trafficking laws and more than 10,000 trafficking convictions worldwide , has resulted in no measurable decline in the number of slaves worldwide .
Between 2000 and 2006 , the U.S. Justice Department increased human trafficking prosecutions from 3 to 32 , and convictions from 10 to 98 .
By the end of 2006 , 27 states had passed anti-trafficking laws .
Yet , during the same period , the United States liberated only about 2 percent of its own modern - day slaves .
As many as 17,500 new slaves continue to enter bondage in the United States every year .
The West ’s efforts have been hamstrung from the outset by a warped understanding of slavery .
In the United States , the Bush administration has focused almost exclusively on the sex trade .
The official State Department line is that voluntary prostitution does not exist , and that commercial sex is the main driver of slavery today .
In Europe , though Germany and the Netherlands have decriminalized most prostitution , Bulgaria and other nations have moved in the opposite direction , bowing to U.S. pressure and cracking down on the flesh trade .
Across the Americas , Europe , and Asia , though , unregulated escort services are exploding with the help of the Internet .
Even when enlightened governments have offered clearheaded solutions , such as granting victims temporary residence , they have little impact .
Many feel that sex slavery is particularly revolting — and it is .
I saw it firsthand .
In a Bucharest brothel , I was offered a mentally handicapped suicidal girl in exchange for a used car .
But for every woman or child enslaved in commercial sex , there are some 15 men , women , and children enslaved in other fields , such as domestic work or agricultural labor .
Recent studies show that locking up pimps and traffickers has had a negligible effect on the aggregate rates of bondage .
And though eradicating prostitution may be a just cause , Western policies based on the idea that all prostitutes are slaves and all slaves are prostitutes belittles the suffering of all victims .
It ’s an approach that threatens to put most governments on the wrong side of history .
Save for the fact that he is male , Gonoo Lal Kol typifies the average slave of our modern age .
( At his request , I have changed his name . )
Like a majority of the world ’s slaves , Gonoo is in debt bondage in South Asia .
In his case , in an Indian quarry .
Like most slaves , Gonoo is illiterate and unaware of the Indian laws that ban his bondage and provide for sanctions against his master .
His story , told to me near his four - foot - high stone and grass hutch , represents the other side of the “ Indian Miracle . ”
Gonoo lives in Lohagara Dhal , a forgotten corner of Uttar Pradesh , a north Indian state that contains 8 percent of the world ’s poor .
I met him one evening in December 2005 as he walked with two dozen other laborers in tattered and filthy clothes .
Behind them was the quarry .
In that pit , Gonoo , a member of the historically outcast Kol tribe , worked with his family 14 hours a day .
His tools were a hammer and a pike .
His hands were covered in calluses , his fingertips worn away .
Gonoo ’s master is a tall , stout , surly contractor named Ramesh Garg .
Garg is one of the wealthiest men in Shankargarh , the nearest sizable town , run by nearly 600 quarry contractors .
He makes his money by enslaving entire families forced to work for no pay beyond alcohol , grain , and subsistence expenses .
For Garg , their only use is to turn rock into silica sand , for glass , or gravel , for roads or ballast .
Slavery scholar Kevin Bales estimates that a slave in the 19th - century American South had to work 20 years to recoup his or her purchase price .
Gonoo and the other slaves earn a profit for Garg in two years .
Every single man , woman , and child in Lohagara Dhal is a slave .
But , in theory at least , Garg neither bought nor owns them .
They are working off debts , which , for many , started at less than $ 10 .
But interest accrues at over 100 percent annually here .
Most of the debts span at least two generations , though they have no legal standing under modern Indian law .
They are a fiction that Garg constructs through fraud and maintains through violence .
The seed of Gonoo ’s slavery , for instance , was a loan of 62 cents .
In 1958 his grandfather borrowed that amount from the owner of a farm where he worked .
Three generations and three slave masters later , Gonoo ’s family remains in bondage .
Recently , many bold , underfunded groups have taken up the challenge of tearing out the roots of slavery .
Some gained fame through dramatic slave rescues .
Most learned that freeing slaves is impossible unless the slaves themselves choose to be free .
Among the Kol of Uttar Pradesh , for instance , an organization called Pragati Gramodyog Sansthan ( PGS ) — the Progressive Institute for Village Enterprises — has helped hundreds of families break the grip of the quarry contractors .
Working methodically since 1985 , PGS organizers slowly built up confidence among slaves .
With PGS ’s help , the Kol formed microcredit unions and won leases to quarries so that they could keep the proceeds of their labor .
Some bought property , a cow or a goat , for the first time in their lives , and their incomes , which had been nil , multiplied quickly .
PGS set up primary schools and dug wells .
Villages that for generations had known nothing but slavery began to become free .
PGS ’s success demonstrates that emancipation is merely the first step in abolition .
Within the developed world , some national law enforcement agencies such as those in the Czech Republic and Sweden have finally begun to pursue the most culpable of human trafficking — slave - trading pimps and unscrupulous labor contractors — but more must be done to educate local police , even in the richest nations .
Too often , street - level law enforcement personnel do not understand that it ’s just as likely for a prostitute to be a trafficking victim as it is for a nanny working without proper papers to be a slave .
And , after slaves have been discovered by law enforcement , few nations provide them with the kind of rehabilitation , retraining , and protection they need .
The asylum now granted to former slaves in the United States and the Netherlands is a start , but more must be done .
The United Nations , whose founding principles call for fighting bondage in all its forms , has done almost nothing to combat modern slavery .
In January , Antonio Maria Costa , executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime , called for the international body to provide better quantification of human trafficking .
Number crunching would be valuable in combating that one particular manifestation of the slave trade , but there is little to suggest that the United Nations , which consistently fails to hold its own member states accountable for widespread slavery , will be an effective tool in defeating the broader phenomenon .
Any lasting solutions to human trafficking must involve prevention programs in at - risk source countries .
Absent an effective international body like the United Nations , such an effort will require pressure from the United States .
So far , the United States has been willing to criticize some nations ’ records , but it has resisted doing so where it matters most , particularly in India .
India abolished debt bondage in 1976 , but with poor enforcement of the law , millions remain in bondage .
In 2006 and 2007 , the U.S. State Department ’s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons pressed Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to repudiate India ’s intransigence personally .
In each instance , she did not .
The psychological , social , and economic bonds of slavery run deep , and for governments to be truly effective in eradicating slavery , they must partner with groups that can offer slaves a way to pull themselves up from bondage .
One way to do that is to replicate the work of grassroots organizations such as the India - based MSEMVS ( Society for Human Development and Women ’s Empowerment ) .
In 1996 the group launched free transitional schools where children who had been enslaved learned skills and acquired enough literacy to move on to formal schooling .
The group also targeted mothers , providing them with training and start - up materials for microenterprises .
In Thailand , a nation infamous for sex slavery , the Labour Rights Promotion Network works to keep desperately poor Burmese immigrants from the clutches of traffickers by , among other things , setting up schools and health programs .
Even in the remote highlands of southern Haiti , activists with Limyè Lavi ( Light of Life ) reach otherwise wholly isolated rural communities to warn them of the dangers of traffickers like Benavil Lebhom and to help them organize informal schools to keep children near home .
In recent years , the United States has shown an increasing willingness to help fund these kinds of organizations , one encouraging sign that the message may be getting through .
For four years , I encountered dozens of enslaved people , several of whom traffickers like Benavil actually offered to sell to me .
I did not pay for a human life anywhere .
And , with one exception , I always withheld action to save any one person , in the hope that my research would later help to save many more .
At times , that still feels like an excuse for cowardice .
But the hard work of real emancipation ca n’t be the burden of a select few .
For thousands of slaves , grassroots groups like PGS and MSEMVS can help bring freedom .
Until governments define slavery in appropriately concise terms , prosecute the crime aggressively in all its forms , and encourage groups that empower slaves to free themselves , however , millions more will remain in bondage .
And our collective promise of abolition will continue to mean nothing at all .

Michelle Malkin has been a consistent cheerleader for the McCain / Palin campaign , but it appears that even she has had enough :
I ca n’t underscore enough what a rotten idea John McCain ’s ACORN - like government mortgage buy - up is .
…
We ’re Screwed ‘08 .
This was his supposed “ game - changer . ”
This was the very first thing out of his mouth during the debate tonight — his big pitch right off the bat .
He spent the entire debate assailing massive government spending — while his featured proposal of the night was to heap on more massive government spending to pursue home ownership / retention at all costs .
If Obama had proposed this , the Right would be screaming bloody murder about this socialist grab to have the Treasury Department renegotiate individual home loans and become chief principal write - down agents for the nation .
Michael A. Cohen is a senior research fellow at the New America Foundation and the author of “ Live From the Campaign Trail : The Greatest Presidential Campaign Speeches of the 20th Century and How They Shaped Modern America . ” ( Full biography . )
There is a popular view about presidential campaigns that image and perception , even likability are the crucial variables , with substance usually running a distant second .
( The recent vice presidential debate is possibly the quintessential example as Sarah Palin ’s connect - the - talking - points performance was considered by many pundits a success simply because the substantive expectations were so low . )
However , the second presidential debate in Nashville , Tenn. , went a long way toward undermining this long - held perspective .
Stylistically , Barack Obama certainly seemed more comfortable than John McCain , but last night it was on policy ideas and his vision for America where Mr. Obama truly shined , demonstrating in no uncertain terms why he is opening up a commanding lead in public opinion polls — and why John McCain has been unable to narrow the gap .
Throughout the debate , Mr. Obama maintained the substantive upper hand ; constantly tying Mr. McCain to the toxic image of President Bush all the while offering a mix of policy initiatives from a middle - class tax cut and new investments in green technology to tax credits for small businesses that offer health care , increased oversight of Wall Street and new diplomatic overtures to Iran .
Mr. Obama can still be characterized as light on specifics ; and like many a change - oriented presidential candidate has a tendency to wallow in generalities .
But these faults , notwithstanding , he is far better at providing a sense of his priorities and , most important , a vision for where he wants to take the country .
For the first time in 18 months as a candidate , Mr. Obama truly cast a presidential air .
John McCain on the other hand fell back on many of the same proposals that have done little to arrest his steady decline ; from attacks on earmark spending and fears of an Obama administration - led tax increase to calls for more offshore drilling and a fuzzy proposal for the Treasury Department to buy up bad mortgages .
Again , few of them resonated , particularly since Mr. McCain seems incapable of relating them directly to the pressing concerns of voters .
No part of the debate better dramatized the divide between the two candidates than a question about the types of sacrifices that should be expected from the American people .
Mr. McCain again dwelled on his familiar call for cuts in government spending and earmark reform .
Considering the lovely paean to sacrifice that Mr. McCain offered in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention it seemed like a missed opportunity — Mr. Obama did not make the same mistake .
He said :
Each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes , in our buildings .
And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we ’re providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car … weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient .
And that ’s going to require effort from each and every one of us .
I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve , and that ’s one of the reasons why I ’m interested in doubling the Peace Corps , making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in the community , involved in military service , so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America .
That ’s something that all of us have to be involved with .
For some , such proposals may seem meager , but there was freshness to Mr. Obama ’s answer that stood in stark contrast to Mr. McCain ’s rather lifeless generalities .
One gets the sense that during the last 18 months , Mr. Obama has thought long and hard about the direction he wants to take the country and the policy initiatives that would form the basis of an Obama administration .
Mr. McCain has not ; a view that I would imagine even the most hardcore G.O.P. partisans would have a hard time disputing .
Yet , none of this should seem terribly surprising .
Throughout his political career , John McCain has never evinced much interest in economic policy issues — and it shows .
In an election like 2000 , where personality dominated , or 2004 , where national security was the top issue , Mr. McCain would be a formidable candidate , but in today ’s current economic environment he simply seems lost .
Add in the electorate ’s exhaustion , even loathing of President Bush and the challenge for Mr. McCain is that much greater .
For all of Mr. McCain ’s efforts to talk about the negative potentialities of an Obama administration they ring hollow when compared to the reality of the present administration — and its potential continuation .
Voters are far more inclined to embrace change when the status quo appears much worse and this is certainly the case in 2008 .
But in some respects this is not completely Mr. McCain ’s fault .
He is the leader of a political party that has run out of steam .
The Republican Party seems more and more like a spent and rudderless force , devoid of new ideas for how to govern the country , and wedded to its unbending political orthodoxies , of cutting government spending , removing regulation and reducing income taxes .
Indeed , more than one observer noted the contradiction of Ms. Palin on Thursday decrying overbearing government while in the next breath calling for more government oversight of Wall Street .
On Tuesday , Mr. McCain had similar problems , as he called for a spending freeze right after pledging support for an expensive new program to buy up bad mortgages .
With a potential $ 300 billion price tag , Mr. McCain offered little sense of how he would pay for the plan .
What has happened to the Republican Party is not unusual in American politics .
A similar phenomenon befell Democrats in the 1970s and 1980s as they became so tied to their liberal orthodoxies they were unable to shift course and devise policies to respond to the changing needs and desires of middle class America .
Since the failure of the G.O.P. ’s Contract with America in 1995 - 1996 , the Republican Party has flirted with political decline ; in 2000 a smart campaign by George W. Bush crafted around the notion of compassionate conservatism nabbed the White House .
But since then the party has moved further and further to the right , out of the mainstream of American political thought , while at the same time Democrats , led by Mr. Obama , have reclaimed the political center with new ideas and a palpable energy for moving the country forward .
The rising fortunes of the Democratic Party and the precipitous fall of the G.O.P. were on full display Tuesday night .
At a time when John McCain needed desperately to find the masterstroke that would allow him to reclaim the initiative from Barack Obama , he found a G.O.P. policy cupboard bereft of ideas .
There are four weeks until Election Day , but the route for Mr. McCain ’s political revival seems to be increasingly out of his hands .
Perhaps the capture of Osama bin Laden or even a major terrorist attack could refocus the race on issues favoring Republicans , but barring such an unforeseen event , Mr. McCain will continue to sail against the political winds .
Nothing that happened Tuesday night changed the fundamental trajectory of a race that now overwhelmingly favors Mr. Obama ; indeed the policy divide between the two candidates offers compelling and unmistakable evidence as to why that is the case .

If you have n’t heard about the McCain - Spain snafu , highlighted by Talking Points Memo overnight , here ’s a quick rundown .
My take on the whole thing follows .
McCain did an interview with a Spanish - language radio station .
He was asked about a series of Latin American troublemakers , in response to which McCain gave the standard conservative boilerplate about standing up to those that oppose liberty , freedom , etc .
The interviewer then asks about Spain and President / Prime Minister Zapatero .
McCain appears confused by the question or unclear on who Zapatero is and covers by providing more boilerplate about Latin America .
He never embraces Spain as an ally , possibly because he does n’t know the questions are about Spain .
At this TPM post , you can hear the interview in English and evaluate for yourself .
Some in the media are already jumping on McCain .
I ’m more charitable .
I do n’t think McCain ca n’t identify Spain ’s correct hemisphere .
I do n’t think McCain is uncertain about Spain ’s status as an ally .
I do n’t think McCain is unaware of Spain ’s leader .
Honestly ?
I think he did n’t hear the interviewer , who was talking quickly and with an accent , when she transitioned to Spain .
And after he missed the transition he got confused and either misheard or misunderstood the rest of what was going on .
I think this whole thing is a symptom of McCain ’s age .
And to be frank , I think it would work better as an attack on McCain if it was framed that way .
Is any voter really going to believe that a 20 + year Senator does n’t know where Spain is ?
They ’re likely to dismiss that as the ( over ) zealotry of the liberal media .
Questions about age and fitness are much more believable .

Russia 's two main stockmarkets bounced back dramatically this morning after trading resumed today for the first time since Wednesday , but amid strong signs of continuing volatility .
Russia 's rouble - denominated MICEX and dollar - denominated RTS reopened after their suspension two days ago – only to shut again for an hour as shares soared .
The exchanges re-opened at midday Moscow time .
Regulators sought today 's temporary closure after share rises jumped above 15 % .
By this afternoon the MICEK was up 23.1 % on the day , while the RTS had risen 15.5 % .
The sudden revival of Russian markets , which coincided with shares rallying strongly on Wall Street and in London , came after the Kremlin pumped nearly $ 60 bn ( £ 33 bn ) into money markets .
Russia 's finance ministry announced on Wednesday it was lending $ 44bn to the country 's three main banks , while the central bank announced loans of $ 14bn designed to ease the acute liquidity crisis .
This morning the Russian prime minister , Vladimir Putin , said that the economy remained healthy .
Speaking at an investors ' forum in the Black Sea resort of Sochi , he said that " fundamental indicators ' including Russia 's foreign debt surplus were in line with " the norm " .
" Our response to problems that emerge will be market - orientated .
The government and the central bank have sufficient reserves to defend the currency and the financial system , " Putin declared .
Other Kremlin officials made clear the Russian government was prepared to intervene in the crisis .
Russia 's market has performed worse than any other emerging market this year – falling some $ 680 bn since its all - time high in May .
On Tuesday the MICEX dropped by 17 % – its biggest slide since Russia 's 1998 financial crash .
Russia 's economy is these days integrated into global markets , and has suffered as shares have fallen this week around the world .
But the slump in Russia has been particularly acute because of falling oil prices .
There has also been a huge flight of capital from Russia since last month 's war in Georgia , with foreign investors taking out $ 35 bn .
Scientists have found a new huge and well - preserved fossil of a goose and duck relative that swam around what is now England 50 million years ago flashing sharp , toothy smiles .
The skull , discovered on the Isle of Sheppey off the southeast coast of England in the Thames Estuary , belonged to a huge ancient bird in the extinct genus Dasornis , which had a whopping 16 - foot ( 5 - meter ) wingspan .
" Imagine a bird like an ocean - going goose almost the size of a small plane ! " said Gerald Mayr of the Senckenberg Research Institute in Germany and a member of the team that studied the skull .
" By today 's standards , these were pretty bizarre animals , but perhaps the strangest thing about them is that they had sharp , tooth - like projections along the cutting edges of the beak . "
Scientists had found fossils of other bony - toothed birds , or pelagornithids , in deposits called the London Clay , which underlies much of London , Essex and northern Kent in the southeast of England .
This new fossil , from the same clay layer , is one of the most well - preserved fossils ever found there and has provided scientists with previously unknown details of the birds ' anatomy .
Mayr 's study of the fossil is detailed in the Sept. 26 issue of the journal Palaeontology .
Like all living birds , Dasornis had a beak made of keratin , the same substance that forms our hair and fingernails .
But unlike modern birds , whose ancestors lost their teeth through evolutionary processes , Dasornis had bony " pseudo - teeth " ( true teeth are made of enamel and dentine ) .
Mayr said that the ancestors of modern birds likely lost their teeth to save weight and make flying easier , but that bony - toothed birds such as Dasornis re-evolved them for dietary reasons .
" These birds probably skimmed across the surface of the sea , snapping up fish and squid on the wing , " he explained .
" With only an ordinary beak , these would have been difficult to keep hold of , and the pseudo - teeth evolved to prevent meals slipping away . "
Researchers think that the closest living relatives to Dasornis are not other big birds such as the albatross , but ducks and geese .

The medieval dock was found next to a fallen Roman wall An archaeological dig at a Kent fort has uncovered the coastline at the time of the Roman invasion of Britain in 43AD - two miles from today 's shore .
The team was excavating a 295 ft ( 90 m ) stretch of collapsed Roman wall , when they found a small medieval dock .
English Heritage archaeologist Tony Wilmott said they then found a " hard surface " , in a water - filled trench , which was the Roman beach .
The dig was on previously untouched land at Richborough Roman Fort .
Mr Wilmott said : " It is widely known that Richborough Roman Fort was the gateway to Roman Britain 2,000 years ago .
" But what is really exciting is that we have actually found the Roman foreshore while digging in a deep trench alongside the remains of a Roman wall .
" The bottom of the trench continually fills with water and by trowelling you can feel the hard surface , which was the Roman beach . "
He added : " We have long been curious about this fallen Roman fort wall and now we know there was a Roman harbour sitting out there . "
Smaller finds included Roman coins and fragments of decorated marble
At the start of the dig , local volunteers helped to reclaim the walls from undergrowth , exposing them for the first time since the 1930s .
Archaeologists also uncovered a number of smaller finds such as Roman coins and fragments of Italian marble believed to be from a great triumphal arch built at Richborough in about 80 AD to commemorate the Conquest of Britain .
Mr Wilmott said the Roman coastline was the original shore at the time of the Roman invasion of Britain in 43AD .
He said the significance of the medieval quayside was still being evaluated but it was known that Sandwich was once a large medieval port .
In the Roman era , Richborough Roman Fort overlooked a sheltered lagoon , where the invading Roman forces first landed .

October 3 , 2008
A huge war crime -- a massive crime against humanity -- is going on right now in Somalia , courtesy of ( but only indirectly traceable to ) the Bush administration and Washington 's bipartisan power elite .
But , aside from Chris Floyd and a few other internet madmen , nobody knows -- or even wants to know -- much about it .
What 's happening ?
And why does n't anybody want to know ?
These are troubling questions for anyone who cares about the soul of America , and even more troubling for anyone who 's beginning to suspect that America has no soul at all .
Chris Floyd :
Somalia is the invisible third front of the Terror War , an American - backed " regime change " operation launched by the invading army of Ethiopia and local warlords in December 2006 .
In addition to helping arm , fund and train the army of the Ethiopian dictatorship , the United States has intervened directly into the conflict , carrying out bombing raids on fleeing refugees and nomads , firing missiles into villages , sending in death squads to clean up after covert operations , and [...] assisting in the " rendition " of refugees , including American citizens , into the hands of Ethiopia 's notorious torturers .
Bombing raids on fleeing refugees ?
Oh , yes .
And much more , too .
These people look hungry .
We 'd better kill them !
And the longer it goes on , the worse it gets .
When Chris Floyd writes , " Somalia is the invisible third front of the Terror War " , he 's probably counting chronologically starting from 9/11 : in this sense Afghanistan is # 1 ( we started attacking in October of 2001 ; let 's forget about the summer of ' 79 ) and Iraq is # 2 ( officially March of 2003 , but in reality January 1991 , and long before then as a matter of fact ) , which would make Somalia # 3 ( December 2006 , and long before then , too ! ) and the recently opened and more recently acknowledged , still partly - deniable war - against - our - ally Pakistan as # 4 .
And then Iran would be # 5 , or maybe it already is ?
But -- oops ! -- did we forget to count the Terror War against the Home Front ?
It soon gets too complicated to sort out , and therein lies one of the problems .
The world is too big and too chaotic ; we are too small and too stupid ; we will never be able to deal with all of it .
( I 've been blogging for almost four years now and there are still large parts of the world that I have never even mentioned !
It does n't mean I do n't care ; usually it means I do n't know enough to say anything authoritative , in which case I prefer to remain silent .
But still ... where 's my coverage of Darfur ?
And that 's just one example . )
We prefer good news to bad , especially when times are tough .
And it does n't take much to overload on bad news these days .
But still ...
How can we ignore things like this ?
Together , the American Terror Warriors , the Ethiopians and the warlords ( some of them directly in the pay of the CIA ) have created the worst humanitarian disaster on earth .
Thousands have been killed in the fighting .
Hundreds of thousands have been driven from their homes , many fleeing to northern Kenya , where more than 215,000 people are languishing in a single refugee camp in Dadaab ; 45,000 people have poured into the camp this year alone , says the UN .
In some of the camps , Somali refugees are living without any shelter at all : " The BBC's Mark Doyle , who has recently visited the camps in Kenya , says some refugees do not even have a basic plastic sheet to protect them from the sun and rain . "
In just the last two weeks , more than 18,500 people have fled the capital of Mogadishu , which has already been decimated by the warfare .
Many were sent on the run by one of the Ethiopians ' favorite tactics : mortar and artillery fire into civilian areas believed " sympathetic " to the insurgents .
The United States is not only backing the Ethiopians and the Somali transitional government ( TGF ) propped up by the occupation ; Washington has also provided " robust financial and logistical support to armed paramilitaries resisting the command and control of the TGF , " according to a major new study of the conflict by the human rights organization , Enough .
In addition to these freebooters , it turns out that the wide - ranging Somali pirates -- who last week hijacked a shipload of heavy weapons being funneled into African conflicts by Ukrainian war profiteers -- are supported by " backers linked to the Western - backed government " in Mogadishu .
We 're reading more from Chris Floyd , of course ; who else ?
Floyd 's writing is unique , both in its stylish command of the language and in its content : for instance , hardly anybody else ever bothers to write about Somalia .
The big media -- mainstream and other -- avoid mentioning it at almost every opportunity , and most of what does get published is sanitized in one way or half a dozen , with writers and editors falling over each other to avoid placing the blame for this horrendous situation where it obviously belongs .
But not Chris Floyd : whenever he digs up news from " the invisible third front " , he writes about it , and he counters the spin .
He puts the news in context ; he explains what it means in terms of the big picture , just like he always does , whether he 's writing about Iraq or Afghanistan , or the Home Front , or any other place .
But -- remarkably , sadly , and altogether too revealingly , in my opinion -- when Chris Floyd writes about Somalia , his website traffic goes through a hole in the floor .
So hardly anybody bothered to visit Floyd 's remarkable site , Empire Burlesque , on the day when he posted the passage quoted above , along with excerpts from a piece by Jennifer Beskal at Salon :
Ishmael , a 37 - year - old shepherd from the Ogaden region in Ethiopia , looked at me with tears in his eyes .
Ethiopian forces -- who had already killed his mother , father , brothers and sisters -- murdered his wife days after they were married .
They then slaughtered his goats , beat him unconscious , and slashed his shoulder to the bone , he said .
In December 2006 , Ishmael crossed through Somalia into Kenya , heading for the nearest refugee camp in search of medical care .
But when he did n't have enough money to pay a 1,000 shilling ( $ 15 ) bribe , the Kenyan police bundled him into a car and took him to Nairobi .
Less than a month later , he was herded onto an airplane with some 30 others , flown to Somalia and handed over to the Ethiopian military -- the same forces that he previously fled .
Ishmael is a victim of a 2007 rendition program in the Horn of Africa , involving Ethiopia , Kenya , Somalia and the United States .
There are at least 90 more victims like him .
Most have since been sent home .
A few -- including a Canadian and nine who assert Kenyan nationality -- remain in detention even now .
The whereabouts of 22 others -- including several Somalis , Ethiopian Ogadenis , and Eritreans -- remain unknown ....
[ In the immediate aftermath of the invasion ] , Kenyan authorities arrested at least 150 men , women and children from more than 18 countries -- including the United States , the United Kingdom and Canada -- in operations near the Somali border , and held them for weeks without charge in Nairobi .
In January and February 2007 , the Kenyan government then unlawfully put dozens of these individuals -- with no notice to families , lawyers or the detainees themselves -- on flights to Somalia , where they were handed over to the Ethiopian military .
Ethiopian forces also arrested an unknown number of people in Somalia ....
An unknown number of them -- likely dozens -- were questioned by the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation agents in Addis Ababa .
From February to May 2007 , Ethiopian security officers daily transported detainees -- including several pregnant women -- to a villa where U.S. officials interrogated them about suspected terrorist links .
At night the Ethiopian officers returned the detainees to their cells ....
In addition to working with the U.S. , the Ethiopians used the rendition program for their own ends .
For years , the Ethiopian military has been trying to quell domestic Ogadeni and Oromo insurgencies that receive support from neighboring countries , such as Ethiopia 's archrival , Eritrea .
The multinational rendition program provided them a convenient means to continue this internal battle -- and get their hands , with U.S. and Kenyan support , on those with suspected insurgent links .
Ishmael was one of their victims .
The questions his Ethiopian interrogators asked were nonstop , and always the same : " Are you al - Qaida ?
Are you an Ogadeni rebel ?
Are you part of the Somali insurgency ? "
Each time he said no , he was beaten , sometimes to the point of unconsciousness .
When he resisted answering , they targeted his testicles .
Then , in February 2008 -- some 14 months after his original arrest -- the Ethiopians decided Ishmael was no longer worth the trouble .
They dumped him , along with 27 others , just over the Somali border .... Now Ishmael is back in the refugee camp , limping and urinating blood .
He is still waiting for the healthcare he came searching for nearly two years ago .
Why do people read Chris Floyd ?
Because he 's a fantastic writer ; because he 's a tireless researcher ; because he always tells us the truth , no matter how horrible ; because he directs our attention to vital stories we otherwise might have missed ; and surely there are more good reasons .
Which of these reasons are negated when Chris writes about Somalia ?
None , of course .
That was a rhetorical question .
Now here 's a real one :
Why does the whole world run away from Chris Floyd 's articles about Somalia ?
Is it because the victims of the war crime in Somalia are blacker than the victims of the war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan ?
Is it because the roots of the war crime in Somalia reflect badly on both Bill Clinton and George Bush ?
Is it because we can't stand reading about more than two war crimes on the same day , and Iraq and Afghanistan fill our quota ?
Is it because the war crime in Somalia is a proxy war crime , being fought under the flag of the invading Ethopians ?
Are Americans are too lazy and too stupid to connect the dots -- the dots between funding , arming , supplying , motivating and supporting an invading army ; and actually being responsible for the invasion ?
Is it because no Americans are being killed there ?
Or is it because the stories coming out of Somalia are so gruesome ?
Floyd 's newest post contains an update on renditions in the Somalia war crime , from the BBC :
Among [ the fleeing refugees ] were Salim Awadh , a Kenyan , and his Tanzanian wife , Fatma Chande .
Both of them were arrested as they crossed the border [ from Somalia to Kenya in January 2007 ] .
" I was kept in a cell with other women .
Then the Kenyan anti-terrorist police questioned me - they asked me why we went to Somalia , " Fatma says .
I meet Fatma in her small two - room house in Moshi , northern Tanzania .
She is quietly spoken and her voice falters as she explains what happened next .
" I told them my husband got a job repairing mobile phones in Somalia .
But they tried to force me to admit that my husband was a terrorist .
They said I had to tell them the truth or they would strangle me . "
... In the first weeks of early 2007 , news began to filter out that several hundred people - including children - had been arrested trying to enter Kenya .
Al Amin Kimathi , the head of Kenya 's Muslim Human Rights Forum , sent volunteers to police stations across the capital , Nairobi , trying to collect information .
" Some very frustrated senior police officers told us point blank : it 's not our operation , go and ask the Americans , just call the American embassy .
We even saw the Americans bring in detainees and take them out of certain police stations in Nairobi , " he said .
Many of the refugees were sent back to Somalia , and then " renditioned " onward to Ethiopia .
" A week after we arrived we were interrogated by whites - Americans , British , I was interrogated for weeks , " Salim says ....
Former detainees have also told the BBC they were questioned by US agents .
One said he was beaten by Americans .
... Al Amin Kimathi believes Ethiopia was seen as the ideal destination .
" It was the most natural place to take anyone looking for a site to go and torture and to extract confessions .
Ethiopia allows torture of detainees .
And that is the modus operandi in renditions . "
... More than a year and a half after the renditions , the US government still refuses to respond to questions on the alleged US role .
... Meanwhile Fatma is still waiting anxiously for news of her husband .
After Salim got access to a mobile phone , he was able to speak to her from his cell for the first time in more than a year .
Now the phone has stopped working , Salim has disappeared once again .
Chris appends this note :
I know that no one cares about this .
I know that the fact that thousands of Somalis have been slaughtered and millions more driven into suffering and desolation by a vicious war being conducted at every step with American assistance , in America 's name -- in your name , if you 're an American -- is not nearly as important as whether or not Joe Biden strikes the proper tone in his " debate " with Sarah Palin tonight .
I know that even to most true - blue " progressives , " the Somalis are non-people -- except when they show up as wild - eyed beserkers on late - night re-runs of " Black Hawk Down . "
I know that every time I write about Somalia , the traffic for the site plummets like the stock of a clapped - out merchant bank just before it gets a government bailout .
But I do n't really care .
With the full approval of the entire bipartisan political elite , America is breeding death , hate , extremism and a hellish storm of blowback through its actions in Somalia .
You might not give a damn that this evil is being wrought in your name , but I do .
I applaud Chris Floyd for his persistence in paying attention to Somalia even though his readers have made it painfully obvious that they do n't give a fig .
But I still want to know : what combination of factors allows them not to care , or prevents them from caring ?
Perhaps there 's a question about whether these war crimes are really being committed in our names ?
Jennifer Deskal , the human rights advocate whose piece in Salon Chris Floyd quoted at length , writes :
Almost everyone I spoke with assumed -- whether true or not -- that the United States backed the arbitrary arrest and unlawful rendition of men like Ishmael and the still - detained Kenyans .
Almost everyone assumed that the Ethiopians operate with America 's blessing .
To which Floyd remarks :
They " assume " these things , of course , because they are true .
And Deskal continues :
Their stories have circulated , fueling anger and resentment .
As one man , whose childhood friend became one of the rendition victims , told me , " Now when I go to the mosque , I pray to God to punish the Americans . "
To be sure , the United States is not the main culprit when the Kenyans unlawfully render suspects or the Ethiopians torture them .
But when U.S. officials interrogate rendition victims who are being held incommunicado , the United States becomes complicit in the abuse .
The U.S. is funding the Ethiopian military , supporting its activities in Somalia and training Kenyan security forces in counterterrorism -- so as U.S. - backed military and police forces in the region brutalize their domestic opponents in the name of fighting terrorism , the United States is often blamed .
The United States could change those perceptions by demanding higher standards of its foreign partners and cutting off aid to abusers .
It otherwise risks fueling the very problem -- anti-American militancy -- that it seeks to solve .
For starters , the U.S. could demand the release or fair trial of any rendition victims still stuck in Ethiopian custody .
Chris Floyd again :
Daskal 's story is marred by the same timidity which groups like Human Rights Watch ( where she serves as senior counterrorism counsel ) generally display when discussing American direction of and complicity in war crimes .
These references are often couched in terms of " a perception " ( or even misperceptions ! ) of American intentions .
The latter are always given the benefit of doubt and qualification .
Still , it requires little reading between the lines to see the confirmation of what every honest observer of the conflict can see : the Terror War operation is creating more of the violent extremism that it purports to combat .
...
In my opinion , Chris Floyd lets Jennifer Deskal off lightly for ridiculous spin and obvious distortion -- as well as some remarkably timid audacity !
( or should I say audacious timidity ? )
The notion that the USA is only complicit if its officials participate in the interrogation of rendition victims is bizarre and incomprehensible -- except as another part of the official deception .
Welcome to the nightmare , where even defenders of human rights cut unrepentant torturers as much slack as possible .
Another bizarre and incomprehensible notion also comes to mind : perhaps most Americas are determined to know as little as possible about the war crime in Somalia because that 's the only way their lives can make sense !
The war crimes against Afghanistan , Iraq , Pakistan , Iran and the Home Front all have some " justifying " pretext , or several .
Even though all the stories are false , they 're there , part of the national crazy - quilt : all the obvious , transparent , politically viable lies about 9/11 ; campfire tales about Saddam Hussein and his non-existent WMD ; the endless not - really hunt for Osama bin Laden ; nuclear weapons that do n't exist yet but are already an existential threat to Israel ; and a nation crawling with FBI entrapment victims if not actually real terrorists .
But we do n't have any story about Somalia .
We do n't have a mythically famous villain .
We do n't have any ruins we can point to while saying , " You see this ?
The Somalis did this ! "
In other words , there is no reason -- not even a transparently false reason -- for the war crime against Somalia .
And yet there 's no opposition to it , from either party .
And this combination of facts , in my opinion , makes the story intolerable to almost everybody .
There 's no way to cloak ourselves in denial this time , no fig leaf to hide behind .
Somalia reveals all too clearly the real motives behind the Terror War , and they are not what we have been told -- by Democrats or Republicans .
Somalia also reveals some crucial aspects of the Terror War on the Home Front .
Among them : America 's bipartisan leadership has no qualms about attacking foreigners who pose no threat to us , even without a plausible pretext , if they think they can get away with it .
When you add in all the other reasons -- from the blackness of the victims to the gruesomeness of the stories -- you get a tangled mess of horror that is so ugly , only the most courageous among us can stand to look at it .
Chris Floyd has enough courage to do it .
But most of his readers do not .
And that 's one of the reasons why I am becoming increasingly convinced that we are more screwed now than ever before .
What Does Mobile Friendly Mean in the World of Web Design ?
Did you know that by 2025 , nearly 72 % of the world will access the internet using only a smartphone ?
If you want to future proof your website , you need to make sure it is ‘ mobile friendly . ’
However , if you do n’t know much about web development , you might find yourself asking the question , ‘ what does mobile friendly mean ? ’
Below you ’ll discover some tips that ’ll help you learn more about the importance of creating a mobile friendly site .
With the help of this post , you ’ll know all that you need to know about creating a mobile friendly site .
Let ’s begin !
What Does Mobile Friendly Mean ?
If your website is mobile friendly , it means that it ’s easy for people to use your website while on a mobile device .
If your website is n’t mobile friendly , it will be hard for visitors to find relevant bits of information .
Visitors will also struggle when clicking on certain links , as ‘ buttons ’ will not be optimized for a mobile experience .
This a problem because visitors will become frustrated , and so they ’ll decide to leave your site .
It ’s also worth noting that search engines will review how mobile friendly your site is when determining rankings .
If your website is n’t mobile friendly , there ’s a good chance that your rankings will suffer .
How to Make Your Website Mobile Friendly
At this point , you ’re probably wondering how you can create a mobile friendly site .
Well , the approach you take will depend on the current design of your website .
If you have a WordPress website , then making your site mobile friendly is often as simple as installing a ‘ mobile friendly theme ’ .
Luckily , such themes are n’t expensive , and you can often get one for under $ 100 .
However , if you have a basic HTML site , you ’ll probably need to bring in a professional .
That ’s because you ’ll need to alter the actual code of your website , and if you ’re not a web developer , this is a challenging thing to do .
Fortunately , a website design firm should be able to help you with this .
With their help , you should end up with a website that automatically adjusts itself so that it looks good on any screen size .
If you want to verify the effectiveness of a given design , ask someone to use your site while on a mobile device .
If they struggle to perform certain tasks , it ’s a sign that you need to keep working on your site .
Time to Build a Mobile Friendly Website ?
Now that you ’ve finished this post , you should be able to answer the question , ‘ what does mobile friendly mean ? ’
While you must create a mobile friendly site , this is n’t something that you want to rush into .
If you move too quickly , your new site might be mobile friendly , but it might not represent your brand in the best possible way .
You ’ll probably need to go through multiple rounds of revision until you end up with a site that you ’re happy with .
Yet , once you have a mobile friendly site , there ’s no doubt that your business will benefit from your forward - thinking approach .

As I noted below , the big press story of the campaign is shaping up to be how reporters are and will react to McCain ’s deliberate strategy of full - court - press lying .
The corrupt , though normal , approach is for reporters to try to dig up whatever Obama exaggerations they can find to try to balance the coverage .
If that does n’t work , then they will try to hang the charges on Democrats — i.e. , “ what Democrats are calling ‘ lies ' ” etc .
And of course using the dictionary term — “ lies ” — for repeated and intentional misstatements of fact is almost always forbidden .
But the lying is so extreme in this case that a few reporters are beginning to actually report the story accurately .
So keep an eye out for examples in both categories — egregious refusals to identify McCain ’s lies properly and instances where reporters actually decide not to mince words and accurately report the story before them .
If you find them , send them in and we ’ll start keeping a list .

The group says the plans will be good for the environment and our pockets A " Green New Deal " is needed to solve current problems of climate change , energy and finance , a report argues .
According to the Green New Deal Group , humanity only has 100 months to prevent dangerous global warming .
Its proposals include major investment in renewable energy and the creation of thousands of new " green collar " jobs .
The name is taken from President Franklin D Roosevelt 's " New Deal " , launched 75 years ago to bring the US out of the Great Depression .
The new grouping says rising greenhouse gas emissions , combined with escalating food and energy costs , mean the globe is facing one of its biggest crises since the 1930s .
Its members include former Friends of the Earth UK director Tony Juniper , Green MEP Caroline Lucas and Andrew Simms , policy director of the New Economics Foundation ( nef ) .
In an article for the BBC News website 's Green Room series , Mr Simms warns that the combination of the current credit crunch , rising energy prices and accelerating emissions are " conspiring to create the perfect storm " .
Climate crisis : Roosevelt revisited " The UK and the global economy are entering unchartered waters , and the weather forecast is not bad , but appalling .
" Instead of desperate bailing - out , we need a comprehensive plan and new course to navigate each obstacle in this new phenomenon . "
The group 's recommendations include : massive investment in renewable energy and wider transformation in the UK
the creation of thousands of new " green collar " jobs
making low - cost capital available to fund the UK's green economic shift
building a new alliance between environmentalists , industry , agriculture and unions
The authors said their proposals drew inspiration from President Roosevelt 's 1933 New Deal .
During 100 days , he sent a record number of bills to Congress , all of which went on to become law , including banking reforms and emergency relief programmes .
The prolific reforms were credited with turning around the US economy .
The authors say that that within " the very real timeframe of 100 months " the world will reach the point where the risk of " runaway " climate change became unacceptably high .

What are these ?
( Graphics and damage forecasts moved below the fold for bandwidth and spacing ... it's all still there ... this continues to be the thread to accumulate resources as of 9/14 . )
Our thoughts and prayers go out to those affected by this storm .
We would ask that you please keep this thread on point with Hurricane Ike and energy - related articles , stories , maps , data , and links in the comments .
Updated 9/14 900 EDT .
Hurricane
Ike made landfall in Galveston in an area with extensive oil infrastructure , namely over 5 million bpd of US petroleum refining capacity .
( 5 MMBBL is about 30 % of US capacity ( about 15 MMBBL ) , and a bit less than 6 % of global capacity ( ~85 MMBBL ) ) .
Path observations and damage estimates for Hurricane Ike-- Methaz NHC official track Sep 13 ( 7:00 EDT ) - click twice to enlarge
For all graphics : Rigs / Platforms : Blue : evacuated only ;
Yellow will require inspection before restart ; Red : damage requiring repair ; Refineries : Black : operational impact ( partial shutdown ) Green : Operational impact ( full shutdown )
Red : Damage likely ; Ports : standard hurricane flags for wind
Here is the latest update from Chuck Watson at KAC / UCF updating at 9/13 700 EDT :
Intensity : folks have questioned my landfall estimate , but the data supports it .
Examples : Buoy 42035 broke loose from it 's mooring , but apparently it passed through the eye and reported valid data .
See attached plot ( note : it 's below the fold ) - peak winds 55 kts / gusts to 75 kts.
RLOT2 failed at 4z , last report was 50 kts / 65 kts , water level 11ft above normal .
The station near Texas City , in the left eye wall , peaked at 60 knots .
Surge peaked about 12 feet .
All of the data indicates landfall wind speeds were no more than 85 knots 2 min average winds .
The NHC estimated 110 m ph / 95knts " sustained " ( whatever that is ; nothing measures a " sustained " wind ) , which would be about 92 knots 2 min average , but as noted earlier they always err on the high side .
Inland areas do NOT seem to be experiencing significant two minute average winds above hurricane force .
Do n't be mislead by the media reports of " hurricane force wind gusts " .
Gusts do n't count .
Scientific definitions matter .
I get " hurricane force wind gusts " in thunderstorms here in Savannah all the time .
Impacts : I think the most severe impacts will be confined to the barrier islands .
Galveston probably got whacked hard .
But I do n't think any of the refineries will suffer major damage , unless something broke that should n't have .
It looks like Baytown never caught the peak surge .
Texas
City might have seen some flooding , but I doubt it was severe .
Do n't get me wrong , there will be a lot of damage from this event - insured losses in the $ 15 to $ 20 Billion range , storm total impacts in excess of $ 60 Billion ( if you include evacuation costs , etc. ) .
But with what I see right now , my guess would be that the petrochemical industry recovers fairly quickly , with refinery down times in the days to 2 week time frame , not months .
I think the biggest problem is going to be staffing and debris cleanup .
The infrastructure was probably OK , but power and crews with damaged homes and cleanup issues will be a big problem .
Harder numbers later today , but my estimates from yesterday are probably pretty close on outage probabilities .
Buoy 42035 reports through Hurricane Ike - click twice to enlarge
MMS reported yesterday that :
97.5 % of the oil production and 94.4 % of the natural gas production in the Gulf has been shut - in ; Personnel have been evacuated from a total of 596 production platforms , equivalent to 83.1 % of the 717 manned platforms in the Gulf of Mexico ; Personnel from 101 rigs have also been evacuated -- this is equivalent to 83.5 % of the 121 rigs currently operating in the Gulf ; that staff has been evacuated from 452 production platforms ( 63.0 % ) and 81 rigs ( 66.9 % ) – ( 95.9 % of the oil production and 73.1 % of the natural gas production has been shut - in as a precautionary measure for Hurricane Ike . )
Here is a map of the critical pipeline structure expanding outward nationwide from the Houston / Port Arthur area :
Here are depictions of various Texas cities storm surge maps under different Hurricane scenarios from Weather Underground .
Chuck Watson has put together a dynamically updating page that will reflect the latest damage models / forecasts at this link : KAC / UCF models .
We will be updating this thread with damage estimate and breaking news as this story unfolds .
A note on Chuck 's modeling process : we take the official NHC track , the raw computer model tracks like GFDL , HWRF , LBAR , etc , and even run our own in - house fast cycle track / intensity models .
These track and intensity estimates are feed to our main hurricane model ( TAOS ) , which computes the wind , waves , storm surge , currents , etc. at each point in our database of over 50,000 elements in the GoM like rigs , platforms , pipelines , pumping stations , refineries , etc .
We then have engineering models for each type of infrastructure that calculates the damage and estimated down time for that element , as well as downstream impacts ( eg if a pipeline is down , the upstream elements can't pump and the downstream elements do n't get product ) .

Ike moves nearer , and professional analysts gauge the impact it may have on our energy infrastructure , feel free to browse our archives of empirically based analyses and perspectives on the many aspects of our energy situation that form the backdrop not only for this hurricane , but for any exogenous event that disrupts the increasingly uneasy balance between energy supply and demand .
The New York Police Department is happy to talk about its plans to ring lower Manhattan with thousands of security cameras .
But the Department wo n't say exactly where the cameras are , or what will be done with the data .
So now the New York City Liberties Union is suing the NYPD , to force 'em to fess up on the spycams .
“ The NYPS is planning blanket surveillance of millions of law - abiding New Yorkers , but it refuses to disclose even the simplest details of this costly proposal , ” the NYCLU 's Donna Lieberman tells the New York Times .
“ A plan of this scope , expense and intrusiveness demands robust public debate and legislative oversight .
The public has a right to this information . ”
Paul J. Browne , the Police Department ’s chief spokesman , says they 've already turned over 91 pages to Lieberman & Co .
The cops " already provided the NYCLU with information short of a road map for terrorists to use in another attack on the financial district , " he says .
In some ways , it 's odd that this fight is going on at all .
" The cameras become a great subject for conversation because they 'll all be in public areas , " NYPD assistant chief John Colgan told me .
" And quite frankly , we want people to see them . "
So why wo n't the NYPD just share its plans ?
Well , let 's just say they 're not too fond of the NYCLU over at One Police Plaza .
So I 'm sure the incentive to cooperate is rather low .
But here 's another guess :
The plans are being kept close because they 'll reveal that the camera system wo n't work quite as well as advertised .
The surveillance project was billed as more than just another attempt to record the comings - and - goings of would - be terrorists .
It was seen as a way to prevent terror strikes before they happen .
" This is about identifying and eliminating a threat , rather than dealing with the consequences , " Colgan said .
" I 'm not in the consequence - management business . "
But similar urban surveillance systems – in Chicago , in New York 's subways – have n't lived up to their advanced billing .
Maybe the NYPD 's is n't quite working out , either .
And while Big Brother blinks , Little Brother is starting to open his eyes .
* Callers to the city 's 911 and non-emergency 311 lines will now be able to send in photos and video to report crimes and complain about quality - of - life problems like uncollected garbage .
* * While hundreds of cities accept text messages to emergency hot lines , New York is believed to be the first with the capability to accept images , officials said .
* * By next year , photos sent by bystanders will be made available to patrol cars , and pictures could even be used as evidence in prosecutions , officials said . *
The NYPD may or may not be watching .
But your neighbor will be , for sure .

A scientist named Tim Bean , who is a PhD student at the University of California Berkeley writes the following on a website : “ I expect that ‘ Counting Rats from Space , ’ the proposed title of my thesis , will become an international phenomenon , spawning everything from a board game to a Top 40 dance hall burner . ”
His dream might soon come true .
Bean is one of the primary researchers on a project that will use images from Israeli defense satellites to obtain an accurate population estimation for California ’s endangered Giant Kangaroo Rat–a keystone species .
The study will be the first to use satellites to research an endangered species .
[ social_buttons ]
The Giant Kangaroo Rat has lost approximately 90 % of its native habitat in California to agriculture .
It is considered a keystone species because it helps to directly provide habitat and food for other animals .
It gets its name from its long back legs that allow it to –you guessed it– jump well .
The Giant Kangaroo Rat is a species endemic to California , and should not be confused with the 21 other kangaroo rat species .
Giant Kangaroo
Rats fulfill their role as a keystone species by chopping down vegetation .
They then eat the seeds of plants .
At the same time they help to create an ecosystem appreciated by other endangered animals , like the kit fox and blunt - nosed leopard lizard .
Plants also benefit , as the seed clippings that the rats use to surround their burrows help enrich the soil with nutrients .
When cutting down vegetation , Giant Kangaroo Rats do so in a pattern that creates almost perfect circles , which can be easily seen from the air .
For this reason , scientists in the past have tried using aerial surveys to document and estimate the California Kangaroo Rat population .
In addition they have used traditional techniques like trapping .
These methods proved cumbersome , however , and thus entered the idea to use satellite images .
Bean and his counterparts who work for the California Branch of the Nature Conservancy and Carrizo Plain National Monument will collect their data by using images from Israeli satellites , as well as 30 years of satellite images released by the U.S. Geological Survey .
They will use the circles that surround the burrows of the kangaroo rats to estimate the population .
Carrizo Plain National Monument contains what are considered to be California ’s most ecologically - intact grasslands .
The whole study region , however , is quite arid and desert - like .
Bean and his colleagues will survey an area about 390 square miles in total .
One potential application of the study ’s findings will be the design of livestock grazing plans based on an increased understanding how rainfall affects vegetation size in the region .
Grazing might actually help accommodate the needs of kangaroo rats in several unique ways .
As rainfall has increased in the study area , so has the size of vegetation– limiting kangaroo rats ’ sources of food .
It is thought that the increasing scarcity of food has perhaps caused a chain reaction : as populations of kangaroo rats have decreased , their role as ecosystem architects has likewise diminished .
So using cattle to help the kangaroo rats have more food in certain areas might be a potential application that is driven by data collected from this study .
Cattle grazing might also reduce the spread and growth of exotic plant species that the kangaroo rats do not use for food– an additional benefit .
Tim Bean has said the following about the research and its importance : “ Without them [ kangaroo rats ] the entire ecosystem would go out of whack …
Carrizo is like a Yosemite for grasslands , and there are decisions people are learning to make to manage it in a way that preserves its natural state .
Since the kangaroo rat is so important to its function , we ’ve got to get a handle on it . ”
Bean obviously has been persuasive , and it makes me curious : why would Israel agree to let Bean and his counterparts use their defense satellites ?
It certainly is an admirable gesture , and I wonder why the United States was not willing to jump on to the project first .
These questions aside , I ca n’t wait for the “ Counting Rats from Space ” board game and corresponding dance club hit .

Tonight 's debate between Sarah Palin and Joe Biden could be a do - or - die moment for John McCain 's candidacy this year .
Things are not looking good for the Senator from Arizona .
The Politico reports today that McCain seems to be giving up on Michigan , a state the GOP strongly believed they could take away from the Democrats in 2008 .
Some recent polls show Obama with a double digit lead in the Great Lakes State .
In return for apparently giving up those 17 Electoral Votes in Michigan , the McCain Campaign will refocus their efforts in Ohio , Florida and Wisconsin .
But without Michigan , McCain will need all three of the other states just mentioned in order to have a chance to win in November - and he trails Obama in all three at the moment .
Even if McCain can pull off the Ohio , Florida , Wisconsin trifecta , Obama is now holding a lead in Virginia and is tied with McCain in North Carolina , two states totaling 28 Electoral Votes , that were solidly in the red column in 2004 .
If Obama can take those two southern states , he will completely wipe out any McCain victory in Florida ( 27 EVs ) , Ohio ( 20 EVs ) or Wisconsin ( 10 EVs ) .
Even worse for McCain , Obama is also leading in several Western States which have traditionally been Republican strongholds , Colorado , New Mexico and Nevada , or 19 total Electoral Votes .
So the big picture is this : in the beginning of this race , three regions were considered in play , the Mountain West , the Rust Belt and Florida .
There was talk that Obama could potentially bring some southern states into play as well , but that seemed like a long shot .
As of tonight , Obama leads in all three regions that were expected to be in play plus he is shaking things up in the south .
Not only does he look good in Virginia and North Carolina , but he is within striking distance in both Georgia and Mississippi , two states that went for Bush by 17 % and 20 % respectively in 2004 .
All of this adds up to a landslide for Barack Obama .
According to electoral - vote.com , one of the most reliable and up - to - date Electoral Vote maps , Obama 's Electoral lead is 338 - 185 with 15 ( North Carolina ) in the tie column .
It is the seventh inning of this race and Obama is not only pitching a no-hitter , but he still has a shot at pitching a perfect game .
As any baseball fan knows , however , a pitcher can't throw a perfect game without the other team providing a little help - swinging at pitches out of the zone , guessing wrong on what pitch a pitcher is about to throw and just simply not making solid contact .
Right now , the McCain Campaign is wildly swinging at pitches like they were Sammy Sosa .
Many have speculated that McCain 's recent drop in the polls has nothing to do with the economy and has far more to do with his selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate .
And while no one expects Sarah Palin to go out there and get a hit tonight , if the McCain Campaign has any hope of coming back during the late innings of this campaign Sarah Palin better step up to the plate , choke up and suddenly morph into Tony Gwynn .
The wild - swing approach of Sosa is not going to work against a crafty veteran like Joe Biden .
And if Palin goes down swinging tonight , this game is over .

The authors of a recent article in the Russian daily newspaper " Izvestia " questioned the dubious logic linking the Alaska 's proximity to Russia with Palin 's foreign policy know - how .
They concluded , rather sarcastically , that the former alone is enough to qualify the Alaskan governor as a global politics ' specialist . '
The article further discussed Palin 's publicity stunt of visiting the Minneapolis Museum of Russian Art in early September and noted that journalists present at the scene somehow failed to probe her familiarity with Russian artwork .
Americans are n't the only ones smirking at Sarah Palin 's claims of expertise in Russian affairs .
The Russians are cracking a smile , too .
Another highly unflattering article in the daily Moscow paper " Pravda " was even more scorching in its discussion of the Alaskan governor , calling her " A Mrs. Nobody Know - it - All " and classifying her threats of initiating war with Russia as " the most irresponsible thing anyone could do at this moment in time . "
What 's worse , journalists are n't the only ones in Russia expressing concerns about Governor Palin 's foreign policy credentials .
The Moscow Times quoted a statement by Sergei Markov , a representative from the Russian Duma , who called a potential win by the McCain - Palin team in the elections this November a " catastrophe " and referred to the vice - presidential candidate as a " housewife , chosen by mere chance . "
In fact , Russians feel so strongly about her that their criticisms have spilled over from foreign policy into other arenas .
At the end of last week , the Russian daily newspaper Izvestiya published an article deriding the VP candidate claims of belonging to the American middle class .
The article discussed in detail Palin 's family financial resources and concluded that the Alaskan governor must have been " modest " when she placed herself as part of the working class .
A few days later , the same newspaper published another piece related to Palin 's claims that Barack Obama had ties to terrorists .
The author commented that the Republican vice presidential candidate had embarked on a personal attack against Obama because she was unable comment on the crucial issues facing America today , like the ongoing financial crisis .
Unsubtle as these comments are , they do point to an important implication for Palin : she needs to back up her claims with facts if she expects to be taken seriously in the U.S. or abroad .
Unfortunately , to date the governor has done little to quell concerns .
When Katie Couric confronted Palin in what became a proverbial interview , about Palin 's claim to understanding Russia , Palin 's response was vague and elusive : " We have trade missions back and forth . "
That kind of elusiveness , if it continues , will only exacerbate powerful wave of outrage and sarcasm that Alaska 's close neighbors -- the Russians - - have been exhibiting lately .

Assigning default values to variables
You can use the logical or operator || in an assignment expression to provide a default value :
var a = b || c ;
The a variable will get the value of c only if b is falsy ( if is null , false , undefined , 0 , empty string , or NaN ) , otherwise a will get the value of b .
This is often useful in functions , when you want to give a default value to an argument in case is n't supplied :
function example ( arg1 ) { arg1 || ( arg1 = ' default value ' ) ; }
Example IE fallback in event handlers :
function onClick(e ) { e || ( e = window.event ) ; }

The man who paid £ 35 for a server stuffed full of Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest customer details has been left less than impressed with the reaction of UK data regulators .
Andrew Chapman 's story hit the news after he bought a server on eBay which contained over a million customer details including full account details , mothers ' maiden names , addresses and even scans of signatures .
But neither the Financial Services Authority nor the Information Commissioner 's Office contacted Chapman when he went public with what he found inside the machine .
Chapman said he phoned the Information Commissioner Office 's head of investigations and offered him the machine .
Instead he was told to return it to Graphic Data .
Chapman , an IT manager from Oxford , told the Reg : " I do n't really see how either the FSA or ICO can ascertain what happened by relying on Graphic Data .
It is a nonsense to ask companies to self - report . "
He said he was told the ICO had no power to seize equipment - although that clearly would not have been necessary in this case .
The ICO has asked the government for stronger investigatory powers and more powers to punish offenders .
We asked the ICO about this and were told that since it knew what information was on the machine , nothing useful could be learnt from it .
The ICO is working with RBS and archiving firm Graphic Data to find out how the machine went astray . ®

Welcome to the Orewellian world of Newspeak , where words are used to control thoughts .
Yesterday , at the bidding of the White House , mainstream news sources across the world magically replaced the term “ bail out ” with the much more palatable word “ rescue . ”
The Washington Post jumped on board ( http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capito…), then Reuters , the Associated Press and Bloomberg all fell into step within minutes , magically replacing “ bail out ” with “ rescue ” across all their articles .
It ’s as if “ bail out ” never even existed .
This is eerily identical to the world in George Orwell ’s 1984 novel , where history is constantly being re-written to conform to the political lies of the present .
There is no such thing as a bail out , we ’re now being told .
Nobody is getting bailed out .
We ’re all being rescued !
How convenient .
Rescued from what , you might ask ?
Rescued from the really bad investment decisions of greedy , careless bankers .
And HOW are we all being rescued ?
By giving them more money , of course .
But do n’t think it ’s simply about rescuing them .
No , of course not , you simple fools :
It ’s about rescuing YOU !
Yes , that ’s right : this is all being done for the good of the People , because everybody knows that sending $ 700 billion to pay off the debts of the wealthy elite is the very best way to uplift the economic status of the working poor .
( Article continues below )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
It makes such perfect sense , I do n’t know why we did n’t think of it sooner .
I mean , why did we have to wait for a crisis to unleash this brilliant rescue plan ?
Why not simply hand over hundreds of billions of dollars to failing banks and financial institutions every week ?
If this is so good for the people , we should have been doing this all along , right ?
Of course , it ’s very , very important to make sure we all use approved words when describing all this .
Because the very term “ bail out ” implies that somebody is abandoning responsibility for a mess they ’ve created .
It ’s very important that all Americans understand nobody is abandoning any responsibility .
In fact , the wealthy elite bankers and financial crooks are taking full responsibility for this mess , and they ’re doing it by forcing the taxpayers to clean it up .
That ’s how seriously they take this situation :
They ’re so deeply committed to solving the problems they ’ve created that they ’ll even reach right into YOUR wallet to make it happen !
After all , you did n’t think rescuing all you people would be free , did you ?
You need rescuing , and there ’s a rescue fee required .
It ’s sort of like what you might pay to be air - lifted by helicopter after breaking your ankle hiking down the Grand Canyon .
If you want to be rescued , you gotta pay up .
The same thing ’s true with the economy .
You want to be rescued ?
You ’ll have to pay .
And why , you might ask , should n’t the people who created the mess be required to pay ?
Well duh … it ’s because they ’re too busy directing the rescue .
Somebody ’s gotta be in charge of the rescue , right ?
And who better qualified to solve this financial mess than the very people who caused it ?
Do YOU know how to make a trillion dollars vanish into thin air ?
I doubt it .
But these jokers can make that happen before lunch !
They know this stuff !
That ’s why it makes such perfect sense to put them in charge of the rescue plan …
So do n’t question any of this .
You would n’t understand all the brilliant , highly - complex aspects of this rescue package anyway .
Just trust your government .
Stop asking questions .
Hand over a blank check and do n’t use the phrase “ bail out . ”
It ’s not a bail out , it ’s a rescue .
Shut up and pay your taxes .
And read the Washington Post to stay informed .
And do n’t buy gold .
You wo n’t need it .
This rescue plan is going to be so incredibly successful that we ’ll all be rich .
The taxpayers are even going to make money on this rescue !
Yes , you heard that right :
It ’s not even really a rescue , it ’s actually just an investment !
Yes , an investment .
Your government is now your stock broker .
Except you do n’t really have a choice in this investment .
It ’s mandatory .
But do n’t worry , your mandatory “ investment ” is going to make you money .
Lots of it !
And when all these banking assets turn around and become more valuable in the future , we ’ll find some way to return all this money to you , the taxpayers .
Because you know , your government is fiscally responsible .
Pay no attention to our national debt .
Debt does n’t matter anymore .
It ’s all about the cash flow , and right now , cash is flowing like a tidal wave into the hands of one person … one person who now controls more than half the entire U.S. economy : Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
But do n’t worry .
Paulson is a great guy !
He ’ll give you ALL your money back someday , with interest , guaranteed !
So technically , it ’s not a bail out , or a rescue or even an investment .
It ’s really just a LOAN to Uncle Sam .
Yep , that ’s right : Uncle Sam needs your money for the big “ rescue . ”
But it ’s all being done for YOU , of course .
And the more you loan Uncle Sam , the more patriotic you are .
You ’re a patriot , are n’t you ?
If you ’re a patriot , then you ’ll join us in supporting the “ rescue ” plan , which really is n’t a rescue , but more like a friendly loan to Uncle Sam .
We just need a bit of cash right now , just to make it through to the next loan from China , and to sell off all these worthless bank assets that we ’re buying with your money .
But just as soon as all that ’s taken care of , we ’ll give you all your money back .
We promise .
In fact , we promise with the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government .

Older windows are often big energy wasters .
Buying new , energy - efficient windows is one way to reduce this lost energy , but there are also several inexpensive repairs that can improve the performance of your current windows .
Any drafts you feel when standing next to a window are likely due to air infiltration around the window frame or sash perimeter .
Address drafts by installing sash locks and weatherstripping around the perimeter of the window .
For double - hung windows , consider side - mounted sash locks that pull the window tight to the sides of the frame , not just where the sash rails meet .
You also can remove the inside trim surrounding the window to see how it was installed into the framing cavity .
Any air space between the house shell and the window frame can cause significant air leakage and should be sealed .
If the gap is not too wide , then it can be sealed with caulk , backer rod or nonexpanding foam .
For windows with ropes and pulleys , buy pulley seals to stop air infiltration there .
You can reduce heat loss through windows by covering them with plastic window film or insulating window inserts , such as those available at Windo - Therm .
Another option is to make simple window quilts by sandwiching a piece of Bubble Wrap between two pieces of cloth material , which can be rolled up and down as needed .
If the robotic arm on NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander can nudge a rock aside , scientists on the Phoenix team would like to see what 's underneath .
Engineers who develop commands for the robotic arm have prepared a plan to try displacing a rock on the north side of the lander .
This rock , roughly the size and shape of a VHS videotape , is informally named " Headless . "
" We do n't know whether we can do this until we try , " said Ashitey Trebi Ollennu , a robotics engineer at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
" The idea is to move the rock with minimum disturbance to the surface beneath it .
You have to get under it enough to lift it as you push it and it does n't just slip off the scoop . "
The lander receives commands for the whole day in the morning , so there 's no way to adjust in mid-move if the rock starts slipping .
Phoenix took stereo - pair images of Headless to provide a detailed three - dimensional map of it for planning the arm 's motions .
On Saturday , Sept. 20 , the arm enlarged a trench close to Headless .
Commands sent to Phoenix Sunday evening , Sept. 21 , included a sequence of arm motions for today , intended to slide the rock into the trench .
Moving rocks is not among the many tasks Phoenix 's robotic arm was designed to do .
If the technique works , the move would expose enough area for digging into the soil that had been beneath Headless .
" The appeal of studying what 's underneath is so strong we have to give this a try , " said Michael Mellon , a Phoenix science team member at the University of Colorado , Boulder .
The scientific motive is related to a hard , icy layer found beneath the surface in trenches that the robotic arm has dug near the lander .
Excavating down to that hard layer underneath a rock might provide clues about processes affecting the ice .
" The rocks are darker than the material around them , and they hold heat , " Mellon said .
" In theory , the ice table should deflect downward under each rock .
If we checked and saw this deflection , that would be evidence the ice is probably in equilibrium with the water vapor in the atmosphere . "
An alternative possibility , if the icy layer were found closer to the surface under a rock , could be the rock collecting moisture from the atmosphere , with the moisture becoming part of the icy layer .
The Phoenix mission is led by Smith at the University of Arizona with project management at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , and development partnership at Lockheed Martin in Denver .
International contributions come from the Canadian Space Agency ; the University of Neuchatel , Switzerland ; the universities of Copenhagen and Aarhus in Denmark ; the Max Planck Institute in Germany ; and the Finnish Meteorological Institute .

YouTube video claims 9 - year - old at US prison in Iraq David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday August 15 , 2008

This A video released on YouTube shows American soldiers taking a group of Iraqis on a tour of a prison camp .
The soldier guiding the group tells them that all the cases are currently being reviewed and says , " I 'm sure if someone did n't do anything wrong , they 'll be released . "
At 5:47 into the video , the group approaches a barbed wire enclosure where the inmates tell them , " We are all under 18 . ...
We all have been here for more than a year . "
The guide hastens to explain , " We have juveniles from 14 to 18 .
...
They 're IED makers .
They are dangerous people . "
One young inmate calls out , " I swear to God , some were just walking in the streets or sleeping and they brought us here .
I swear to God we are all innocent . "
" I am my mother 's only child , " says another , at which the American soldier breaks in , " And he is the most dangerous .
We know about him . "
" I am only a child , " says a third , more youthful , voice .
" How old are you ? " he is asked .
" Nine years old . "
" How long have you been here ? " " Five months .
...
They wanted to take my father .
I told them take me instead . "
The inmates are not shown clearly enough to tell if the speaker does appear to be that young .
However , Brig .
Gen. Janis Karpinski , the former commander at Abu Ghraib , testified in 2005 that there were several juvenile prisoners there , including one who said he was almost twelve but looked no more than eight and was crying for his mother .
" These juveniles are treated very well , " insists the soldier .
" We invite their parents to come and visit with them .
They actually have movie nights .
...
We have looked through every one of these files .
These juveniles are dangerous . "

Now in the fourth edition of version 1.0 or second edition of 1.1 , XML has enjoyed a popularity matched by few other technologies .
Introduced in 1998 as a more general - purpose ( and extensible ) markup language than HTML ( and also derived from SGML ) , XML has spawned a host of other related technologies ( XPath , XSL / XSLT , XQuery , XML Schema , Relax NG , etc. ) as well as a plethora of XML - based dialect languages covering every conceivable purpose .
In the world of enterprise programming ( most notably Java ) , XML extended its reach to become the data / configuration / metadata format of choice .
At one point in time , any software framework that even had a vaguely enterprise -y smell to it relied on XML almost as a matter of course : J2EE ( EJB , Servlet API , JSF , etc. ) , Struts , Spring , Tapestry , and the list goes on .
When the ability to communicate via HTTP between browser requests was popularized in 2005 ( famously by Jesse James Garrett ) , XML was so prevalent that it was simply assumed that this was the data serialization format of choice -- hence the term AJAX ( Asynchronous JavaScript and XML ) or the " XmlHttpRequest " object .
Use of XML was simply unquestioned .
Then something happened , or started to happen ...
In the last few years other technologies have begun to encroach in some of the areas where XML was once so dominant : annotations in Java ( attributes in C# ) , JSON , Protocol Buffers , and even YAML .
Dissatisfaction with XML is on the rise .
Could it be that developers are realizing that XML is not good for everything ?
The evidence is growing :
Much of the motivation behind Google Guice was to create as a " pure java " -- i.e. , sans XML -- implementation of a dependency injection framework .
One of the creators of Guice , " Crazy " Bob Lee , has made no bones about his disdain for XML as a framework design tool .
Spring itself followed suite , introducing a pure - annotation approach to dependency injection ( in addition to the XML - based approach ) in Spring 2.5 .
Wicket advertises itself as having a " refreshing lack of XML " .
JSON 's compactness and ease of serializing / deserializing to and from JavaScript has made it a very appealing alternative to use of XML , and has taken a big bite out of the X in AJAX .
Numerous official Java specifications ( EJB 3.0 , JPA , JSF 2.0 , Servlet 3.0 ) are moving away from the use of XML metadata and towards Java annotations .
This is really one of the largest pieces of damning evidence , as Java specifications were one of the major drivers behind the canonization of XML as a key enterprise technology .
Some people have even gone as far as to dedicate web sites explaining why XML sucks .
Of course , as one may point out , this could just be the " vocal minority " voicing objections while the quieter majority continue to use it -- and indeed the use of XML and the development of XML - related technology shows no sign of really slowing down .
But this trend does raise the legitimate question of whether or not XML has really over - reached its original purpose ( and usefulness ) , and needs to be re-evaluated for some of the use cases to which it is currently being applied .
So , now that XML is in the denouement of its hype cycle , it is a good candidate for a more honest evaluation of its strengths and weaknesses .
Let 's start with the minuses ...
Drawbacks of XML
Verbose :
By its very nature as a markup language , XML contains considerable redundancy ( i.e. , < tag > </tag > ) .
While this suits the hierarchical structure of markup languages well , it can be a big drawback , especially when dealing with large amounts of data .
This verbosity carries real consequences in terms of processing efficiency and network transmission overhead .
Technologies like MTOM or XOP are really a hack to get around this problem .
Trees :
The hierarchical tree structure of XML is a generally useful structure , but is not naturally suited to every problem domain .
Some types of data are simply better suited to other data structures : lists , maps , etc .
Unnecessary representation of this data as a tree carries some consequences in terms of processing efficiency and complexity .
Markup Language : XML is a markup language , not an imperative or functional language .
And it is not good at faking either one .
This seems to be a fundamental point missed by some fairly knowledgeable people .
The otherwise well - designed BPEL is a case in point : right ideas , wrong technology .
This does n't mean that XML can't be used as a kind of " Poor Man 's DSL " , but being declarative is about as far as one should stretch a markup language .
Language Metadata :
Though specifications like XML Schema brought a kind of type system to XML , this was a type system meant to be language agnostic .
Historically speaking , however , it is common to see XML applied as a tool for language metadata , forcing the tedious and non -typesafe use of references to language types .
This is the classic XML attribute class= " com.example .Foo " seen in way too many Java enterprise frameworks .
A real facility for language metadata ( annotations in Java or attributes in C# ) is a much better solution .
Nothing world - shaking here .
Most developers having to type out XML documents have probably thought of these at some point in time .
So what are the good points ?
Advantages of XML
Platform and Language Neutral : Although other competing technologies can make the same claim , this is one of the big reasons for the rise in XML 's popularity in the first place .
Great tools :
There are a very rich set of tools for working with XML , which is certainly one of the reasons for its great popularity .
This makes working with XML a much simpler choice , since in most languages the parser and other tools have already been written for you .
Readability : Some people may argue with this and provide good counter - examples ( EJB deployment descriptor files come to mind ) , but in general 90 + % of XML documents I 've ever seen are fairly readable .
This readability , however , certainly does not scale : larger , more complex XML documents tend to be fairly unreadable , but this is often more of a consequence of the misapplication of the technology .
Namespaces : Although using different namespaces in an XML document can have some unexpected surprises for the beginner , generally speaking namespaces are a pretty powerful feature of XML .
They enable , among other things , ideas like " mashups " -- i.e. , XML documents being extended or combined with other XML documents ( or content ) in ways not necessarily foreseen by the providers of those documents ( think Yahoo Pipes ) .
Being able to avoid conflicts between different data sources is one of XML 's great advantages over other technologies that do not support namespaces .
Validation : Built - in data validation is another one of XML 's advantages .
However one may feel about the widely - used standard , XML Schema , having the heavy lifting of this tedious functionality off - loaded from the author to the tools is truly a blessing .
Using simple math , it would seem that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages .
But of course , it is n't that simple and the benefits vs. drawbacks have to be weighed on an individual basis .
Most of the abuses of any given technology usually stem from the case that simple facts like this get overlooked or forgotten amidst the hype .
In the worst cases , this kind of thinking results in elaborate specifications that are designed simply as workarounds to the limitations of the technology .
The " right tool for the right job " is the caveat here , but the warning seems easily forgotten .
The popularity of XML is definitely here to stay and the technology is generally " good enough " for most purposes to which it has been applied .
But I think that it is important , as with any technology , to apply some critical thinking before using it for a given purpose .
If you find yourself in the middle of coding an elaborate workaround to a problem you are encountering ( performance or otherwise ) , the question " Why am I doing this ? " should be more than a passing thought .
A little ( un ? ) common sense goes a long way in building the right solution .

What Proved to Be False
 Bill Clinton will be a great asset to Hillary .
For all we know , the former president has been showering his wife with brilliant strategic advice in the background .
But as a public surrogate , Mr. Clinton has run disastrously off the tracks at times ( see Carolina , South ) , engaging in red - face tirades on camera , offending black voters , infuriating party leaders and generally consuming way too much oxygen .
He has gone conspicuously Off - Broadway since South Carolina  no sign of him ( only Chelsea ) at Mrs. Clinton ’s victory speech last Tuesday .
 Money is everything .
Certainly , it ’s better to have it  lots of it  than not .
But there have been numerous examples in this campaign of candidates with no money ( John McCain last year ) or little money ( Mike Huckabee this year ) surviving , even thriving .
Inversely , the stout coffers of Mr. Obama did little for him in Texas ( where he spent about $ 10 million in television advertising between early February and early March ) and Ohio ( $ 5.3 million ) .
And despite spending $ 42 million of his own money , Mitt Romney developed little traction beyond his actual and adopted home states of Massachusetts , Michigan and Utah .
“ That ’s amazing , ” the comedian Jimmy Kimmel said after Mr. Romney dropped out .
“ I was able to not win the presidency for free . ”
 Barack Obama has a glass jaw .
For many months last year , it was assumed that Mr. Obama would be too soft , or timid , to endure the attacks to come .
“ Obambi , ” he was dubbed by a Chicago Tribune columnist .
A parallel assumption emerged that the 46 - year - old Mr. Obama was merely running in 2008 to sow good will for a campaign in 2012 or 2016 .
As it turned out , Mr. Obama has proven adept at deflecting punches , shrugging off criticism from opponents as “ the same old politics . ”
Caveat : Mr. Obama has gotten bad reviews in recent days for his ability to parry attacks from Mrs. Clinton and tougher questions from the news media in the run-up to Texas and Ohio .
“ He may have a glass jaw , ” CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer said last week .
He was one of many media types to raise the suspicion anew .
An Open Letter to my Friends on the Left

September 28 , 2008
My friends ,
In the last week or two , I have heard frequently from you that the current financial mess has been caused by the failures of free markets and deregulation .
I have heard from you that the lust after profits , any profits , that is central to free markets is at the core of our problems .
And I have heard from you that only significant government intervention into financial markets can cure these problems , perhaps once and for all .
I ask of you for the next few minutes to , in the words of Oliver Cromwell , consider that you may be mistaken .
Consider that both the diagnosis and the cure might be equally mistaken .
Consider instead that the problems of this mess were caused by the very kinds of government regulation that you now propose .
Consider instead that effects of the profit motive that you decry depend upon the incentives that institutions , regulations , and policies create , which in this case led profit - seekers to do great damage .
Consider instead that the regulations that may have been the cause were supported by , as they have often been throughout US history , the very firms being regulated , mostly because they worked to said firms ' benefit , even as they screwed the rest of us .
Consider all of this as you ask for more of the same in the name of fixing the problem .
And finally , consider why you would ever imagine that those with wealth and power would n't rig a new regulatory process in their favor .
One of the biggest confusions in the current mess is the claim that it is the result of greed .
The problem with that explanation is that greed is always a feature of human interaction .
It always has been .
Why , all of a sudden , has greed produced so much harm ?
And why only in one sector of the economy ?
After all , is n't there plenty of greed elsewhere ?
Firms are indeed profit seekers .
And they will seek after profit where the institutional incentives are such that profit is available .
In a free market , firms profit by providing the goods that consumers want at prices they are willing to pay .
( My friends , do n't stop reading there even if you disagree - now you know how I feel when you claim this mess is a failure of free markets - at least finish this paragraph . )
However , regulations and policies and even the rhetoric of powerful political actors can change the incentives to profit .
Regulations can make it harder for firms to minimize their risk by requiring that they make loans to marginal borrowers .
Government institutions can encourage banks to take on extra risk by offering an implicit government guarantee if those risks fail .
Policies can direct self - interest into activities that only serve corporate profits , not the public .
Many of you have rightly criticized the ethanol mandate , which made it profitable for corn growers to switch from growing corn for food to corn for fuel , leading to higher food prices worldwide .
What 's interesting is that you rightly blamed the policy and did not blame greed and the profit motive !
The current financial mess is precisely analogous .
No free market economist thinks " greed is always good . "
What we think is good are institutions that play to the self - interest of private actors by rewarding them for serving the public , not just themselves .
We believe that 's what genuinely free markets do .
Market exchanges are mutually beneficial .
When the law messes up by either poorly defining the rules of the game or trying to override them through regulation , self - interested behavior is no longer economically mutually beneficial .
The private sector then profits by serving narrow political ends rather than serving the public .
In such cases , greed leads to bad consequences .
But it 's bad not because it 's greed / self - interest rather because the institutional context within which it operates channels self - interest in socially unproductive ways .
This , my friends , is exactly what has brought us to the mess we are now in .
To call the housing and credit crisis a failure of the free market or the product of unregulated greed is to overlook the myriad government regulations , policies , and political pronouncements that have both reduced the " freedom " of this market and channeled self - interest in ways that have produced disastrous consequences , both intended and unintended .
Let me briefly recap goverment 's starring role in our little drama .
For starters , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are " government sponsored enterprises " .
Though technically privately owned , they have particular privileges granted by the government , they are overseen by Congress , and , most importantly , they have operated with a clear promise that if they failed , they would be bailed out .
Hardly a " free market . "
All the players in the mortgage market knew this from early on .
In the early 1990s , Congress eased Fannie and Freddie 's lending requirements ( to 1/4th the capital required by regular commercial banks ) so as to increase their ability to lend to poor areas .
Congress also created a regulatory agency to oversee them , but this agency also had to reapply to Congress for its budget each year ( no other financial regulator must do so ) , assuring that it would tell Congress exactly what it wanted to hear : " things are fine . "
In 1995 , Fannie and Freddie were given permission to enter the subprime market and regulators began to crack down on banks who were not lending enough to distressed areas .
Several attempts were made to rein in Fannie and Freddie , but Congress did n't have the votes to do so , especially with both organizations making significant campaign contributions to members of both parties .
Even the New York Times as far back as 1999 saw exactly what might happen thanks to this very unfree market , warning of a need to bailout Fannie and Freddie if the housing market dropped .
Complicating matters further was the 1994 renewal / revision of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 .
The CRA requires banks to to make a certain percentage of their loans within their local communities , especially when those communities are economically disadvantaged .
In addition , Congress explicitly directed Fannie and Freddie to expand their lending to borrowers with marginal credit as a way of expanding homeownership .
What all of these did together was to create an enormous profit and political incentives for banks and Fannie and Freddie to lend more to riskier low - income borrowers .
However well - intentioned the attempts were to extend homeownership to more Americans , forcing banks to do so and artificially lowering the costs of doing so are a huge part of the problem we now find ourselves in .
At the same time , home prices were rising making those who had taken on large mortgages with small down payments feel as though they could handle them and inspiring a whole variety of new mortagage instruments .
What 's interesting is that the rise in prices affected most strongly cities with stricter land - use regulations , which also explains the fact that not every city was affected to the same degree by the rising home values .
These regulations prevented certain kinds of land from being used for homes , pushing the rising demand for housing ( fueled by the considerations above ) into a slowly responding supply of land .
The result was rapidly rising prices .
In those areas with less stringent land - use regulations , the housing price boom 's effect was much smaller .
Again , it was regulation , not free markets , that drove the search for profits and was a key contributor to the rising home prices that fueled the lending spree .
While all of this was happpening , the Federal Reserve , nominally private but granted enormous monopoly privileges by government , was pumping in the credit and driving interest rates lower and lower .
This influx of credit further fueled the borrowing binge .
With plenty of funds available , thanks to your friendly monopoly central bank ( hardly the free market at work ) , banks could afford to continue to lend riskier and riskier .
The final chapter of the story is that in 2004 and 2005 , following the accounting scandals at Freddie , both Freddie and Fannie paid penance to Congress by agreeing to expand their lending to low - income customers .
Both agreed to acquire greater amounts of subprime and Alt - A loans , sending the green light to banks to originate them .
From 2004 2003 [ corrected on 10/19/08 ] to 2006 , the percentage of loans in those riskier categories grew from 8 % to 20 % of all US mortgage originations .
And the quality of these loans were dropping too : downpayments were getting progressively smaller and more and more loans carried low starter interest rates that would adjust upward later on .
The banks were taking on riskier borrowers , but knew they had a guaranteed buyer for those loans in Fannie and Freddie , back , of course , by us taxpayers .
Yes , banks were " greedy " for new customers and riskier loans , but they were responding to incentives created by well - intentioned but misguided government interventions .
It is these interventions that are ultimately responsible for the risky loans gone bad that are at the center of the current crisis , not the " free market . "
The current mess is thus clearly shot through and through with government meddling with free markets , from the Fed - provided fuel to the CRA and land - use regulations to Fannie and Freddie creating an artificial market for risky mortgages in order to meet Congress 's demands for more home - ownership opportunities for low - income families .
Thanks to that intervention , many of those families have not only lost their homes , but also the savings they could have held onto for a few more years and perhaps used to acquire a less risky mortgage on a cheaper house .
All of these interventions into the market created the incentive and the means for banks to profit by originating loans that never would have taken place in a genuinely free market .
It is worth noting that these regulations , policies , and interventions were often gladly supported by the private interests involved .
Fannie and Freddie made billions while home prices rose , and their CEOs got paid lavishly .
The same was true of the various banks and other mortgage market intermediaries who helped spread and price the risk that was in play , including those who developed all kinds of fancy new financial instruments all designed to deal with the heightened risk of default the intervention brought with it .
This was a wonderful game they were playing and the financial markets were happy to have Fannie and Freddie as voracious buyers of their risky loans , knowing that US taxpayer dollars were always there if needed .
The history of business regulation in the US is the history of firms using regulation for their own purposes , regardless of the public interest patina over the top of them .
This is precisely what happened in the housing market .
And it 's also why calls for more regulation and more intervention are so misguided : they have failed before and will fail again because those with the profits on the line are the ones who have the resources and access to power to ensure that the game is rigged in their favor .
I know , my friends , that you are concerned about corporate power .
So am I .
So are many of my free - market economist colleagues .
We simply believe , and we think history is on our side , that the best check against corporate power is the competitve marketplace and the power of the consumer dollar ( framed , of course , by legal prohibitions on force and fraud ) .
Competition plays mean , nasty corporations off against each other in a contest to serve us .
Yes , they still have power , but its negative effects are lessened .
It is when corporations can use the state to rig the rules in their favor that the negative effects of their power become magnified , precisely because it has the force of the state behind it .
The current mess shows this as well as anything ever has , once you realize just what a large role the state played .
If you really want to reduce the power of corporations , do n't give them access to the state by expanding the state 's regulatory powers .
That 's precisely what they want , as the current battle over the $ 700 billion booty amply demonstrates .
This is why so many of us committed to free markets oppose the bailout .
It is yet another example of the long history of the private sector attempting to enrich itself via the state .
When it does so , there are no benefits to the rest of us , unlike what happens when firms try to get rich in a competitive market .
Moreover , these same firms benefited enormously from the regulatory interventions they supported and that harmed so many of us .
The eventual bursting of the bubble and their subsequent losses are , to many of us , their just desserts for rigging the game and eventually getting caught .
To reward them again for their rigging of the game is not just morally unconscionable , it is very bad econonmic policy , given that it sends a message to other would - be riggers that they too will get rewarded for wreaking havoc on the US economy .
There will be short - term pain if we do n't bailout these firms , but that is the hangover price we pay for 15 years or more of binge lending .
The proposed bailout cannot prevent the pain of the hangover ; it can only conceal it by shifting and dispersing it among the taxpayers and an economy weakened by the borrowing , taxing , and / or inflation needed to pay for that $ 700 billion .
Better we should take our short - term pain straight up and clean out the mistakes of our binge and then get back to the business of free markets without creating an unchecked Executive branch monstrosity trying to " save " those who profited most from the binge and harming innocent taxpayers in the process .
What I ask of you my friends on the left is to not only continue to work with us to oppose this or any similar bailout , but to consider carefully whether you really want to entrust the same entity who is the predominant cause of this crisis with the power to attempt to cure it .
New regulatory powers may look like the solution , but that 's what people said when the CRA was passed , or when Fannie and Freddie were given new mandates .
And the very firms who are going to be regulated will be first in line to determine how those regulations get written and enforced .
You can bet which way that game is going to get rigged .
I know you are tempted to think that the problems with these regulations are the fault of the individuals doing the regulating .
If only , you think , Obama can win and we can clean out the corrupt Republicans and put ethical , well - meaning folks in place .
Think again .
For one thing , almost every government intervention at the root of this crisis took place with a Democratic president or a Democratic - controlled Congress in place .
Even when the Republicans controlled Congress , President Clinton worked around it to change the rules to allow Fannie and Freddie into the higher - risk loan market .
My point here is not to pin the blame for the current crisis on the Democrats .
That blame goes around equally .
My point is that hoping that having the " right people " in power will avoid these problems is both naive and historically blind .
As much as corporate interests were relevant , they were aided and abetted , if unintentionally , by well - meaning attempts by basically good people to do good things .
The problem is that there were a large number of undesirable unintended consequences , most of which were predictable and predicted .
It does n't matter which party is captaining the ship : regulations come with unintended consequences and will always tend to be captured by the private interests with the most at stake .
And history is full of cases where those with a moral or ideological agenda find themselves in political fellowship with those whose material interests are on the line , even if the two groups are usually on opposite sides .
This is the famous " Baptists and Bootleggers " phenomenon .
If you 've made it this far , I am most grateful .
Whether or not you accept the whole argument I 've laid out here , I do ask one thing of you : the story I told at the start of the role of government intervention in this mess is true , whatever your grander conclusions about the causes and cures are .
Even if you do n't buy my argument that more regulation is n't the cure , to blame this mess on " the free market " should now strike you as an obvious falsehood and I would hope , in the spirit of fair play , that you would stop making that claim as you speak and write about the ongoing events of the last two weeks .
We can disagree in good faith about what to do next , and we can disagree in good faith about the degree to which government intervention caused the problems , but blaming a non-existent free market for a crisis that clearly was to some extent the result of government 's extensive interventions in that market is unfair .
So if I have persuaded you of nothing else , I hope deeply that I have persuaded you of that .
In the end , all I can ask of you is that you continue to think this through .
Explaining this crisis by greed wo n't get you far as greed , like gravity , is a constant in our world .
Explaining it as a failure of free markets faces the obvious truth that these markets were far from free of government .
Consider that you may be mistaken .
Consider that perhaps government intervention , not free markets , caused profit - seekers to undertake activities that harmed the economy .
Consider that government intervention might have led banks and other organizations to take on risks that they never should have .
Consider that government central banks are the only organizations capable of fueling this fire with excess credit .
And consider that various regulations might have forced banks into bad loans and artificially pushed up home prices .
Lastly , consider that private sector actors are quite happy to support such intervention and regulation because it is profitable .
Those of us who support free markets are not your enemies right now .
The real problem here is the marriage of corporate and state power .
That is the corporatism we both oppose .
I ask of you only that you consider whether such corporatism is n't the real cause of this mess and that therefore you reconsider whether free markets are the cause and whether increased regulation is the solution .
Thanks for reading .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
You 've got to give California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger credit for being the first to stick his hand out .
Even before the vote on the $ 700 billion bailout bill last week , the wily Terminator of fiscal discipline had a letter on the desk of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson making the case for a $ 7 billion loan to keep the nation 's most populous state running past October .
Arguing that California -- and many other states -- have been frozen out of the credit markets like a subprime homebuyer , Schwarzenegger said the state needs the money to pay teachers , cops , firefighters , nurses , and other state - funded enterprises of some importance .
California was quickly followed by Massachusetts , whose reputation as " Taxachusetts " has n't seemed to help it stay above water .
And now the race is on to see whether any of these states can tap into the bailout frenzy before all the money goes to save Iceland .
So the question that Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke always ask themselves at times like this is whether the foundering entity is too big to fail ?
Bear Stearns was .
Lehman , not so much .
AIG ?
You bet .
But what of California ?
Sure , we 're a blue state , with a large bear on our state flag .
And yeah , the housing crisis that is now plaguing the entire world probably started here .
And , uh , Nancy Pelosi is our senior representative .
We want to preserve the salaries and lifestyles of our Hollywood fat cats .
We 've been known to favor gay marriage , smoke dope , prance about in garters , save owls and seals , and generally flip a silver - studded finger to any Bush & Co. suggestion or policy over the last eight years .
Oh , and we think Barry Bonds got a raw deal .
But should that exclude us from a federal handout at the expense of the Red State gun-toting , Sarah Palin - loving taxpayer ?
All I can say is thank god it will never come to a nationwide vote .
We'd be on our own quicker than you can say , uh , Arnold Schwarzenegger .
If the now famous Joe Sixpack does n't understand that saving Wall Street means saving his job and bank account , there 's no way he 'll listen to an argument about California 's importance to the fiscal health of the country .
Hey , if President Ford can tell New York to " drop dead , " during its last major fiscal crisis in the 1970s , who 's to guarantee Bush wo n't do the same to California when the time comes ?
Because if there is anything more unpopular then bailing out Wall Street , it is bailing out a group of politicians who can't manage their budget .
In California 's case , that 's $ 15 billion worth of mismanagement .
Our only hope , of course , may be with Paris Hilton , who still seems to have money and whose shadow campaign for president could be the October Surprise to end all surprises .
See US Magazine video of Hilton bailout plan .
Barring that -- or a remarkably quick thaw in the credit markets -- it 's likely that California and a host of other states and municipalities may soon start dialing down on essential services and jobs as this credit creature 's grip goes from banks and bankers to local , state , and national governments .
With more than $ 7.4 trillion in market value wiped off the U.S. stock market in the last year , since the Dow Jones Industrial Average peaked above 14,000 , and some $ 2 trillion in retirement savings accounts zapped , it 's hard to believe that things could get much worse .
But even as the disaster unfolds on our computers , television sets and BlackBerrys , and in our bank accounts and broker statements , at least the trains are still running and bridges are still open and police are still catching bad guys .
The potential for things to quickly deteriorate on a social level is no more crazy an idea than the thought a year ago today at the Dow 's peak that Wall Street as we knew it would be gone in 12 months .
For all of the jokes about him and his wacky state , Schwarzenegger is n't acting this time .
( Adds details from Fed , Paulson statements , paragraph 4 on )
WASHINGTON , Sept 16 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will lend up to $ 85 billion to the American International Group AIG.N in a plan aimed at saving the insurer from a " disorderly failure " that could wreak economic havoc .
The Fed said under the two - year facility the U.S. government will receive a 79.9 percent equity interest in AIG and has the right to veto payment of dividends to common preferred shareholders in the deal , which has the full support of the Treasury Department .
“ The Board determined that , in current circumstances , a disorderly failure of AIG could add to already significant levels of financial market fragility and lead to substantially higher borrowing costs , reduced household wealth and materially weaker economic performance , ” the Fed said in a statement .
The Fed said the loan , secured by all assets of AIG and its primary non-regulated subsidiaries , was designed to assist the insurance giant in meeting its obligations as they come due .
The loan will facilitate a process under which AIG will sell certain of its businesses in an orderly manner , with the least possible disruption to the economy .
The loan is expected to be repaid from proceeds of the sale of the firm ’s assets .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , in a separate statement , said that U.S. financial regulators were engaged in a broad effort to try to restore some stability to battered financial markets .
“ We are working closely with the Federal Reserve , the SEC and other regulators to enhance the stability and orderliness of our financial markets and minimize the disruption to our economy , ” Paulson said in a brief statement of support for the Fed ’s action .

Anyway , I complain about my phone , but it does provide me with e-mail , the Internet , streaming TV ( thanks to a Slingbox ) , a game called Bubble Breaker and , occasionally , phone calls .
Cell phones have come a long way , baby .
Let ’s take a stroll down memory lane .
1 | The car phone
I remember when my dad got a car phone .
All of a sudden our family ’s 1990 Plymouth Acclaim was n’t just cool because it was an Acclaim … it was cool because you could make phone calls from it !
Of course , those calls cost like $ 2 a minute and the phone was so large I think there was no way to install it without completely blocking the emergency brake … but the future was here .
That was the first and last time my dad was an early adopter on cell phone technology .
I just had to talk him into replacing his four - year - old phone that T - Mobile gave him for free … he ’d gone two years with it only working outdoors , and he had been fine with that .
2 | The Zack Morris cell phone
Zack Morris ’s cell phone on “ Saved by the Bell ” was absolutely iconic … even it it was about a foot long and five inches deep .
I ’d say it contributed 85 percent to his coolness .
That , and his ability to freeze time .
3 | The first StarTAC
I ’m pretty sure this was the first flip phone .
My friend ’s dad got one circa 1996 and there was NOTHING cooler .
I also believe that it cost a few grand at the time .
Sadly , this phone ’s compactness also started the hideous trend of attaching your cell phone to your belt .
When history is finally written and people are looking back at the ’90s and early ’00s and people are deciding what fashion trends to most aggressively mock us for , ugly , antiquated cell phones attached to belts will have to be in the top three .
They ’re that era ’s parachute pants , my friends .
4 | The big Nokia
I feel like everyone had this phone at some point .
And why not ?
It had SNAKE .
Snake remains the best free cell phone game ever .
People with much fancier phones would borrow your giant , ugly Nokia just to play snake .
5 | The small Nokia with AOL logo
I actually got this phone .
When I switched from Sprint to T - Mobile , I decided I did n’t want to pay for a phone … and this one was free .
My favorite part is the America Online logo they plastered on the screen .
( The phone could n’t go onto AOL … but it did have Instant Messenger built in .
Still , that logo just FEELS so antiquated . )
That was the big selling point .
That , and the gold color .
In retrospect , I actually liked this phone .
It worked pretty well .
You could go online and find the codes to program in your own ringtones ( I remember plunking in “ Big Pimpin ' ” , which was huge at the time ) .
6 | The shoulder bag battery phone
I do n’t think I ever saw anyone use this , but I know it existed .
You ’d put the battery over your shoulder and talk on the headset .
Does n’t seem particularly practical , but it ’s better than , ya know , trying to find a pay phone .
I guess .
7 | The swingin’ Motorola
I think Motorola made this phone to resemble a Star Trek communicator device .
It was designed to look futuristic … but , unfortunately for Motorola , in the way that people in the ’60s and ’ 70s thought the future was going to look .
To use it , you would n’t flip it open , you ’d swing the front part up , 180 degrees .
In the end , it just looked strange .
I can’t guarantee it , but I think dysfunctional phones like this might ’ve been the reason that in Wanna Be a Baller , Lil ’ Troy was so adamant about switching from Motorola to a PrimeCo phone .
8 | The Americal Idol phone
AT&T / Cingular has always had a relationship with Americal Idol , being the official cell phone provider of texting in your vote .
And , in the third season , Ryan Seacrest did n’t just talk about texting in your vote , he also held up a phone .
It was an ugly , ugly Nokia .
For some reason , they decided that 12 keys were just too many .
So they turned the 12 buttons into six buttons , and , by all accounts , made it impossible to accurately dial .
And probably impossible to accurately text in your vote .
Maybe that ’s how John Stevens outlasted Jennifer Hudson that year .
9 | The giant hinged Samsungs
Cell phones are smaller now than they were in the past , that ’s a fact .
But even eight to 10 years ago , most cell phone companies were , at least , trying to give the illusion of sleekness .
Not Samsung .
They made two phones ( the N200 and N300 ) which required swinging giant , mostly useless pieces of plastic out to have conversations .
The N300 had a flimsy little flap that swung down from in front of the keypad and served as the microphone .
The N200 took it even farther … you had to swing up an extraordinarily bulky piece of plastic to get to the keys … and then that plastic served as the earpiece .
But I give Samsung credit for being non-conformist here .
Who says small is cool ?
Not Samsung .
Damn straight .
10 | The birth control phone
I like that when this Nokia phone came out , everyone compared the keypad to a container for birth control pills .
We ’re such a country of perverts .
Perverts with cell phones that allow us to be bigger perverts .
11 | The Nokia communicator
This was during the brief phase where Nokia considered transitioning from a cell phone manufacturer into a boat anchor manufacturer .
Apologies to all of the other ugly , experimental Nokias and Motorola flops that did n’t make the list .
And to my first phone , which was a flip phone from Sprint and Samsung that had the best battery life in history .
Seriously .
That thing would last a week .
And it can hold a charge , too .
I turned the phone on about a year ago , after six or so years of sitting in a storage box , and it turned right on and still had two battery pieces left .
Now , if you ’ll excuse me , I need to go leech more power off my roommate ’s phone .
After all , my Motorola Q has been on for half a day .

It 's fascinating , and Kamen makes for compelling watching .

Click to view Interesting stuff , as I said , and the Luke arm seems to have a pretty astounding future ahead of it .
I can't help thinking I 'd 've asked a few more direct questions though .
Is the arm dexterous enough for it to let a wearer / user use the toilet ?
When the Luke arm gets to that level of sophistication — and , more importantly , when its developer / users trust it enough to do intimate tasks like that with it — that 's the point at which I reckon the arm will stop being a science - technology showpiece and really make a difference in people 's lives .

Recently Ryan North very kindly asked me to create a Guest Dinosaur Comic for him , and of course I said " heck yes ! "
Here it is everybody ( referencing this old Dinosaur Comic from years past )
The SGI STL documentation notes that std::map::operator[ ] is redundant :
Strictly speaking , this member function is unnecessary : it exists only for convenience .
This sentence pretty much nails what ’s meant by “ syntactic sugar ” , defined more formally in Wikipedia as :
… a term coined by Peter J. Landin for additions to the syntax of a computer language that do not affect its functionality but make it “ sweeter ” for humans to use .
For example , Python ’s @decorator syntax sweetens the practice of wrapping functions .
In C++ , operator overloading adds nothing which could n’t be achieved using standard function call syntax , but it opens the door to some inventive and expressive techniques .
Haskell has a nice syntax for custom infix operators , and so on .
Lisp values its spare syntax and certainly wo n’t allow infix operators , but even a minimalist dialect like Scheme allows lists to be represented like this ( a b c d e ) rather than ( a . ( b . ( c . ( d . ( e . ( ) ) ) ) ) ) .
Perl comes laced and frosted with syntactic sugar .
Larry
Wall explains why he does n’t heed Alan Perlis ’s famous warning about cancer of the semicolon .
To me , one of the most agonizing aspects of language design is coming up with a useful system of operators .
To other language designers , this may seem like a silly thing to agonize over .
After all , you can view all operators as mere syntactic sugar — operators are just funny looking function calls .
Some languages make a feature of leveling all function calls into one syntax .
As a result , the so - called functional languages tend to wear out your parenthesis keys , while OO languages tend to wear out your dot key .
— Larry Wall , Apocalypse 3 , Operators
( Perl , of course , tends to wear out your shift key …)
There ’s not much in C++ you could n’t manage using C , given enough effort .
I both use and bitch about C++ and sometimes it ’s good to get back to the plain and wholesome taste of C .
Not for long though : I start to miss the standard containers and algorithms , operator overloading , exceptions etc .
I mention this because I ’ve been thinking about what makes good software documentation .
If I ’m working with the C standard library , I tend to refer to the man pages for help , and very fine they are too .
Apparently man pages for the C++ standard library exist but they do n’t come as standard on my platform and I have n’t installed them — instead I refer to the SGI STL Programmer ’s Guide , which I ’ve downloaded locally for instant and offline access .
Now , it ’s clear this guide has n’t been actively maintained ( the “ What ’s New ” page lists nothing more recent than June 2000 ) : it includes non-standard extensions and in some places I ’ve found it ’s no longer correct [ 1 ] .
Nonetheless , its clear exposition and clean layout make it my first point of reference .
C++’s standard map container bears a superficial resemblance to Python ’s dict , associating keys with values ( under the surface , a map is a balanced tree and a dict is a hash table [ 2 ] ) .
Like Python , the [ ] operator syntax can be used for container access .
Unlike Python , accessing the value associated with a key not present in the map succeeds — the key gets added and the value is default constructed [ 3 ] .
Here ’s how the SGI guide documents this overloading of operator [ ] ( emphasis mine ) .
Since operator [ ] might insert a new element into the map , it ca n’t possibly be a const member function .
Note that the definition of operator [ ] is extremely simple : m[k ] is equivalent to (*(( m.insert ( value_type( k , data_type ( ) ) ) ) . first ) ) .
second .
Strictly speaking , this member function is unnecessary : it exists only for convenience .
Should reference documentation entertain ?
This paragraph may not have had me rolling on the floor with laughter , but I did snort in my coffee .
Here ’s some compact C++ code designed to showcase the convenience of the operator overload , in this case calculating word frequencies in an istream :
typedef std::string
Word ; typedef std:: map<Word , int > WordCounts ; void count_words ( std : : istream & text , WordCounts & word_counts ) {
Word word ; while ( text >> word ) { ++word_counts [ word ] ; } }
Using the supplied definition of operator [ ] , the loop reads :
while ( text >> word ) {
++(*(( word_counts.insert ( WordCounts:: value_type( word , WordCounts : : mapped_type ( ) ) ) . first ) ) ) .
second ; }
Now , I realise you have to be clever to use C++ , and I ’m sure there ’s a better way of laying out this expression , but can really anyone find it extremely simple ?
Syntactic sugar .
Pour it on !
[ 1 ]
For example , in the quoted documentation for operator [ ] , data_type ( ) should now read mapped_type ( ) .
[ 2 ] TR1 at last brings a standard hash table to C++ , which goes under the unlikely name of std::tr1::unordered_map .
[ 3 ]

KERMAN PROVINCE , Iran ( Reuters ) - For some Iranians , it ’s a galling thought : the United States may oust Iran as the world ’s largest producer of pistachio nuts this year because of one of the worst harvests ever in the Islamic Republic .
A worker sorts pistachios by hand during a final inspection before packing at a processing factory in Rafsanjan , southeast of Tehran , September 23 , 2008 .

The popular nibble is Iran ’s main export commodity outside the oil sector , earning it more than $ 1 billion last year , and providing many people with jobs in the arid , southeastern province of Kerman , which has 140,000 pistachio farmers .
Unusually cold weather during the flowering in April dealt a blow to the 2008 crop , which farmers say is down by as much as 75 percent from last season ’s record of 280,000 tons ( 617.3 million pounds ) .
The shortfall has helped push up pistachio prices but not by enough to compensate for lower volumes , they say .
The poor harvest follows a severe drought that is forcing Iran to import millions of tons of wheat and causing power shortages in the world ’s fourth - largest crude producer .
“ We actually never had production as low as this , ” said Behrooz Agah , whose grandfather pioneered exports of the split - shelled nuts in the 1930s .
“ For Iranian pistachio farmers , yes , it is a crisis , ” he said , standing in sweltering heat amid rows of trees with bunches of the red - green nuts growing in desert - like terrain .
Agah said he expected export revenue to fall to $ 350 - 400 million and that this year ’s frost would also hit the 2009 crop .
Though pistachio prices have now jumped after a period of stagnation , margins have been squeezed by double - digit inflation -- running at an annual 27 percent -- and rising costs .
The relative stability of Iran ’s rial against the U.S. dollar has not given those selling abroad any major relief .
Mehdi Agah , Behrooz ’s uncle and a board member of Iran ’s Pistachio Association , said the country was experiencing the so - called Dutch Disease , where the value of a currency is strong because of lucrative oil or gas exports , hurting the ability of other sectors to compete internationally .
“ Already the carpet industry has lost business to the Dutch Disease , ” he said , referring to another export earner .

JOB LOSSES
Economic consultant Saeed Laylaz said Iran ’s imports were growing faster than its non-oil exports , making the country more sensitive to the price of crude , which has plunged from a July peak of $ 147 per barrel on deepening global economic gloom .
Iran relies on windfall gains from its hydrocarbon wealth for its budget and to pay for surging imports of goods , which are forecast to almost double to $ 83 billion between 2005 - 2010 .
“ We are three times more dependent on oil revenue than 10 years ago .
This is a huge change , ” Laylaz said in Tehran .
The International Monetary Fund warned in a report in August that Iran ’s swelling current account surplus could swing into deficit in the medium - term if oil went to $ 75 .
Crude this week traded just below $ 90 a barrel .
For Iran ’s pistachio farmers , however , the most pressing problem is this year ’s crop failure at a time of growing demand from new consumers in countries such as China and Russia .
Big farms employ hundreds of mainly Afghan laborers during the harvest in September .
But this season warehouses stand half - empty and machines lie idle .
“ Workers are going to be laid off , ” said Ali Alizadeh , who manages a processing plant where the nuts are cleaned and dried .
He expected the firm ’s exports to fall by around 70 percent .
OLD FOE TAKES LEAD
The pistachio problem alone would be serious enough in a country where the official jobless rate is around 10 percent , but there is also a political dimension .
The Sarmayeh business daily said last month the United States might this year produce more pistachios than Iran for the first time .
“ Americans are using all advertising tools and their financial power for victory in this market , ” it quoted Mohammad Hossein Karimipour , head of the agricultural commission of Iran ’s Chamber of Commerce , as saying .
The United States has more than doubled production in the last decade to 416 million pounds ( about 190,000 tons ) in 2007 , most of it in California .
With a good pistachio year usually followed by a weaker harvest , California ’s output is expected to fall to 260 - 270 million pounds in 2008 but this would still be more than many are forecasting in Iran .
Barring any major weather problems , “ we would expect to have a crop next year of around 425 million pounds , ” executive director Richard Matoian of the U.S. Western Pistachio Association said .
Washington severed ties with Tehran shortly after Iran ’s 1979 Islamic Revolution and the countries are now also at odds over the Islamic state ’s disputed nuclear activities , which the West suspects are aimed at making bombs .
Iran , which is under U.S. and United Nations sanctions , denies the charge .
A report in the Iran Daily newspaper in June said the United States tried “ to improve its position in the global war of pistachio production and export by undermining Iranian trade in every way . ”
Others are more sanguine .
Mehdi Agah said he expected Iran to take back the number one spot next year .
SELLER’S MARKET
He and others in Kerman , a province of 2.7 million people where pistachios are the main source of income for one fifth of the population , played down the Californian angle and said water shortage was their chief concern .
Mohsen Jalalpour of Kerman ’s Chamber of Commerce said lack of water after years of below average rainfall could cut output .
The Pistachio Association is hoping for government backing to help shift production to other parts of Iran where there is more water , for example in the west .
“ If we do this ... there will be no fear of American competition , ” said Mehdi Agah .
U.S. producers might use water and land more effectively but Iranian farmers say nobody can rival the taste of their pistachios , which are also used in sweets and ice - creams .
Some producers also said rising demand and prices meant there was room for both Iran and the United States .
China has emerged as Iran ’s biggest export market after sales to Europe took a hit in the last decade due to concerns over aflatoxin , a carcinogen produced by a fungus that grows on the pistachio nut under certain conditions .
Iranian producers say they are addressing the aflatoxin issue and that European interest is picking up again .

No one could have seen this coming , right ?
Well , actually , the White House has admitted that they drew up the bail out plan months ago :
[ White House Deputy Press Secretary Tony ]
Fratto insisted that the plan was not slapped together and had been drawn up as a contingency over previous months and weeks by administration officials .
He acknowledged lawmakers were getting only days to peruse it , but he said this should be enough .
But the government did nothing real to prevent the financial meltdown .
Instead , it let the meltdown happen , and now is trying to ram through terrible and counter - productive legislation drafted previously by using fear tactics .
Does this sound familiar ?
It should .
FINANCIAL TURMOIL FINANCIAL TURMOIL
More coverage : Recession is official , economists say President Bush again pressed for quick action Monday on a $ 700 billion government bailout plan for Wall Street , but some key Democrats urged a more deliberate approach as negotiations continue .
The uncertainty helped send the Dow Jones industrial average down almost 200 points at mid-day .
Bush issued a statement at the White House saying " the whole world is watching " how the U.S. government addresses the continuing turmoil in the worldwide financial markets , as investors await more details about the government 's plan to buy banks ' mortgage debt .
Anxious lawmakers have vowed cooperation but insisted that any rescue include more government accountability , aid troubled homeowners and prevent Wall Street executives at taxpayer - aided firms from reaping generous payouts .
Monday , some leading congressional Democrats were calling for a more deliberative approach than that favored by Bush .
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd voiced confidence in Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , saying that " we 've got the right man " to deal with the problem that has roiled not only Wall Street but international markets as well .
But his counterpart in the House , Rep. Barney Frank , accused Paulson of pushing Congress to move too hastily .
Dodd , D - Conn. , said Monday morning that there will be a division of thought in Congress about how best to proceed on a $ 700 billion bill the Bush administration is seeking from lawmakers to buy up bad mortgage loans that have been weighing down financial companies since they became engulfed in a severe credit crisis 14 months ago .
Dodd , interviewed on CBS's The Early Show , said many members of Congress believe a legislative relief package also should be tailored to protect taxpayers in the best way possible .
He said they should be " first in line " to get money back once conditions in the industry stabilize and recover .
Under a proposal outlined Monday by Dodd , a draft of which was obtained Monday by the Associated Press : • Judges could rewrite mortgages to lower bankrupt homeowners ' monthly payments .
•
Companies that unloaded their bad assets on the government in the massive rescue would have to limit their executives ' pay packages and agree to revoke any bonuses awarded based on bogus claims .
•
The government would have broad power to buy up virtually any kind of bad asset , including credit card debt and car loans , from any financial institution in the U.S. or abroad in order to stabilize markets .
But it would end the program at the end of next year , instead of creating the two - year - long initiative that the Bush administration has sought .
•
An emergency board would be established to keep an eye on the program with two congressional appointees , and a special inspector general appointed by the president .
Also Monday , finance officials from the globe 's major economic powers said they welcomed the steps taken to stem the crisis .
The Group of Seven , made up the the United States , Japan , Germany , France , Britain , Italy and Canada , issued a statement saying it was " ready to take whatever actions may be necessary , individually and collectively , to ensure the stability of the international financial system . "
On Sunday , Paulson made the rounds of the major TV news programs to make the case that hisprogram to buy up toxic mortgage securities is vital to keep financial markets functioning and prevent a collapse .
" The credit markets are still very fragile right now and frozen , " Paulson told NBC's Meet the Press .
" We need to deal with this and deal with it quickly . "
SHAKE -UP CONTINUES : Goldman , Morgan to become bank holding companies Acknowledging that taxpayers and some members of Congress are dubious — and upset — about rescuing wealthy firms that made risky business bets , Paulson said there is simply no other path given worldwide carnage in financial markets .
" It pains me tremendously to have the American taxpayer put in this position , but it is better than the alternative , " Paulson said .
He and President Bush are urging Congress to pass a plan by the end of this week .
If approved , the government 's commitments related to the credit crunch would be about $ 1.6 trillion .
At $ 700 billion , the latest pledge would approach the more than $ 750 billion that 's been spent for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and fighting terrorism since Sept. 11 , 2001 .
On Capitol Hill , top lawmakers from both parties said they understand the enormous stakes and want to act this week .
But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , said Congress would " not simply hand over a $ 700 billion blank check to Wall Street and hope for a better outcome , " adding that the " party is over for the Bush administration 's anything - goes , failed economic policies . "
Sen. Richard Shelby , R - Ala. , whose support is pivotal as he's the senior Republican on the Banking Committee , said he is " unconvinced that Treasury 's proposal strikes a balance between the interests of the taxpayer and the economy . "
A list of changes Frank gave Treasury a list of changes he wants in any bailout bill : limits on executive compensation at firms aided by the government ; regular reports by Treasury , including audits by Congress ' Government Accountability Office ; and more intense federal efforts to help homeowners prevent foreclosure .
The White House plan would give Treasury sweeping power to issue up to $ 700 billion in bonds to fund the purchase of residential and commercial loans that have gone bad , either in the form of mortgage - backed securities or regular loans .
Treasury officials , who would report periodically on their holdings , could buy other assets if necessary to stabilize financial markets .
The program , to be overseen by private asset managers , would run for two years , covering loans made before Sept. 17 .
To qualify , financial institutions would have to have " significant " U.S. operations , though Treasury and the Federal Reserve could widen the program .
Congress would increase the federal debt limit by $ 700 billion to $ 11.3 trillion .
Paulson said on ABC's This Week that the White House will push to include foreign firms in the plan .
" If a financial institution has business operations in the United States , hires people in the United States , if they are clogged with illiquid assets , they have the same impact on the American people as any other institution , " he said .
" The key here is about protecting the system . "
Dodd said lawmakers want to improve the legislation , not derail it .
He said a briefing by Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke outlining the potential devastation from a financial - sector meltdown was so grim that he " had to go back almost to the reactions I had to the 9/11 " attacks to describe his state of alarm .
The plan follows a series of government efforts over the past year that failed to stabilize credit markets .
Spooked investors last week pulled an estimated $ 200 billion from money market funds , sent stock markets gyrating and forced central banks to pump in hundreds of billions of dollars to keep credit flowing .
In another sign that troubles in financial markets are far from over , the Fed late Sunday announced that it had approved the applications of investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to become bank holding companies — pending a five - day waiting period .
The change gives the firms more power to bolster their financial bottom lines by raising deposits .
It will also allow them to borrow directly from the Fed 's discount window as commercial banks can .
Paulson 's solution is for the government to buy up all of the toxic mortgages and mortgage - backed securities at the heart of the credit crisis .
Banks cannot easily sell them because their values are dropping as housing prices fall and mortgage delinquencies rise .
They 've written down the value of those securities by billions of dollars , which has shrunk their capital and the amount available to lend .
The credit squeeze has already spawned 12 bank failures this year , including one on Friday in West Virginia .
It has made financial firms wary of lending to one another for fear they wo n't get paid back and made them tighten lending standards for businesses and consumers alike .
' Fearful and unconvinced ' House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , said Sunday he would work for the plan .
But a number of GOP lawmakers were skeptical about the huge price tag and enormous expansion of federal authority , especially after Treasury 's recent takeover of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Fed 's emergency $ 85 billion loan to struggling insurance behemoth American International Group .
" I 'm skeptical , fearful and unconvinced , " says Rep. Jeb Hensarling , R - Texas , who fears the nation is moving toward European - style socialism .
" Having said that , it may be the most important vote I cast in my congressional career , so I continue to keep an open mind about the subject … study it , think about it and pray about it . "
Economists said decisive action is needed — and well overdue .
" They let the crisis go on for too long .
They fiddled around with these liquidity programs " that let investment banks borrow money at low rates , said Brian Bethune , chief U.S. economist of Global Insight .
" The bottom line is that it has not been enough . "
Yet analysts disagree over whether even $ 700 billion is sufficient and whether the plan will inflict long - term damage on the economy .
Bethune says the funding should be adequate .
He estimates the face value of the mortgage - backed securities is $ 1.25 trillion , of which banks already have written off about $ 500 billion , leaving about $ 800 billion .
But he says they will likely write down an additional $ 100 billion to $ 200 billion : " I think ( $ 700 billion ) seems reasonable in terms of the total number , and it's more than what I expected . "
The distressed assets are now selling on average for about 40 cents on the dollar , with even viable securities getting sharp markdowns .
The government , he says , will likely pay more than that but less than the securities ' actual worth if they were held to maturity — perhaps about 60 cents on the dollar .
Several months may be required to fund the plan and buy the securities , but the announcement itself could calm spooked markets , letting banks attract new investment even before they unload the bad debt .
In fact , it could boost the value of the securities , causing some banks not to sell and cutting the bailout 's cost , Bethune says .
" Some banks may not even bother to sell , " he says .
Yet the plan also carries big risks .
Christopher Whalen , managing director of Institutional Risk Analytics , says the government ultimately will have to spend as much as $ 1.4 trillion buying sour mortgage assets , depending on how many foreign banks participate .
Its ability to borrow all that money is not a given , he says .
Whalen predicts the bailout will set off economic upheaval .
The government will have to borrow so much that it will drive up interest rates , weaken the dollar and worsen inflation .
" I think you can see interest rates in the double digits , " he says .
" Congress thinks they can borrow forever .
The dollar is going to fall .
Nobody is going to want to hold U.S. debt . "
Whalen says , " I do n't think we need to rescue Wall Street .
Wall Street is curing itself quite nicely .
If we do n't allow our people to feel pain , it 's not going to inoculate them " against future crises .
Some economists warn that the long - term costs to the USA will loom even larger , as the bailouts hurt future federal spending for health care , Social Security and education .
" They 're just blowing the bank wide open right here , " says Jagadeesh Gokhale , senior fellow at the Cato Institute .
" We still really do n't know what the exposure may be . "
The financial sector is lobbying for changes and clarifications in the plan .
The Financial Services Roundtable , which represents 100 of the largest financial services companies , said Sunday that while it supports the general thrust of the proposal , it wants a mechanism to figure out what kind of assets the Treasury should buy , and at what price .
Unforeseen results
More generally , banking and financial firms say that a series of bold actions taken by Treasury in recent days could have unintended consequences on financial firms .
Just Friday , for example , Treasury said it would temporarily insure the holdings of money market mutual funds up to $ 50 billion to firms that pay a fee to participate in the government program .
Money market mutual funds hold about $ 234 billion of asset - backed commercial paper .
In recent days , investors have acted to get out of money market mutual funds , forcing firms to sell holdings to pay the investors .
But the crisis in financial markets has made it harder for firms to sell even their high - quality holdings .
Independent mortgage consultant Howard Glaser says the bailout puts the government in an awkward , conflicted position .
" The federal government is both the owner of the loan and so may want to seek maximum return by foreclosing , and they have an express interest in keeping people in their homes and trying to avoid foreclosures . "
But he says , " My broad sense is there are no arrows left in the quiver for the federal government .
" They have to take action .
It 's not perfect , but it 's the only avenue they have at this point . "

A serious consumer slowdown looks to be taking hold , and some economists in the latest Wall Street Journal economic forecasting survey say it could be a major retrenchment lasting for years .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama leads Republican rival John McCain by 14 percentage points , with three weeks to go until the U.S. election , a CBS News / New York Times poll showed on Tuesday .
Obama had 53 percent support to McCain ’s 39 percent in the national opinion poll , CBS News said .
Obama ’s lead was 3 points higher than in the previous poll on October 6 .
In the midst of a financial crisis and with the election looming on November 4 , the stakes are high for the third and final debate between Obama and McCain on Wednesday at 9 p.m. EDT in Hempstead , New York .
“ Among independents who are likely voters -- a group that has swung back and forth between McCain and Obama over the course of the campaign -- the Democratic ticket now leads by 18 points .
McCain led among independents last week , ” CBS said .
It said Obama was widely seen as running the more positive campaign , with 61 percent saying McCain was spending more time attacking Obama than explaining what he would do as president .
Just 27 percent said the same thing about Obama .
McCain ’s favorable rating dropped 4 points to 36 percent and was now lower than his 41 percent unfavorable rating , CBS said .
Obama was seen favorably by half of registered voters and unfavorably by 32 percent .
The latest CBS News / New York Times poll was conducted by telephone among 1,070 adults nationwide from Friday to Monday .
The margin of error was 3 percentage points .
McCain has sought to regain his footing on economic issues over the past three weeks after facing criticism for saying the fundamentals of the U.S. economy were strong despite signs of crisis on Wall Street .
During that time , Obama has moved from a tie with McCain in national polls to a lead .
In more bad news for the McCain campaign , a Quinnipiac University / Wall Street Journal / Washingtonpost.com poll on Tuesday gave Obama sizable leads in four battleground states .
McCain and Obama unveiled new plans this week to head off a recession in the United States as officials around the world try to ward off economic damage from the financial crisis .
How to Read an FBI File
September 4 , 2008
Maybe you found an FBI file on the web , maybe you got it through a web site like Get Grandpa 's FBI File or Get My FBI File , maybe you found it at the National Archives , or maybe it was up in the attic in great - aunt Mildred 's possessions .
If you 're like most people , after you read it you probably had a bunch of questions .
FBI files are filled with jargon , abbreviations , file numbers , codes , blacked out chunks of text , and odd little codes in the margin .
Very puzzling !
If you 're serious about trying to understand the stuff in that file , this document is for you .
Its goal is to help you understand the contents of your FBI file .
( For convenience , let 's say " your file " even though the file may be about someone else . )
This document is divided into two parts .
The first covers the actual content of an FBI file -- what 's in it , how to make sense of FBI abbreviations , etc .
The second deals with the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) , which is likely how the file you 're looking at was obtained .
That section will help you understand why some bits of text were blanked out , what the odd little codes in the margin mean , and give you some hints on where you can get more information .
Part I : The Contents of an FBI File
Let 's talk geography for a second .
( Trust me on this . )
The FBI 's Headquarters ( HQ , also called " The Bureau " in FBI files ) is in Washington D.C. ( HQ is also sometimes referred to as the Seat of Government or " SOG . " )
The FBI also has 56 Field Offices in major cities across the United States .
Smaller offices called Resident Agencies ( RAs ) exist in smaller cities .
Legal Attaches ( " LEGATs " ) exist in some foreign countries .
Most of what you will see in an FBI file is messages going back and forth between Field Offices and HQ .
It may help to think of an FBI file as a collection of what today would be e-mail messages .
Just as e-mail messages today can range from trivial to vitally important , so too can the messages in FBI files .
Some of these messages will have been sent by teletype , others by airmail , and still others by normal surface mail .
Some of the communications will be mundane or administrative while others will be more interesting .
Documents in FBI files can be as serious as a " prosecutive summary " or non-prosecutive summary or something like 50 + page investigative report by a Field Office or by Headquarters which is then forwarded to military intelligence , the White House , the Attorney General or other government agencies -- and much of that data will be classified Confidential , Secret , or Top Secret .
Other documents contained in FBI files include court documents , transcripts of testimony taken under oath at Congressional hearings , credit bureau reports , incorporation documents , military service records from the National Personnel Records Center , electronic surveillance transcripts , reports to and from the U.S. Secret Service , from Army , Navy or Air Force Intelligence , and security components of various agencies .
Note that most messages sent to HQ are addressed to the " Director . "
The Director of the FBI did not personally read every one of these messages .
Rather , messages sent to HQ are processed by FBI agents assigned to the office of the Director .
Similarly , messages from the Director were generally written by one of his staff members .
( That said , one FBI file researcher commented that , " Anything of national significance or which might be of potential embarrassment to the Bureau or the Administration in power was routinely circulated among top Bureau officials -- including Hoover .
Everything which alleged an FBI connection to some matter which might bring the FBI into disrepute or potentially involve the Bureau in some sort of political controversy was immediately sent up the food chain and seen by Hoover .
It really is quite amazing how much seemingly mundane stuff Hoover initialed and often hand - wrote comments or instructions on -- including whether or not an inquiry from a correspondent should be answered and whether or not FBI publications should be sent to requesters . " )
The FBI Filing System
You 're going to see a lot of file numbers in FBI files , so we need to talk a little bit about how the FBI filing system works .
One of the most astonishing things about the FBI filing system is that FBI HQ and FBI Field Offices keep separate files with separate file numbers .
This means that there might be a file number 87 - 1234 at Headquarters and it is likely completely unrelated to file 87 - 1234 in the San Francisco Field Office -- which in turn is probably completely unrelated to file 87 - 1234 in the New York Field Office !
This might seem crazy today , but back before computers and the Internet when the FBI was started this was probably a pretty reasonable approach .
Because of this , a complete FBI file designator is made up of three parts :
The FBI classification number in the FBI 's Central Records System that the investigation or file was opened under .
This is a two - or three - digit number which specifies broadly the type of offense was being investigated .
For example , 87 is fraud , 139 is interception of communications .
A complete list of FBI offense codes is provided on the Thunder and Lightning News Service web site .
This code is also sometimes called an " offense code . "
We 'll use that terminology in this document to avoid confusion with security classifications ( e.g. , secret , top secret , etc. ) , which are also called " classifications . "
A code indicating where the file originated , either FBI Headquarters or a Field Office .
These tend to be two - letter codes but are sometimes three letters .
For example , Headquarters is HQ , Los Angeles is LA , San Francisco is SF , etc .
A complete list of these abbreviations is given on a separate page .
The file number , which is typically a 3 - 6 digit number that is unique ( for that offense code ) to Headquarters or the Field Office .
So for example , file number 139 - HQ - 4992 is a file from FBI headquarters dealing with interception of communications ( e.g. , wiretapping ) and is file number 4992 in that offense code at Headquarters .
File 87 - NY - 6837 is fraud case number 6837 in the New York field office .
Note that 87 is the offense code , not the year of the file .
HQ files are sometimes called " Bureau " files so you might see reference to " Bufile 139-4992 . "
This is the same as 139 - HQ - 4992 .
Similarly , Field Office files are often written as something like " SF 87-1234 " instead of " 87 - SF - 1234 . "
A few pages marked up to indicate file numbers .

A few pages marked up to indicate file numbers .
( Click for 3 - page pdf . )
You may sometimes see an offense code followed by the word " new . "
For example , " 100 - new . "
This indicates that the office has opened a new investigation in the 100 series ( subversive matters ) but that a file number was n't yet assigned as of the time of writing .
A hypothetical Headquarters file 139 - HQ - 4992 might have several corresponding Field Office files , depending on where the investigation took place .
If this was a wiretapping case in New York , there might be a New York file 139 - NY - 399 that is the Field Office file on the matter .
However , sometimes the offense code in the Field Office may not match that at headquarters .
As a result you sometimes wind up with funny situations like a HQ file number 139 - HQ - 4992 corresponding to Kansas City file 87 - KC - 1240 .
As you go through your file you will see references to other file numbers .
If you have a HQ file , these other files will frequently be Field Office files ; if you have a Field Office file , you will see reference to the Headquarters file .
If you are interested in learning more about the subject of your file , you will likely want to file a Freedom of Information
Act request to obtain these corresponding files if you do n't have them already .
A key point : Field Office files often contain significantly more information than HQ files .
Consequently , the field office file should not be considered as a useless " duplicate " of HQ files .
While it is true that much of the material in a Field Office file may be in a HQ file , it may have a lot that is n't there , too .
The upper left corner of reports and the lower left corner of cover pages are good places to look for file numbers .
Also , most letters , telegrams , and teletype messages will have file numbers after the " From " and " To " lines .
( If you click on the tiny page to the right you 'll be rewarded with three pages of an FBI file that has been annotated to identify all the file numbers mentioned in it . )
It is important to keep in mind that these other file numbers do not necessarily pertain to the same subject .
For example , a HQ file on Joseph Smith ( 100 - 123456 ) might indicate the following additional files : Los Angeles 100- 2347 , New York 157-2345 and Chicago 65-65192 .
These other files may not be specifically on Joseph Smith .
Instead , they may be files which contain data about organizations or publications or some other matters deemed important for cross-referencing purposes .
Perhaps the Los Angeles file pertains to an organization which Joseph Smith was involved with for some period of time , the New York file might be a file on Communist Party infiltration of that organization , and the Chicago file might be on Congressional testimony by an informant who mentioned his / her connection to Joseph Smith . )
Because file numbers mentioned in an FBI file do n't always have the two - letter code showing which office the file is from , it can sometimes be tough to tell whether a file number is a HQ or Field Office file .
In these cases some thought may be required to puzzle this out .
TIP : Make a list all the file numbers mentioned as you read through your file .
By the way , the offense code gives insight into the FBI 's thought process during the investigation .
The Field Office might have thought your file was a low - level administrative inquiry ( file class 62 ) but the FBI Headquarters file might be something more ominous , like espionage ( file class 65 ) .
Serials
TIP : Check your serials .
If you do n't have all of them , try to match the missing serials up with pages listed on the deleted page sheet that followed the cover letter from the FBI .
Each document in an FBI file is called a " serial . "
A serial could be something as simple as a one - page teletype message or something more complex , like a 45 - page report with a 3 - page cover memo .
Most serials are given a serial number , although a few are " unrecorded " ( i.e. , not given a serial number ) .
Serial numbers typically start at 1 in each file and increase sequentially from there , though occasionally serial numbers may start with " X " and then proceed to " X - 2 " and then " X - 3 " and so on , eventually followed by serial # 1 .
Serial numbers are frequently handwritten in the lower right - hand corner of the front of the document in large letters .
They consist of the file number ( without the HQ or Field Office identifier ) followed by a dash and the serial number .
For example , if the file number is 139-4991 , serial number 3 of that file will be written as 139-4991 - 3 .
Alas , sometimes serial numbers are illegible , or are redacted .
Serials in a file are not always in chronological order .
That is , serial # 1 is n't always the earliest document in the file .
If this is the case for your file it may help to rearrange serials chronologically .
( Also , sometimes public source materials ( e.g. , newspaper and magazine articles or copies of flyers or newsletters ) may be put at the front of the file and given a serial number such as " 1A " or " 1B " ; you can think of these as " sub files " of the main file . )
TIP : Account for missing pages .
If you do n't you can get way confused .
See left for details .
It is sometimes difficult to tell if you have all the pages in a given serial , especially since the FBI FOIA team may have withheld some pages in their entirety .
One trick is that usually the FBI is pretty good about putting an asterisk after the last page number of a document .
So if you look at the bottom of the page and see " 3 * " in the center it tells you that this is page 3 of a 3 page document .
Captions
Most documents in an FBI file are titled or " captioned " with information on the file subject .
A caption generally consists of three lines : the name of the subject , the character or nature of the case being investigated ( often a cryptic abbreviation ) , and the office of origin ( " OO " ) .
So a caption might look like :
Joe Blow , a.k.a.
ITWI ; ITSP
OO : San Francisco
This tells you that the case concerns somebody named Joe Blow who is also known by other names ( " a.k.a. " ; sometimes the abbreviation " was " for " with aliases " is also used ) and that Mr. Blow is being investigated for interstate transportation of wagering information ( ITWI ) and interstate transportation of stolen property ( ITSP ) .
The office of origin ( OO ) is San Francisco .
Sometimes there can be more than one office of origin , e.g. , if a suspect moves .
A secret decoder ring for some of these abbreviations is available at abbreviations.com .
Forms
One thing you will quickly notice is that the FBI was , and is , crazy about forms .
Are you interviewing an informant ?
Fill out an FD - 209 .
Visiting a foreign country ?
Fill out an FD - 473 .
The good people at The MemoryHole have obtained a comprehensive list of FBI forms under FOIA , but some of the most common you 're likely to run into are :
FD - 204 : Investigative report
FD - 263 : Cover page accompanying investigative report
FD - 302 : Form for reporting information that may become testimony
Another document you may run into is a " letterhead memorandum " , abbreviated LHM .
This is an official FBI memorandum that was expected to be shown to someone outside the FBI .
Abbreviations and Jargon
FBI files are rife with abbreviations and FBI jargon .
A pretty good list of FBI abbreviations is available at abbreviations.com .
A shorter list of some of the more common abbreviations is at the end of this document .
One abbreviation which you may find puzzling when you first encounter it is " RUC . "
Literally this stands for " referred upon completion " but that does n't quite explain what it means .
It typically is used when HQ or a Field Office requests another Field Office to investigate something : when the Field Office is finished it will respond with something like " We are placing this matter in RUC status " which is FBI - speak for " Okay , here 's the stuff you asked for .
We 're done with this unless you tell us differently . "
Symbol Sources
Depending on the nature of your file , you may run into the phrases " symbol source " or " non-symbol source . "
The FBI sometimes uses informants or technical sources of information ( such as microphones or wiretaps ) when conducting an investigation .
To protect the identity of these sources in some cases the FBI will replace the sources names with an abbreviation called a symbol , e.g. , T - 1 , T - 2 , etc .
Big surprise : these are called symbol sources .
Sources not so protected are called non-symbol sources .
" June Mail "
If you 're lucky :-) you may run into mention of " June Mail " in your file .
According to Unlocking the Files of the FBI , " June Mail was information received from or relating to the FBI 's ' most sensitive sources , ' including governors , secretaries to high officials , extremely confidential information , and ' highly confidential or unusual investigative techniques ' " ( e.g. , black bag jobs ) .
Mail Covers
A mail cover is a investigatory technique in which the names and addresses of a subject 's mail correspondence are recorded .
Mail covers do n't actually open someone 's mail but they do make a record of all the subject 's incoming and outgoing mail .
Correlation Summaries
On files of major significance , the Bureau often prepared a " correlation summary " which essentially is a chronological history of data contained in the file .
This is extremely important because often the correlation summary identifies cross-references and related files that contain information about the subject which is not always released when the main file was processed .
Part II : FBI Files and the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA )
This section deals with things you 'll see in your file that are not part of the FBI file itself but are rather artifacts of your file having been processed by the FBI under the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) .
Why Does My File Look Like Swiss Cheese Sprinkled with Gibberish ?
Swiss cheese sprinkled with gibberish .

If your FBI file was obtained under FOIA the FBI almost certainly withheld -- " redacted " -- some information .
( The image to the right gives an example of this ; click to get a larger version . )
The way the FOIA law works is that you are entitled to a complete copy of any Government file or document except for portions of the document that are exempt from disclosure .
These " exemptions " are spelled out in the FOIA law ; the FBI is n't supposed to redact information just because it feels like it .
( That said , several FBI FOIA researchers I spoke to gave low marks to the FBI for " routinely excising " materials , such as data already in the public domain or things that might be embarrassing to the Bureau , " just because they feel like it . "
See Gimme Some Truth : The John Lennon FBI Files by Jon Wiener for one man 's quest to get the FBI to reveal information withheld from a famous file . )
The withheld parts are generally easy to spot : they 're the big white boxes where something should have been in the file !
In some cases entire pages , or dozens or hundreds of pages , may be withheld .
b2
b6
b7c
...
Whenever the FBI withholds information , it has to tell you which exemption -- that is , which part of the FOIA law -- it relied upon to withhold the material .
It does so by noting the specific exemption code , which it typically puts in the right margin of the page -- just like to the right of this paragraph .
These look like little letter - number abbreviations like b2 or b7 c .
These refer to the specific section of the Freedom of Information Act that allows the FBI to withhold this information .
For example , b2 refers to 5 USC 552 ( b ) ( 2 ) .
The EEOC ( of all places ! ) has a nice summary of FOIA exemptions .
You care about the exemption codes for a couple of reasons .
First , they give you an indication of the sort of information that was redacted .
Second , you can infer from them what your chances are of obtaining the redacted information if you wanted to appeal the FBI 's decision to withhold it .
For example , national security redactions are sometimes reversed on appeal , but redactions dealing with protecting the identity of an informant or confidential source are reversed much less frequently .
Third , should you choose to appeal the redaction , the exemption will strongly influence how you write your appeal request .
Security Classifications
Does your document have an interesting message like that to the right ?
" All information contained herein is unclassified " ?
That tells you that at one time the page you 're looking at was classified and has been through a security declassification review .
Some Reference Material
The following materials may help you as you read through your file :

During the US vice presidential debate last week , Sen. Joe Biden ( D ) and Gov. Sarah Palin ( R ) found common ground on at least one topic :
Both support imposing a no - fly zone in Sudan 's troubled Darfur region .
Some 6,000 miles away , Darfuris fleeing their homes welcome such talk , especially after a recent spate of indiscriminate government bombings .
" The government said it was only looking for rebels .
It said it did n't want to harm the people , " says villager Abdullah Isshac , who spent one week hiding in the countryside after a government attack on the village of Khazan Tungur .
" But the rebels are out in the mountains , not in the village . "
To the outside world , Sudan 's government sings a different tune , claiming since July – when the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) sought an arrest warrant for President Omar al - Bashir on charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity , and genocide for his role in the Darfur conflict – that the prosecution of its leader would jeopardize the peace process .
But as the situation on the ground here grows worse , Darfuris are asking : " What peace process are you talking about ? "
Among the many symbols of war in Darfur – sprawling five - year - old camps for displaced people and an ever - growing African Union and United Nations peacekeeping mission – the bumpy road between Tabit and Tawila , two small villages in northern Darfur , offers a striking reminder that this conflict is still going strong .
The hour - long route passes through vast plains and mountain chains and is dotted with small villages – each telling its own story .
In Giringo , a crater three yards in diameter marks the spot where a government plane dropped a bomb just a few weeks ago – only yards away from a set of trees where villagers were seeking refuge from the hot sun .
In Umlaota , ashes and a roofless mud frame are all that remain of a civilian home that was burned by government troop gunfire the same day .
A few yards farther , casings from belt - fed machine guns are strewn across the main road passing by the village .
Stop by any of these villages at night and you will find them mostly empty .
People sleep in the forests in hiding , afraid the attacks will continue .
The road to Tawila ends at the UN peacekeeping mission 's base , just outside a camp for some 25,000 displaced people , with yet another sign of government attacks :
A hole in the barbed razor wire surrounding the base , where desperate residents forced their way through to escape when government police raided their camp in May .
Sudan : ICC indictment hurts peace
But Sudan 's government shows a different face to the world .
Vice President Ali Osman
Taha told the UN General Assembly in New York late last month that the realization of peace in Darfur and the ICC 's aims were two different tracks that could never meet .
At a time when the government had made great strides to implement the peace and reconciliation process , he said , such an indictment would be detrimental .
" The unprecedented move by the ICC prosecutor undermines the ongoing comprehensive peace process which has entered a final phase , " Mr. Bashir added at an international summit last week .
It " will have a catastrophic adverse impact on stability in the entire region . "
Arab and African nations have backed Sudan 's position .
Many Western analysts have cautioned that justice should not come at the price of peace .
" How will the ICC hamper the peace process ?
What peace process ? " asked one international observer in Darfur .
" I do n't see anything happening . "
In fact , quite the opposite is true .
Last month saw heavy fighting between government troops and rebel factions in North Darfur .
Many of the areas targeted by the government were under control of the only rebel group to have made peace with the government in 2006 , contrary to the agreement 's cease - fire .
Tens of thousands of Darfuris are believed to have been displaced , many of them still hiding in the mountains afraid the bomb - dropping Antonov planes will return .
" The government has not even tried to implement the Darfur Peace Agreement .
Not one move , " added the observer , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
" Disarming Arab militias , for example ?
Quite the contrary , they started to give them more weapons and send them out again . "
It 's getting worse , locals say
Many Darfuris continue to bear the brunt of Bashir 's alleged decision to unleash Arab militias – known as janjaweed – on the non-Arab rebels and civilians of their ethnic groups – through harassment by the government 's central reserve police and border guards , who villagers and international observers say are simply former janjaweed .
Analysts have characterized the current conflict as low - level , compared to the height of the conflict in 2003 - 04 , when government troops and allied militias allegedly burned villages , raped women , and looted animals en masse .
But many Darfuris say the conflict is worse today than it was almost five years ago .
Rape , looting , and killing by government police are weekly occurrences in camps for the displaced , residents say .
" [ Government troops ] are the ones attacking us .
How will the ICC threaten the peace process ?
It wo n't jeopardize peace .
If the criminal is caught , we wo n't be afraid anymore , " said one sheikh at a camp for the displaced in Tawila .
" We have run out of hope .
We have given up on everything .
How long can we live like this ? "
Last month , 31 civilians were killed in South Darfur when government troops opened fire on a camp for the displaced , claiming they were trying to confiscate illegal weapons from within the camp .
" And this is while the government is supposed to be putting on its best act , " said one UN official .
" They do n't care and they can get away with it . "
The arrival of the African Union - UN Hybrid operation in Darfur ( UNAMID ) has done little to improve the situation .
Hamstrung by insufficient troops , it is often limited by the insecurity it is supposed to prevent .
Patrols are suspended when tensions flare and villagers say peacekeepers stand and watch as attacks take place .
Insecurity – especially for the close to 17,000 humanitarian workers bringing aid to some 2.5 million people displaced by the conflict – has never been so acute .
Armed robberies and hijackings of aid compounds and vehicles are almost daily occurrences and have now begun taking place in the middle of Darfur 's main towns .
Vehicles are so vulnerable to attack that UN agencies in El - Fasher , capital of North Darfur , no longer drive outside town .
Trips are routinely canceled for security reasons and aid workers feel they have been put in a " stranglehold , " as Gregory Alex of the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs puts it .
The government insists its military operations are to clear the routes of bandits who have made humanitarian work in some parts nearly impossible .
It says the rebels are presenting its operations as attacks against them in order to win battles in the information war .
" The armed forces have the right and the duty to make the routes safe generally for all travelers , " says Sudanese military spokesperson Sawarmi Khalid Saad .
" Some of the [ nongovernmental organizations ] have left their work in Darfur because of this insecurity .
We have to stop it . "
Yet the result has been the opposite : the recent fighting has caused at least one NGO to halt its operations , leaving 20,000 in the Khazan Tungur area without medical care .
And while the government insists it is trying to find peace in Darfur – even signing peace agreements with insignificant split - off members of rebel groups in an effort to extend the illusion , analysts say – a top official from the ruling National Congress Party says the government should not be negotiating with " terrorists , " calling the 2006 peace agreement with the most powerful rebel group a " very stupid " move motivated only by " tremendous pressure " from the West .
" I am not condoning everything that our government does .
I think one of the most stupid acts they have done is to sign an agreement with those rebels , who are bandits , " says Osman Khalid Mudawi , chairman of the foreign relations committee at the National Assembly .
" Sudan could have used the language of the time … .
Sudan should have refused ever to talk to them and branded them as terrorists and no one would have blamed Sudan . "
So fragile is the peace the government is parading publicly in its quest to suspend the ICC case that the aligned rebel group maintains its own weapons , vehicles , and headquarters .
Two major fights between both sides have broken out in the last six months alone .
" As an army , we consider that there is no peace , " says Commander Mohammed Shen of the faction of the Sudan Liberation Army ( SLA ) run by Mini Minawi .
" The government says : ' I want peace , ' then it turns around and bombs [ us ] , " says Moussa Abul Qasim , of Tabit village , where fighting recently broke out between the SLA and government troops .
" It 's all lies . "
And many humanitarians think it is only going to get worse .
Increased movement of government troops ; tactical unification among splintered rebel factions ; the end of the rainy season , which hampers military movement ; the end of the holy month of Ramadan ; and an ever - nearing decision by the ICC on whether or not to prosecute make for an ugly combination .
" People who have been here a long time say this conflict is as bad now as it has ever been , " one UN official said .
" Things are going to worse before they get better . "
How to Get Your Sales Contracts Signed Faster by Your Clients
In the world of sales , closing the deal is the end goal .
The faster you close the deal , the quicker the pipeline moves and the less time your sales team must spend going back and forth with the prospects .
One of the biggest and most common time wasters in this process that slows down the deal is getting the sales contracts signed .
Virtually every salesperson is familiar with the following scenario :
You have covered all the product specs , and the prospect is in love .
They agree to sign on to be a customer , so you tell them all that ’s left is to sign a contract to cement the deal .
At this point , all you get is radio silence .
You will probably send several emails to follow up with the prospect , leave voicemails , and more , still to get no response .
This often goes on for weeks or longer until the prospect finally signs ( or backs out ) of the contract .
What you have to figure out is – what will help speed up getting the contract signed ?
If you are facing this quandary , keep reading .
Some tips to help are found here .
Use Electronic Documents
One of the easiest ways you can ensure your sales document is signed in a timely fashion is to stop using paper .
It is n’t the 90s anymore – the entire process of having to print out paper documents and then fax , scan , or email them back is dead .
Not only do very few people have fax machines , but the entire process is long and cumbersome .
A better option is to choose a tool that allows your sales prospects to add their e signature to the contract .
With this , there is no printing , faxing , or anything else involved .
By using digital documents , you can eliminate most of the problems that stop a sales contract from being signed right away .
Also , if the contract has to be reviewed by more than one person , you can include the approval process in the actual document workflow .
The last part of the benefit here is that all the signed contracts will be store online .
This means you no longer have to use old - school filing cabinets .
Create a Sense of Urgency
If your prospect has n’t made you a priority or if they are price shopping the contract against the competition , it ’s a good idea to light a fire under the by creating a sense of urgency – this is a smart move .
In some situations , salespeople will send contracts without a timeline or due dates .
They assume the prospect will sign it within a few days .
Unfortunately , this is n’t usually the case .
It ’s up to you to create a sense of urgency .
Some ways for you to do this include :
Ask
While this may sound simple , you ca n’t stress how important it is to get your contract signed quickly .
When you send it to the client , make sure to include a call to action or note , such as “ We are excited to have you on board .
The faster you sign the contract , the sooner we can get started . ”
Offer a Deal
It ’s also a good idea to offer some type of deal or add value if the person signs the contract within a certain period of time .
It may be additional users , an added feature , or a discount .
This is up to you .
Let the sales prospect know the price you are offering is only good for a specific amount of time – i.e. 7 to 10 days .
After that point , the contract will be void and there ’s no way to guarantee the same price .
Most people are more likely to take action if they are aware of a deadline .
If you are n’t pushing your prospects to take a certain action , they will sign the contract on their own time .
This may not be as fast as you would like it to be .
By creating a sense of urgency , you get your contracts signed faster .
Make Sure to Follow Up
Once you have sent the sales contracts , is the typical strategy to sit and wait to hear back ?
It ’s better to take a bit of initiative and follow - up with the prospect .
If you wait for someone to sign the contract , this is putting your pipeline and your revenue in their hands .
To get paid faster , follow - up .
This does n’t mean waiting for several weeks – follow up within a few days of the contract being sent .
If you have used electronic software , you may have a built - in feature that will send a reminder to the prospect about signing the contract .
Another option for following up with prospects that have n’t signed yet is to ask if there is anything else they need .
With this option , it reminds the prospect the contract still needs signing , and it gives them the chance to ask questions or clarify the information .

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , speaks during a news conference Tuesday .
Pelosi orders wide Wall Street probe
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has ordered a broad , swift investigation of Wall Street and will demand testimony from Bush administration officials and captains of finance , congressional officials said .
House Democrats plan to aggressively look at the administration ’s role in the meltdown over the weekend and to explore further regulation and government structures that would be taken up under the new president .

And the trouble could run even deeper than has been clear so far — and get more expensive for the U.S. government .
The Associated Press reports that the fund established to insure bank deposits is dwindling , with the taxpayer as the lender of last resort .
" The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , whose insurance fund has slipped below the minimum target level set by Congress , could be forced to tap tax dollars through a Treasury Department loan if Washington Mutual Inc. , the nation 's largest thrift , or another struggling rival fails , economists and industry analysts said , " The AP reported .
The hearings ordered by Pelosi will take place over the next few weeks , the officials said .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , who regularly appears on Capitol Hill , will be called to testify as part of the investigation .
As the main event , Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) , chairman of the House oversight committee , wrote to Richard Fuld , chief executive of the imploded Lehman Brothers , to ask him to appear on Capitol Hill on Sept. 25 .
“ The hearing will examine the regulatory mistakes and financial excesses that led to yesterday 's bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers , ” Waxman wrote .
“ The committee will also explore the impacts of the Lehman bankruptcy on financial markets and the United States economy . ”
Separately , Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass. ) , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , plans a forward - looking hearing with economists on Wednesday to “ begin a conversation about where we go with the capital markets , ” a House aide said .
Frank plans “ oversight of what happened this weekend with the Treasury and Federal Reserve , ” and will look at “ how bad the capital markets are , and what may be needed . ”
“ The markets are not self - correcting , ” the aide said .
“ If they continue to not self - correct over the next several months , is there a federal response ?
There might be more federal intervention that ’s needed .
We ’ll proceed cautiously , and that would be next year . "
Both chairmen are acting at the direction of Pelosi , who told them to figure out what happened and demonstrate that they are on top of the situation , the officials said .
Pelosi said Tuesday on MSNBC that she expects a “ restructuring ” of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac “ in the next Congress with a new president . ”
“ Are they quasi - governmental organizations , are they quasi - nongovernmental organizations ?
Should they just be share hold private institutions ? ” she said .
“ We have to examine that .
And I 've asked the chairmen — Chairman Frank and the Chairman Waxman , the chairman of our Oversight and Reform Committee , to take a look at both of those . ”
IMF Survey : IMF Head Urges Greater Regulation of Financial Sector
IMF head calls for global reform of financial system
Welcomes U.S. authorities ' plan to " put out the fire "
Urges systemic response to crisis affecting global economy
IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss - Kahn called for a global solution to the U.S. financial crisis , saying coordination of the reform effort " is a job for the IMF . " .
U.S. FINANCIAL CRISIS
Reform of the international financial system could begin when finance ministers and central bankers convene in Washington next month for the IMF - World Bank Annual Meetings .
In an interview with France 's Journal du Dimanche newspaper — one of several he has given to international media over the past few days — he said a proposed U.S. $ 700 billion bailout plan should be a first step toward reform of the global financial system , and called for greater regulation of financial institutions and markets .
" It 's because there were no regulations or controls , or not enough regulations or controls , that this situation was born , " he said .
" We must draw conclusions from what has happened — that is to say regulate , with great precision , financial institutions and markets . "
" This ( U.S. ) plan is welcome because it 's comprehensive .
But it has to be the first step of international political action , " said Strauss - Kahn , a former French finance minister who took over as head of the Fund in November last year
IMF - World Bank Annual Meetings
He said the IMF would be happy to coordinate the global reform process , which could begin next month when finance ministers and central bankers convene in Washington for the annual IMF / World Bank meetings on October 11 - 13 .
Without the will to reform , there was a danger that the state would be seen as running to the " rescue of incompetent managers and greedy speculators " , he said , noting the criticism in parts of Europe about banking profits being privatized but their losses being nationalized .
Defending the IMF 's role in the crisis , Strauss - Kahn said the Fund had estimated in April that there would be $ 1 trillion in financial sector losses and had predicted a sharp slowdown in the global economy .
" But people did not want to listen to us .
We were criticized for being pessimistic , " he said .
The IMF has recently raised this estimate to $ 1.3 trillion .
Proposed multilateral consultation
The interview with the French weekly was one of a series of media interviews on the financial crisis over the past few days .
Speaking to the New York Times , Strauss - Kahn called for a multilateral consultation — involving the United States , Europe , China , and other financial powers — to develop a coordinated response to the crisis .
" We 're facing a systemic crisis , and it needs a systemic response , " Strauss - Kahn told the paper last week .
" The IMF is the right place to organize a global response to weaknesses in the global financial system . "
His remarks built upon his call in an op -ed in the Financial Times for a systemic solution to the crisis .
Understandable U.S. response
In other remarks , Strauss - Kahn spoke about the speed and effectiveness of the U.S. response to the crisis to the Singapore Straits Times :
" It 's absolutely understandable that the government in any country , when the first wave hits , says that it 's a small wave and we 'll manage .
And then comes a bigger wave and they say we 'll fix it .
And then when the tsunami comes , it 's too late .
So I understand the way the American authorities wanted to address this step by step .
" Of course it 's easier to say now that the Americans should have chosen a more comprehensive plan earlier .
The IMF did , in June , propose to the U.S. a more comprehensive plan .
It is in the report we made on the American economy under the Article IV consultations .
We said things are going that badly that you should organize a comprehensive solution — like they are talking about today .
And that was only three months ago . "
On the difference with the Asian crisis
" What originated in Thailand and spread to Korea , Indonesia , and other countries was mainly a balance of payments problem .
That was our core business .
This crisis , even if it is a huge crisis , is different .
It has had almost no impact on the exchange rate , on the dollar .
You could have expected the dollar to fall but it did not .
This is a different kind of crisis , so the solution to be applied is not the same .
The main actors today are the central banks and treasuries ; the main actors in the Asian crisis were institutions like the IMF . "
Speaking to the Brazilian news magazine Veja , he spoke about the likely impact of the crisis on the financial sector :
" It will look very different .
For the first time , the crisis did not originate at the periphery , but at the center of the system .
This crisis has originated in the U.S. housing market , but it has deeper roots .
The expansion in the financial market has far surpassed the growth in the real economy in the last decades , with a complexity never seen before , while banking supervision and regulation have not been prepared for such a challenge .
" Most investment banks lowered their risk analysis criteria to increase their profits , without proper oversight .
Therefore , one of the probable outcomes of this crisis will be to have a smaller financial system , more compatible with the real economy and in a more controlled and regulated environment . "
On the dollar
" The curious thing is that , even with the US economy today facing many different blows at the same time , there is no panic with regards to the dollar , which would have been expected .
On the contrary .
The dollar 's status has remained intact . "
Finally , in remarks to the Straits Times , Strauss - Kahn looked at the impact on the real economy .
" One of the effects on the real economy has been a sharp slowdown .
Nevertheless it is only a slowdown , not a recession .
Two or three years ago , if you had asked the experts , ` We will have a trillion dollars of distressed assets in the financial sector — what will be the consequences on the world economy ? ' , many would probably have said there would be a huge recession .
But we do n't contemplate that ; we contemplate a slowdown .
" The linkages between the financial sector and the real economy are not as easy to understand .
The IMF is in a unique place to try to take into account this connection , and that is probably the reason why our forecast is more accurate .
More resilient economy
" We see recovery in 2009 .
The economy is more resilient than expected .
Our forecast is that commodities will stabilize in 2009 : oil and food prices will not be as high as their peaks in past months .
We see the U.S. housing market finding a bottom in the coming months .
" So we have good reason to expect that growth will come back .
There are some downside risks , of course , from the financial sector and the ( lack of ) confidence in the corporate and housing sector .
That 's why it was important to propose a comprehensive solution which appears reliable to people .
When you are sorting the problems one after another , you do n't give the impression you are managing the whole problem .
I hope the plan now being proposed in the U.S. will restore investor confidence next year . "

Micrometeoroid Shield Test - Preliminary Photos
These snapshots were taken during testing at Rice University on October 7 - 8 , 2002
Hypervelocity test gun .
The gun uses hydrogen , compressed by a piston driven by a shotgun shell , to accelerate small particles to a velocity of 7 km/s .
The particle enters the evacuated target chamber through the hole just visible at the corner of the target ( upper left ) .
The target is the micrometeoroid shield , with a plastic scintillator and phototube behind it to simulate the orbital condition .
Close - up of damage to the shield caused by a 2.2 mm aluminum ball .
The layers have been folded back to show the interface between the outer layers ( ceramic fabric separated by foam ) and the backing layers ( Kevlar ) .
In the distance of 20 mm from the point of impact , the shield has dispersed the energy of the projectile into an area approximately 30 mm in diameter .
The Kevlar stopped the debris ( in this case ) .
Close - up of damage to the scintillator wrapping caused by debris penetrating the shield ( a thinner shield than in the photo to the left ) .
The hole is 8 mm in diameter , smaller than the hole within the shield , but large enough to alow light to reach the scintillator .
If this happens in orbit , the ACD tile will be disabled .
Near this time every year , I am reminded of this story .
And it demonstrates why insurance regulators and policy makers who are currently analyzing regulations on life settlements and “ stranger owned life insurance ” should consider the impact of human nature on those insurance transactions .
Insurance products are frequently abused by profiteers and life insurance policies pose a significant risk in the hands of the unscrupulous .
There is no better example of this abuse than Ronald Clark O’Bryan .
Ronald Clark O’Bryan had serious personal financial problems .
He earned $ 150 per week , was eight months behind on his car payments and had total debts up to $ 100,000 .
In January of 1974 , over his wife ’s objection , he took out $ 10,000 life insurance policies on both of his two children .
Later that year , over the objection of his life insurance agent , he bought additional $ 20,000 life insurance policies on his son and daughter .
By mid-October , both of his children were covered by several life insurance policies but O’Bryan had virtually no coverage on himself .
It was also at this time that O’Bryan told a creditor that he expected to receive a large sum of money before the end of the year and extended his debt obligations into 1975 .
In August of 1974 , O’Bryan , who worked as an optometrist , asked his manager for cyanide to clean gold glass frames — an unusual request considering that cyanide had not been used in the industry for over twenty years .
He also talked about the commercial uses of cyanide with his co-workers , as well as what dosages of the chemical would be deadly .
After his request for the cyanide was denied , O’Bryan asked a friend ( and employee of Arco Chemical Company ) where he could buy cyanide and , “ out of curiosity , ” what doses would be fatal to humans .
He finally asked how one could detect the presence of chemicals in a dead body .
Two weeks before Halloween , O’Bryan bought costumes for his children and appeared excited about taking them “ trick or treating ” even though he had never been excited about it before .
A week later , he invited a friend ’s family to dinner on Halloween night and suggested that the children from both families “ trick or treat ” together .
On Halloween , the families met for dinner as planned and then went “ trick or treating . ”
The group approached a house , only to find no one home .
The children ran to the next home , but O’Bryan remained behind in the darkness for about thirty seconds .
He quickly caught up with the group holding “ giant pixy styx ” and exclaimed that the " rich neighbors " were handing out expensive candy .
When they returned home , O’Bryan ’s son Timothy asked for one of the pixy styx .
He took two gulps of the powder , complained that it tasted bad and began vomiting .
He went into convulsions and was taken to the hospital where he died within an hour .
Fluids taken from his stomach contained 16 milligrams of cyanide .
The level of cyanide in his blood was .4 milligrams .
A fatal human dose of cyanide is a blood level between .2 and .3 milligrams .
On November 1st , O’Bryan met with the funeral director and learned that a separate death certificate was required to make a claim under each policy on Timothy ’s life .
He ordered six death certificates .
He also described how he intended to use the insurance policy benefits and said the did n't see how the police could “ pin ” the death on anyone .
O’Bryan was mistaken .
The police did , in fact , pin Timothy ’s death on him .
O’Bryan was tried , convicted , and sentenced to death .
He was executed by lethal injection on March 31 , 1984 .
The story of Ronald Clark O’Bryan is horrific .
It is almost impossible to comprehend how a person could murder his or her own child for life insurance proceeds .
But examples of life insurance abuse , often equally horrific , are legion .
And such examples speak volumes about how basic human nature , when presented with profiteering opportunities through life insurance , can produce unimaginable results .
My goodness , there ’s certainly a lot of REST talk these days .
I ’m partly responsible ; Paul Krill and I had a long talk at OSCON and he chose to pull out my dissing WS -* for his title :
Sun technologist : SOAP stack a ‘ failure ’ .
This led to an incredibly long discussion thread on Yahoo Groups ’ ( irritatingly - named ) “ service - orientated - architecture ” forum .
Damien Katz was another provocateur , firing off REST , I just do n't get it and “ The web is built on REST .
Therefore REST is good ” Bullshit .
This provoked Dare Obsanjo to a burst of restrained pedagogy in Explaining REST to Damien Katz .
Let me stir this pot with a few questions , some vaguely heretical in flavor .
Has REST Been Fortunate in its Enemies ?
· I have been among the most vocal of those sneering at WS -* , and I ’m comfortable with what I ’ve said .
But that does n’t prove that the core WS -* ideas are wrong .
Here are some of the handicaps WS -* struggled under :
Lousy foundational technologies ( XSD and WSDL ) .
A Microsoft / IBM - driven process that was cripplingly product - linked and political .
Designers undereducated in the realities of the Web as it is .
Unnecessary detours into Architecture Astronautics .
As a result , we should be really careful about drawing lessons from the failure of WS -*.
Specifically :
Just because the XSD type system is malformed , you ca n’t conclude that the notion of schema - driven mapping between program data types and representation payloads is harmful .
Just because WSDL is a crock , you ca n’t conclude that exposing a machine - readable contract for a service is a necessarily bad idea .
Just because UDDI never took off , you ca n’t conclude that service registries are dumb .
Just because SOAP has a damaging MustUnderstand facility and grew a lot of ancillary specification hair , you ca n’t conclude that some sort of re-usable payload wrapper is necessarily a dead - end path .
Just because the WS -* security specifications are overengineered and based on a shaky canonicalization spec , you ca n’t conclude that message - level security and signing are n’t sometimes real important .
And so on .
I personally tend to think that schema - driven mapping is hopeless , contracts are interesting , registries are a fantasy , and payload wrappers are very promising .
But I do n’t think that the history of WS -* is a very good argument for any of those positions .
Is Getting HTTP Right Good Enough ?
· REST , say its aficionados , is more than just HTTP .
And that ’s true in theory .
But in practice , there are a whole lot of benefits to just getting HTTP right .
Suppose just hypothetically that your app violated a bunch of REST precepts , say by making heavy use of cookies and never embedding hyperlinks in what it sent .
But suppose also that it was a really good HTTP citizen ; getting the caching right , not misusing POST , and taking advantage of idempotency where possible .
Well , you know , it might be a pretty good app , and scale startlingly well .
The reason that this scenario feels a little strained is that who ’ve come to understand HTTP have usually picked up some of the rest of the REST canon along the way , and put it to use .
That granted , I think the benefits from getting HTTP right are really really big ; enough that they ’re worth pursuing even if you do n’t care to join any four - letter religions .
And if you ’re trying to explain to management why you ’re working on sweating the HTTP details , just tell ’em you ’re doing REST and you ’ve got buzzword cover .
What Does “ Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State ” Mean , Really ?
· I ’ll be honest : I ’m not sure .
On the other hand , one of the great advantages of being resource - centric , as in giving everything you care about a URI , is that whatever kind of messages you ’re shipping around the network , URIs are easy to pack into them .
And experience to date suggests that doing this leads to good results .
Is Statelessness Required ? ·
It ’s really easy to understand why , in an ideal - world network application , if none of the client implementations contain state , the scalability payoff can be huge .
In the perfect REST world , state lives in resources , resource identifiers , and the representations you pump around the net .
Well , yeah , but in this world , that ’s hard .
For example , one of the places state should n’t live is in cookies jammed down clients ’ throats .
It says so right here in Roy ’s thesis .
But damn , they ’re useful .
My intuition is that the architectural flaws are small enough , and the convenience - function benefits large enough , that they ’re with us for the long haul .
And I think there ’s a lesson here : that statelessness , like many other good things ( Buddha - nature , purely descriptive markup ) is an Aristotelian virtue ; unattainable in an absolute sense , but rewarded to the extent you can practice it .
Is Being Message - Centric Good Enough ?
· The Web is attractive and thought - provoking because it succeeded in scaling to meet the needs of a global heterogeneous network where many had failed before , most notably CORBA and DCOM .
The most obvious differentiator is that those other network programming frameworks tried to extend the notions of API and Object Model across the network .
The Web does n’t do APIs or Object Models ; it ’s just a set of protocols , agreements regarding the exchange of short series of messages , and what has to be in those messages .
My single most deeply - held conviction about network computing is that attempts to abstract away the underlying message traffic are in the long run doomed .
So hmmm , maybe is it not only good enough to do HTTP right , maybe all you need is to face up to the fact that it ’s all about message interchange , and proceed from there ( of course , you ’ll probably end up inventing something essentially like HTTP ) .
Are PUT and DELETE Essential ?
· During the design of AtomPub , a few people , including me , worried out loud about the use of PUT and DELETE in the protocol , simply because those functions are n’t supported in browsers , hence also not in servers , and are not available at all to programmers on the dumber class of mobile devices .
We were shouted down by the purists , who said that PUT and DELETE are essential features of the architecture .
And they had good arguments , especially around idempotency and ETags for safe concurrent update .
But you know , unlike most other REST conversations , those are arguments from theory not practice .
I ’m pretty convinced that AtomPub would work about as well if you overloaded the U and D in CRUD on POST , carefully and respectfully .
Having said that , I ’m beginning to believe that the theoretical benefits of PUT will work out pretty well in practice , and I ’m glad that AtomPub now gives PUT something useful to do .
Is “ Do Like the Web ” a Good Argument ?
· A common argument from REST proponents is “ The Web works pretty well , so should n’t you be taking Web Architecture seriously as you go about your engineering ? ”
For a recent example , see my comment on Damien Katz ’s piece linked above .
While Damien is unconvinced , I think it ’s actually a pretty good argument .
I ’ve never talked to Roy about this , but my perception is that REST was reverse - engineered from his understanding of what makes the Web work , based on having been there when some of the most important pieces were being built .
And judging by my experience of getting Web stuff to work , Roy ’s understanding is pretty much on the mark .
Anyhow , all the other strong REST arguments are theoretical .
There ’s a lot to like , on engineering - aesthetics grounds , about decentralized flat identifier namespaces , about the notion of Resource and Representation , about statelessness , about hypermedia , and so on .
But all my favorite engineers are most impressed by arguments from practice not theory : “ See , like that . ”
Where Are the Tools ?
· I ’m on record as thinking there ’s not much out there .
Let me be specific on what I mean by tooling : facilities for use by programmers that do away with redundancies and irritants and boilerplate ; that let you do things faster and better .
Once you get past ActiveResource , Restlet , and Jersey , I ’m not aware of much ( but I bet there ’ll be some shout - outs in the comments ) .
Seems like an opportunity to me because , you know , REST really actually truly works , as religions go it ’s a very practical one .

A Solar Prominence Unfurls
Credit : STEREO Project , NASA
Explanation : On September 29 , this magnificent eruptive solar prominence lifted away from the Sun 's surface , unfurling into space over the course of several hours .
Suspended in twisted magnetic fields , the hot plasma structure is many times the size of planet Earth and was captured in this view by the Sun- watching STEREO ( Ahead ) spacecraft .
The image was recorded in extreme ultraviolet light emitted by ionized Helium , an element originally identified in the solar spectrum .
Seen against the brilliant solar surface in visible light , such prominences appear as dark filaments because they are relatively cool .
But they are bright themselves when viewed against the blackness of space , arcing above the Sun 's edge .
A video of the eruption ( a 2.6MB .mov file ) is available here .
It 's a good question , and David Brooks offers a perceptive psychological explanation today .
Obama , Brooks argues , is a peripatetic , picaresque character , migrating from one place to another and from one institution to another without ever fully belonging to any .
This disconcerts those voters who like their leaders rooted .
And maybe David 's onto something .
As a geographically transplanted founding member of the post - boomer meritocratic elite , I 'm not the most objective observer here .
There may also be residual race - consciousness at work or simply guardedness about Obama 's relative Washington inexperience .
But I 'd add two more factors to the mix .
The first is Iraq .
The swift decline in violence and chaos there has changed the debate from purely how to get out as swiftly as possible and cut our losses ( or sustain a grueling endless conflict ) to what are the costs and benefits of staying longer or leaving sooner , and the tactics of each option .
Obama 's candidacy soared in response to a foreign policy catastrophe all his serious opponents supported at the start .
The catastrophe endures , of course , and the financial costs of continued enmeshment grow all the time .
But the sharp decline in deaths of Americans has done what McCain needed : it has given the neo-imperial project a new lease on life .
We are now told , for example , by three of the proponents of the war that we cannot even begin major drawdowns until 2010 .
And if chaos or unrest continue or increase by then , well , we 'll have to wait some more , wo n't we ?
If the criterion for departure is a peaceful , unified Iraq , we could be there as long as the British once were .
McCain 's previous position was to hang in while Iraq continued to burn .
His new position is to hang in and somehow turn a strategic blunder into a strategic success ( even if no sane person , knowing what we know now , would have begun this thing in the first place ) .
This is a much , much better place for McCain to be than he was just five months ago .

House Republican Whip Roy Blunt ( R - MO ) was just interviewed by Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC , and he told Mitchell that McCain killed the deal yesterday at the White House :
“ I do think that John McCain was very helpful in what he did .
I saw him this morning , we ’ve been talking with his staff .
Clearly , yesterday , his position in that discussion yesterday was one that stopped a deal from , uh , finalizing that no House Republican , in my view , would ’ve been for .
Which means it probably would n’t have passed the House .
Now , Democrats are in the majority , they can pass anything they want to without a single Republican vote .
But they do n’t seem to be willing to do that .
I ’m pleased we can have negotiations now that get us back to things that we think can protect the taxpayers better , create more options , are , frankly , be better understood in the country than the plan , than the path that we were on just a couple of days ago . ”
McCain was “ helpful , ” Blunt says , because McCain killed the deal – he did n’t help get a deal , he helped kill it .
That is n’t a maverick bringing everyone together , it ’s an erratic , confused bull in a China shop doing what his trigger - happy gut tells him ( if I may mix my metaphors ) .
When the choice is between making war brokering peace , John McCain always goes for war .
It ’s what hot - heads do .
Especially when they ’re no longer at their prime .
Now and then , Fox News makes a stab at living up to its “ fair and balanced ” tag line .
At other times , the cable network ’s operatives throw off all pretense , let their neatly trimmed hair down and do what they seem to love best -- blame all of the world ’s evils on those pointy - headed , America - hating liberals .
Like , say , Barack Obama !
Fox host Sean Hannity and his producers served up a heaping portion of just such red meat Sunday night on “ Hannity ’s America . ”
And they ’ve since been making lame defenses of the faux documentary , which bore the subtle title : “ Obama and Friends : The History of Radicalism . ”
Fox ’s hourlong screed is just the kind of media coverage that has contributed to the increasingly angry and irrational tone on the campaign trail .
Even by the low standards of this election ’s advocacy journalism , the program plumbed new depths -- relying on innuendo and guilt by association to paint the Illinois senator as a dupe of the shadowy forces of the left .

Much of Hannity ’s report was based on interviews with half a dozen partisan commentators , whose main qualification seems to have been a previously expressed disdain for Obama .
Near the top of the program , the host introduced one of them , Andy Martin , as an “ author and journalist . ”
But reporters in his Chicago hometown know Martin better as a perennial political candidate and serial litigant .
The Chicago Tribune has spent some time examining Martin ’s past .
He was refused entry to the Illinois bar in the 1970s , in part because his Selective Service records showed his thoughts exhibited “ a paranoid flavor and a grandiose character . ”
In a 1983 personal bankruptcy case , he referred to a judge as a “ crooked , slimy Jew . ”
And a federal judge noted his history of “ vexatious , frivolous and scandalous ” lawsuits .

When he ran for Illinois governor two years ago , Martin quoted a nearly 30 - year - old Tribune editorial that called him “ an absolutely brilliant campaigner ” when he was running for a Senate seat .
He did n’t mention that the same editorial said he “ has no more business in the U.S. Senate than an elk has in a phone booth . ”
The producer of the Hannity program declined to be interviewed , so it ’s impossible to determine whether Fox did n’t know about Martin ’s history or just did n’t care .
Perhaps the producers relied on the gadfly ’s own website , which assures us he is “ a legendary Chicago muckraker , author , Internet columnist , radio talk - show host , broadcaster and media critic . ”
And expert in all things Barack Obama .
So when Hannity wanted to know what Obama did as a young community organizer , Martin was ready with a pithy answer : “ I think a community organizer , in Barack Obama ’s case , was somebody that was in training for a radical overthrow of the government . ”

Martin offered no evidence .
None .
But , when I called him , he helped me understand why this was not a problem .
“ I do involve with the facts , ” he began , “ but when the facts are n’t all there , and the perpetrator has concealed all the facts and is basically refusing to testify , you are allowed to draw an adverse inference . ”
It sounds to me as if he ’s saying :
When you ca n’t prove something , you ’re allowed to make stuff up .
And does that also mean you might as well assume the worst ?
I asked .
“ The proof of the pudding , ” Martin responded , “ is that they are on the verge of taking over the government . ”

So , if Obama is elected , that would constitute a “ radical overthrow ” ?
Well , Martin conceded , “ maybe I should have changed my words around to say there would be a change of the government that would put a radical in charge . ”
During the program , Martin floated other wild theories , including one based on Obama ’s association with 1960s radical William Ayres .
He noted that Ayres had spoken fondly of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , who , in turn , “ learned from Fidel Castro of the Cuban revolution . ”

That led Martin to share this conclusion with Fox viewers : “ If you love the Cuban revolution and Castro , and if you love what ’s happening in Venezuela with Hugo Chavez , you ’ll love Barry Obama -- Barack Obama , as he calls himself -- in the White House . ”
Helpful .
Now I ’m starting to get it .
Take opinions and present them as facts .
Stitch them into patterns .
Then pretend to your viewers -- as many as 2 million typically watch Hannity ’s Sunday show -- that those patterns reveal the truth .
But that was merely mortar for the program ’s building blocks : Obama ’s relationships .
And if Obama knew them -- Ayres , the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. , Palestinian scholar Rashid Khalidi -- it ’s pretty obvious ( darn right ! ) he must subscribe to their most controversial ideas .
I take Hannity at his word -- when confronted on - air this week by Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs over Martin ’s past comments -- that he and his Fox colleagues do not condone anti-Semitism .
Martin has denied he ever made anti-Semitic remarks .

The Fox host seemed to excuse the lack of balance by arguing that he had interviewed liberals , such as Malik Shabazz and Al Sharpton , on other programs .
How that even remotely exonerates the Obama program , which made no pretense of presenting even a single defense of the Democrat , is beyond me .
Of course , there was no time in the Hannity hour to , for instance , interview the conservatives who helped elect Obama president of the Harvard Law Review .
Hannity was too busy probing deep into Obamaworld ’s shadowy corridors , like the one that leads to Saul Alinsky , the founder of community organizing .

No one denies that the young Obama , like thousands of others before and since , was inspired by Alinsky , who preached that society ’s have - nots should expand their power by working aggressively within the government .
As a young reporter here in Los Angeles , I learned firsthand the impact of such teachings , when Alinsky - inspired community organizations first shook the halls of power .
What did they do ?
They lowered auto insurance premiums on the Eastside .
They drove liquor stores out of South Central .
They organized an anti-gang program .
Hannity and his confederates ought to take a close look at that last one .
It had the backing of another wild - eyed fanatic -- Richard Riordan , the city ’s Republican mayor .

News Firms Fight for Exit Polling Rights
In the US , six national news companies have filed a lawsuit against a state of Minnesota law which they say will prevent them from conducting accurate exit polls .
The statute , entitled ' Lingering near polling place ' and passed by the Minnesota Legislature in April , prevents anyone who is not voting from getting close to polling stations - within 100 feet of the building 's exit .
The plaintiffs - ABC , The Associated Press , CNN , CBS , Fox News and NBC - say the statute inhibits their rights under the First Amendment .
Its wording singles out journalists , banning them from approaching within six feet of a voter , or otherwise ' interfering with the voting process . '
The groups say the law should distinguish between disruptive and non-disruptive activity , and that exit - polling is important in providing ' accurate data about voter behavior because of the near certainty that the persons interviewed have actually voted ' .
They explain : ' This reporting will be valuable not only for our present understanding of this historic election ; it will also inform the analysis of historians , social scientists , and others who will study the results for years to come . '
Attorney Susan Buckley outlines the problem : ' the farther you get away from the polling place , the harder it is to contact voters ' - voters are more likely to leave the area or blend in with other people who did not vote , spelling the end of exit polling ' with any kind of accuracy and reliability ' .
Buckley says no other state has such a broad restriction , and points out that courts in ten states have recently challenged the constitutionality of such restrictions and unanimously decided that they violate the First Amendment .
The law and others like it follow work by the Congressional Research Service after the 2000 presidential election , in which various media projected that Al Gore had won Florida before the polls had actually closed .
The study concluded that Congress could not constitutionally prohibit exit polling , but could perhaps include it in a ban on ' voter solicitation within a certain distance from a polling place ' .
Supporters of the law say it is necessary to ensure voters ' rights , and that the 100 - foot radius is easier for judges to interpret where it applies to the exit and not to a specific room within a building .
Secretary of State Mark Ritchie and Attorney General Lori Swanson are names as defendants in the case , which gets a preliminary hearing next Thursday .
GAINESVILLE , Fla . --
A bit of serendipity has given astronomers a surprise view of a never - before - observed event in the birth of a galaxy .
University of Florida and University of California - Santa Cruz astronomers are the first to discover the onset of a huge flow of gas from a quasar , or the super - bright core of an extremely remote young galaxy still being formed .
The gas was expelled from the quasar and its enormous black hole sometime in the space of four years around 10 billion years ago - an extremely brief and ancient blip noticed only by a sharp - eyed undergraduate and the unlikely convergence of two separate observational efforts .
" It was completely serendipitous , " said Fred Hamann , a UF astronomy professor .
" In fact , the only way it could have happened is through serendipity . "
A paper about the research appeared online this month in the Letters of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
Quasars are enormously bright cores of very distant galaxies thought to contain " super- massive " black holes a billion times larger than our sun .
They are seen only in the centers of very distant galaxies that formed long ago -- galaxies whose light is just now reaching Earth after billions of years in transit .
The quasar in question occurred about 10.3 billion years ago .
The black holes within quasars are invisible , but the cosmic material cascading toward them builds up and forms hot " accretion " disks , the source of quasars ' intense light .
Some of the incoming material also can be expelled from quasars to form enormous gas clouds that zoom out at extremely high speeds .
With the quasar in question , the gas is flowing at an astonishing rate of 58 million mph , Hamann said .
But while astronomers had observed the presence of such gas clouds with other quasars , they had never witnessed one actually coming into being -- until now .
Hamann said the discovery was initiated when Kyle Kaplan , an undergraduate at UC - Santa Cruz , earlier this spring noticed peculiarities in the spectra , or wavelengths of light , that had been observed and recorded from the quasar .
The spectra were gathered in 2006 as part of an effort to study the galaxies between the quasar and Earth .
UC - Santa Cruz Professor Jason Prochaska was aware of Hamann 's work on quasars and asked him to take a look .
When Hamann and other astronomers checked the spectra against the spectra of the same region recorded in a separate sky survey in 2002 , they were surprised to discover that there were zero indications of the gas cloud .
" So that 's how we know this appeared between 2002 and 2006 , " he said .
Daniel Progra , a physics professor at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas and an expert on gas outflows from astronomical objects , indicated the discovery is a lucky one .
" I am most excited about this work , " he said .
" We humans cannot directly monitor changes in quasars as they take very many years .
Therefore , a discovery of a change over a few years is very interesting .
It is not unexpected , but chances are very small . "
He said the discovery supports a computer model he developed that predicts the gas outflows are dynamic and complicated .
Hamann said the discovery also opens a window to understanding more about how quasars come into being .
" The fact that we saw one appear in so short a time frame means that it's a volatile type of structure , " he said .
" It could be an evolutionary phase , or maybe a transition stage from one phase to another . "
It also poses interesting questions about the role of quasars in the formation of galaxies .
Astronomers hope future observations will prove telling , Hamann said .
" One interesting question in astronomy is ' how does the evolution of quasars relate to the evolution of galaxies ? , ' " he said .
" The matter ejected from quasars might be the key to this relationship because it can disrupt or regulate the formation of galaxies around quasars .
This discovery is a small piece of that story that we can see happening in real time , and what we are going to do now is keep watching . "

Other astronomers and authors of the paper are Paola Rodriquez Hidalgo , a UF graduate student , and Stephane Herbert - Fort , a University of Arizona graduate student .
So far , only Honda offers a CNG vehicle in the US .
It 's Civic GX which has been the greenest car in the country practically since it was introduced in 1997 .
( A $ 25,000 price tag is trimmed by a $ 4,000 federal tax incentive . )
It may also be one of the cheapest cars to operate .
With a home fueling unit , the Civic GX can be filled up at $ 1- 1.50 per gallon equivalent , according to John German , American Honda ’s environment and energy analysis manager .
Little wonder the stock of CNG - compatible cars is growing worldwide .
Currently just one percent of the global vehicle stock , they make up 24 percent of vehicles in Argentina .
Natural Gas Prized by Power Sector
But this new demand from the transportation sector , overlaps — and possibly conflicts — with its growing popularity for electricity generation .
Roughly one - third of US gas consumption goes to generate power and that is projected to keep growing .
( Gas produced one per cent of New England ’s power in 1980 ; now it supplies more than 40 percent . )
That ’s driving growing imports of liquidified natural gas ( LNG ) , currently just three percent of total gas use ( the rest is from North America ) but soon expected to rise to 20 percent .
That ’s why boosting domestic gas production is critical , argues McClendon , especially fast growing unconventional sources , which has soared 65 percent in the last decade .
Tapping these sources comes from new technologies , including improved horizontal drilling .
( One example : gas is now being sucked from underneath Dallas - Fort Worth ’s airport and “ the drilling rigs .... are headed toward downtown , " says the Department of Energy . )
John Felmy , chief economist of the American Petroleum Institute , says the Chesapeake study usefully highlights the importance of opening up more roughly 80 percent of US territory – both on and off - shore – that is closed to exploration .
But McClendon acknowledges current gang - buster unconventional gas production , should keep supply growing five percent a year for the next decade - even without opening up more public land .
Crowding Out Gas-Dependent Industry
McClendon says the US could convert 10 percent of our vehicle fleet to CNG within eight years , and only increase overall natural gas consumption by one percent .
Dow Chemicals ’
Wells is not so sure about that , and he questions the even more fundamental assumption that gas will always be cheaper than oil .
He notes they were at rough parity between January 2003 and December 2005 and that gas prices were far more volatile than oil .
Increased demand will also ratchet up gas prices for both residential and business users , particularly harming industries dependent on gas for energy and feedstocks , such as chemicals and plastics , he says .
Rising prices are already taking a toll on US - based business .
Foreign - sourced natural gas is far cheaper than US - produced gas - even LNG imports are two times cheaper $ 4-4.50 vs average US price of $ 10 ) - putting US industry at a significant disadvantage , noted Wells .
The spike in gas prices since 2001 has forced many US companies with “ global market share ambitions ” to relocate overseas , a trend he said would only accelerate with Pickens ( and Chesapeake ’s ) plan , according to Wells .
“ We want to invest in the US , but there must be an appropriate value proposition , ” he said , noting Dow ’s 2002 US sales outstripped those Germany ( its second largest market ) , by more than six to one .
Today more than two - thirds of Dow ’s total sales are generated outside the U.S .
Alright , I ’ve got another conspiracy theory misconception to dispel .

After reading through the Chrome Terms of Service , some people are worried that Google is trying to assert rights on everything that you do on Chrome .
From one example story by Marshall Kirkpatrick :
The terms include a section giving Google “ a perpetual , irrevocable , worldwide , royalty - free , and non-exclusive license to reproduce , adapt , modify , translate , publish , publicly perform , publicly display and distribute any Content which you submit , post or display on or through , the Services . ”
That seems pretty extreme for a browser , does n’t it ?
I knew that Google did n’t want to assert rights on what people did using Google Chrome , so I asked the Chrome team and Google lawyers for their reaction or to clarify ( probably several other people pinged them too ) .
Here ’s what I heard back from Rebecca Ward , the Senior Product Counsel for Google Chrome :
“ In order to keep things simple for our users , we try to use the same set of legal terms ( our Universal Terms of Service ) for many of our products .
Sometimes , as in the case of Google Chrome , this means that the legal terms for a specific product may include terms that do n’t apply well to the use of that product .
We are working quickly to remove language from Section 11 of the current Google Chrome terms of service .
This change will apply retroactively to all users who have downloaded Google Chrome . ”
I hope that addresses the concerns that I ’ve seen on a few places around the web .
I appreciate that people pored through the Chrome license to find anything that looked unclear and then raised concerns so that Google could respond .
Update : I did this post quickly because I had to go to a meeting .
Coming back to read what I wrote , I think I was too strident ( both here and commenting a few places around the web ) and I apologize for that .
As a long - time Googler , I knew that Google would n’t want rights to everything that somebody did in Chrome .
It also seemed like there had been incidents like this in the past and they always got cleared up quickly .
But it was clearly a mistake on Google ’s part to include that language when it should n’t have been there , and I should have been grateful to the people that pointed it out .
Instead of getting snippy with people , my reaction should have been more along the lines of “ Oh crap , I do n’t think that ’s intentional .
Thank you so much for noticing that and pointing it out .
I ’ll see if we can get an official clarification or reaction as soon as possible . ”
I apologize for that , and I appreciate the people who push Google to be better .
Update , September 3rd 2008 : Earlier today , Google changed section 11 of the EULA to read as follows :
11 . Content license from you 11.1
You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in Content which you submit , post or display on or through , the Services .
I think that text is much better .
Update , September 4th 2008 : Google provides a full explanation of how this happened and how they ’ve corrected the Google Chrome End User License Agreement ( EULA ) .
One of the first things Eric Mattessich discovered in engineering school was that the typical internal combustion engine blows about 70 percent of the energy it creates straight out of the tailpipe in the form of heat .
So , he wondered , could he adapt the kind of heat - recapturing mechanisms used to make powerplants more efficient to work on hybrid cars ?
" The technology has been around since the 1900s , " he points out .
" It 's just that no one has put it into such a small package before . "

SOME EUPHEMISMS TO WATCH OUT FOR DURING ELECTIONS AND WAR HOGAN
The first casualty of war , it 's been said , is the truth .
The same goes , you could say , for elections .
Here are some brief examples of war and elect ... more ...
Received via email , so I do n’t know where it originated ( and Google was no help either ) .
George W. Bush , Vladimir Putin , and Steve Ballmer were called in by God .
God informed them that he was very unhappy about what was going on in this world .
Since things were so bad , he told the three that he was destroying the Earth in three days .
They were all allowed to return to their homes and businesses , and tell their friends and colleagues what was happening .
God did tell them though , that no matter what they did he was “ not ” changing his mind .
So , W. went in and told his staff , “ I have good news and bad news for you .
First the good news . . . there is a God .
The bad news is that he is destroying the Earth in 3 days . ”
Putin went back and told his staff , “ I have bad news and more bad news .
The first was . . . there is a God .
The second was that he is destroying the Earth in 3 days . ”
Steve Ballmer went back and told his staff , “ I have good news and good news .
First . . .
God thinks I am one of the three most important people in the world .
Second . . . you do n’t have to fix Windows Vista . ”
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A federal judge Thursday rejected a motion by defense attorneys asking him to either to declare a mistrial in the criminal case against Sen .
Ted Stevens or dismiss the indictment against him .
Instead , Judge Emmet Sullivan ruled Stevens ' trial will continue Monday .
Defense attorneys had claimed prosecutors belatedly turned over information that might be helpful to Stevens ' case .
Sullivan said the information can be used by Stevens ' attorneys as the trial proceeds .
Government prosecutors in the corruption trial had waited until Wednesday night to give the defense the documents , drawing a stern rebuke from Sullivan .
Stevens , the Senate 's longest serving Republican , has pleaded not guilty to a seven - count indictment for filing false statements on mandatory financial disclosure forms .
Prosecutors say the annual forms should have included hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts from Bill Allen , founder of the Veco Corp. -- an oil field contractor and at that time Alaska 's biggest employer .
Although the company was not known for residential construction , former employees have testified Allen and top aides directly asked them to work on Stevens ' home in Girdwood , a ski town outside Anchorage , Alaska .
Allen himself is the government 's star witness , and has been on the stand since Tuesday .
But Stevens ' defense attorneys said prosecutors waited till Wednesday night to turn over crucial FBI notes on Allen .
Those indicate that Allen believed that , had Stevens received invoices from the foreman or others for the Veco work , Stevens would have paid them .
Allen has testified he did not bill Stevens for some of the work .
The notes from the investigator indicate Allen did not fully bill for Veco 's work because he felt the costs were higher than they need to be , and " partly because he did not want the defendant to have to pay . "
On Wednesday , Allen acknowledged in testimony he failed to ask Stevens to pay for some work simply " because I like Ted . "
The defense cried foul at getting the new information so late in the trial .
A visibly angry Sullivan agreed , saying , " It was gross negligence on the part of the government . "
Prosecutors acknowledged the error but said it was unintentional .
" It was a human error , " said prosecutor Brenda Morris .
But " by the luck of God , Mr. Allen is still on the stand and they can cross - examine him . "
" It should n't have to be lucky , " Sullivan replied .
Defense attorney Brendan Sullivan told the judge that the prosecution 's argument is " disingenuous and perhaps dishonest . "
The judge said he found the mistake unbelievable .
" I told the government what to do , and it did n't do it , " he thundered .
" Why should n't I dismiss the indictment ? "
Morris maintained that Stevens is still receiving a fair trial , but the judge said , " the only reason he 's ( Stevens ) getting a fair trial is because I 'm here to see to it he 's getting a fair trial .
Thank goodness we do n't have to rely on the United States to give him a fair trial . "
The judge told jurors the trial would not proceed Thursday because " the attorneys and I need to address some issues that have come up .
It has nothing to do with your job ... just go enjoy your day . "
Prosecutors did not speak to reporters as they left the courthouse .
The government 's attorneys have been in trouble with the judge three times during the trial .
The first time , the judge threatened to declare the government 's case concluded when they ran out of available witnesses before the court 's day was done .
The second time was over the unresolved decision by prosecutors to send a subpoenaed witness back to Alaska without telling the judge or defense attorneys .
But it was Thursday 's controversy that seemed to provoke the judge the most .

BillO must have missed the last eight years of BushCo because he says that all our economic problems are the fault of the dirty f*&king hippies .
You see , O'Reilly asks :
Is America a nation in decline ?
As if that 's a legitimate question .
You know the answer he 's going to give .
In his mind the media wants Obama elected and while most Americans are n't liberals they want a president that will look out for them .
The gap in wealth throughout the land is due to liberal policies that have led to the collapse of our education system .
You see it 's all the kids fault since they can't read or write well enough to compete in the work place so Obama will set up a huge Welfare state that takes his money and give sit to us .
Why , it 's all so simple .
Oh wait , when did they actually try to get a job ?

College sells gays down the American River
by Jeremy Hooper
Over the past few years , California has faced a documented rise in anti-gay hostility from immigrants of Slavic descent .
You might remember that the Southern Poverty Law Center wrote an in - depth report on the matter .
You might have also seen videos like this one , this one , or this one , all of which ably document the heated protests from these Russian - speaking evangelicals .
It is certainly a situation that we have watched with interest / fear .
Well now this community 's anti-gay protests have taken on one Sacramento Community College 's student body .
This week the Student Council of American River College voted 8 - 3 to endorse that cruel and discriminatory measure known as Proposition 8 .
And five of those eight council members were immigrants from the former Soviet Union , who have heatedly spoken out about their " responsibility to protect our traditional family values . "
Here 's a Sacramento
Bee story on the matter :
ARC Student Council votes to back gay marriage ban [ Sac Bee ]
Here 's a speech from one of the council members , Viktor Chaban , lashing out against " the homosexuals " and their " choice " :
Here 's a video of the vote itself :
And here 's a local news report on the situation :
:: sigh : :
All that vodka drunk by college gays drink , and this is the thanks they get ?
**SEE ALSO : Timothy Kincaid has written more on the matter over at Box Turtle Bulletin
Your thoughts
The part of this which does NOT surprise me is that the student body not only ALLOWED this to happen , but made it EASY for them by …hmmmm … what could it be ?
NOT VOTING .
Only 300 people bothered to vote , so naturally anyone who just showed up to run and got all their friends to join them , won .
NOW , suddenly , there are 450 people who object ?
Where were they when the voting needed to be done ?
Maybe they excused themselves by saying , “ it ’s just student council , who cares ? ”
Maybe they thought , “ All candidates are the same and none of them think exactly as I do and the system is corrupt to begin with , so why bother ? ”
Maybe they thought that * obviously * these candidates were too stupid / bigoted / uninformed / extreme and therefore no one would vote for them .
You may never not the governing body you vote for ; but you can count on getting the one you did n’t bother to vote for .
Every lefty / liberal / progressive / democrat who is considering not voting or doing a “ protest ” vote might consider looking at this little election story here .
Posted by : Laura | Oct 2 , 2008 11:06:24 AM
That 's exactly right , Laura .
And it 's a near certainty that these anti-gay activists got on the council for this very reason .
It is likely a conducted effort .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Oct 2 , 2008 11:17:23 AM
Interesting take on the Council vote .
" Cruel and discriminatory " to vote yes on 8 ?
Discrimination has to do with making distinctions between what is right and what is obviously very wrong .
It is a good thing in this sense .
It is you gays who have chosen to defy God 's design , preferring LGBTQ behaviors over that which is normal .
To ' discriminate ' , i.e. , point out the perversion and stand against it is commendable .
You prefer the anarchistic , destructive homosexual lifestyle ?
Your choice , just do n't stuff it down our throats with your violent activism to destroy a foundation of moral , orderly society , marriage .
Why do n't you link to the YouTube video showing the homosexuals ' loving , tolerant response to one of the Yes on 8 council members ?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_leg-aRb6o8
Hmm , but that ruins you thesis that the Slavs ( and others supporting biblical values ) are the cruel , violent ones ...
Posted by : Yeson8 | Oct 2 , 2008 11:20:17 AM
It 's general apathy that has you bothered .
Since the populace has been dumbed down and you liberals have the high ground to force your agenda on the people , you 've become accustomed to having your way .
Now that a disgusted voting bloc has arisen that is not apathetic and willing to stand for their beliefs , why now you 're all bent - - it 's a conspiracy !
Bigots !
Stupid !
How could this happen ?
People are waking up and realizing the jeopardy this country is facing because of complacency .
The gay agenda must be stopped and action must be taken .
Disgruntled
No on 8 supporters may try and recall those 8 Council members for their courageous , educated stand for morality , but that effort will just be shown for what it truly is -- a spiteful , concerted effort of striking intolerance by the ' live and let live ' crowd .
Posted by : Yeson8 | Oct 2 , 2008 11:33:04 AM
" Yes on 8 " : If you would actually look at the post , you would see that the video to which you have linked IS on there !
The first one , in fact .
The rest of your points are too ridiculous ( and yes , CRUEL ) to even acknowledge .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Oct 2 , 2008 11:47:57 AM
Yes , the video is there , but note how you framed it , as an example of SLAVICS " lashing out " at homosexuals and their choice .
Watch the video and you will see it's the sodomites who are viciously lashing out at the Slavic speaker , not vice versa .
You people cannot tolerate any ' intolerance ' of your chosen perverted lifestyle , fess up .
Posted by : Yeson8 | Oct 2 , 2008 11:53:48 AM
No , no , no -- do n't play that game with me .
What you initially said is : " Why do n't you link to the YouTube video showing the homosexuals ' loving , tolerant response to one of the Yes on 8 council members ? "
And you were wrong - - we did post it .
But now you 're acting as if it 's the way it 's framed with which you have a problem , rather than simply admit that you were wrong .
And yes , Mr. Chaban ( maybe that 's you ? ) did , in fact , lash out against " the homosexuals " and " their choice . "
That is a fact .
Just like you are calling gays " perverted " and " sodmomites . "
If some gay people take unkindly to that , it 's to be expected .
And while you , in your little bubble of hostility , might think you are helping your side by making such heated vitriol known , you are dead wrong .
Even many within the " pro-family " movement would agree with us on that .

What confuses me is why the student council is getting involved at all .
I have sat on my own university 's student council for three years now , and one of our primary rules is that we are not politically involved , except at the level of education .
The only political involvement by the council is lobbying on issues such as tuition hikes , student loans , etc .
We provide funding for any student group , regardless of their politics ( assuming , of course , that they are not violating the charter of rights and freedoms through membership or agenda . )
Why on earth would a student council be " endorsing " a marriage proposition , one way or the other ?
Although I am a queer rights activist and strongly against proposition 8 , I would be similarly concerned if they voted to endorse the opposite position - the role of student government is to embrace and promote the rights of ALL students , and taking a political stand means that you are inevitably alienating students as well as supporting them .
I hope these comments make sense .
I should mention as well that I am Canadian , and there may be a difference in how American schools run their student goverments .
( ps : Hi , I 'm Katie , I check this website every day but do n't generally post . )

Linking to the actual YouTube site of the video as I gave it is a little more enlightening than just you posting the video .
Add more balance to your reporting , showing more of the other side 's view , than just your lopsided interpretation .
And Katie , why endorse that Prop ?
It is about education .
Redefine marriage , and from K - College , the whole educational system will have to re-educate the masses on what constitutes the basic building blocks of society .
There are moral wrongs and rights , absolutes , that are inviolable whether you agree with them or not .
As so many supposedly ' neutral ' business organizations in the culture war have openly come out against Prop 8 ( Levi's , Google , SEIU , CTA , PG&E , etc. ) should n't educational institutions ( concerned about real education , not indoctrination ) also be heard on this issue ?
Your choice to be gay is your right , but that is all .
It is NOT a civil rights issue : you do not deserve special , preferential treatment based on your sexual orientation !
Posted by : Yeson8 | Oct 2 , 2008 1:11:00 PM
" Linking to the actual YouTube site of the video as I gave it is a little more enlightening than just you posting the video . "
Oh , just stop it !
Your point makes no sense .
The video is the exact same whether it is embedded or on the Youtube page !
In fact , far more people are likely to watch an embedded video as they are to click over to the YouTube site .
And if they want to go to the YouTube site , everyone and their brother knows that you can click on a YouTube video to see it on its host site !
Your side will ultimately lose because discrimination is a losing position .
But keep kicking and screaming and declaring that we are " perverts " who " chose " our " lifestyle " if it makes you feel better .

Laura :
Agreed but what a great lesson this affair is in the importance of participatory government .
Far too many of us take our precious right to vote for granted .
Jeremy :
If you hear of the results of the recall effort , please post them .
I 'm interested to see how this plays out .
Thanks for bringing this to your readers ' attention .
Yeson8 : Blah , blah , blah .
Perhaps it works differently in Russia , but free speech does NOT guarantee you a right to not be offended .
The USA is n't Russia and fanatics like you are losing ground every single day .
If you think this student council decision is anything more than an anomaly , you 're sadly mistaken .
' Good ' luck with that recall , pal .
Katie : I do believe that the council is free to take a position one way or the other , unless prohibited by their charter , but agree that this is something beyond their competence .
That the council intervened and the result of this is something that the student body itself is free to consider in recall efforts or the next election .

As someone who goes to American River College ( and someone who was at that protest ) I want to defend the student body and say that these folks who passed the endorsement on Prop 8 ARE NOT the minority .
These people do not represent the diverse and generally open minded population our campus has , they unfortunately just have a bigger voice than the rest of us .
Myself and others are taking the steps to push back and make ourselves heard though , and I hope someday in the near future the news bits that discuss ARC are about the good we 're doing , not the hate we 're promoting .

ARC's Prop 8 Endorsement :
The story behind the vote
Bay Area Reporter
In a move that was called " no surprise " by Sacramento lgbt activists , the student council of American River College last week passed a resolution which called for the support of November 's Proposition 8 ballot measure , the so - called ' gay marriage ban . '
The resolution of support is believed to be the first of its kind at any California college or university .
According to a Sacramento
Bee story , in the face of what reporter Steve Magagnini called " passionate opposition , " the measure passed by a vote of 8 - 3 , with three abstentions .
In his article , Magagnini incorrectly termed the ballot measure " the Marriage Protection Amendment . "
In fact , it is termed the " LIMIT ON MARRIAGE " amendment on the November ballot .
" No surprise , " said local lgbt activist Jerry Sloan about the ARC council endorsement , noting that five of the eight majority votes cast were those of slavic christian fundamentalist students who had " targeted the board for takeover more than a year ago . "
These students , explained Sloan , are members of the same religious immigrant community that has held virulently anti-gay protests at Sacramento lgbt events and celebrations since 2006 .
In fact , one of the council members to propose the endorsement , Dennis Choban , who goes by " Viktor , " was photographed by OUTWORD demonstrating at this year 's lgbt pride parade .
American River College is " one of four community colleges , " in the Sacramento region , explained ARC Public Information spokesperson Stephen Peithman , adding that ARC has four satellite centers .
" We have several centers and have a very large service area ... We are a commuter school . "
Peithman , while noting that the ARC student council was elected with less than 300 of the institution 's 35,000 students participating , Peithman believes the college " is a reflection of its surrounding community . "
Sloan and fellow gay activist Nathan Feldman have been watchdogs of this group for the lgbt community and Sloan is credited with obtaining copies of council member applications declaring their intention to run for the student board .
" They all ran together as a group , " stated Sloan , who alleges that the slavic evangelical community in coordination with the Placerville pentacostal group , the Church of the Divide , conspired to elect a majority to the ARC Student council board as early as last year .
In Choban 's application to enter the student council race , his answers make clear Choban 's religious motivation to run for council .
In answering questions that make no reference to religion , nor calls for a religious response , Choban expresses his desire to see his religious beliefs reflected in ARC curriculum .
" My goals include removing humanistic bias from cerain [ sic ] courses , ( such as Evolution Science ) and presenting other views , ( such as Creation Science ) and , Encouraging live discussion of nontraditional views in all classes . "
" Humanistic bias is a catchphrase " used by radio talkshow host James Dobson and " Christian Nation " author and lecturer David Barton , said Sloan , who calls these young slavic men " brain - washed robots .
Anything that 's not christian is secular humanism to these guys .
Humanism is what christian fundamentalists mean when they say ' them , ' as in 'us versus them , ' " stated Sloan .
" I have been exposed to the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights again and again , " stated Chabon in answering the form 's question : " Are you familiar with governing documents , such as a constitution and by - laws ? "
Sloan muses , " His answer makes it sound like he 's been exposed to some terrible disease . "
Alexandru Cojan , another of the group of five christian students to run for ARC 's student council this year , listed similar religious views on his application .
Cojan listed only one goal for his tenure as a councilmember , " To represent christians on campus and to stand up for righteousness . "
Valeriy Dron , whose other written answers reflect that English is a second language for him , writes that he wants " to be a voice for Christians on campus . "
Daniel Karavan and Sergey Linnik listed similar singular goals with Linnik stating his desire for freedom to express his " religious believes [ sic ] and ideas that will benefit all . "
Karavan notes the skill he will bring to the council is his active involvement " in a Youth Church Council . "
Joshua Serban 's application is perhaps the most direct .
" I 'm a christian .
I represent christ " wrote Serban when answering the application 's query about personal skills .
His goal , if elected to the board ?
" To represent Christians and Christian values , " at this commuter junior college .
Yelisey Shendrya also was among the group of slavic christians who applied together for student council .
" Originally the slavs had nine members on the board " said Sloan , who claims that several of the students became ineligible for the council after falling below the minimum gpa requirement for participation in ARC student government .
" The students must maintain a 2.5 grade point average , " said Steven Peithman , ARC 's media spokesperson .
Choban is one of the students who just qualified for council eligibility .
The gpa requirement for councilmembers is 2.5 , according to Peithman .
Choban listed his gpa as " 2.7 . "
Karavan , who along with Choban participated in demonstrations at this year 's pride parade and festival , was slightly better at 2.8 .
Both Serban and Dron applied as new students , giving them exemption from eligibility requirements .
Many of the slavic council members mentioned their activity in church youth activities and church youth council .
Most of these students are believed by Sloan and Feldman to attend Bethany Slavic Missionary Church on nearby Jackson Road in North Sacramento .
" That church has more than 5,000 attendees every Sunday , " stated Sloan , adding " this is not a group that should be taken lightly . "
Sloan worries that the small Sacramento lgbt community " is no match " for the size and force of the local slavic fundamentalist immigrant community .
With 70 churches and 80,000 to 100,000 members , its the largest evangelical immigrant community in the nation , according to a Los Angeles Times article by Rome Tempest .
" I was excited about the students level of involvement , " said Keltie Jones , the openly gay Dean of Counseling and Student Services .
" I was excited to see the number of students involved .
That is what I found to be so exciting . "
Jones had received some negative feedback from being quoted in the Bee story for " being excited . "
" My comments were not that I was happy about the result , I was excited about the fact that our students were engaged .
For me , college is more about that . "
Asked if she believes the reputation of ARC will suffer from this resolution , Jones was contemplative .
" I think the real reputation of ARC will depend on what happens next .
The reputation of ARC is important , but I think its important that we support student development in all ways , and sometimes students get passionate about issues .
What 's important is how the student body responds to the actions of the council , " said Jones .

Being homosexual is a choice and nothing more .
Marriage is the joint union between man and women and I support the student government at American River College and I hope the college that I attend takes the same step forward .
I am also an excutive officer in the student government , so I can push for that to happen .
Posted by : | Oct 9 , 2008 3:17:36 AM
As a student at ARC , I have to speak out a bit about this whole ' the student body is responsible for not voting ' bs .
That 's just what it is , B.S. I have been a student on campus for three years , I 'm completing my second degree .
Usually during election times , or during times that are important to the college for voting processes , there are posters put up and information spread on where the students need to go to make their voices heard .
There was nothing posted for this election .
No information about who was running , no information on where one could vote , when one was supposed to be voting .
Without specifically thinking about 'oh , I need to go and elect my student administration representatives , who should I ask about that ? ' most of us , who also work and some of whom have families and outside lives had little to no control over the people who are now claiming to represent the entire college .
It is inappropriate for the student association to take my money ( something I have no choice in giving them as it is part of tuition ) and then presume to make political statements for an entire campus .
They are not representing my views .
I would , however , feel similarly uncomfortable if they were pro-gay .
That is not fair to the campus either , it does n't speak for the student body .
The only thing that the student association should be doing is worrying about inter-campus things , and other school related things .
Such as Measure M and whether or not that gets passed .
Or parking , which is a clusterf*ck .
Leave the California constitution out of it , it has nothing to do with ARC .
And frankly , creates a hostile learning environment .

Thanks to all the students who have written .
Your insight really helps us here .
As for anon ( the executive officer in the student government ) at 3:17 AM : Many of you on the ARC student government seem to be really into your threats .
You should cut down on that .
They are really unbecoming .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Oct 9 , 2008 8:46:53 AM
Insight ?
Sight at all ?
Seems most of the students ( not anon exec officer ! ) have been blinded by the liberal indoctrination that over 12 years in the California school system will cause .
Face it .
No matter how you spin the original Council election , or the Council taking up Prop 8 for a vote , it all boils down to one thing :
The liberal , gay and gay - supporting students are MAD they are not getting their way , so as sore losers they will scream and raise as much of a recall ruckus much like a toddler throwing a temper tantrum .
We all know the high stakes in this battle .
As energized as your side is , some of us are as equally fired up to go to the limit to see Prop 8 pass .
May the vindictive Council recall effort fail and Proposition 8 PASS in November !

Yeson8 : You will never win the ultimate war because you have chosen the losing side .
Waste all the words you want .
Your bigotry will not prevail .
Not ultimately .

The results of the student association recall came out yesterday .
The recall failed by a 200-300 vote margin .
Aprox 3450 people voted .

LIKE a Hollywood monster that is impervious to bullets , the credit crisis refuses to lie down and die .
The authorities have bombarded it with interest - rate reductions , tax cuts , special liquidity schemes and bank bail - outs , but still the creature lumbers forward , threatening new victims with every step .
Global stockmarkets are suffering double - digit losses this year , and credit markets are once again gummed up .
For investors who cut their teeth in the 1980s and 1990s , the persistence of the crisis must be a surprise .
Prompt action by central banks , after Black Monday in 1987 ( when America 's stockmarket fell by almost 23 % ) , or following the collapse of Long - Term Capital Management , a hedge fund , in 1998 , suggested it was always worthwhile to “ buy on the dips ” .
One reason why things are different this time is that there has been a double shock .
On top of the decline in house prices and the associated drop in the prices of asset - backed securities , the markets have also had to face a surge in commodity prices .
That has constrained central banks from easing monetary policy as much as they might have done , particularly in Britain and the euro zone .
Even in America , rates might now perhaps be 1 % ( as they were in 2003 ) without the commodity boom .
In addition , the combination of the two shocks has created uncertainty about the direction of monetary and regulatory policy .
Will the central banks be forced to “ do a Turkey ” and adjust their inflation targets upward ( implicitly or explicitly ) to reflect reality ?
Alternatively , will they crack down so hard on inflation that they force their economies into recession ?
And will the price of investment - bank rescues be a harsh new regulatory regime that restricts the scope for future credit ( and economic ) growth ?
In the face of all this uncertainty , investors can hardly be blamed for being cautious .
The way that the crisis has centred on the banking industry also explains its duration .
Stephen King , an economist at HSBC , points out that the financial crises of the 1990s were also prolonged , from the savings and loan collapses in America through the Swedish banking rescues to the extremes of Japan 's debt deflation .
As Mr King says , “ if banks are unable or unwilling to lend , monetary policy does n't work so well . ”
Worse still , bank problems create a feedback loop with the rest of the economy .
When banks get into difficulty , they restrict their lending .
That in turn makes life more difficult for companies and consumers , causing them to cut their spending and making it harder for them to repay their debts .
That forces further caution on the banks .
Recent economic data have highlighted how the gloom is spreading .
Neither Germany nor Japan enjoyed a credit boom earlier this decade but both economies are suffering .
Business confidence in Germany fell to its lowest level in three years , according to the latest Ifo survey , released on August 26th .
“ The credit crunch is morphing from an American - centred financial crisis into a global economic crisis , ” says David Bowers of Absolute Strategy Research , a consultancy .
Another reason why the crisis is lasting so long stems from the nature of the previous boom .
Everyone was borrowing money , from homeowners buying houses they could not afford in the hope of capital gains , to investors buying complex debt products with high yields because of the extra “ carry ” .
These investors were , directly or indirectly , beholden to the banks .
Even when money was borrowed from “ the market ” , the lenders may well have been hedge funds , conduits or structured - investment vehicles , all of which had themselves borrowed money from banks in the first place .
That former wellhead of finance has now run fairly dry .
In turn , that explains the absence of bargain hunters , particularly in the debt markets .
Investment - grade debt might look attractive on a five - year view , if all you have to worry about is the risk of default .
But most investors in that market have a three - or six - month view ; they cannot afford for things to get worse before they get better , in case they are forced into a fire - sale of their assets .
So the markets ( and the developed economies ) are waiting for a catalyst for recovery .
Lower commodity prices helped for a while , and may help further if they encourage central banks to cut rates .
Evidence of a bottom in the American housing market may also do the trick .
But the crisis seems certain to linger into 2009 , and could even make it into the following year .
Successful horror movies tend , after all , to have several sequels .
OK , it could be worse , we could have the Shanghai market or Moscow but is this what we should expect from what is supposed to be the strongest economy in the world ?
We had a Republican right wing Congress from 1994 - 2006 and a pro-business president since 2000 , both of whom promised to unshackle business and let it reach its true potential .
Impressed ?
Me neither .
They received everything they wanted , walked away with salaries and bonuses and golden parachutes that dreams are made of and this is what we get .
Even today , the Republicans are unable to admit that their model failed .
Many still believe that we need even less regulation and that we should n’t have any say in executive pay despite taxpayer investments .
Can we move on from this experiment in Republican economics now ?
Can we get back to real American ideas such as equal opportunity instead of a tilted system that favors the elite few ?
I remain skeptical that we ’re going to see any significant change though I ’d like to be proven wrong .
One thing that is for sure , we wo n’t have any change if we let the Republicans control the message .

The database used to produce the government 's terror watch lists is " crippled by technical flaws , " according to the chairman of a House technology oversight subcommittee — and the system designed to replace it may be even worse .
In a letter to the inspector general at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence last week , Rep. Brad Miller ( D - NC ) complained that the National Counterterrorism Center 's " Railhead " initiative , designed to upgrade the government 's master database of suspected terrorists , " if actually deployed will leave our country more vulnerable than the existing yet flawed system in operation today . "
Miller , who chairs the Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee of the House Science and Technology Committee , cited " severe technical troubles , poor contractor management , and weak government oversight , " which he said had brought the Railhead program to the " verge of collapse . "
The NCTC's Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment , established pursuant to the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission , is the government 's centralized master database of people with suspected terror links .
Containing some half a million names , it is used to create more specific watchlists used by other government agencies , such as the Transportation Security Administration 's much - derided " no - fly " list .
The current TIDE system has its own set of " serious , long - standing technical problems . "
It requires users to perform " cumbersome and complex " SQL searches rather than delivering straightforward text matches .
And its data is scattered across 463 different , poorly - indexed tables .
But the Railhead " upgrade , " Miller 's letter charges , only compounds the problems .
According to his subcommittee 's analysis , the new - and - improved system boasts fewer features , hobbles information sharing between agencies , fails to match slight variations in aliases contained on the watchlist , and is stymied by basic Boolean search operators .
Miller also alleged that some of the $ 500 million spent on Railhead already had been improperly used to renovate a facility owned by contractor Boeing .
The NCTC fired back Friday in a statement , calling Miller 's description " inconsistent with the facts " and complaining that his subcommittee " has had no interaction with the NCTC or the Intelligence Community on the Railhead Program . "
Ten years after graduation , high - school students who had been rated as conscientious and cooperative by their teachers were earning more than classmates who had similar test scores but fewer social skills , said a new University of Illinois study .
The study 's findings challenge the idea that racial , ethnic , and socioeconomic gaps in educational attainment and earnings can be narrowed solely by emphasizing cognitive skills , said Christy Lleras , a University of Illinois assistant professor of human and community development .
" It 's important to note that good schools do more than teach reading , writing , and math .
They socialize students and provide the kinds of learning opportunities that help them to become good citizens and to be successful in the labor market , " she said .
" Unless we address the differences in school climates and curriculum that foster good work habits and other social skills , we 're doing a huge disservice to low - income kids who may be entering the labor market right after high school , especially in our increasingly service - oriented economy , " Lleras added .
She cited responses to employer surveys that stress the need for workers who can get along well with each other and get along well with the public .
The U of I study analyzed data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study , which followed a diverse group of 11,000 tenth graders for 10 years , tracking not only their scores on standard achievement tests but teacher appraisals of such qualities as the students ' work habits , their ability to relate well to peers , and their participation in extracurricular activities , a proxy for the ability to interact well with both students and adults .
The teachers ' assessments were then compared with the students ' self - reported educational attainments and earnings 10 years after high - school graduation .
Even after controlling for students ' achievement test scores , family socioeconomic status , and educational attainment , Lleras found that such social skills as conscientiousness , cooperativeness , and motivation were as important as test scores for success in the workplace .
" You could argue that the reason these behaviors matter is that kids who display them are more likely to obtain a college degree and in turn have higher earnings .
Certainly that is part of it , but even after I controlled for educational attainment , there were still significant effects , " she said .
To measure conscientiousness , the researcher ranked teacher responses to such questions as : Does this student usually work hard for good grades ?
How often does the student complete homework assignments ?
How often is this student tardy to class ?
To measure cooperativeness and sociability , she ranked teacher assessments of how well a student related to other students .
Teachers were also asked to rank a student 's motivation or passivity .
Participation in sports and school organizations also had strong effects on a student 's future educational and occupational success .
" For African American and Hispanic students only , participation in fine arts led to significantly better earnings compared to whites .
This suggests that different activities teach kids different kinds of skills and learned behaviors , " she said .
Lleras also emphasized the importance of improving school quality .
" Low - income and racial minority students continue to be concentrated in lower - quality schools with fewer opportunities for extracurricular participation , larger class sizes , and lower teacher quality , all factors that are correlated with poorer school - related attitudes and behavior , " she said .
" If the few resources that low - performing schools have are used solely for testing and preparing students for tests , which is what many schools are doing to meet the requirements set forth in No Child Left Behind , these schools will continue to face challenges , " she said .
" My findings show that the most successful students are those who have not only high achievement test scores but also the kinds of social skills and behaviors that are highly rewarded by employers in the workplace , " she said .

Report : White House coordinated taxpayer - funded travel on behalf of embattled GOP candidates Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday October 15 , 2008
Print This Email
This A new report from the House Oversight Committee alleges that President Bush and his White House political team engaged in a systematic effort to send government officials on taxpayer - funded trips to help Republican candidates in the 2006 midterm elections .
The 27 - page report ( .pdf ) documents 425 trips arranged by the White House Office of Political Affairs for various agency heads , cabinet secretaries and other prominent administration officials .
More than 300 of those trips took the officials outside of Washington for events with members of Congress in tough races .
Most of the pseudo - campaign stops were paid for with taxpayer money , in violation of the Hatch Act , which prohibits political activity as a part of the official duties of executive branch personnel , according to the report .
The committee 's reports recommends amending the law governing executive branch political activity and eliminating the White House Office of Political Affairs .
Ken Mehlman , who ran Bush 's re-election campaign in 2004 , led the Political Affairs office in the president 's first term .
The Oversight Committee report said he laid the groundwork for the politicization of agency heads .
Under Mr. Mehlman , the Office of Political Affairs established what it called an asset deployment team to mobilize agency heads to travel to events with Republican candidates .
The asset deployment team included various members of the Office of Political Affairs , as well as the chiefs of staff and White House liaisons of at least 12 departments and agencies .
It was established in 2002 .
The team deployed agency heads to appear with Republican incumbents who were facing difficult re-election races .
It also apparently timed the visits to ramp up in the months before the election .
In October of 2006 , executive branch officials completed more than 90 visits recommended by the political office .
The report says cooperative agencies were praised while White House officials cajoled agencies who did not advance the president 's political agenda .
In one instance , the report notes , that GOP political guru Karl Rove singled out the Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Departments of Commerce , Transportation and Agriculture for their cooperation with the party 's election efforts .
An ONDCP White House liason singled out the praise in an e-mail to the office 's director and other top officials .
This recognition is not something we hear everyday and we should feel confident that our hard work is noticed .
All of this is due to our efforts in preparing the Director and Deputies for their trips and events .
Director Walters and the Deputies covered thousands of miles to attend numerous official events all across the country .
The Director and the Deputies deserve the most recognition because they actually had to give up time with their families for the god awful places we sent them .
The report notes that activities of the White House political office have been controversial since former President Ronald Reagan established in in 1981 and it recounts complaints of Bill Clinton 's improper use of agency officials in pursuit of political goals .
But the extent of political activity by the current White House and its deep and systematic reach into the federal agencies is unprecedented .
Congress should amend the Hatch Act , the federal law restricting political activity by federal officials , to eliminate the White House Office of Political Affairs .
If the political affairs office is retained , its activities should be restructured to ensure that it serves the interests of the taxpayer , not the political party of the President .
The Hatch Act , originally passed in 1939 to quell fears that Franklin Roosevelt would use an expanding corps of federal employees to advance his political prospects , has been amended several times since its passage .
The actions documented in the report seem to represent precisely the kind of conduct it aimed to prevent .
" In effect , " the report says , " the Bush Administration established precisely the type of ' political boiler - room ' that Congress warned against when it amended the Hatch Act in 1993 . "
The crash landing of NASA ’s Genesis capsule in 2004 points out some of the problems of active descent and landing systems .
( credit : NASA ) “ Pit Stop ” : a new way to return from space
This article proposes an unusual way to land objects from orbit and probes returning from deep space .
I wo n’t dwell on details best left for future study , but will suggest enough possibilities to encourage more study of the concept .
The use of airbags to help spacecraft land on Mars is a recent example of just how important it is to consider unconventional recovery options like the one described here .
The goal is to reduce or eliminate the usual weight penalty and reliability issues associated with parachutes , touchdown cushioning rockets , water flotation devices , and other complex paraphernalia normally required to softly land a space vehicle on the Earth .
New concepts deserve a memorable name , so I call this recovery system “ Pit Stop ” for reasons that will soon be obvious .
In this scenario , reentry of the spacecraft would be conventional until it slows and descends in the atmosphere to an altitude of perhaps 15,000 meters .
At that height the landing capsule might separate from the disposable heat shield , which then drops away .
The heat shield could remain attached , but it might present extra thermal problems for the recovery facility on the ground .
Aerodynamic control surfaces would then pitch the vehicle over into a vertical dive where it would reach a terminal velocity of perhaps 100 meters per second .
The goal is to reduce or eliminate the usual weight penalty and reliability issues associated with parachutes , touchdown cushioning rockets , water flotation devices , and other complex paraphernalia normally required to softly land a space vehicle on the Earth .
Signals from stationary Global Positioning System ( GPS ) transmitters on the ground near the landing site , in conjunction with the Orbital GPS system , would help direct the capsule ’s final decent .
Like a “ smart bomb ” the vehicle would aim for an exact spot on the earth ’s surface .
Ground - based vertical wind profilers would provide real - time meteorological updates for the guidance and control system .
Other terminal guidance aids , for example LIDAR ( light detection and ranging ) or active laser tracking might also be used to achieve great accuracy .
In this “ Pit Stop ” concept , the landing capsule , carefully steered in its plunge to earth , would aim for the opening of a deep vertical shaft set into the ground .
The capsule would dive into this hole while still falling at terminal velocity .
The recovery shaft would extend straight down into the earth for hundreds of meters and be closed off and pressure tight at its base .
Detailed shaft shape and depth would affect the desired deceleration rate .
For recovery of an object that could withstand high G - loads , the shaft might be only a few hundred meters deep .
For a low G - load recovery , a shaft over a thousand meters deep would probably be required .
The landing capsule would fit loosely in the entrance of the pit , but clearance would tighten with depth .
As the capsule descends , air would flow around the vehicle through the narrowing gap between it and the shaft wall .
Appropriate vehicle shaping might encourage it to seek a stable position in the center of the shaft , but it ’s also possible it might be pulled toward a wall by aerodynamic effects .
Since scraping against the shaft wall is possible , abrasion could be addressed by coating the shaft with a film of water or other material .
As the capsule descends , it would act as a piston , compressing the air in front of its direction of travel .
It would slow down rapidly because the compressed air would behave like a soft , pneumatic spring .
Eventually the spacecraft would stop .
In one scenario , as air escapes around its body , the vehicle would slowly sink down to the bottom of the pit and finally be stopped by a cushioning system .
Airlocks at the bottom would open and a human recovery crew would gain access .
As the capsule speeds down the shaft , there is some possibility that the air compressed below might not escape fast enough to give the desired deceleration profile .
If so the vehicle could stop and then bounce back upward , propelled by the compressed air , then halt , then descend again to a stop , then rise , then descend , etc. , in a sequence of elevator –like up and down moves that slowly dampen out .
One way to prevent rebound would be to contour the sides of the spacecraft so that air can vent by ( or maybe even through ) its body .
Another way to avoid a pogo stick affect might be to arrange the primary shaft to nestle concentrically inside a larger outer tube .
Vent holes or slots between the two shafts would release air from under the capsule at a controlled rate .
The best site for “ Pit Stop ” ground stations would be a place with no wind , but light or steady local winds could be compensated for by the vehicle ’s terminal guidance .
Daily upper atmospheric variables such as density , high altitude winds and irregular de-orbit burn characteristics all introduce uncertainty in the final reentry path .
These unknowns could be addressed by installing several “ Pit Stop ” capture facilities spaced kilometers apart along the reentry ground track in the general landing area .
The final choice of which receiving pit to use would be made when the capsule begins its atmospheric dive toward the ground .
The “ Pit Stop ” recovery scheme should work with a wide range of vehicles .
When the system is proven to be reliable , it may be especially attractive for use with manned vehicles that pay a big weight penalty to achieve soft - landing capability .
Shaft recovery provides pneumatic cushioning that ’s inherently automatic and reliable .
The vehicle guidance and control system must be absolutely trustworthy , but the directional precision needed for such control is demonstrated regularly in existing military applications .
When the system is proven to be reliable , it may be especially attractive for use with manned vehicles that pay a big weight penalty to achieve soft - landing capability .
Back in 2004 the parachute system failed on a Chinese reentry vehicle , yet the capsule remained basically intact after smashing through the roof of a house .
In the same year , when the chutes on NASA ’s Genesis capsule malfunctioned , that deep space probe hit the Utah desert traveling at almost 100 meters per second .
Relatively soft soil kept the capsule from disintegrating and much of the payload was recovered .
These two rare accidents show that it is possible for a spacecraft to survive after falling through the lower atmosphere with no retarding devices and striking the ground .
Thus , a totally successful soft landing is mostly a matter of controlling the final deceleration .
It makes perfect sense to put equipment on the ground to do this rather than to carry heavy landing devices on the vehicle .
An underground recovery system based on this “ Pit Stop ” concept could become routine when it ’s appreciated that such a scheme would be simple , safe , and economical .

SARAH PALIN UNPLUGGED …. Look , this is just getting scary .
I do n’t care how partisan you are , you ca n’t watch this clip from Sarah Palin ’s interview with Katie Couric without wondering if she ’s completely cracked under the pressure of running for vice president .
The question is a simple softball about the bailout — something she ’s had weeks to bone up on — but her answer is incoherent .
Not just the usual platitudes politicians offer when they do n’t feel like answering a tough query , but completely incoherent .
Hell , it ’s barely even in English .
I do n’t even feel right making snarky jokes about this stuff anymore .
This campaign has gone seriously off the rails .
I ’ve never seen anything like it , but everyone is still nattering on as if this is business as usual .
If it is , though , we ’ve already entered the world of Idiocracy and we might as well all just give up and enjoy our super - size Slurpees while we can .

” Konstens former äro många , men dess väsende är ett . ”
“ I know how the world works .
I know the good and the evil in it . ” — John McCain
When talk turns to the intersection of religion and politics , religionists are a bore to have around ; what you want is titter and amusement .
But scholars of religious studies do n’t offer much by way of demonstrative surprise at the obscenities of public faith .
Like the manager of the strip club , they ’ve seen it all before .
Whisper to a religionist that the Christian candidate has a grandchild produced out of wedlock and you ’ll get a game of one - upmanship .
“ Well , if you think that ’s crazy , let me tell you about the nun in Dubuque who …the Hindu cleric who …the Catholic soccer mom who … the born - again president who … ”
Or , just as likely , you might get a little shrug , a roll of the eyes , and a tiny harrumph .
“ Religious people are just like nonreligious people , ” one colleague remarked to me recently , “ except religious people have whole cosmologies to explain their failures . ”
What may seem like a flippant position is actually an elaborate argumentative vantage point that scholars of religion have been refining for over one hundred years .
Religionists are , by their training , by their dispositional nature , less interested in the debunking of the religious subject ( “ I knew you were lying ! ” ) than we are in the study of the religious subject ( “ Such a complicated way to understand the world ! ” ) .
What religionists have learned through all this analysis is that there are no consistent or pure religious subjects .
There have been men and women throughout history — of towering , articulated faith and of impressive , practiced piety — who have found ways to sin , prevaricate , and seemingly contradict the ideal postulate of their orthodoxies .
It is no surprise that a man of Christian consensus might have an Afrocentric preacher , or an evangelical may have an impregnated teen , or a Catholic may have a weakness for plagiarism , or an Episcopalian may have a hankering for Charles Keating ’s cash .
These are n’t exceptions in the study of religion , they are the rules .
Men and women believe even as they struggle , relentlessly , to behave .
So when I say that John McCain may not believe in God , I do so with serious thought , and with no small indifference .
It matters very little to me ( as a voter , as a thinker , and as a believer ) that John McCain does n’t articulate a deity familiar to any available denomination of Christianity ( or Judaism or Hinduism or Islam ) .
John McCain is , indisputably , a man of courage and intelligence .
To suggest that he is not recognizably Baptist ( nor ostensibly Episcopalian ) is merely to demonstrate that our enterprise of discerning religion from political candidates misses , precisely , the realities of religion .
In some contrast to the pursuits of journalism , the religionist does not anticipate the craven , presuming that all words of faith are pandering rhetoric meant to appease men with guns and girls with God(s ) .
Rather , our job is to collect the available artifacts of religion ( words and acts supplied in archive or public record ) and render an analysis of the subject .
For students of religion , this analysis is not an inherently apolitical exercise , but it is , at its best , one disentangled from theological prescription .
Somehow , without a God ( but not , as we will see , without a powerful creed ) John McCain has forged for himself a moral mode , a discourse , a rhetoric of righteousness .
What , then , ought it matter whether he is or is not , technically speaking , Christian ?
It apparently matters to him , and to his opponent , and maybe it matters to you .
McCain has noted several times that the “ number one issue … that people should [ use to ] make a selection of the president of the United States [ is ] will this person carry on in the Judeo - Christian principle that has made this nation the greatest experiment in the history of mankind ? ”
A person ’s faith is , according to McCain , an “ important part of our qualifications to lead . ”
Bracketing his dubious grasp of constitutional history , McCain ’s words direct our assessment .
How ought we estimate the existence of such Judeo - Christian principle ?
And is such a principle properly religious ?
As I proceed here with a study of McCain ’s religious words and religious acts , it is worth noting that there is no test , no catechism , and no shibboleth ( as much as the voting public may , for whatever reason , desire one ) that will prove religious identity or personal commitment to a specific God .
People say and do a lot of things they do n’t actually mean .
Trying to know what people actually do believe , or what they actually do mean , requires psychic skill far beyond the purview of most refereed journals , most tenured academics , and certainly beyond the polygraph limits of the American media .
Remember ( yes , you , Senator McCain ; you , Senator Obama ; and you , voting Americans ) : words of faith are precisely that : words .
To know a man ’s religion as an observer ( a voter , a journalist , a scholar , an outside believer ) is to know , only and entirely , his language game .
This is John McCain’s .
Acts of Faith
From the start , it should be clear that we do n’t have a lot to study .
The most consistent aspect of McCain ’s performance of religion is his droopiness toward expressive devotion .
When it comes to communal ritual and institutional affiliation — the social expressions of religious belief —
McCain offers little more than a confusing hopscotch of churches and a sense of presumptive Protestantism .
His strongest acts of faith have been political maneuvers , like his 2008 attempt to create alliances with evangelical leaders in an effort to convince the party ’s base that he is a Bible believer .
This despite the fact that he denounced the religious right in 2000 as “ agents of intolerance ” and despite the definitional truth that he was not , by any useful meaning of that category , an evangelical .
This is one of the many reasons the selection of Governor Sarah Palin was such a brilliant choice as a co-conspirator in 2008 .
Central casting could not have supplied a better religious beard .
Even in his 2008 convention speech McCain would not admire publicly Palin ’s religious belief , choosing rather to note that “ she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for .
She stands up for what ’s right , and she does n’t let anyone tell her to sit down . ”
McCain ’s rhetoric is littered with invocations of chutzpah and independence , even as his has been a ( theological and professional ) career bent on a studied moderation .
“ Ultimately , ” writes McCain biographer John Karaagac , “ we may say that McCain ’s life offers a study in appropriateness . ”
Yes , McCain has done what was expected of him : he , great - grandson of an Episcopalian priest , attended an Episcopal High School , matriculated to the Naval Academy , then devoted himself to military service before transferring his duty to elected office .
In high school , he attended mandatory chapel every morning and mandatory church twice on Sundays .
He learned every line of the Nicene Creed and the Apostles ’ Creed , acts of memorization which would later earn him the role of ad hoc prison chaplain in the Hanoi Hilton .
When he married a woman more regularly religious , he followed her to church when they had time to go .
He would listen , and nod , and think that there was something good about all this fellowship , all this love .
Such a rendition of McCain ’s appropriate religious life fails to offer the fleshy , flashy McCain , the McCain of infamy and admiration .
McCain ’s life story ( articulated in memoirs and stump speeches ) is suffused with talk ( and pride ) for insubordination , fearlessness , and nonconformity .
He fancies himself a “ maverick . ”
Perhaps this is why he has such a hard time tying with a denomination , and why he does n’t like talking about anything as singularly conceding as religious devotion .
For some observers , the fact that McCain does n’t talk much about his faith , about his Christianity , is a denominational inevitability .
“ McCain , actually , is being very authentic by keeping it inside , ” writes voter Eric Gorski in a letter to the New York Times , “ He does n’t wear religion on his sleeve because he comes from a generation and upbringing — Episcopalian — that tends not to . ”
Such a socially determinist explanation might apply if McCain had not made an abrupt move to a different church in the early 1990s .
Although his campaign lists his affiliation as “ Episcopalian , ” McCain corrected a reporter in 2007 , commenting , “ By the way , I ’m no Episcopalian .
I ’m Baptist . ”
That year — preceding his current national candidacy , just seven years after he was outfoxed by Bush in South Carolina — saw many oddly confessional claims from McCain on subjects religious .
“ It was n’t so much a rejection of the Episcopal Church , ” McCain said in October 2007 of his move to the North Phoenix Baptist Church .
“ I came into that church , I sat down , I got the message of redemption and love and forgiveness , and it resonated with me .
I found going to that church was beneficial to me in my life . ”
He “ got ” the “ message of redemption . ”
He ’s been “ going ” to church .
These are claims of some acceptance and presence , but not the conversion or holy abjection frequently described by individuals whose worlds have been transfigured by a particular reading of the gospel , a particular preacher ’s poignancy , or a particular ritual process .
Becoming Baptist was , by McCain ’s reckoning , a Sunday respite .
Conveniently for him , this churchly idyll was found by quitting one of the smallest mainline denominations in order to attend the single largest Protestant sect , by leaving the land of Gene Robinson for the world of Billy Graham , Rick Warren , and Mike Huckabee .
For people who do n’t enjoy the intricacies of Christian denominationalism , McCain ’s language of change may seem adequate .
He once drove a Ford , now he drives a Chrysler : What ’s the difference ?
For religionists ( the sort of people who love the messy details of sectarian schism ) , McCain ’s terse description of North Phoenix does not supply nearly enough explanation for what is a jolting swap , like trading the Jetta for a Suburban .
Yet McCain supplies no wake - up call , no re-awakening of his spirit to explicate his substitution of Sunday affections .
He offers no specifications of the kind of Christ that pressed him from a the Book of Common Prayer to the Baptist Faith and Message .
Nor , as mentioned above , has he shown the increased piety of the convert .
When asked how often he attends church McCain says , “ not as often as I should . ”
When asked whether he has participated in adult baptism , a ritual requisite for converts to the Convention , McCain says no , calling it “ a personal thing , ” adding on another occasion that “ I did n’t find it necessary to do so for my spiritual needs . ”
McCain ’s decision not to participate in a major ritual of Baptist practice may be laziness , may be diffidence , or it may be a desire to evade hypocrisy .
If I do n’t take communion when I attend an Episcopal church , it ’s not because I am antagonistic to communion ( or Episcopalians ) .
I do n’t take communion because this ritual act of belonging is not mine because I do not , properly , belong .
Why does McCain choose not to belong where he claims to belong ?
If these rituals are not McCain ’s , which are ?
Are his prayers Nicene still ?
Were they ever ?
McCain ’s acts of faith requires a return to requisite high school ritual .
Or , as he would have it , a return to Hanoi .
Words of Faith
For most political leaders , God is littered about their speeches , press releases , floor statements , editorials , and memoirs like verbal pork barrel .
Federal executives and legislators tend to collapse into predictable patterns of religious invocation , using lines from the Gospel of Matthew , images of David and Goliath , or talk of covenants to build a City on a Hill in order to flourish their claims of political power .
Yet in his years of public service prior to 2008 , John McCain ’s speeches are models of secular aridity .
He does n’t just occasionally speak of God or faith or America ’s Christian promise ; he never does .
Indeed , John McCain does not like to talk about religion .
“ I ’m unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in God , ” he has said , “ But I do not obviously try to impose my views on others . ”
When pressed , McCain has been known to snap back to interrogating reporters , “ The most important thing is that I ’m a Christian .
And I do n’t have anything else to say on the issue . ”
When McCain does use religious metaphor , it is language cribbed from another belated believer .
McCain likens himself to Reagan , a man whose faith made a surprise appearance only once he achieved elected office .
In his 2008 convention speech , McCain called upon his party to return to the “ party of Lincoln , Roosevelt , and Reagan . ”
In 2000 , McCain separated that same party from the party of the religious right , fatefully remarking : “ My friends , I am a Reagan Republican who will defeat Al Gore .
Unfortunately , Governor Bush is a Pat Robertson Republican who will lose to Al Gore . ”
This Reagan Republican has come around on Pat Robertson politics , volunteering to sacrifice once again for his country a piece of himself .
At the “ Civil Forum on the Presidency ” moderated by Rick Warren at Saddleback Church this past August , and on countless other occasions during the campaign , McCain has canonized one anecdote to answer every question about God , every question about faith , every inquiry about his religious devotion .
This is , of course , the tale of the dirt cross at the Hanoi Hilton .
McCain describes this period with rehearsed ( always dry - eyed ) poignancy , recounting how his commitment to The Code of Conduct left him to rot for five and half years , how trapped in solitary confinement he was allowed a minute or two outside on Christmas day , and how one guard looked him straight in the eye on that day ( that holy day ) and “ drew with his sandal a cross in the ground . ”
In recent press events , this moment in Hanoi has become his road to Damascus , the tale told to shunt rumors of irreligion .
Conversion narratives have become mandatory formulations in American politics , signaling simultaneously theological affinity with an important voting bloc as well as the character requisite to serve an executive post with populist humility .
As political scientist David S. Gutterman has observed , words of conversion feed multiple audiences :
Those who have their own conversion narrative will be able to recognize themselves in another ’s story , and those who are not saved will be hopefully seduced by the plot of the story , so that they may know themselves as chaotic and fragmented , needing only to follow the path laid bare by the narrative plot in order to experience Jesus and be made whole .
That conversion talk is so much more common in contemporary politics than it was twenty - five years ago can be paralleled with other signs of the triumphant solipsist , including the success of confessional talk shows , competitive reality programming , and the discovery that celebrities are “ just like US ! ”
Even within this din of come - to - Jesus moments , McCain ’s story is discordant , failing to supply some of the basic ingredients for a ritual confession of faith .
It includes no mention of God ( or Christ ) as an actor in his life or even in that dirt - drawn moment .
There are no searching first - person studies of his character , expelling moment of personal sin revealed , revelled , and renunciated .
His reading of the story varies , most frequently returning to it as a common text for two people seeking fellowship : “ For a brief moment , neither one of us were in Hanoi , we were just two Christians celebrating the birth of Christ together . ”
Another time : “ We stood wordlessly looking at the cross , remembering the true light of Christmas . ”
Yet another : “ I will never forget the fact that no matter where you are , no matter how difficult things are , there ’s always going to be someone of your faith and your belief and your devotion to your fellow man who will pick you up and help you out and bring you through . ”
The story , and its retread morals , has stirred a bit of predictable controversy .
Blogger Andrew Sullivan finds it bears a striking resemblance to a tale once told by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn .
There have also been intimations that McCain only added the story once he entered politics , due to its absence from his 1973 captivity narrative .
And historian John Fea has noted , aptly , that no matter the truth of the tale , it “ tells us more about the guard ’s faith than McCain’s . ”
Whatever the origin of the story , McCain ca n’t stop in the midst of this election cycle from telling it to us .
The cross may have been marked in the dirt , and McCain may indeed have been filled with a certain form of communal wonder , but is that wonder a “ Christian ” awe ?
McCain ’s unwillingness to format the story neatly into a born - again plotline may indicate his own reticence to propagate a rhetorical fraud .
In his memoir Faith of My Fathers , McCain does not describe this incident as a conversion to Christianity , but as a conversion to country , as the time when he finally understood his “ self - respect in a shared fidelity to my country . ”
The cross in the ground was a crossroads for McCain , but not from sinner to saved .
Rather it was his turn from Lt. Commander Cad to Citizen McCain .
He mentions the words “ Christian ” and “ Christianity ” rarely , but when he does , it is always — always — connected with an idea of “ America ” or “ American . ”
Consider these examples .
When Rick Warren asked what faith in Jesus means to him , McCain replied : “ Means I ’m saved and forgiven .
And when we ’re talking about the world , our faith encompasses not just the United States of America , but the world . ”
Elsewhere , in a Time magazine rendition of the dirt cross story , he comments : “ I will always remember as well the Christmas services that my fellow prisoners and I held in a cell , when I gave thanks to God for the blessings he had granted me with the company of men I had come to admire and love .
In the life of our country , faith serves the same ends that it can serve in the life of each believer , whatever creed we may possess . ”
McCain admits to a faith , and suggests that this “ faith ” has been his total “ salvation . ”
“ The only reason why I ’m here today is because I believe that a higher being has a mission for me in my life — a reason for me to be here . ”
That “ higher being ” is n’t God .
That higher being is America .
Again , after another telling of the Hanoi Hilton conversion , he proclaims : “ This is my faith , the faith that unites and never divides , the faith that bridges unbridgeable gaps in humanity .
That is my religious faith and it is the faith I want my party to serve , and the faith I hold in my country . ”
Later , in his 2008 convention speech , McCain becomes more explicit , saying that after Hanoi , “ I was n’t my own man anymore .
I was my country ’s . ”
Salvation has but one source : “ My country saved me .
My country saved me , and I cannot forget it . ”
Someone once called atheism an undetectable God. McCain ’s
God can be detected , it can be found : his God is the country for whom McCain survived .
The strident — near stunning — focus of his religious ardor has been to his nation .
You wo n’t find McCain singing Baptist hymns .
You wo n’t hear him weigh out the meaning of the Episcopal sacraments .
You wo n’t find him doing these things because he does n’t need them , nor does he ( by all public practice and proclamation ) want them .
He has all the ritual and power , holiness and community he could want .
Often McCain draws on images of Theodore Roosevelt ’s frontier as his virgin paradise , a place where men followed the strenuous life to messianic effect .
These men , the men and women who pursue such new lands and new struggles , are McCain ’s parish , and their devotion is his ritual practice .
His religion is the civil religion of America .
“ You know , ” he explained at this year ’s convention , “ I ’ve been called a maverick ; someone who marches to the beat of his own drum .
Sometimes it ’s meant as a compliment and sometimes it ’s not .
What it really means is I understand who I work for .
I do n’t work for a party .
I do n’t work for a special interest .
I do n’t work for myself .
I work for you . ”
This is the conversion of Hanoi .
The cross in the dirt is religious talk , but it is the observation of a man who cannot make religious moments of his own , so he turns to the devotions of others to derive his piety .
The real fall - on - the - knees moment is McCain ’s conversion to self - sacrifice , to his nationalist orthodoxy .
David Foster Wallace , who recently passed away , summarized this attitude with excruciating clarity in his account of McCain ’s 2000 presidential campaign :
Think about how diametrically opposed to your own self - interest getting knifed in the nuts and having fractures set without a general would be , and then about getting thrown in a cell to just lie there and hurt , which is what happened .
After a vivid portrayal of McCain ’s torture ( broken ribs , shoulder broken with a rifle butt , broken arm , teeth knocked out ) , Wallace places us in McCain ’s position :
Imagine how loudly your most basic , primal self - interest would cry out to you in that moment , and all the ways you could rationalize accepting the offer …
Would you have refused the offer ?
Could you have ?
That McCain did stay , that he did so against his obvious self - interest , in loyalty to the Code , might demonstrate , as Wallace puts it , that McCain is certifiably insane .
But we also know …
[ F ] or a proven fact , that he is capable of devotion to something other , more , than his own self - interest .
So that when he says the line in speeches now you can feel like maybe it ’s not just more candidate bullshit , that this guy it ’s maybe the truth .
Or maybe both the truth and bullshit — the man does want your vote , after all .
The man does want your vote , after all .
And so we return to where we begin .
How do we ever know the mysteries of the man ’s soul ?
And what , really , should those mysteries have to do with our political estimations ?
To declare that McCain is not Christian against his ( once rare ; now constant ) protestations to the opposite is not intended to be insubordinate to his proudly proclaimed truths .
It is merely to say that , like policy positions , religion has an evidence pool .
If a man says he supports nuclear power , we can check his voting record and decide for ourselves if the votes support that position .
If a man says he believes in God , the evidence is harder to find .
Did Jesus die for your salvation ?
We take it as a matter of faith : McCain says so , then it is so .
But for the religionist , this is a position that would garner no high marks .
Scholars wobble , constantly , between our task of understanding the material ( “ What , precisely , does the Book of Mormon say ? ” ) evaluating the material ( “ How , precisely , does this map onto broader patterns of religious behavior ? ” ) .
John McCain calls himself Christian , yet his religious worldview ( articulated in word and act ) does not map anywhere near the Episcopal Church of his childhood , nor the Baptist church of his adulthood .
Indeed , it is hard to find John McCain ’s religion without a lot of conjure , and a lot of ( dangerous , on scholarly grounds ) imagination .
Yet he has conceded to a religious mimicry , invoking ( lightly , never avowedly ) from ( what just happens to be ) the most consequential Protestant voting bloc in the Republican Party .
Contemporary culture , doped up on Daily Show smirks , is certain that all surfaces deceive , all tales are seductions , and all one - liners lie .
To be sure , honesty is not the coin of the political realm , and we may be savvy to practice a vigilant doubt .
It is tempting , then , to suggest that McCain ’s dramatic turn to religious talk in the last few months is the world ’s greatest cover - up , hiding the secret truth that this is no man of God .
Someday we may find evidence that Rove edited McCain ’s texts , that McCain resisted Palin ’s Pentecostal panache and that , all along , McCain begged that he might never again have to tell the tale of the cross and the dirt .
Or maybe , just maybe , we ’ll find diary upon diary authored by John McCain keening for Christ ’s particular grace .
Or maybe we ’ll hear stories ( from his daughters , from his sons ) of how embarrassed , how mortified he was to be such a religious monkey , how certain he was that The Code of Conduct was all he should need , and how it was that that man , that eight - year President , made him be so very evangelical in order to win back the very party that ( once upon a time , not so long ago ) made him lose a primary by calling his daughter black .
But for now , we just have this man , this testifying and freewheeling man who has made his own choices ( in word and act ) .
He is a man running hard in the hardest race of his life , a man who believes in his country , who believes he would serve it well , who believes that he is the best American for the job .
And since all Americans are assumed to be , at base , Judeo - Christian , then it is no lie at all to say that he is , at base , a good Christian man .
And so he is .
A good Christian man .
He says it , and we have to believe him .
We , the scholars .
You , the voters .
We believe him against the evidence because it feels better to believe that his life — his survival , bound and tied , long ago — is a testimony to Jesus ’ mercy .
We feel better believing that nobody would ever , or could ever , lie about loving God , or lie about loving Christ .
And despite our own schismatic compulsions ( in daily life , in sectarian divide ) , we like to believe that all denominations look the same in the dark .
Finally , we want to believe that words of faith are different than words of politics , that when a man speaks of God he is more honest , more reliable , than he is when he speaks of policy promises .
In short , we just want to believe that belief is .
That ’s what we want , and it ’s what McCain now provides .
Who among us could judge him ?
After all , it ’s not in his self - interest : it ’s in ours .
McCain plays in a theater , with a script , that we designed ( not without a little assistance from Them , from Rove and the Southern Baptist Convention and the RNC and the DNC ) .
Despite his disinterest in the subject called Jesus , he dances for our pleasure , he sings a salvation song for us , for those who he seeks — always , relentlessly , with frightening abandon , self - deception , and self - sacrifice — to serve .

Living in the Past : Perceptions of Linux
by Ostatic Staff - Oct. 13 , 2008
Free Software Magazine recently took a closer look at the " Linux legacy . "
The " legacy " -- Linux 's reputation precedes it , even in the realm of the " average user . "
This reputation is , of course , that Linux is ( pick one of your choice ) : hard , incompatible with most hardware , command line only -- the list goes on .
It 's a fitting observation , as the operating system hits its seventeenth year , that there are a great many people out there aware of Linux now who have been aware of it for some time .
And to some , Linux in 2008 seems identical to Linux in 2001 , or 1998 .
What do you say to someone who has " used Linux " or seen it in action , who , when giving reasons why it was n't for them , says something that indicates that they tried it five , seven , ten years earlier ?
It may not have been something they 'd use eight years ago , and it may not be something they 'd prefer now , even .
Really , that 's okay , that 's not the issue .
What do you say when they are telling someone else about a problem that may have been a real dealbreaker in Linux circa 2001 , but today simply no longer applies ?
I 've encountered this on a few recent occasions .
It is a difficult situation .
Why ?
Because though it may be true peripheral support has improved greatly , that Linux package management systems make other operating systems ' updaters seem painful , and that installation is n't nearly as complex as it was even three years ago ( or even necessary at all , given live distros with persistent home directories or rewriting capabilities ) , pointing these things out to the party making the outdated claim does little to convince him that things have changed .
The exchanges , in my case , have happened online .
It is particularly sticky here , as the person with the out of date viewpoint does n't have the benefit of vocal inflection or visual cues as to what 's being said , and it's far too easy to interpret " that 's no longer the case " -- however carefully worded -- as " you 're wrong . "
On the other hand , it does n't help anyone -- especially in a public forum -- to not say anything .
What I 've found works best is to point the folks with the outdated perceptions toward a few general purpose , user - friendly distributions offering liveCDs ( Puppy is always a rather nice one to offer , being that it 's a quick download but is still quite robust , includes add - ons like Flash , and offers easily configurable persistent file storage through both USB drives and CD - RWs ) .
Do they try them ?
I do n't know for certain .
I hope so .
Sometimes , though , it is less about changing the original user 's perception as much as offering a new user reading the exchange something solid to try -- and thereby reach his own conclusion .
The other effective approach is to drop any feeling of defensiveness ( and this can be rough , as you may have stated facts politely and graciously , and still get hit with colorful epiteths or had some blanket assumptions made simply because you use Linux ) and acknowledge that even with the steps forward , Linux just might not be for the right fit .
It is possible that it just really , truly is n't .
It is also possible they are n't that interested in finding out what 's changed .
In that case , I 've discovered it 's better all around to offer those still holding to the " legacy view " the option to walk away .
This ultimately saves your sanity .
Again , it may not do much for the person with the outdated information .
It does give any new users coming across the discussion not only some appropriate options to try , but the feeling that if these should n't work out , it is not a personal failing on their part , nor does it mean that they are n't welcome to pick up and try again in six months , or twelve months , or five years .
Have you encountered these " legacy perceptions " in either the real world or online ?
Why are many people 's ideas about " how Linux works " stuck in the past ?
How can distributions , and current users , not only demonstrate where we are now , but keep Linux from getting " perceptually " frozen in any particular place in time in the future ?

Apple 's taking all that new MacBook Pro love and shrinking it down to size for the all - new MacBook .
The laptop includes those same NVIDIA 9400 M graphics , Mini DisplayPort plug , new manufacturing method , backlit keyboard and fancy glass trackpad of its big sibling , but does it with a 13.3 - inch LED - backlit screen and typically friendly MacBook pricepoints .
The laptop is 0.5 pounds lighter than its plastic predecessor , 0.95 - inches thick , and Apple 's also claiming 5 hours of battery life here , but we 'll have to wait and see how realistic that number is .
The base model weighs in at $ 1299 with a 2GHz Core 2 Duo processor , while $ 1599 gets you 4GB of RAM and a 320 GB HDD .
There 's also an SSD option if you 're really looking to splurge .
If none of the new speed or style appeals to you , Apple 's also slashing its existing low - end MacBook to $ 999 , which is still a bit steep if you ask us .
Hit the jump for a breakdown of the configurations .
The devices used in two firebombings targeting UC Santa Cruz biologists are similar to some used in the past by animal rights activists , investigators said Sunday .
The bombs were so powerful they were like " Molotov cocktails on steroids , " said Santa Cruz police Capt .
Steve Clark .
One struck the home of assistant biology Professor David Feldheim on Saturday morning , forcing him to flee with his family .
The other exploded just a few minutes earlier , gutting a car parked outside the campus home of a second researcher .
Later , Santa Cruz County sheriff 's deputies went to the home of a third researcher who received a threatening telephone message , but officers found no explosives .
More than 50 investigators , including some from the FBI 's regional terrorism task force , are looking into the attacks .
Feldheim , whose townhouse was firebombed just after 5:30 a.m. , uses mice in laboratory research on brain formation .
He told The Chronicle that he and his wife , along with their 7 - year - old son and 6 - year - old daughter , had to drop a ladder from the window of a second - floor bedroom to escape after smoke filled the home 's first floor .
" Everyone is OK , " Feldheim said in an e-mail .
" The kids are taking it pretty well .
My wife and I are very shaken up .
I also injured both feet in the escape . "
Act of terrorism
Feldheim was treated at a hospital and released , police said .
Clark said the attack on Feldheim is being considered an act of terrorism and attempted murder .
Clark said the bomb at Feldheim 's house was similar to those used by animal rights extremists in the past , adding , " There are instructions on how to make it on their Web sites . "
Feldheim and the unidentified faculty member who received the threatening message were named on pamphlets that were left on a stack of newspapers in a downtown Santa Cruz coffee shop last Tuesday , Clark said .
The unsigned pamphlets at Caffe Pergolesi , which printed 13 researchers ' pictures and addresses , called them murderers and torturers and said , " Animal abusers everywhere beware . "
The name of the researcher whose car was bombed was not on the pamphlets , Clark said .
The attacks may mark an escalation in a series of protests against UC researchers that prompted a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to issue a temporary restraining order against three animal rights groups in February .
In January , a Molotov cocktail exploded on a UCLA researcher 's porch .
A month later , six people in masks tried to force their way into the home of a UC Santa Cruz researcher and hit her husband on the head , police said .
And at UC Berkeley , officials said 24 animal researchers and seven staffers have been harassed in recent months , with some homes and cars vandalized .
Clark said authorities are offering security to UC Santa Cruz animal researchers and have contacted every person named on the pamphlet , whether or not they were involved in animal testing .
He said investigators were combing the Internet to see if anyone would take credit for the attacks .
But as of Sunday , no one had .
" It 's one thing to be an activist , it 's another to be an extremist , " Clark said .
" It 's absolutely outrageous that you would bring this kind of an attack to a family , all because of your passion over this cause .
To me , it 's indicative of people who have a complete inability to articulate their point in a constructive manner . "
UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal condemned the bombings as " criminal acts of anti-science violence . "
A different view was expressed today by Jerry Vlasak , a Los Angeles spokesman for the North American Animal Liberation Press Office , which often posts on its
Web site communiques from activists taking credit for attacks .
He said the benefit of animal research does not justify its expense or the exploitation of animals .
Vlasak said the bombers likely were not trying to hurt Feldheim , but were instead " trying to send a message to this guy , who wo n't listen to reason , that if he does n't stop hurting animals , more drastic measures will be taken ... it 's certainly not an initial tactic , but a tactic of last resort . "
Feldheim , whose work includes introducing genes into living mouse brains , said Sunday that his research " is aimed at understanding how brain connections form during development , with special focus on the visual system . "
He said the work is important " so we can learn how to fix these connections after damage due to injury or disease . "
Sunday afternoon , Feldheim 's front door and concrete patio in a complex of townhouses on Village Circle remained blackened by flames and smoke .
A neighbor said that residents , who are mostly faculty and students , awoke to the sound of an alarm .
" I feel bad that anyone would take that drastic a step to harm people , " said Miriam Ting , a Santa Cruz pharmacist .
No answer
Just a few blocks away , no one answered the door at the brown faculty townhouse where the car had been firebombed , and a biology professor listed as living there did not respond to an e-mail .
His driveway was still charred ; the car was no longer there .
" It 's a threat to everyone who lives here , " said David Anthony , a history professor whose home is attached to the one where the car was firebombed .
Feldheim described a frightening escape .
When the bomb exploded near his front door , he said , his family was awakened by the sound of smoke detectors .
" The downstairs was so smoky that we could not see , " said Feldheim .
" My wife and children all escaped out of the bedroom window using a fire - escape ladder .
A neighbor and then the Fire Department came and put out the fire . "
Feldheim said his home had been vandalized last year , with " hateful messages " written in chalk on the sidewalk outside , trash strewn about and some flower planters broken .
The university responded by paying for an alarm system and motion - sensitive lights , he said .
" I 'm not sure what we 'll do in the future , " Feldheim said .
A handful of scraps of charred wood and a little pile of stone chips - finds from the first excavation at Stonehenge in more than 40 years - have added thousands of years to the history of one of the world 's most famous prehistoric monuments .
There was no gold or bronze , but to the archaeologists who led the excavation , Professors Tim Darvill and Geoffrey Wainwright , the unlovely heap of finds is real treasure .
They are convinced the stone chips are evidence of belief in the healing power of the " bluestones " brought 150 miles from south Wales , which endured long after the monument was thought to have been abandoned .
The magical bluestone , spotted dolerite which when newly quarried is a dark blue speckled with brilliant white stars of quartz , made Stonehenge into the Lourdes of prehistoric Europe , they believe , or as Darvill put it yesterday , " the accident and emergency unit of southern England " .
The charcoal fragments also add haunting new evidence to the Stonehenge story .
Darvill and Wainwright revealed yesterday , at the Society of Antiquaries in London , that the earliest has been dated to 7,000BC , and the most recent to medieval times , suggesting that the site was already important 4,000 years before the oldest stone circle , and continued to draw visitors for centuries after it was believed to have been abandoned .
Although they concede Stonehenge was probably " multifunctional " , possibly also serving as a giant calendar marking the solstices , as well as a site of ancestor worship , they are convinced its true importance came from the modest bluestones , the size of a man or smaller , dwarfed by the awesome sarsens .
Two of the original bluestones were broken , many chipped into fragments , and some survive only as stumps underground after being broken up to serve as healing talismans .
Organic remains , including a few specks of grain and seed , have allowed secure dating for the first time of the bluestone circle : around 2,300 BC , three centuries later than previously thought .
The stones were repeatedly moved and rearranged , and the enormous sarsen trilithons added , before the final outer circle of sarsen uprights and lintels was created around 1,900 BC , creating the world - famous profile of the monument .
Although the double - decker bus height sarsens are undoubtedly the most impressive , Darvill and Wainwright believe they were essentially an architectural framework for the bluestones , just as towering medieval cathedrals grew over the shrines of saints .
The stone comes from only one place , an outcrop of the Preseli hills near Wainwright 's home in Pembrokeshire .
The crags are full of springs , many still regarded as healing holy wells , and ancient decorated stones prove they were important from prehistoric times .
Their theory , which they said yesterday was borne out by their excavation results , was that they were brought to Stonehenge by stupendous human effort because of the belief in their healing power .
They completely dismiss the rival theory that the stones were carried by glaciers .
" The one tiny flaw in the theory is that there is absolutely no evidence for glaciation of Wiltshire , " Wainwright said .
By re-examining old records they have now found evidence of chips of bluestone buried with many bodies in the Stonehenge area - including that of the Amesbury Archer , one of the richest finds in decades , who died around 2,300 BC - and they believe further research will uncover many more .
Bluestone fragments have also been found at other monuments , including the summit of nearby Silbury Hill .
Many of the bodies bear the marks of horrible illness or injury , supporting the theory that they came to Stonehenge in futile search of a cure or at least respite from excruciating pain .
The Archer , whose grave was found in 2002 just three miles from Stonehenge , came like the much younger man buried near him - who may have been a son or nephew - from modern Switzerland .
The skeleton suggests he spent years in agony from a shattered kneecap , and may eventually have died poisoned by an abscess which rotted a hole through his jaw .
Archaeologists had believed that by the time the Romans arrived in Britain , Stonehenge was just a towering enigma , its ritual importance entirely forgotten .
The latest finds imply a much more complex story : they include a Roman coin among stone fragments , suggesting the Romans also believed in and sought out the healing magic .
The later charcoal deposits suggest to Darvill and Wainwright annual gatherings , perhaps for feasting and ceremony at the winter solstice , continuing as late as the 17th century .
The modern - day druids and pagans who assemble bearing green boughs for the winter and summer solstices may not be so far off the mark after all .
The last excavation at Stonehenge was in 1964 .
Although in April Darvill and Wainwright only won permission from English Heritage for a trench the size of a large hearthrug - " a little piece of keyhole surgery " as Darvill described it - it was the first excavation at which the whole armoury of modern scientific archaeology could be fired .
" This is very much work in progress , " Wainwright said yesterday .
" There are more surprises to come , I 'm sure of that . "
Next season they will be back in Preseli , looking for more evidence of ritual practice at the home of the bluestones .
" I 'm sure we 'll find the Welsh architect of Stonehenge yet , " Wainwright said .
The excavation was funded by BBC Timewatch and Smithsonian Networks and a documentary on the findings will be screened on BBC2 at 8 pm on Saturday .
Theories
The 20th - century archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes said each generation " has the Stonehenge it deserves - or desires " .
These are some of the explanations for one of the most spectacular monuments of the ancient world .
· Geoffrey of Monmouth , 12th - century historian , said giants originally brought the stones from Africa to Ireland , where they were used for healing , and then Merlin brought them to Britain .
· John Aubrey , 17th - century antiquary , discovered the row of barely visible pits now named after him , which possibly held the first wooden posts , and believed the structure was a druid temple .
· John Wood the Elder , 18th - century architect , carried out the first accurate survey of Stonehenge in 1740 , which directly influenced his designs for the Circus in Bath .
· William Stukeley , 18th - century antiquary , working with the astronomer Edmund Halley , said Stonehenge was completed in 460BC , and was aligned with magnetic north .
· Joseph Norman Lockyer , scientist and astronomer , suggested in 1906 that Stonehenge was a giant astronomical observatory .
· Gerald Hawkins , British astronomer , suggested in 1966 , in Stonehenge Decoded , that the monument was a prehistoric computer , capable of complex predictions of planetary alignments and eclipses .
· This article was amended on Wednesday September 24 2008 .
Our geology was awry in the article above about Stonehenge .
The bluestones at the site are spotted dolerite , a blue - grey igneous rock , not dolomite , which is a sedimentary rock resembling limestone .
This has been corrected .
Since 9/11 , we 've been constantly warned that another terror attack on the U.S. is inevitable .
But there have n't been any bombs .
Why ?
Some of it is due to improved surveillance , security , and information - sharing , you 've got to assume .
Some of its is because there are so many other places to wage jihad – like Iraq and Afghanistan .
But another big reason why there has n't been another strike on America may be that terrorists hate to commute to work .
" Most terrorists live close to their selected targets , " a new National Institute of Justice report finds .
" According to our analysis , almost half ( 44 percent ) of all terrorists examined lived within 30 miles of their targets . "
And that 's good news for local law enforcement .
Not only are the militants in the neighborhood .
But they spend time in the area , ramping up for the big attack .
Which gives cops a chance to catch 'em , notes the report , spotted by Drew Conway .

スティーブ・ウォズニアク対談レポート 対談の模様 8月21 日 開催
IDF 2008最終日のスペシャルイベントには 、Apple創業者の1人スティーブ・ウォズニアク氏が登場した。同氏は、Apple I、Apple IIの設計者であり、著名なエンジニアである。もちろん、米国を代表する企業であるAppleの創業者ということでも有名で、米国では一般的な知名度も高い。 今回も昨年と同じくNPR( National Public Radio ) で 、Tech Nation 、BioTech Nationのホストであ るMoira Gunn博士がインタビュー役を務めた。本来は、インタビュワー形式なのだが、聞き役のGunn博士の進行があまり上手ではなく、話が前後したこともあり、全体を編集してのレポートとさせていただく。(以下 敬称略 ) ●お金が少ない方がうまくいく スティーブ・ウォズニアク氏 エンジニアの本質とは、という質問に対してウォズニアクは、「ロジックを考えたり、電子がどう動くかを考えるなどいろいろなことがあって、非常に頭脳的な努力が必要で、すべてがうまく機能するように考える必要がある。いろいろなチップを入れたらどうだろう、というだけではダメで、細かいところも含めて、たとえば、電圧は合っているかなども調べて、細かいところにも気を配らねばならない。ただ、私のアプローチは、ほかの人とは違う。他人に見せても違っていると言われる。なにかをするのに非常にコンパクトにやることが多い。私は、常にいいエンジニアでありたいと考えている」。 さまざまな開発に関しては 「 お金は、少しぐらい足りないほうがいい。そのほうが、いろいろな『トリック』が出てくるから。トリックというのは頭の中に浮かぶ、本にないような工夫のこと。他人のやったとこでなく、そのアーキテクチャを理解して覚えたり、さまざまなものを記憶していると、突然、アイディアが浮かぶ。これとこれをつないでみたらいいんじゃないか、といったようなこと。お金が足りない方がいろいろな工夫をしてその結果、いいものになるのだと思う。私は、Apple II の200ページのマニュアルも自分で書きました。当時は、ほかの人に書いて貰ったりすることはできませんでしたから。それから基本ソフトウェアも自分で書かねばなりませんでした。BASICも最初のものは自分で作りました。これは大学で学んだりしたわけではなくて、言語のマニュアルを見て、構造を自分で考えました 」 。 ウォズニアク氏は、ハードウェアだけでなくてソフトウェアも自分で作った点で、賞賛されることがある。特に、最初のApple IIのROMソフトウェアは、機械語モニタ、16bit CPUエミュレータなどを含む高機能なものが、2KBというコンパクトなサイズにまとめられている。
コンピュータのデザインについては「成功したコンピュータのデザインは、リーダーが明確な方向を示すことができる小さなグループで行なわれた。最もいい考えは、小さいグループの中に生まれる。これは、あなたたちが、多くの従業員を抱えるGoogleやMicrosoftのような大企業よりもうまくできることを意味している。私は幸運にも、Appleに競って入社しようとする多くの人たちがいなかったので、いろいろなことを言われずに仕事ができました」。
コンピュータとの出会いは「高校生のときには、父のようにエンジニアになろうと考えていました。当時は、電子回路がエンジニアの扱うもので、電子技術を学ぶ学校に行きました。もちろん、PCを作ることになるとは思ってもいませんでしたが、コンピュータやデジタル技術は好きでした。あるとき、スモールコンピュータハンドブックというミニコンピュータについて書かれた本を見つけました。これで、私は、コンピュータを理解したのです。尊敬する人を挙げろといわれれば、この本の著者でしょうか」と述べた。 この本はおそら くDoug Coward氏 の「 The Small Computer Handbook 」( '66) ではないかと思われる。これは、PDP-8などの初期のミニコンピュータについての書籍である。
その後、ウォズニアク氏は、スタンフォード大学のリニアックセンター(高エネルギー物理の実験施設)にある図書館に頻繁に通い、コンピュータのマニュアルや雑誌などを集め始めたという。
● Appleとウォズニアク またジョブズ氏 がAppleを一度去ったことについては 「 不誠実だと思ったが、今では戻ってきてくれたことがうれしいし、それに世界を変えるようなデバイスを作っています。いつでも彼は望む人になることができるし、私は、そのために1人のエンジニアになることを望んでいます。ジョブズは、シェークスピアとかアインシュタインのように100年以上も有名であり続ける偉大な人になることを夢見ていました。いつだって、私は、彼が売ることを望むコンピュータを作ります。その4番目のものはApple IIでした 」 。 Apple IIが4番目というのは、おそらく大学時代に作ったBlueBox(電話のタダ掛け装置)と、ジョブズ氏がATARIにいたときに手伝ったBreakOutゲームマシン(ジョブズ氏は、部品数削減を命じられ、ウォズニアク氏にこれを依頼した)、そしてApple Iを数えてのことだと思われる。このとき、ウォズニアク氏は、HPに在籍していたが、ジョブズ氏の説得もあって、会社を辞めることになる。実際には、Apple Iを作ったときに会社の上司やジョブズ氏が勤めていたATARIの上司にもApple Iを見せたのだが、どちらも製品を理解できず、それぞれの会社がApple Iを製造することはなかった。前述の「お金は足りないほうがいい」は、ときにこのApple Iのときのことを指しているのだと思われる。2人は、車や高価なプログラミング電卓を売って、材料を購入して、Apple Iをガレージで作っていたという。 「 私は、社員番号が1番で、Appleが始まってからずっと、組織図の一番下にいました。ときどき、私はApple
Storeに買い物に行きます。それで社員割引を頼みます。すると、店員が社員番号は何番って聞くんです。そのときに1番だよって答えます。それで、マスコミの人にいいたいのだけど、私は、iPhoneを買ったときには割り込みしませんでしたよ。それから、いつも社員割引で製品を買いますが、25%引きで、決してタダで貰うことはありません」。
これについては、iPhoneの発売時にウォズニアク氏がセグウェイに乗って、Appleストアにやってきたこと、そして列の先頭を譲られて、買っていたという報道に対してのものだ。
Intelアーキテクチャへの移行については、「 私は 、 AppleへのIntelチップの採用は、いいと思っていました。特に低消費電力のアーキテクチャが我々のノートブックにぴったりで、これでかっこいいノートブックPCを作ることができると思いました。多くの人は、これに狼狽しましたが、これは正しい判断だっと思います。あのとき、IBMは、我々よりもソニーのゲームマシンのほうが重要で、我々の望むプロセッサを作ってはくれなかったからです」。
●名前を変えて大学へ再入学 聞き役を務め たMoira Gunn博士 '85年に名前を変えてカルフォルニア大学バークレー校に再入学したことについては、「子供にお父さんは、ちゃんと大学を卒業した」ということを話したかったからだという。また、最近では、ボランティアで子供にコンピュータについて教えている。これは、学校の先生と違って、先に進む必要がなく、きちんと教えることができるのだという。
教育については「私の父は、これをしなければならないという押し付けはなかった。トランジスタはどうやって動くの聞けば、電子の動きから化学的なことなど、細かいステップで教えてくれた。何かを理解できないのは、一度に入る情報が多すぎるからで、細かくステップを踏んで、段々と教えれば誰でもちゃんと理解できます。たとえば、スプレッドシートがうまく扱えないというのは、なんとなく理解しているけど、細かくステップを踏んで理解していないからだと思います。私の父は、良い価値観をたくさん教えてくれました」と述べた。
ウォズニアク氏は、セイモア・クレイ氏やジーン・アムダール氏といったコンピュータ業界の偉人たちと、肩を並べるほど高く評価する人もおり、特にハードウェア、ソフトウェアの設計と実装を1人で行なったApple IIのデザインのすばらしさはいまでも賞賛されることが多い。
今回のイベントは内容的には少し散漫だったが、「開発は少しぐらい予算が足りないほうがいろいろ工夫していいものができる」、「小さなグループから成功したコンピュータシステムができた」といった知見などにはなるほどとうなずけるものがあった。

For as long as anyone could remember , there had always been two server rooms : the Cool Room and the Hot Room .
The Cool Room was exactly what you ’d expect a server room at a mid-sized technology services firm to be : floor - to - ceiling racks along the walls filled with various servers , battery backups , monitors , and KVMs , all tied together with Ethernet and power cables that were neatly tucked in their trays .
And , of course , it was a cool 65 °F thanks to a pair of dedicated air conditioning units .
The Hot Room , on the other hand , was more like a server closet .
It was a cramped 8 ’ by 10 ’ room that housed core telecommunications equipment including the firewalls , routers , switches , VPN concentrators , and the PBX system .
This room also served as the central hub for the facility ’s wiring and had hundreds of cat5 cable running through countless junction boxes .
And , of course , it was a sweltering 98 °F thanks to all of the equipment that had become even hotter to the touch .
Ted , who had recently joined the firm as an IT Director , was a bit uncomfortable with this setup .
Not only did the Hot Room house nearly half a million dollars worth of gear , but if any one of the core components – such as the core router or PBX – failed from overheating , it would be a business catastrophe .
He asked Aaron , the network operations manager , for some more background .
“ Believe you me , ” Aaron explained , clearly used to answering the what ’s - up - with - the - Hot - Room question , “ we ’ve tried for years to get this resolved .
What it comes down to , quite simply , is cost .
One - hundred and seventy - eight thousand dollars .
Even the CTO could n’t get that amount approved . ”
“ But , ” Ted instinctually questioned , “ would n’t it cost more than — ”
“ Cost more than in an outage , you mean ? ” Aaron interrupted , “ yeah , it could .
But , then again , it might not .
They ’re willing to risk it , I guess . ”
“ Okay , ” Ted paused for a moment , “ ca n’t you just move – ”
“ Move the equipment upstairs to the Cool Room ? ” Aaron interrupted again , finishing Ted ’s sentence , “ we ’ve already moved what we could .
But with everything terminating here , the switches and routers have to stay . ”
That made some sense .
Ted pondered the problem for another few seconds and then asked , “ how about a portable or duct– ? ”
“ Ductless A/C ? ” Aaron jumped in , “ the problem with those – or the portables – is we ’ve got no place to vent or drain .
So , if we went that route , it ’d just be easier to place a few units on the roof .
Plus , the portables are all fairly limited when it comes to BTU . ”
Ted could n’t think of any more ideas off the top of his head .
Since the Hot Room had n’t overheated once over the past few years , he felt safe knowing that it probably would n’t overheat in the next few weeks .
That ’d give him plenty of time to come up with a solution that cost less $ 178,000 .
The next day , Ted stopped by their building ’s maintenance office to see if the superintendent could help come up with a creative way to duct some cool air in the Hot Room without breaking the bank .
Within the hour , the superintendent met Ted in the lobby and they walked over to the Hot Room .
“ So we ’ve got a bunch of telcom stuff in here , ” Ted explained while he unlocked the door .
A gust of warm air greeted both Ted and the super when the door opened .
“ I ’m worried that some of it will over – ”
“ Jeeze oh man ! ” the superintendent exasperated , “ it ’s pretty toasty in here .
Hang on a sec . ”
The super walked down the hall , rifling through a ring of keys , and disappeared around the corner .
About sixty seconds later , a blast of cold air came pouring through the ceiling vents .
Ted looked up at the ceiling and could n’t help but stare in awe .
“ Yep , that ’ll do it , ” the superintendent said when he returned a few moments later , “ you had a tripped breaker on the VAV box .
Hope it was n’t bothering you for too long . ”
By the end of the day , it was a nice 65 °F in the Hot Room .

As ailing Wachovia Corp. waits to see whether it will be acquired by Wells Fargo & Co. or Citigroup Inc. -- possibly with taxpayers paying the tab for hundreds of billions of dollars in bad loans -- some of the company ’s top brokers are preparing to depart Saturday for an all - expenses - paid cruise of the Greek Isles .
The weeklong trip for up to 75 employees of brokerage A.G. Edwards , which Wachovia acquired last year for nearly $ 7 billion , will also include spouses and significant others , said Teresa Dougherty , a Wachovia spokeswoman .
“ This is one way that we recognize our top financial advisors , ” she said .
Word of the Wachovia junket follows reports that senior executives of troubled insurance giant AIG attended a $ 440,000 company retreat last month at Southern California ’s swanky St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach just days after being bailed out with $ 85 billion in taxpayer funds .

A White House spokeswoman Wednesday called the AIG outing “ despicable . ”
Yet even as the Bush administration was wagging its finger at AIG , the Federal Reserve was announcing $ 37.8 billion in additional loans for the company .
Moreover , a spokesman for American International Group said the company was going ahead with plans to host a three - day confab for about 150 insurance brokers at the Ritz - Carlton Resort in Half Moon Bay next week .
About 50 AIG employees also will attend .
“ This is an annual affair , ” said AIG ’s Joe Norton .
“ It ’s a key meeting . ”
Such five - star shindigs have long been a standard practice for the U.S. financial industry .
They serve as incentives and rewards for top performers , and as regular get - togethers for senior execs .

But the gatherings raise ethical questions at a time when many institutions are turning to taxpayers to cover their bad mortgage bets , and when millions of Americans are tightening their belts .
“ It ’s clear that these executives do n’t get it , ” said Stephen Conroy , an associate professor of economics at the University of San Diego who focuses on business ethics .
“ These are the same excesses that got them where they are today . ”
Conroy acknowledged that companies still need to recognize their biggest moneymakers during hard times , and that such events are typically scheduled months in advance .
But he said the only prudent thing to do when a company faces troubles like AIG or Wachovia does is to behave with some humility .
“ Some expenses are clearly valid , ” he said .
“ But things like the Ritz - Carlton are hard to justify . ”

As I reported Wednesday , AIG spent more than $ 440,000 wining and dining salespeople and company managers at the St. Regis .
The bill included nearly $ 200,000 for rooms , $ 150,000 for meals , $ 23,000 in spa charges and almost $ 7,000 for golf outings .
Responding to outrage over the wingding , AIG said the company ’s CEO , Edward Liddy , sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson explaining the nature of the event .
Liddy was quoted as saying that AIG was “ reevaluating the costs of all aspects of our operations in light of the new circumstances in which we are all operating . ”
Be that as it may , AIG ’s Norton said next week ’s Ritz - Carlton retreat would proceed as planned .
He said the event would introduce new insurance products to salespeople who specialize in wealthy clients .
Norton declined to provide a price tag for the event .
A Ritz - Carlton spokeswoman also declined to comment .

The hotel ’s website describes the facility as “ an elite golf and spa resort ” where guests can “ enjoy soothing coastal breezes and captivating ocean views , ” and “ estate - style accommodations . ”
Rates vary from $ 399 a night for a run -of - the - mill room to more than $ 1,000 for a suite .
In other words , just the place to bask in what ’s now more than $ 100 billion in taxpayer cash pouring down on AIG .
In Wachovia ’s case , the company declined to say what cruise line the Edwards workers would be taking or what islands they would be visiting .
Dougherty called the cruise a “ recognition trip ” and said such things “ are common practices around brokerage firms . ”

Wachovia agreed last week to be purchased by Citi for about $ 2 billion .
Under terms of the deal , Citi said it would assume the first $ 42 billion in losses related to Wachovia ’s stinkiest mortgages , and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. would shoulder all losses above that amount -- possibly as much as $ 270 billion .
Days later , though , Wells Fargo stepped in with a $ 15 - billion offer that would n’t include taxpayer funds .
Citi and Wells then unleashed their lawyers on each another .
A compromise was expected to be reached by Wednesday .
The two sides now say they ’ll try to cook something up by Friday .
Sounds like stressful work .
What these guys need is a little vacation .

How did the actions of subprime mortgage borrowers in the US affect global financial markets and lead to the ongoing liquidity crisis – and will the resulting fallout hurt the wider economy ?
Here ’s a cool interactive explanation of the credit squeeze from FinancialTimes.com .
The following is an excerpt from Winter Soldier Iraq and Afghanistan : Eyewitness Accounts of the Occupations by Iraq Veterans Against the War and Aaron Glantz .
From March 13 - 16 , hundreds of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans gathered in Silver Spring , Md. , to testify about atrocities they had personally committed or witnessed while deployed .
Among those who testified was former National Guardsman Christopher Arendt .
He served a tour at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
I would like to share with you how one goes about becoming a concentration camp guard without ever having really made many decisions .
I was 17 years old when I joined the Army National Guard in Michigan .
I was living with friends .
I decided to join the military Nov. 20 , 2001 , because I had no other options .
My family was poor , I was poor , and I wanted to go to school .
I was promised a significant amount of money for this purpose , which I have yet to receive .
I was in the field artillery , Charlie 1st of the 119th Field Artillery , where I served , quite happily , for no .
That ’s a lie .
I was miserable ; I hated it , but I served nonetheless .
We got orders in October 2003 that we would be deploying to Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
Artillerymen would be deploying to Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , to be prison guards .
During our one - month mobilization process , we were taught how to put shackles on other people .
It feels ridiculous when you are practicing how to put shackles on another human being .
You realize how absurd it is .
You ’re putting them on somebody ’s hands , and it ’s awkward .
It hurts , it ’s uncomfortable , and it feels dehumanizing .
This is just practice .
This is just to warm - up for the big game .
We left for Guantánamo Bay early in January 2004 .
It was hot .
It was uncomfortable .
We slept in awful little houses , but at least we had houses .
I served on the blocks for two months as a prison guard .
My duties were to feed detainees and dispense toilet paper .
I occupied myself in some way , shape , or form to drive the boredom out .
The primary difficulty in keeping my humanity intact was the boredom .
One of the ways I dealt with this was by talking with the detainees .
A consequence of having detainees is that they are human beings and also have stories .
I talked with them about those stories , which led to my being taken off the blocks .
I was sent to work in the Detention Operations Center as the escort control for the last eight months of my tour .
I managed the movements of every detainee in Camp Delta .
I did this on 12 - to - 14 - hour shifts and rotated with a very small crew of other specialists .
I was 19 at the time .
Papers , numbers , shackles , and keys .
All of that had to be accounted for , but it was n’t anything more than papers , numbers , shackles , and keys .
I ’d call two people in , usually outranking me , and I ’d have to tell them to do something that they hated doing .
And they hated me for telling them to do it .
That ’s the nature of the machine .
We ’re just chips in a Plinko machine .
Orders come down from God knows who or where .
They just keep coming down .
There are two specific things I will address about the operation at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
One is the issue of torture .
I ’ve heard a lot of speculation as to what torture is .
I would like to ask everyone to consider whether living in a cell for five years , away from your family and friends , without ever being given answers as to why you ’re there , whether this is torture .
Having to ask 19 - year - old boys who do n’t have any idea about the policies of their government why they are detained and the answers that we were n’t able to give  I consider that torture .
But if that was n’t enough , we had other methods to make certain we got around to torturing these people .
I dispatched the detainee movements .
I would come into the office at 4:30 in the morning and there would sometimes be a little paper in the wall with a number on it , which represented a detainee inside of an interrogation room .
The temperature of the interrogation room was maybe 10 or 20 degrees , with loud music playing .
Sometimes that detainee would stay there for my entire 12 - to - 14 - hour shift .
He was shackled to the floor by his hands and his feet , with nothing to sit on , loud music playing , in the freezing cold .
I guess that ’s torture ; that depends on who you ask .
I hear there is an official list of things that are and are not torture .
Waterboarding is torture .
My recent example is not .
I ca n’t believe a human being could even write a list like that .
The other issue I would like to address is the common usage of the Quick Reaction Force , which is a rotating , five - man team established each morning .
If a detainee is unsatisfied with his stay and becomes rowdy , five grown men are fitted with riot gear and lined up outside of a cell while the platoon leader of that camp sprays the detainee in the face with pepper spray .
I was sprayed with pepper spray once , and I feel that ’s one of the worst moments in my life .
It put me on my knees for two to three hours afterwards , and in a great deal of pain for the next three days .
I would never , ever want anyone to have this happen to them .
After spraying the detainee , these five men would rush in and take whatever opportunities they could .
The standard operating procedures do not state that you should beat the sh*t out of detainees , but I guess that some people just decided that ’s what they were going to do anyway .
These are all on tape , by the way .
The government makes sure that each one of these operations is taped .
I taped several of them , and I would be happy to show you those clips , but I doubt they will be released anytime soon .
After the detainee is taken forcibly from his cell  that ’s probably the first time that he ’s left his cell in five , six , seven days  the detainees are beaten , pulled out to the back , shaved , all of their hair , their beard , and then taken to wherever they were supposed to go .
There was one other thing I wanted to address , about the use of the term " detainee . "
We were told it had to be detainee .
It had to be detainee .
If it ’s a prisoner , then they are a prisoner of war , and subject to entirely different laws .
If they ’re detainees , they ’re subject to no law whatsoever , because there are n’t laws for detainees .
Because they are called detainees , they do n’t get trials and there is no code for how they ’re treated .
It ’s semantics , and we need to pay attention to those ; they ’re important .
It ’s the difference between calling something a detention facility and a concentration camp , even if they ’re the same thing .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - An American Airlines flight made an emergency landing and was evacuated in Los Angeles on Tuesday after smoke was detected in the cabin .
There were no injuries among the 188 passengers and six crew members on the Boeing 757 , said Tim Smith , spokesman for AMR Corp , American ’s parent company .
Flight 31 from Los Angeles to Honolulu departed at 8:48 a.m. PDT ( 11:48 a.m. EDT ) and returned because of “ smoke or haze ” in the cabin , Smith said .
He noted that there was no sign of fire .
The plane was evacuated using the four slides that are packed into the doors of the aircraft .
Smith said he did not know why the slides were used in this evacuation , adding the procedure is “ fairly uncommon . ”
The landing was normal , and passengers were bussed to the terminal .
Smith said it was unclear what had caused the smoke in the cabin .
He said the plane , made by Boeing Co , would be taken out of service for an investigation .
New vehicle prices are falling at the fastest rate ever recorded , a team of analysts said Thursday , squeezing automakers ’ profit margins at a time of slumping sales but also setting the stage for a sales rebound once the economy improves .
Two JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts , auto analyst Himanshu Patel and economic analyst Marc Levinson , said in a research report that the average price of a new vehicle in the second quarter fell 2.3 % from the year - earlier period to $ 25,632 .
That ’s the steepest drop recorded in the bank ’s 41 - year - old survey , the analysts said .
The price drop comes as automakers are already coping with mounting losses and declining sales .
Carmakers are shifting away from trucks and sport utility vehicles , which command high profit margins , toward manufacturing smaller cars , which are less profitable .
Although vehicle sales are expected to remain weak in the near term , the analysts said , the price decline is leading to better affordability and could translate into a big recovery for auto sales by the second half of 2009 .

“ If the labor market begins to improve in the second half of 2009 . . . buyers returning to the vehicle market may find the costs of owning a new vehicle to be unusually attractive , ” Patel and Levinson wrote .
The analysts attributed the decline in average price to two factors .
First , demand among buyers has shifted from trucks to less - expensive smaller cars because of high gas prices , they said .
Truck - based vehicles such as pickups , minivans and SUVs accounted for less than half of all sales in the second quarter for the first time since 2001 , they said .
Second , drivers are trading down within both the car and light - truck categories to cheaper , more fuel - efficient models , they said .
“ Vehicles have become much more affordable to average consumers , ” Patel and Levinson wrote .
Aug. 13 , 2008  -- ExxonMobil CEO and chairman Rex Tillerson defended his company 's staggering $ 11.7 billion in profits for the second quarter , saying that the company 's earnings reflected the magnitude of its business operation .
" I saw someone characterize our profits the other day in terms of $ 1,400 in profit per second .
Well , they also need to understand we paid $ 4,000 a second in taxes , and we spent $ 15,000 a second in cost , " Tillerson told ABC News ' Charles Gibson .
" We spend $ 1 billion a day just running our business .
So this is a business where large numbers are just characteristic of it . "
ExxonMobil earned the best quarterly profit ever for a corporation , up 14 percent from last year but still below investors ' expectations .
While Wall Street was slightly disappointed by Exxon 's earnings , some Americans were outraged by what they saw as big oil profiting at their expense .
Tillerson recognized that consumers are angry about the escalating price of gas .
" I can understand why people are very upset and why they 're very worried and concerned about their ability to deal with these high prices , " Tillerson said .
" It does bother me that much of that is directed at us .
Our job is to provide energy , to provide it in a means that is reliable .
And we hope we can provide it in a means that 's convenient as well to the consumer . "
When asked whether he agreed with Phil Gramm , Sen . John McCain 's former economic adviser , who labeled America as a " nation of whiners , " Tillerson said he empathizes with American consumers .
" I do n't think there 's any question that if these prices -- $ 3.50 , $ 4 a gallon for gasoline -- and the follow - through effects on the cost of electricity [ are ] causing a lot of problems for a lot of Americans .
...
Their budgets just are very difficult for them to accommodate this . "
Supply and Demand
But Tillerson also said that the combination of new technology on the supply side and energy efficiency on the demand side will make gas more affordable for the average American .
" What we can do is add new supply and to provide means for people to use the energy more efficiently , which will help reduce demand , " Tillerson said .
" And that 's what we 're spending a lot of our effort doing , is working on both sides of the demand equation and the supply equation . "
Tillerson 's suggestions for energy efficiency echoed recommendations by presumptive Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama , who called for tire - inflation and proper car tuneups to provide relief to distressed voters .
" Things like providing lighter weight tires , tires that retain their pressure more efficiently , lighter weight plastics to go into vehicles to reduce vehicle weight " will help consumers use gas more efficiently , according to Tillerson .
Energy has been center stage on the campaign trail , with both Democrat and Republican sides attacking one another 's proposals and calling for energy independence .
But Tillerson added that energy independence is " not realistic for the United States or almost any other country . "
" I 'm not sure that it 's even desirable for the United States to pursue that as a goal , " he said .
" Our country 's economy is so interdependent with the rest of the world in so many areas of , not just commodities , but capital markets .
...
So I 'm not sure why we would view energy any differently than the way we view the rest of our economy . "
' No One Solution '
When asked about the fragility of the global market to geopolitical developments across the world , especially in oil - rich nations such as Saudi Arabia , Tillerson suggested that energy diversity provides security .
" I think the response to that is to have as many diverse supplies of energy as possible .
And that means both in terms of geographic diversity .
You want to expose yourself or certainly have access for the American people to as many different geographic sources of supply as possible .
So the disruption in one area does not leave you ... hostage to any one area . "
Last week , Obama called to " end the age of oil in our time , " claiming that the United States could produce enough renewable energy to replace all U.S. imports of oil within 10 years .
But Tillerson said that " it 's going to be very challenging to achieve that goal , in that period of time .
And again , so much of the energy issue that the United States deals with and the world deals with , people I think do not have an appreciation for the lead times that are required . "
As for John McCain 's solution to " drill now , drill here , " Tillerson said that instead we should focus on both efficiency and drilling .
" We can't drill our way out of this problem , just like we can't conserve our way out of this problem , just like we can't alternative fuels our way out of this problem , " he said .
" There is no one solution to this ; there 's an integrative set of solutions .
And you have to undertake them all .
So when the whole debate focuses around we have to choose this one solution or that , people are missing the point . "
Tillerson stressed that energy policy is bigger than any one candidate , and " for people or policymakers to pick one as being the winner is really shortsighted , " he said .
Policy must instead be a comprehensive , long - term approach .
" And that does get to the question of are we doing everything here at home that we could be doing .
And I think most people have come to the realization that , for many , many years , the United States has not fully developed its own natural resources . "
The Next Generation
Instead of focusing on independence , Americans " should be developing , again , all the supply sources and all the options that we can develop in a way that 's efficient and is going to provide energy at a cost that Americans can afford . "
Tillerson sees ExxonMobil as more than an oil company -- more of an energy company that provides natural gas and coal while exploring alternative , renewable fuels and nuclear power .
He said that the company is investing $ 100 million in a pilot plan to examine a new technology that can separate CO2 from gas streams .
" For ExxonMobil to make a meaningful difference , we 've really got to find a way to change those technologies to provide those alternative forms of energy on a much larger scale and at a cost that people can afford , " Tillerson said .
" It does n't do the consumer a lot of good to substitute an alternative fuel that costs $ 5 for gasoline that costs $ 4 . "
Tillerson explained that the percentage of funds invested in alternative energy does not compare to the amount invested in stock buybacks for company shareholders , because " we have n't found an alternative to invest in that makes a lot of sense for us . "
ExxonMobil invested $ 12.5 billion , a record amount of capital into exploration expenditures , in the first half of 2008 .
But 55 percent of their profits go to stock buyback .
" Where we need to be 20 , 30 , 50 years down the road is to continue to be the most efficient producer and most environmentally responsible producer of oil and natural gas , to develop the next generation -- which is not available today -- the next generation of replacement fuels for the future . "
An investigation sparked by a suspicious death at an upscale senior living facility in Calabasas has expanded to include the alleged abuse of three more elderly residents , including a 78 - year - old woman who was allegedly body - slammed into her bed , according to court records and interviews .
Keith Stubbs said he was told by authorities that a caregiver at Silverado Senior Living rousted his sleeping mother out of bed by “ jumping on her chest . ”
When she tried to defend herself , “ he picked her up W.W.F.- style and slammed her onto the bed , ” Stubbs said , describing a popular move in televised World Wrestling Entertainment matches .
The Stubbs family and two others learned last week that their elderly loved ones were allegedly abused by former Silverado caregiver Cesar Ulloa .
Stubbs said his mother suffers from a brain condition that left her unable to speak , “ which makes her the perfect victim , ” he said .
Ulloa was arrested Oct. 2 after a nearly yearlong investigation into the death of 80 - year - old Silverado resident Elmore Kittower , whose body was exhumed after an anonymous whistle - blower told authorities Kittower was beaten by a staff member minutes before he died .

An autopsy report released last week revealed that Kittower died of a blood clot in his lung .
But the document also cited “ blunt force trauma ” as a contributing factor in his death .
The report noted that Kittower ’s body was covered in bruises and had partly healed rib fractures that appeared to have happened within a month of his death .
Ulloa , a 20 - year - old Reseda resident , was charged with four counts of elder abuse and one count of torture when he was arraigned last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court .
He pleaded not guilty .
In addition to Kittower and Stubbs , Ulloa is accused of abusing Richard McDonough and Robert Turner , an 83 - year - old retired Northrop Grumman employee who has dementia and is in the early stages of Alzheimer ’s disease , according to a family member .
McDonough ’s family could not be reached for comment .

Turner ’s nephew , Richard Skowronek , said authorities did n’t go into detail about what was allegedly done to his uncle , other than that “ he was punched in the stomach . ”
He said he and his wife were “ dumbfounded ” that such an assault could occur in a “ top - notch ” facility such as Silverado .
“ I feel that in search of the almighty buck , they brought in some folks they did n’t check out real carefully , ” he said in a telephone interview from his home in Georgia .
Mark Mostow , a spokesman for Silverado , said the company adheres to a “ strict and stringent ” screening process for potential employees , including criminal - record checks , drug tests and reference checks .
He said all employees go through an elder - abuse reporting program conducted by the California Department of Justice .
Advertisement
“ We follow what ’s required by state law and we go above and beyond that , ” Mostow said .
He added that Ulloa , who was fired from Silverado last year , charmed the families of many of his patients .
“ He had a very friendly and outgoing demeanor that people were attracted to , ” Mostow said .
“ They wanted him around . ”
Keith Stubbs said it was about two years ago , before Ulloa even started working at Silverado , that he and family members first started noticing bruises on his mother ’s arms and neck .
Advertisement
When family members asked about the injuries , Stubbs said they were told his mother was clumsy and sometimes combative with other residents of the hillside facility .
On one occasion , Stubbs recalled , “ they said she fell down and hit a wheelchair with her neck . ”
Stubbs said he was concerned , but never suspicious .
Silverado ’s resort - like atmosphere and the seemingly caring , professional demeanor of its staff instilled confidence that his mother was in good hands .
That feeling of confidence gave way to one of outrage and betrayal last week when he was told about Ulloa ’s alleged assault on his mother .
He said it was devastating to think that his mother may have been abused but was unable to complain because she could n’t speak .
“ You do n’t know where she is mentally inside that shell she ’s in , ” said Stubbs , a mortgage banker from Ventura County .
Advertisement
Looking back , he said he should have suspected something was wrong when his mother became withdrawn , recoiling from the touch of even loved ones who entered the room .
He said his mother ’s change in behavior coincided with the time Ulloa worked at the facility .
“ She started to act like a wounded animal , ” he said .
“ But when she finally found out who you were , she did n’t want to let you go . ”
Stubbs and Skowronek said they were considering removing their family members from Silverado despite assurances that steps had been taken to guard against any future abuses .
Sgt. Bill Cotter of the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department homicide unit declined to discuss any of the allegations against Ulloa in detail .
He did not dispute any of the accounts by family members .

Cotter said investigators are still trying to determine the identity of the whistle - blower in the case .
He asked that anyone with information about that person or with information about the alleged assaults call detectives at ( 323 ) 890-5500 .

“ There are three kinds of lies : lies , damned lies , and statistics . ”
- Mark Twain
There is no question that the current $ 700 billion USA Housing Motherland Bailout is the biggest story going around .
The magnitude of the bailout has quelled other big stories that would have been the day ’s topic du jour .
For example , Ambac and MBIA were once again put under the microscope given the events going on in the markets .
Over the weekend , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , the last two independent investment banks have changed their stripes .
The big investment bank model has come to a fitting close .
On the radio I heard someone say , “ all those Harvard undergrads are going to have to change their majors . ”
Indeed .
At the heart of this mess is the housing market .
That wonderful housing bubble that sucked a vast majority of our country into a spending orgy once only found in Vegas casinos .
Who would have thought that there truly was a one ARM bandit ?
The entire financial edifice came inches away from “ melting down ” or so the talking heads would like you to believe .
Maybe it came close to melting down for Wall Street but there are many people that are currently unemployed or living on the edge that the system has already melted down .
The initial bailout bill pushed by Hank Paulson was for free reign , a check with no blue ink dripping from it for bailing out Wall Street .
Not a good way to ask for nearly $ 1 trillion .
King Paulson this weekend ran into a hitch .
As it turns out , there may need to be a bit of oversight for that $ 700 billion bailout .
I ’ve only heard a few folks in the late stages of delusion on the intertubes or teletubes have the gall to say , “ in fact , we may actually turn a profit here ! ”
Comments like that go in the file cabinet next to Alan Greenspan saying in Feburary of 2004 ,
“ American consumers might benefit if lenders provided greater mortgage product alternatives to the traditional fixed - rate mortgage . ”
Thanks Alan !
They took your advice and things turned out superb .
Any more words of wisdom you ’d like to impart with us ?
Before we examine the California housing market , let us look at some of the new requested provisions for the bailout :
( a) Executive compensation restrictions
( b) Regulation with accountability
( c) Mortgage cram - downs in bankruptcy court
(d) Equity sharing
Frankly , these should have been in the bill from the beginning .
The initial 3 page skeleton from comrade Paulson looked like one of those napkin deals you do with a drunken buddy .
In fact , it was amazing in simplicity and lacked any depth but provided incredible power .
Someone must of thought they found , “ my precious . ”
It is as if you wrote a bill saying , “ as of this moment , I give [ insert name of l33t U.S. Treasury dude ] total power to take all my money , spend it how they like , and never be held accountable for their actions . ”
Here is the 44 page bill that has a little bit more substance that came out today .
When you elect someone because you feel comfortable to have a drink with them , do n’t get mad when you get them unequivocally supporting back of the napkin solutions to the biggest financial crisis the world has ever witnessed .
The nuts and bolts are still being worked out .
I was thinking about the initial plan and maybe thought it was a basic strategy of negotiation .
How so ?
Well first , there is no way in the world that people would be willing support a $ 700 billion bailout if most of the benefit was going to go to banks and Wall Street with such little substance .
Look at how long the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 took to get passed .
So instead , they throw out a plan that had zero chance of passing just to get the political capital to actually move the bill .
Now , we hear about basic regulations , oversight , and standards and the public almost wants to jump up and cheer and sign the bill .
It ’s as if you were selling your home and I told you , “ yes , I really like your property so let me offer you a good starting point .
How about $ 1 ? ”
At first you ’d probably flip out but what if in my next move I offer you slightly less than what you initially wanted ?
“ Okay , I ’ll give you $ 200,000 . ”
Of course anything sounds better than the first offensive offer .
In fact , it may even seem generous .
That is where we are at in the negotiation process .
California Housing – Motherland Bailout Distracts
If it was n’t for the almighty bailout chatter , we ’d be talking about the absolutely pathetic numbers coming out of California .
Last week the unemployment numbers for the state came out and they were abysmal :
The California unemployment rate is increasing at a rapid pace hitting its highest peak in 12 years .
Currently , the state unemployment rate is at 7.7 % which stands in stark contrast to August of 2007 data which only puts the number at 5.5 % .
How can the rate skyrocket so quickly ?
Easy .
A large part of the state was highly dependent on the housing market so the one year crash has essentially exposed the economy of the state .
The state also has had one of the most contentious budget battles of all time .
We broke the record in terms of how long we went without a budget .
The current budget which has yet to be finalized looks like a flat out joke and capitulation just to move something through but we ’ll be back here again next year .
Think about it .
Unemployment is surging and housing prices are dropping like a rock and a high amount of revenues come from both of these streams .
So do you think we are going to bring in more money next year ?
I think we are at the point where housing prices are accelerating even faster simply because of the overall economic condition .
First , let us look at statewide sales first :
You need to remember that July and August are the strongest months of the year and these numbers are weak .
The California housing market like most markets relies on a strong spring and summer season to carry them over a typically slower fall and winter .
We just got a horrific start and now given the USA Motherland bailout more focus is on reassuring the country as opposed to one single state .
46 % of all sales in the state last month were foreclosure re-sales .
You want to see how quickly prices fall when a bubble pops ?
Take a look at this chart :
So as late as of May of 2007 , the median price was $ 484,000 according to DataQuick .
The current median price ?
$ 301,000 .
I also wrote an article on how divergent different price measures were during the bubble but now that things are crashing , prices on the low end are starting to converge .
In fact , the peak price from the California Association of Realtors had the median price at $ 597,640 !
So if we are to use the bottom price from DataQuick of $ 301,000 for August of 2008 and the peak price from April of 2007 from the C.A.R. the median price for a California home is now down 49.6 % .
The state has now seen a near 50 % correction in one year .
Stunning .
What is even more unreal is that $ 301,000 is actually too high for certain areas in the state .
The more troubling sign is the onslaught of bad properties hitting the market .
Let us take a look at some market data for August of 2008 :
California
Total homes sold : 37,988
Notice of Defaults : 44,278
Notice of Trustee Sale : 24,241
REO : 33,205
What is troubling is the amount of Notice of Defaults that do end up in foreclosure :
“ ( DQNews )
Of the homeowners in default , an estimated 22 percent emerge from the foreclosure process by bringing their payments current , refinancing , or selling the home and paying off what they owe .
A year ago it was about 52 percent .
The increased portion of homes lost to foreclosure reflects the slow real estate market , as well as the number of homes bought during the height of the market with multiple - loan financing , which makes ‘ work - outs ’ difficult . ”
Basically 80 % of the 44,278 will lose their home .
That is 35,422 .
The rate was for July so I imagine we are now probably looking at 85 to 90 percent of NODs going to foreclosure .
Take a look at the sale number for the best month of the year .
We did n’t even include the actual REOs and Notice of Trustee Sales in this number !
Overall , the distress action in California for August was at 101,724 and made up 33 percent of all foreclosure filings for the entire country !
In fact if you add the 4 states of California , Florida , Arizona , and Nevada you get 56 % of all foreclosure filings !
I remember getting e-mails from people out of the state claiming that a decline in California will have little impact on the country .
It was contained .
Bwahaha !
Where have we heard that before ?
California is a freaking monstrous state in size and economic pull .
We also had the biggest financial bubble .
Much of the circus lending from Wall Street found its home here .
There are still $ 500 billion in toxic Pay Option ARM mortgages that have yet to recast with $ 300 billion here in the state .
If you are not from California , would you like to see some of your tax money bailout a Real Home of Genius ?

Even though Congress has growled loudly enough to get Internet service providers to back off their plans to sell information about their customers ’
Web surfing to advertising companies , one prominent legal expert argues that the law governing the issue should still be made tougher .
The issue was examined in a new paper , “ The Rise and Fall of Invasive ISP Surveillance ” , by Paul Ohm , a former Justice Department official who now is a professor of law at the University of Colorado .
Mr. Ohm argues that the prospect of Internet service providers using new technology to monitor what their customers do online is a grave threat to privacy .
Because ISPs pose such a high risk of terrible harm to so many people , and because of the unmistakable signs that things are getting worse , they must be regulated .
For now , Internet providers in the United States have put on hold plans to sell customer surfing information to ad companies .
Several congressional committees held hearings on the topic , providing a forum for a number of senators and House members to indicate their displeasure at the concept .
Indeed , NebuAd , the company that was behind most of the advertising systems set to be used by Internet providers in the United States , has in effect put that business on hold .
Robert Dykes , its chief executive , quit to become chief financial officer of VeriFone .
( Phorm , which is working with big Internet providers in the United Kingdom , says it is plowing ahead with a test with 10,000 customers of BT .
But its plans have been subject to delays and questions about an earlier trial with BT that was not disclosed to customers . )
Mr. Ohm argues that the regulatory issues are still relevant because the Internet providers still have a strong incentive to seek money from advertisers to supplement their monthly fees .
The Electronic Communication Privacy
Act , a 1986 law originally meant to keep telephone companies from listening to the calls of their customers , probably applies to some of these Internet monitoring schemes , Mr. Ohm writes .
If a court determined that the browsing history of an Internet user represents the “ contents of communication , ” it could be construed as wiretapping , he wrote .
Wiretapping , under the law , is a felony and also is a cause for civil action .
Even if a list of sites visited is n’t called content , he argues the companies still fall under another part of the act that bans the collection of “ pen register ” information , the list of phone numbers called by a given line , and other data used for the routing of communications .
Using that data , other than for a few specified purposes , is only a misdemeanor , however , and cannot be the basis of a civil lawsuit .
When I reached Mr. Ohm on the phone Friday , he said he was surprised that Internet providers had proceeded as far as they have with plans for these advertising systems .
“ If I were a lawyer for an I.S.P. , you have to err on the side of avoiding this sort of massive liability , ” he said .
Nontheless , Mr. Ohm argues that the law is overly complex and ambiguous , and should be clarified .
His article proposes simplifying the overall structure :
The new unified law should regulate all monitoring — without distinguishing between whether the monitoring is of content or not — provided it is monitoring of data “ of or pertaining to a user , customer , or subscriber . ”
He wants to make clear that Internet providers would be allowed to monitor customers to protect themselves , such as to track down a hacker .
But that exception would need to be related to a specific incident .
Routine and automated monitoring of customers , beyond the minimum needed to operate a network , would be banned .
Finally Mr. Ohm wants to make it much harder for customers to waive their protections by consenting to some boilerplate agreement .
Internet users would need to authorize the monitoring of their surfing each time they use the Internet , under the standard he proposes .
Mr. Ohm said he is much more concerned with Internet service providers than with other Web companies , such as Google .
Web sites , he said , have the ability to describe what they are doing with customer data on every page , although they may object to doing so .
Consumers do n’t really interact explicitly with their Internet providers once they set up a connection .
Moreover , Internet providers have an unusually broad view of what customers read , buy , watch and listen to .
“ Google does n’t know what I do when I ’m on MSN , ” he said .

This page explains how to move the Control key .
Some users find that this can help to avoid “ Emacs pinky ” ( RepeatedStrainInjury ) .
But note that some users find that doing this causes Emacs pinky because you ’re extending your left pinky to hit Ctrl all the time .
Better to keep the standard layout and press the Ctrl keys on either side of the keyboard with either the tip of your pinky ( fan out your fingers and rotate your wrist toward the center of your body ) , your pinky fingernail ( curl it under ) or the knuckle at the base of the pinky ( open your hand and slam it down ) .
Get used to them all ; the first word in RepeatedStrainInjury is Repeated .
Introduction
For some , swapping Control and CapsLock is very important ; the virtually useless CapsLock is far easier to press than Control , crucial to Emacs yet really awkwardly located .
When Emacs was first written , most keyboards had Ctrl to the left of A , either immediately to the left or with CapsLock in between .
Thus , it was a convenient and logical choice of key for creating Emacs commands .
When personal computers went mainstream in the 80’s , Ctrl was moved out of the way , presumably because the target users ( office workers ) would n’t need Ctrl as often as CapsLock .
GNU / Linux
Note that separate keyboard mappings are often used for X ( graphical sessions ) and for virtual consoles .
( On Debian , you may be able to use / etc / default / keyboard file for both . )
GNOME Desktop Environment
This setting is in the GNOME Tweak Tool .
On the “ Typing ” tab , find the “ Ctrl key position ” setting and select “ Swap Ctrl and Caps Lock ” or “ Caps Lock as Ctrl ” ; the latter is also available under “ Caps Lock key behavior ” as “ Make Caps Lock an additional Ctrl ” .
KDE Desktop Environment
In KDE 4.x there ’s a “ Keyboard Layout ” dialog in the Systems settings that allow you to modify the Caps Lock behavior .
First be sure to allow KDE to control keyboard layouts .
Do this by selecting “ Enable keyboard layouts ” here :
Then turn on the desired options and press the apply button :
X ( using xmodmap )
In the X Windowing System you can use xmodmap ( 1 ) to change the keymaping .
Some desktop environments , like Gnome and KDE , which use X , have specialized preference menus to make this easier .
The advantage of using xmodmap is that it will work with any desktop or Window Manager .
See the man page command xmodmap ( 1x ) for more information .
I swap their functions throughout my environment , not just for Emacs .
On Unix - like systems , I have a ~/.xmodmap file :
! ! Swap Caps_Lock and Control_L ! remove Lock = Caps_Lock remove Control = Control_L keysym Control_L = Caps_Lock keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L add Lock = Caps_Lock add Control = Control_L
which is sourced from my ~/.xsession with the line :
xmodmap ~/.xmodmap
X ( using xkb )
In the X Window System , you can also swap Control and Caps Lock with the xkb option ctrl : swapcaps .
If you do n’t ever need Caps Lock you can instead of swapping the two set Caps Lock to be another Control .
This is done with ctrl:nocaps .
Use one of these from command line :
setxkbmap -option ctrl : swapcaps # Swap Left Control and Caps Lock setxkbmap - option ctrl : nocaps # Make Caps Lock a Control key
Note that the above will change your keyboard layout to a us keyboard layout .
If it is not a US keyboard layout , you need to add a switch with your layout , like :
setxkbmap - layout gb - option ctrl : nocaps # Caps Lock is Control on a GB keyboard
If you do n’t know your keyboard layout name , I think it is always the second value inside the xkb_symbols include line if you setxkbmap - print , so this command should preserve it for you :
setxkbmap - layout " $( setxkbmap - print | awk - F + '/ xkb_symbols / {print $ 2} ' ) " - option ctrl : nocaps
On 2015/03/16 , dumbl3d0re said : “ This have never occured for me .
Does n’t happen for me on Debian 8 - current . ”
You can put this command in your ~/.xsession , ~/.gnomerc or whatever .
If you can edit the X configuration file , you might do it system - wide : Section " InputDevice " Driver " keyboard " Option " XkbRules " [...]
Option " XkbOptions " " ctrl : nocaps " If above setting does not work , try this one ( nowadays Xorg prefers ) : Section " InputClass " Identifier " Keyboard Setting " MatchIsKeyboard " yes " Option " XkbOptions " " ctrl : swapcaps " EndSection In Fedora 15 you can also add a file ~/.Xkbmap that contains command line arguments to setxkbmap .
These will be used when you next log in .
- option ctrl : swapcaps
The CapsKey page has an example of moving Ctrl to Caps .
Virtual consoles
This is not the same as a terminal running in a window under X !
It is the text - only mode typically accessed by pressing Ctrl + Alt +F1 - F6 .
Generic GNU / Linux Virtual Console ( any distribution )
Note : while these instructions should work under any distribution of GNU / Linux , you may wish to use a distribution - specific method which may be simpler .
Press Ctrl - Alt - F1 to enter the first virtual console .
Now run :
$ sudo dumpkeys | head - 1 > /usr/ share/keymaps/Caps2Ctrl.map
Then add the following lines to that file :
keycode 58 = Control
# This makes Caps act as Ctrl # keycode 29 = Caps_Lock
# This makes Ctrl act as Caps # alt_is_meta # This fixes the Alt key
Then run loadkeys on that file :
$ sudo loadkeys /usr / share / keymaps / Caps2Ctrl.map
To revert , run :
$ sudo loadkeys -d #load default keymap file
For more extensive editing try :
$ dumpkeys > my_keymap $ cp my_keymap trial_keymap $ edit trial_keymap $ sudo loadkeys trial_keymap
$ man keymaps
It should be noted that using numeric notation for the keysyms is highly unportable as the key action numbers
To find out what keysyms there are available for use in keymaps files , use the command
dumpkeys -- long - info
Unfortunately , there is currently no description of what each symbol does .
It has to be guessed from the name or figured out from the kernel sources .
On Debian and derivatives ( Ubuntu , Mint etc . )
To make Caps Lock another Ctrl key , edit the file / etc / default / keyboard and change the line which reads
XKBOPTIONS= " "
to
XKBOPTIONS= " ctrl : nocaps " # Some people prefer " ctrl : swapcaps "
and then run :
$ sudo dpkg - reconfigure - phigh console - setup
On 2020/03/28 , Aju said : “ Linux Mint 19.3 Tricia x86_64 Cinnamon 4.4.8 running the dpkg - reconfigure command did not change things for me but logging out and logging back in did . ”
On Gentoo Linux
For i386 systems , to make Caps Lock another control : In /etc / conf.d/ keymaps set
KEYMAP= " emacs "
Then run # / etc / init.d / keymaps restart ( or reboot ) .
See /usr / share / keymaps/i386/qwerty/emacs.map.gz for more information .
On Slackware GNU / Linux
Similar to Gentoo , you can add Caps Lock as another control key :
As super -user :
$ loadkeys emacs $ echo " loadkeys emacs " >>
/etc/rc.d/rc.local
NetBSD console
To /etc/wscons.conf add :
mapfile /usr / share/ wscons/keymaps/pckbd.c2c
then create the file /usr / share / wscons/ keymaps / pckbd.c2c with the single line :
keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
This can also be tested immediately ( does n’t require reboot ) and temporarily ( wo n’t survive a reboot ) with : wsconsctl - w map +=“ keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L ”
OS X
Open System Preferences → Keyboard and choose Modifier Keys :
Then select which of the four modifier keys should send Control :
The variable ‘ mac - command - modifier ’ can be used to interpret the Command key as an additional Control .
This can be useful for Linux - like behavior when Caps Lock has already been remapped to Command .
In Emacs 22 ( Carbon Port , CVS version ) you can use the variable ‘ mac - control - modifier ’ to remap the Control key .
Microsoft Windows
Ctrl2cap
The easiest way to achieve this in Microsoft Windows is to install the Sysinternals program Ctrl2cap .
Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools
Use remapkey . exe from Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools to remap windows keyboard layout .
AutoHotkey
On Windows you can use the AutoHotkey program which uses “ scripts ” to remap the keyboard .
This section describes how to swap Control and CapsLock , but with AutoHotKey it is also possible to use Space both as Space and Control .
See Using space bar as both space and control below .
This method has a couple benefits .
One is scripts can be compiled to a stand alone .exe file which can be executed on a machine that does n’t have AutoHotkey .
Another is , the key re-mapping can be set to only apply in emacs ; the caps lock key will behave normaly in every other program .
( If that ’s what you want . )
To remap the Caps Lock key to Ctrl save the following to a file named script.ahk .
Then execute the script with AutoHotKey by double clicking it .
See the AHK2EXE documentation to learn how to make scripts into stand alone executables .
# IfWinActive emacs + Capslock : : Capslock Capslock : : Control # IfWinActive
The original Caps Lock behavior is here mapped to Shift + Caps Lock .
If you want the caps lock to be the control key everywhere remove the lines that begin with “ # IfWinActive ” .
If you want this AHK script to remain in effect across windows restarts place the script in your startup folder .
See the startup section of the AHK FAQ for more specific directions .
Here is a exe of the AutoHotKey script , so you do n’t have to download autohotkey itself .
( Note these programs map right control to caps lock . )
The script : http://www.cs.umb.edu/~wimiller/stuff/caps2ctrl.exe
The source : http://www.cs.umb.edu/~wimiller/stuff/caps2ctrl.ahk
Using Return Key as Ctrl
Another recommendation is to use the return key as Ctrl when it is held down .
This makes pressing keys on the left side of the keyboard in conjunction with Ctrl a lot easier .
If another key is pressed while the Return key is pressed , the return key acts as a Ctrl .
If the Return key is pressed and released alone then it acts as the Return .
More details , an AutoHotKey script , and a compiled exe to do the above can be found here .
Registry
Applies across all user accounts .
Requires Administrator access to write to the registry .
More info here : http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq-w32/Swap-CapsLock-and-Control.html#Swap-CapsLock-and-Control
NoCaps
REGEDIT4 [ HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
\S YSTEM \C urrentControlSet \ C ontrol \ K eyboard Layout ] " Scancode Map " =hex :00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,02,00,00,00,1d,00,3a,00,00,00,00,00

REGEDIT4 [ HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
\S YSTEM \C urrentControlSet \ C ontrol \ K eyboard Layout ] " Scancode Map " =hex :00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,03,00,00,00,1d,00,3a,00,3a,00,1d,00,00,00,00,00
This can also be done by manually editing the registry to accomplish the same thing , see [ 1 ] for an explanation .
To undo the changes , you can just delete the Scancode Map value , or run a .reg script with the following :
REGEDIT4 [ HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
\S YSTEM \C urrentControlSet \ C ontrol \ K eyboard Layout ] " Scancode Map " =-
Note : the Synaptics touchpad driver for Windows reads the unmodified scancodes while ‘ PalmTouch ’ is active , so if you switch Ctrl and Capslock you will also have to turn off PalmTouch if you want to send ‘ Ctrl - Taps ’ using the touchpad .
You can instead make similar changes to [ HKEY_CURRENT_USER \K eyboard Layout ] which makes the change for just the current user only .
Keymap
There is a small piece of software called keymap which modifies the registry .
KeyMapper
It seems that keymap .exe does not work on Windows 7 .
KeyMapper ( http://code.google.com/p/keymapper/) works fine .
SharpKeys
SharpKeys works like Keymap and KeyMapper as it will modify the registry for you , and it is know to work with Windows 8 .
In Lisp ?
I know this is fairly simple to do for emacs only , but I ’ve never looked into how exactly , and Lisp is not my forte .
Anyone ?
That is doubtful .
I am able to get the xorg under Cygwin on windows to switch the keys via a command line argument to xwin .
Surely then it should be possible to patch emacs to do this at least at the source level .
Anyone ?
Also , what do you mean by “ last method ? ” I do n’t see a method on here that does n’t require Administrator access .
I ’d love to know one .
I think that when you run emacs through cygwin , it uses its own x server .
When you give a command lin e switch to remap keys , you are effectively doing it across all of your X server .
It just happens that your X server is only running emacs .
As far as I know , X does not allow per-application custom keybindings .
EmacsW32 , with w32 - enable - caps - lock set to nil , reads that key as < capslock > .
It should be possible to tell Emacs to treat it as a control .
( define - key function - key - map [ ( capslock ) ] ‘ event - apply - control - modifier ) gets close .
PowerToys Keyboard Manager
PowerToys Keyboard Manager for Windows 10 does not work with WSL and Windows Terminal as of August 2020 .
With the most straight forward configuration , you can tell it is not working because holding the remapped caps lock key causes the region to activate and deactivate continually .
Android
When using a Bluetooth hardware keyboard attached to a android tablet or phone you might consider changing the SHIFT key also to CTRL .
To do this Android wide , you need to have root access obviously .
Open a console and gain root access with :
$ su
Then remount / system and change the desired keys in / system / usr / keymaps with the editor of your choice , e.g. nano :
# mount -o rw , remount / system # nano / system / usr / keylayout / Generic.kl
Again Key 58 is the SHIFT key .
Set it to CTRL_LEFT for instance .
Save the file and restart your tablet / phone .
Another method
Files placed in / system will be replaced during an Android system update .
Instead of overwriting the Generic.kl file , you can copy it as / data / system / devices / keylayout/Vendor_XXXX_Product_XXXX.kl and make the appropriate changes in that file .
You can find out the Vendor and Product id of your external keyboard by running
cat / proc / bus / input / devices
Your keyboard ’s info should appear .
Ensure that the created .kl file , as well as any directory you create to place it in , has the appropriate permissions i.e. the keylayout file should not be world - writable , or Android will not load it .
Using space bar as both space and control
An alternative to moving the control key , to avoid Emacs pinky , is to use the space bar as both space and control .
If you press the space bar alone , it inserts a space .
If you press it together with another key , it acts as a control key .
You can achieve this by using at - home - modifier in X ( Linux only ) .
And for MS Windows , AutoHotKey with BigCtrl script .
And for Mac , keyremap4macbook .
This is not limited to ctrl – shift , alt , or any other keys can be pressed with thumbs .
See also the following Japanese keyboard section .
History :
This trick was invented by K. Kimura in 2001 , and has been known as “ SandS ” , standing for “ Space and Shift ” ( the original idea was to use the space as shift ) to some users in Japan .
See the README of at - home - modifier for the full history .
Japanese keyboard
Yet another alternative to moving the control key , to avoid Emacs pinky , is to use Japanese keyboard .
Japanese keyboard ( Wikipedia article ) has many keys that you can press with thumbs , to which you can bind modifiers .
For example , the bottom row of Japanese keyboard can work as [ alt ] [ shift ] [ ctrl ] [ shift ] [ alt ] and [ Esc ] [ Bs ] [ Space ] [ Enter ] [ Tab ] , all pressed by thumbs , by using “ at - home - modifier ” or AutoHotKey mentioned in the previous section .
For experiences with Emacs and particular keyboards , see GoodKeyboards and Wiki: ErgonomicKeyboard ( keyboards , pedals , etc. )
Foot switch
Another option is to use FootSwitches for Control key and other frequently used keys .
For example I use two Usb pedals : one for Ctrl key , the other for Shift key , Shift + Space is bound to RET , and CapsLock for Backspace .

Keyboard and no admin privileges in MS Windows
Install AutoHotKey to a folder in your user account .
Or , get a programmable keyboard such as Topre ’s Realforce 87U , which is sold at elitekeyboards.com .
It features a DIP switch setting for swapping the control and caps lock keys , and includes a keypuller and replacement keys so that the labeling will also be correct .
Though made by the same company that produces the Happy Hacking keyboards recommended on the GoodKeyboards page , the Realforce is a much more traditional PC keyboard and the one I most prefer to use with Emacs .
– Tuffy
Another keyboard is the WASD keyboards .
They have a switch that allows you to control whether the Caps Lock key is a control or standard caps lock .
– Elias
You could also make your own keyboard and hardware mappings , there is a libre keyboard design at http://www.key64.org/
which have been designed for emacs users in mind , it ’s design is ergonomic so is very comfortable to type with .

Not too long ago , Marc Fleury went public with his newest venture , an open source home automation " project " ( not yet officially a company ) called OpenRemote .
Marc describes it as " an open community in the Home Automation or Domotics space " , that " promote [s ] open standards , open collaboration , and open implementations in the field . "
Fleury continues to stress that what makes OpenRemote different from other home automation systems you may have seen is that it focuses solely on the software aspect of things .
To help users who want to use the OpenRemote system in their own home , he and the community at OpenRemote have published a Bill of Materials and many other references to assist in the design , construction and implementation process .
You can sign up and join the conversations in the forums to get involved , or just learn a bit more about the system at the official website .

Sunflowers : A Fuel of the Future ?
September 12th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Sunflowers are already used for oil production and to make biodiesel — now scientists want to look into their viability as ethanol producers in the state of Georgia and beyond .
Over the next few years , University of Georgia scholar Steve Knapp will study silverleaf and Algodones dune sunflowers , both of which are woody - stemmed species that grow as tall as 21 feet .
The species have the ability to produce significant amounts of cellulosic biomass , which can be converted into ethanol .
But both the silverleaf and Algodones dune sunflowers are wild species , and domestication takes time .
Knapp plans to tackle the problem by studying each of the sunflower ’s 40,000 to 50,000 genes to determine what they control in the plant .
Obviously , this is an undertaking that could take years .
However , Knapp does have plentiful funding to get him started — he has received $ 1.2 million from the US Department of Agriculture and the Department of Defense , $ 500,000 from seed companies , and $ 400,000 from the USDA Plant Genome program .
Whether or not the sunflowers emerges as a serious contender in the ethanol race remains to be seen , but its commercial use could easily provide some extra income to Georgia farmers .

Temporarily
Modified Paulson Proposal Is A Disgrace
The modified Paulson bill is so full of holes and toothless provisions it is a disgrace to suggest it is close to being ready for a vote .
Most importantly , th
Fox Oversees Henhouse
New Proposal Cedes Congressional Authority To The Administration
Paulson , or whoever the next Treasury Secretary is , can buy whatever he wants , at whatever price he wants
Why should Congress give such authority to anyone at any time ?
If you vote for this Bailout Bill I will vote against you .
If you vote for this bill I will contribute my time , energy and money to your opponent , whoever that may be .
Please scrap the Paulson proposal in entirety and try something that might work , that is constitutional , and does not put taxpayer money at risk .
In her interview with CNBC Monday and in comments to other news organizations , Clinton did not refer to the Home program in reacting to the Treasury plan , but did say that “ part of what needs to go into the proposal is the authority for mortgage modifications . ”
Watch Clinton 's interview on CNBC at left .
Based on that interview and comments made to to other news organizations Monday , it was not entiirely clear that Clinton was proposing a different , additional programfor loan modification .
When CNBC.com sought clarification on that point Tuesday , her office said the senator was unavailable and referred to a lengthy statement on the economic crisis on the senator 's Website .
The statements refers to her calls for " creating a new version of the Home Owners ’ Loan Corporation ( HOLC ) to remove bad mortgage debt from the market and restore confidence , " and her introduction of " the Mortgage Refinancing Initiative of 2008 , which would provide an opportunity for at - risk households to refinance unworkable mortgages . "
Pollock says the $ 300 billion allocated is enough to “ make a meaningful start , " and is equivalent to 15 percent of the $ 2 trillion in existing subprime and Alt - A mortgage debt .
More broadly , it ’s odd that the plan has n’t figured much , if at all , into the overall debate .
You would think Paulson , who once again Tuesday called the housing correction “ the root cause ” of the credit crisis , would have reminded Congress of the government 's commitment in deflecting criticism about the shortcomings of the Bush administration ’s plan .
At the same time , you would think that Congressional Democrats and others at the first of two public hearings would have called for the need to supplement the Hope program , amend it or tie it in some way to the current crisis legislation .
( Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , oddly enough , was the one person who mentioned the program by name — in an answer to a question about foreclosure protection — and that was very late in the day .
The near vaccum of sorts begs the question as to whether the program and its broader legislative parent have been forgotten in the heat of the crisis .
“ It ’s possible , " says Jackabovics .

" I 'm out of ink .
Feed me . "
That was what my Brother 640 CW multifunction printer demanded recently .
I checked and there was still enough fluid in its cartridge for goodness knows how many more pages .
I examined all three allegedly empty cartridges -- cyan , yellow , and magenta .
From the top to bottom , they measured 1 1/8 inches .
There was still roughly 1/4 inch of fluid at the bottom of each one .
That 's about a fifth of the cartridge 's capacity , so my loss in ink was roughly $ 2.25 per cartridge .
That 's not exactly big bucks , but enough to make me feel like I was being scammed .
( Oh , right , what printing manufacturer would do that , eh ? )
I was fuming .
Brother Says : Oh , That 's Normal
I used my pull and fired a note off to Brother 's PR person .
My question was simple :
Is there a mechanical reason to leave fluid in the cartridge ?
Brother 's rep had a logical answer , of course .
Here it is , verbatim -- make sure to slip on a pair of hip boots so you do n't get splattered with anything .
" First , we would like to assure you that Brother stands behind our product and the information disclosure that we provide to the consumer .
It is always our policy to provide such information to consumers to help them understand both the product and the conditions under which the product operates .
" To address your specific question regarding ink volume , the rated yield for each cartridge follows the industry standard of that period which was based on 5 % page coverage .
So regardless of what small ink volume you may see remaining in an ink cartridge when it needs to be replaced , we guarantee that the ink volume that was provided and ' used ' meets this industry standard calculation .
Any additional ink volume left in a cartridge at that time was not put into the rated yield calculation that is guaranteed by Brother .
" Importantly , there is a technical and performance reason for why the small amount of ink is remaining in a cartridge that is identified as ' empty . '
As mentioned in the User Manual , 'even though the machine informs you that an ink cartridge is empty , there will be a small amount of ink remaining in the ink cartridge .
It is necessary to keep some ink in the ink cartridge to prevent air from drying out and damaging the print head assembly . '
By doing so , the machine is protected and consistent print quality is ensured to satisfy the consumer .
In effect , remaining ink should not be viewed as waste , but as Brother 's affirmative action to provide ongoing high quality output and performance of the machine . "
Horsepucky , says I . Granted , the printer may need a small amount of ink to keep the printer heads from drying out , but the volume left in the cartridge is n't what I 'd call small .
And I 'm not interested in the industry standard of 5 percent coverage .
What I know is that even with minimal printing , the Brother needs a new cartridge way too often -- and I want every last drop of ink .
Inkjet Cartridges ?
It 's a Hot Topic
I 'm not the only one incensed about the ink issue .
Here 's what a few of my blog readers had to say :
" It 's environmentally unfriendly .
The more frequently we 're required to change our ink cartridges unnecessarily , the more landfill waste .
Granted many people recycle their used cartridges , but just as many throw them in the garbage . "
-- cwashizawa
" Change the name in your rant from Brother to Canon and it's exactly the same story .
My brand new Canon was telling me the color cartridge was dangerously low for months before I actually got a printout with some missing color . "

" I 've been in the supplies industry for 30 + years and 7 years ago developed my own Web site ( OfficeSupplyOutfitters.com ) to sell aftermarket and compatible replacement alternatives ....
Why ?
Because inkjet and toner cartridges were appallingly high priced .
If that were n't enough , the printer manufacturers are now using new technology to get you to buy more than you need ....
Now some of the printer manufacturers are using chips on their cartridges to prevent aftermarket suppliers from being able to remanufacture their cartridges ! "
-- rookiecando
" Just have to add my 2 cents to this , in addition to my raging fury with HP for installing mini-ink cartridges in new printers that will print a test page and then force you to buy full - sized ink cartridges right out of the gate .
The HP Officejet Pro K850 ... forces me to change practically full cartridges because it says they have ' expired . '
This machine takes 4 ' high - yield ' tanks of ink at about $ 80 to replace . "

Bush , WSJ push House GOP on bailout
Treasury ’s courtship of Republican votes for its financial markets rescue plan was helped on two fronts Saturday by the Wall Street Journal ’s editorial page and President Bush ’s often overlooked weekly radio address .
A leading platform for the right , the Journal editorial page endorsed the initiative as a “ tool to avoid a deeper downturn ” and even took a swing at former House Speaker Newt Gingrich — a leading Treasury critic — for being able to “ pirouette as a fiscal conservative hero now that he ’s a TV pundit . ”

“ No one tried harder than we did to avoid arriving at this pass , but now that we ’re here our vote is that this government intervention is justified , ” the Journal wrote .
“ The execution risks are real , as in any government exercise , but the risks of doing nothing are just as real for the economy and believers in free markets . ”
Bush ’s radio remarks will receive less attention but go much further than the president ’s televised address Wednesday in addressing taxpayer concerns about the long term cost of the proposed $ 700 billion intervention .
Wednesday ’s speech frustrated many for not better using the national stage to break down the complex issue into simpler terms , and the radio address appears an effort to try make up for this lost opportunity .
“ The final cost of this plan will be far less than $ 700 billion , and here ’s why , ” Bush said bluntly in his radio remarks .
“ As fear and uncertainty have gripped the market for mortgage - related assets , their price has dropped sharply .
Yet many of these assets still have significant underlying value , because the vast majority of people will eventually pay off their mortgages .
In other words , many of the assets the government would buy are likely to go up in price over time .
This means that the government will be able to recoup much , if not all , of the original expenditure . ”
Winning over Republican support — especially in the House — is now the crucial battleground , almost as much as the final negotiations on the content of the legislation authorizing action .
House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) said Friday he is “ convinced ” now that agreement can be reached by Sunday but substantial Republican support will be needed if the bill is to get through the House .
“ There ’s no shortcut here , ” said Frank .
“ The House Republicans are going to have to be supportive of this bill or we wo n’t get a bill . ”
House Minority Whip Roy Blunt — tapped Friday to represent his party in the talks — told Politico that he was going into the discussions “ really trying to negotiate something that a lot of Republicans can be for . ”
And Sen. John McCain , the Republican presidential nominee , is back in Washington determined to reassert himself in the process even after a blow - up at the White House Thursday night .
“ He said , `I want to see this done and I wish you best of luck in getting it done , ' ” said New Hampshire Sen.
Judd Gregg , the lead negotiator for Senate Republicans , after conferring with McCain Friday .
After late - night staff talks running into Saturday morning , the principal negotiators , including Frank and Gregg , hope to meet Saturday afternoon .
And there appears to be a greater willingness to expand the options available to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson — and his successor in the next administration .
Frank welcomed Blunt ’s participation and renewed the Democrats ’ offer to include some Republican ideas as an “ option ” for Paulson .
But the chairman warned that the core Paulson plan — now endorsed by the Journal — must remain intact .
“ Unless they give in in their opposition to the central Paulson plan , I do n’t see a bill , ” Frank said .
Frank and Blunt spoke out even as Washington sorted through the wreckage left by a wild Thursday .
A White House meeting , urged by McCain and also attended by Obama and House and Senate leaders , on the $ 700 billion rescue plan ended on a sour note after several angry , animated exchanges .
Blunt ’s appointment ends a short - lived Republican boycott of the talks that followed .
But the path ahead remains very steep , and House conservatives are pressing for additional tax breaks as well as the elimination of small but symbolic provisions that would dedicate any profits from the assets to help an affordable housing program .
It has been a week now since Paulson first proposed the massive intervention in which the government would buy , hold , and sell mortgage - related assets that have increasingly dragged down the markets since the collapse of the U.S. housing bubble .
Apart from injecting new capital , Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke hope the initiative will help break the downward cycle of “ fire sale ” prices that have discouraged private investment .
Through various auction mechanisms , the government purchases could shed new light on the assets ’ true value , and thereby remove some of the market uncertainty about their value that has discouraged lending .
Democrats have proposed that the $ 700 billion be parsed out in increments , beginning first with $ 250 billion and then $ 100 billion .
The second $ 350 billion would also become available in time , but a future Congress could attempt to block its release by enacting a joint resolution — requiring the signature as well of the next president .
Even under these terms — which Treasury fears are too restrictive —
House Republicans say the potential losses for the taxpayer are excessive .
Rather than purchase bad assets , one alternative would be to extend government - backed insurance for the securities , with industry paying a fee for the added coverage that could improve their value .
Speaking with reporters Friday , Frank renewed an offer earlier this week by Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) that this insurance proposal could be added as an option for Paulson or any future Treasury secretary .
The chairman said he had discussed the matter with Paulson , who was amenable as well .
“ Frankly , he said , ‘ If that was added as an option , it would n’t hurt , but I could n’t use it , ’ ” the chairman said of his discussion with Paulson .
As for Frank himself ?
“ I would n’t mind , but it does n’t do anything .
It ’s useless but not harmful , ” Frank said .
“ The problem was in displacing the other stuff . ”
Blunt said Republicans want “ meaningful ” changes to the Paulson plan , not “ some type of window dressing to say it ’s there . ”
But a top McCain adviser said adding the insurance language — even as just an option — would be helpful , since even if Paulson were to reject the idea , the authority would still be available for a new president and secretary next year .
“ Yes it would be helpful and other options like loans would be helpful too , ” said Mark Salter , a longtime aide to the Arizona Republican .
“ The next president will have the options even if Paulson chooses not to use them . ”
McCain met again with House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) in the Capitol Friday before leaving for the presidential debate in Mississippi .
And his campaign issued a statement that “ he will return to Washington to ensure that all voices and interests are represented in the final agreement , especially those of taxpayers and homeowners . ”
Those “ voices ” would certainly include the House Republicans , who have been much more vocal in their opposition than their Senate counterparts .
McCain ’s staff says he wants to be constructive , helping to build the support needed for a bipartisan package .
But Democrats are leery and even fear that McCain is setting up a situation where he and House Republicans run against the rescue plan and try to tab Obama with the huge costs .
House Democrats remember the price they paid politically for a vote in 1993 on then - President Clinton ’s deficit reduction plan — including tax increases .
And the shadow of that experience hangs over cloakroom discussions between Democratic lawmakers today .
“ It feels like ‘ 93 … I think people feel very strongly about that , ” said Rep. Alcee Hastings ( D - Fla . ) .
“ And I also think people feel very strongly that Republicans , because of deregulation and other matters , contributed to the problem and they should be the ones wanting the correction . ”
By the time the button and other relics were buried 63 years ago , the burial party would have harboured no hopes of survival , or rescue , or of anyone in the outside world knowing where they were .
They knew that people who came to this remote place were doomed to die .
This place was the last camp .
So the dying soldiers buried these artefacts , the only non-perishable things they owned , in the hope that someone , one day , would know that Australians had been there , eight kilometres south of Ranau .
A few months earlier in 1945 , the Japanese high command had ordered that no prisoners survive the war .
With Allied forces nearing Sandakan , the Japanese ordered prisoners to march 265 kilometres to Ranau .
Of 2434 Australian and British prisoners in Sandakan , only six survived - 1787 Australians and 641 British perished in the camp , along the track or at Ranau .
The last were executed on August 27 , 12 days after World War II ended .
Now the owner of the land on which the relics were discovered , with the help of Ms Silver , the foremost authority on the Sandakan tragedy , is planning to preserve the site .
He will build a community facility with the artefacts in special pavilions .
Private Keith Botterill , one of the six survivors , had told Ms Silver before he died of conditions at the last camp .
Botterill , who had been on the first of two death marches , saw a line of 183 shambling , emaciated figures from the second march enter the camp site on June 26 , 1945 .
These men were the last of 536 who had left Sandakan a month before .
The men were dying by the dozen , from dysentery , malaria , beriberi , overwork and terrible beatings .
At the end of July , only 32 were still alive ; on August 1 , 17 were carried or forced to crawl to the POW cemetery and murdered .
The final 15 were all killed on August 27 .
In 1995 , Ms Silver located the POW sites along the route , and visited all but one in 1999 .
Early this year , her trekking colleague , Tham Yau Kong , met the landowner where the last camp was situated , Dr Othman Minudin , who agreed with Ms Silver that the site was uncontaminated by modern - day living .
Ms Silver and her husband , Neil , spent two days there last month .
They uncovered a large number of artefacts , from old nails used to build the POW hut , to the remains of the Japanese food store , kitchen knives , a wok support , an army mug , a heavy machine - gun bullet , and various knives that could be used as weapons .
They were preparing to leave when Mr Silver took their metal detector outside the general search area .
He shouted for his wife and their helpers to come .
They had unearthed the last desperately sad evidence in the Sandakan story .
Mr Silver cannot explain why he moved from the POW hut search area to where he found the artefacts .
Tham Yau Kong and Othman Minudin have no such problem : the spirits of the POWs were at work .
Bush vetoes Medicare bill
As promised , President Bush has vetoed the Medicare bill that would stave off a 10.6 percent cut in reimbursements to doctors and replace it with a slight increase .
The bill passed both chambers with a veto - proof majority after a contentious several weeks of debate .
And now it continues .
Bush vetoed it , he said in a statement , because of Democratic attempts to roll back certain private elements within the Medicare program .
Democrats say the private plans amount to a corporate giveaway and are too costly ; Bush frames it as a matter of choice , saying in a veto statement that " taking choices away from seniors to pay physicians is wrong . "
His full statement after the jump ...
TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES :
I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 6331 , the " Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 . "
I support the primary objective of this legislation , to forestall reductions in physician payments .
Yet taking choices away from seniors to pay physicians is wrong .
This bill is objectionable , and I am vetoing it because :
--
It would harm beneficiaries by taking private health plan options away from them ; already more than 9.6 million beneficiaries , many of whom are considered lower - income , have chosen to join a Medicare Advantage ( MA ) plan , and it is estimated that this bill would decrease MA enrollment by about 2.3 million individuals in 2013 relative to the program 's current baseline ;
--
It would undermine the Medicare prescription drug program , which today is effectively providing coverage to 32 million beneficiaries directly through competitive private plans or through Medicare - subsidized retirement plans ; and ·
--
It is fiscally irresponsible , and it would imperil the long - term fiscal soundness of Medicare by using short - term budget gimmicks that do not solve the problem ; the result would be a steep and unrealistic payment cut for physicians -- roughly 20 percent in 2010 -- likely leading to yet another expensive temporary fix ; and the bill would also perpetuate wasteful overpayments to medical equipment suppliers .
In December 2003 , when I signed the Medicare Prescription Drug , Improvement , and Modernization Act ( MMA ) into law , I said that " when seniors have the ability to make choices , health care plans within Medicare will have to compete for their business by offering higher quality service .
For the seniors of America , more choices and more control will mean better health care . "
This is exactly what has happened -- with drug coverage and with Medicare Advantage .
Today , as a result of the changes in the MMA , 32 million seniors and Americans with disabilities have drug coverage through Medicare prescription drug plans or a Medicare - subsidized retirement plan , while some 9.6 million Medicare beneficiaries -- more than 20 percent of all beneficiaries -- have chosen to join a private MA plan .
To protect the interests of these beneficiaries , I cannot accept the provisions of this legislation that would undermine Medicare Part D , reduce payments for MA plans , and restructure the MA program in a way that would lead to limited beneficiary access , benefits , and choices and lower - than - expected enrollment in Medicare Advantage .
Medicare beneficiaries need and benefit from having more options than just the one - size - fits - all approach of traditional Medicare fee - for - service .
Medicare Advantage plan options include health maintenance organizations , preferred provider organizations , and private fee - for - service ( PFFS ) plans .
Medicare Advantage plans are paid according to a formula established by the Congress in 2003 to ensure that seniors in all parts of the country -- including rural areas -- have access to private plan options .
This bill would reduce these options for beneficiaries , particularly those in hard - to - serve rural areas .
In particular , H.R. 6331 would make fundamental changes to the MA PFFS program .
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that H.R. 6331 would decrease MA enrollment by about 2.3 million individuals in 2013 relative to its current baseline , with the largest effects resulting from these PFFS restrictions .
While the MMA increased the availability of private plan options across the country , it is important to remember that a significant number of beneficiaries who have chosen these options earn lower incomes .
The latest data show that 49 percent of beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans report income of $ 20,000 or less .
These beneficiaries have made a decision to maximize their Medicare and supplemental benefits through the MA program , in part because of their economic situation .
Cuts to MA plan payments required by this legislation would reduce benefits to millions of seniors , including lower - income seniors , who have chosen to join these plans .
The bill would constrain market forces and undermine the success that the Medicare Prescription Drug program has achieved in providing beneficiaries with robust , high - value coverage -- including comprehensive formularies and access to network pharmacies -- at lower - than - expected costs .
In particular , the provisions that would enable the expansion of " protected classes " of drugs would effectively end meaningful price negotiations between Medicare prescription drug plans and pharmaceutical manufacturers for drugs in those classes .
If , as is likely , implementation of this provision results in an increase in the number of protected drug classes , it will lead to increased beneficiary premiums and copayments , higher drug prices , and lower drug rebates .
These new requirements , together with provisions that interfere with the contractual relationships between Part D plans and pharmacies , are expected to increase Medicare spending and have a negative impact on the value and choices that beneficiaries have come to enjoy in the program .
The bill includes budget gimmicks that do not solve the payment problem for physicians , make the problem worse with an abrupt payment cut for physicians of roughly 20 percent in 2010 , and add nearly $ 20 billion to the Medicare Improvement Fund , which would unnecessarily increase Medicare spending and contribute to the unsustainable growth in Medicare .
In addition , H.R. 6331 would delay important reforms like the Durable Medical Equipment , Prosthetics , Orthotics , and Supplies
competitive bidding program , under which lower payment rates went into effect on July 1 , 2008 .
This program will produce significant savings for Medicare and beneficiaries by obtaining lower prices through competitive bidding .
The legislation would leave the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund vulnerable to litigation because of the revocation of the awarded contracts .
Changing policy in mid-stream is also confusing to beneficiaries who are receiving services from quality suppliers at lower prices .
In order to slow the growth in Medicare spending , competition within the program should be expanded , not diminished .
For decades , we promised America 's seniors we could do better , and we finally did .
We should not turn the clock back to the days when our Medicare system offered outdated and inefficient benefits and imposed needless costs on its beneficiaries .
Because this bill would severely damage the Medicare program by undermining the Medicare Part D program and by reducing access , benefits , and choices for all beneficiaries , particularly the approximately 9.6 million beneficiaries in MA , I must veto this bill .
I urge the Congress to send me a bill that reduces the growth in Medicare spending , increases competition and efficiency , implements principles of value - driven health care , and appropriately offsets increases in physician spending .
GEORGE W. BUSH
THE WHITE HOUSE ,
July 15 , 2008 .
That did n’t take long .
Outraged voters have created an online petition to demand that the McCain - Obama presidential debate take place on Sept. 26 as planned .
ALL OF THIS SOUNDS KIND OF FAMILIAR ….
If the scuttlebutt is right , policy makers are about this close to striking some kind of bailout deal , making John McCain ’s latest round of inexplicable tactics entirely unnecessary .
But McCain apparently wants to come riding onto Capitol Hill — probably on a white horse , if he can find one — where he can take credit for a package he had nothing to do with .
And if all of this sounds kind of familiar , it ’s because we saw a very similar situation about a year ago .
During a meeting [ in May 2007 ] on immigration legislation , McCain and Sen. John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) got into a shouting match when Cornyn started voicing concerns about the number of judicial appeals that illegal immigrants could receive , according to multiple sources — both Democrats and Republicans — who heard firsthand accounts of the exchange from lawmakers who were in the room .
At a bipartisan gathering in an ornate meeting room just off the Senate floor , McCain complained that Cornyn was raising petty objections to a compromise plan being worked out between Senate Republicans and Democrats and the White House .
He used a curse word associated with chickens and accused Cornyn of raising the issue just to torpedo a deal .
Things got really heated when Cornyn accused McCain of being too busy campaigning for president to take part in the negotiations , which have gone on for months behind closed doors .
“ Wait a second here , ” Cornyn said to McCain .
“ I ’ve been sitting in here for all of these negotiations and you just parachute in here on the last day .
You ’re out of line . ”
McCain , a former Navy pilot , then used language more accustomed to sailors … .
“ [ Expletive ] you !
I know more about this than anyone else in the room , ” shouted McCain at Cornyn .
So , lawmakers and administration officials negotiated behind closed doors for quite a while , trying to hammer out a deal .
McCain , on the campaign trail , was detached and uninvolved .
In the 11th hour , McCain swoops in , hoping to take credit for work he did n’t do , and when challenged , Senator Hothead erupted , demanding deference .
Soon after , a deal was announced , McCain smiled for the cameras as if he ’d been integral to the process , and then left to go back to the campaign trail , not sticking around long enough to help the compromise package become law .
He may be lacking in temperament , character , and honesty , but at least McCain has a consistent m.o.
John McCain 's campaign is also looking into pressing harder in Maine .
McCain 's fate hangs on three states
ST . LOUIS — Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) now must win Pennsylvania , Wisconsin or Minnesota in order to get enough electoral votes to win the presidency , his campaign says .
Those were considered swing states in 2000 and 2004 , but George W. Bush lost them both times .

“ Our ability to pick off one of those three states is where our fortunes are largely held , ” a McCain official said .
“ These are states where Barack Obama is on the defense . ”
McCain 's political director , Mike DuHaime , told reporters on a conference call three hours before debate time that the campaign plans an " aggressive " front in Maine , a solidly Democratic state that gets virtually no attention in presidential races .
The sudden attention to Maine , which is getting some of the staff McCain is moving out of Michigan , reflects what a squeaker McCain expects .
Maine is not a winner - take - all state ( the only other one that splits its electoral vote is Nebraska ) .
And McCain aides , perhaps optimistically , are suggesting he can win one electoral vote by picking up one of the Pine Tree State ’s two congressional districts .
The Maine congressional district McCain is eying is the larger , northern one , the 2nd District , which covers most of the state and is held by Democratic Rep. Michael H. Michaud .
McCain has very limited ways to win , with no room for error .
Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) still has many routes to the White House and so can afford to campaign on a much broader playing field .
McCain aides discussed their tough new map math after Politico ’s Jonathan Martin reported , and McCain aides subsequently confirmed that he is giving up on Michigan , withdrawing staff and advertising .
“ We felt like being able to play in Michigan up to this point was an offensive move , ” a McCain aide said .
“ As we close down into Election Day , our map is going to become more targeted .
McCain figures that winning one of those three big remaining swing states , plus those he considers safe , would put him 10 shy of the 270 electoral votes he needs to win .
“ We can dig up an additional 10 electoral votes in Nevada , Colorado and New Hampshire , ” the official said .
Recent polls have showed Obama running strong in some states Bush won in 2004 .
But the McCain official said the campaign is confident : “ We feel strongly that we ’re going to win in Florida , Missouri and the traditional Republican states of Virginia and North Carolina . ”
One McCain official acknowledged that the campaign is feeling the pressure from the better - funded Obama .
" He has an extraordinary amount of resources , " the official said .
Soon after Sarah Palin was elected mayor of the foothill town of Wasilla , Alaska , she startled a local music teacher by insisting in casual conversation that men and dinosaurs coexisted on an Earth created 6,000 years ago -- about 65 million years after scientists say most dinosaurs became extinct -- the teacher said .
After conducting a college band and watching Palin deliver a commencement address to a small group of home - schooled students in June 1997 , Wasilla resident Philip Munger said , he asked the young mayor about her religious beliefs .
Palin told him that “ dinosaurs and humans walked the Earth at the same time , ” Munger said .
When he asked her about prehistoric fossils and tracks dating back millions of years , Palin said “ she had seen pictures of human footprints inside the tracks , ” recalled Munger , who teaches music at the University of Alaska in Anchorage and has regularly criticized Palin in recent years on his liberal political blog , called Progressive Alaska .
The idea of a “ young Earth ” -- that God created the Earth about 6,000 years ago , and dinosaurs and humans coexisted early on -- is a popular strain of creationism .

Though in her race for governor she called for faith - based “ intelligent design ” to be taught along with evolution in Alaska ’s schools , Gov. Palin has not sought to require it , state educators say .
As governor and in her formative role as mayor of Wasilla , Palin has trod carefully between her evangelical faith and public policy on issues such as abortion and library books .
At times she has retreated when her moves have sparked controversy or proved politically impractical .
She has harnessed the political muscle of social conservatives and antiabortion groups , yet she did not push hard for a special legislative session on abortion , and she did not challenge a court ruling that allowed health insurance for same - sex partners of state workers .
Palin has attended a number of prayer sessions with pastors and has quietly sought their guidance , but she is often mum on matters of faith in high - profile public forums .
Advertisement
Her aides say Palin ’s caution at the intersection of religion and governance is a studied effort to share her beliefs without forcing them on Alaska .
“ She ’s obviously an intensively religious person , ” said Bill McAllister , Palin ’s chief spokesman as governor .
“ She understands that she ’s the governor and not preacher in chief .
Religion informs her decisions , but she is not out to impose her views on Alaska . ”
McAllister said that he never heard Palin make such remarks about dinosaurs and that Palin preferred not to discuss her views on evolution publicly .
“ I ’ve never had a conversation like that with her or been apprised of anything like that , ” McAllister said .
He added that “ the only bigotry that ’s still safe is against Christians who believe in their faith . ”

Palin ’s critics say she holds back from trying to codify her faith - based views when she senses it will cost her politically .
“ She ’s got a fine - tuned sense of how far to push , ” said John Stein , who guided Palin into her political career before she toppled him as Wasilla ’s mayor .

‘ Moral majority ’

Stein said Palin displayed only hints of her fundamentalist Assembly of God upbringing when he first backed her for a nonpartisan run for Wasilla City Council in the early 1990s .
But in 1996 , when Palin ousted Mayor Stein with the aid of pink - colored antiabortion mailers and busloads of Christian grass - roots activists , she grew more overt about her plans , he said .
She combined her staff meetings with prayer sessions , Stein said , and upset the town ’s chief librarian by asking what the process would be for banning books .
According to Stein , bans were never carried out only because “ the library director was horrified and stood up to her . ”
Geri McCann , who ran the town museum under Mayor Palin , counters : “ Sarah brought it up because she knew there was a moral majority in Wasilla who needed their voices heard . ”
During an October 2006 debate in the Alaska governor ’s race , Palin urged that evolution and creationist ideas be taught together in state schools .
“ Do n’t be afraid of information and let kids debate both sides , ” she said .

But since taking office in December 2006 , Palin has made no moves to impose the teaching of creationism or “ intelligent design , ” the modern version of creationist thought , in Alaska schools .
“ As far as teachers are concerned , we have n’t seen any push , ” said Joan Sargent , a Fairbanks teacher who heads the Alaska Science Teachers Assn .
Teachers already have the flexibility to introduce creationist views , as an addendum to the mainstream study of evolution , Sargent said .

‘ Political capital ’

Palin is “ still new at this game , ” said Democratic state Rep.
Les Gara , whose colleagues also have gained leverage against Palin through a power - sharing arrangement with Palin rival Lyda Green , a Republican who is president of the state Senate .
In the 2006 governor ’s race , Palin was unequivocal in her opposition to abortion .
In a questionnaire from the conservative Eagle Forum , she wrote : “ I am pro-life , ” adding that she would agree to allow abortion only in medical cases where “ the mother ’s life would end . ”
But Palin , who took office in December 2006 , has not made Alaska a battleground on the issue .
When two bills emerged in the Alaska Legislature this year to restrict abortion -- one to require parental consent and the other to outlaw dilation - and - extraction procedures , called partial - birth abortion by opponents -- Palin said she was ready to sign them into law .
Advertisement
But both efforts were killed by Democrats .
And when Green , who supported the measures , pressed for a special session to deal with abortion , Palin instead chose a special session to secure a natural gas pipeline project .
Antiabortion leaders said they understood Palin ’s delay on the issue because of other state concerns .
“ She ’s a woman of integrity and we trust her , ” said Karen Lewis of Alaska Right to Life .
“ Sometimes you have to wait . ”
Palin also did not challenge an Alaska Supreme Court ruling that mandated health insurance benefits for same - sex partners .
Instead she signed a nonbinding referendum that asked voters their opinion on the issue .

“ She ’s been careful not to squander all her political capital on social conservative issues , ” said Allison Mendel , an attorney whose lawsuit led to the insurance ruling .

Pentecostal training
Palin has appeared at prayer sessions and church functions across Alaska and has turned to her childhood pastor and other religious leaders for guidance .
Advertisement
“ She uses us as a sounding board , ” said the Rev. Paul Riley , who spent 30 years leading the Wasilla Assembly of God Church , where Palin worshiped until a few years ago .
Riley said he and other pastors formed prayer circles around Palin in Anchorage at several “ One Lord Sunday ” events -- which bring together various churches -- and had offered prayers at similar events since she became governor .
In April , Palin told 500 people at an Assembly of God conference in the Anchorage Sheraton about the trials ahead in raising her youngest child , Trig .
Born that month , he has Down syndrome .
“ The whole group stood up and prayed beside her , ” Riley said .
The pastors also prayed that Palin ’s efforts to win a major natural gas pipeline project would lead to a “ blessing . ”
In one of her more controversial appearances in the Wasilla church , Palin told a group of ministry students in June to pray that sending troops to Iraq was part of “ God ’s plan . ”
Advertisement
In a speech this month at a deployment ceremony for her Iraq - bound soldier son , Palin called the conflict a “ righteous cause . ”
McAllister said Palin did not know that she was being taped when she made the Iraq war remarks at the church .
And her practice of turning to local pastors for guidance and prayer is in line with the practices of other American political leaders , he said .
“ It ’s nothing out of the ordinary , ” McAllister said .
“ Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan did it . ”
Palin grew up steeped in Pentecostalism at the Wasilla church , where she learned “ memory verses ” from the Bible as a young “ Missionette ” -- the church ’s equivalent of a Girl Scout .

Theron
Horn , the church ’s youth pastor at the time and now a Minnesota businessman , often told Palin and her classmates that they could grow up to be anything -- including politicians .
Horn said he “ was just trying to get the kids to see their potential , ” but Riley said it was a turning point for Palin .
--
Worldviews
Palin was accustomed early on to the sight of churchgoers ecstatically declaring their faith by speaking in tongues -- a practice familiar to the more than 6 million Americans who are members of Pentecostal churches .
Advertisement
Neither Riley nor Tim McGraw , who took over as pastor when Riley retired in 1986 , recalled seeing Palin taking part in the charismatic prayers .
But “ whether she did or not does n’t matter , ” said McGraw , who now leads the Yosemite Christian Center in Madera , Calif .
“ We ’re not some sect on the fringe .
This is a reputable denomination of Christianity . ”
Although she now worships in traditional fundamentalist churches in Wasilla and Juneau , Palin ’s formative years in Pentecostal churches have been a target for some bloggers and Democratic opponents .
They point to controversial statements from some of her pastors about converting gays and Jews and to her own comments about the Iraq war .
“ It ’s legitimate to ask questions about candidates who come from a fundamentalist environment with a black - and - white worldview , and want to know how it would affect their approach on all kinds of issues , ” said Paul S. Boyer , a retired University of Wisconsin history professor who has written about the role of religious prophecy on public policy .
Advertisement
But Douglas Wead , an author and former aide to President George H.W. Bush , argues that the campaign brush fires over Palin ’s religious background and pastors ’ statements ignores or trivializes the emergence of evangelical Christianity in the American mainstream .
“ Are we saying they ca n’t participate in public life ? ” Wead asked .

Last month , IT industry analysts Gartner published their 2008 Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies .
Here ’s what it looks like :
What I find especially interesting is where on the hype cycle some of these technologies are , especially seeing their current and predicted positions along the Technology Trigger and cresting the Peak of Inflated Expectations .
What will languish in the Trough of Disillusionment , and what will emerge onto the Slope of Enlightenment ?
Gartnerâ€™s own summary is this :
[ …]
“ Although Web 2.0 is now entering the Trough of Disillusionment , it will emerge within two years to have transformational impact , as companies steadily gain more experience and success with both the technologies and the cultural implications , ” said Jackie Fenn , vice president and Gartner Fellow .
“ Later – in between two and five years – cloud computing and service - oriented architecture ( SOA ) , which is moving up the Slope of Enlightenment , will deliver transformation in terms of driving deep changes in the role and capabilities of IT .
Finally , public virtual worlds , which are suffering from disillusionment after their peak of hype in 2007 , will in the long term represent an important media channel to support and build broader communities of interest . ”
So in one of my areas of interest , Gartner says that Web 2.0 has a good chance of achieving the promise that is currently seen as so much hype and so is likely to emerge out of the trough , when it does get there , fairly quickly .
Thatâ€™s good news .
There are a couple of very interesting new entrants for 2008 , notably microblogging – think of Twitter , Friendfeed and the like – green IT and cloud computing , the latter especially at the heart of growing commentary and opinion , what some would undoubtedly call hype .
How does all this compare to what Gartner has been predicting in recent years ?
I ’ve been closely following the hype cycles for 2006 and 2007 , and it is interesting to compare 2008 with the predictions for the two preceding years :
It ’s particularly notable to see the short journey Web 2.0 has taken in these three years , from its position at the Peak of Inflated Expectations in 2006 , down the slope towards the Trough of Disillusionment in 2007 where it largely still is in 2008 .
Note Gartner ’s prediction , though , as I mentioned above .
And note , too , where corporate blogging has gone in these three years – rapidly through the trough and onto the Slope of Enlightenment .
Wikis , too – now on that slope .
I think one technology to keep a close eye on is green IT which , as Gartner says , will likely gain momentum in tandem with broader and growing concerns about climate change and environmental issues .
Anything notable that strikes you when looking at these three years ?

Review of " Expert Python Programming " by Tarek Ziade '
by Michele Simionato
October 14 , 2008
Summary
A couple of weeks ago I was asked to review in my blog " Expert Python Programming " by Tarek Ziade ' in exchange for a free copy of the book .
I accepted , I received the book a few days ago and I read it in the weekend .
Here are my impressions .
Advertisement
Expert Python Programming - as the title implies - is intended for proficient Python programmers who want to become experts .
In my opinion the target audience is very well chosen , since we do not need yet another beginners ' book , whereas there are very few Python books intended specifically for skilled programmers .
The book fullfills its goals exceptionally well : it definitely gives you enough hints and suggestions to turn you from a mere practictioner into a professional Python programmer ( of course some effort on your part is required in order to reach that goal , but a book cannot perform miracles ; ) .
In only 350 pages Tarek Ziadé covers an extremely wide range of topics .
Expert Python Programming is not just a book about Python , the language ; it is also a book about Python , the platform : it covers all the major libraries and tools used to write and to deliver profession Python application .
It is the knowledge of such tools and techniques that make the difference between an amateur and a professional developer .
Moreover , the book is a collection of best practices for modern software development , covering topics such as how to use a Distributed Version Control System , how to setup a buildbot for your tests , how to setup an automatic build of your documentation , etc .
Really a lot of good stuff that I have never found collected together in a single place .
The thing that impressed me the most is how much this book is updated : basically it covers all the latest development in the Python community , even very recent ones like the Sphynx documentation system , to name just one which I think is extremely interesting and little known .
I like very much the overall attitude of the book , especially the lack of verbosity .
There is a lot of really good information in a surprising small number of pages , since as the author says , " this book is not intended to replace inline resources , but rather aims at complementing them " .
Other books I have seen contain thousands of pages of redundant information you can find in the manuals , whereas Expert Python Programming is more like a guide through the jungle of the Python resources , just what a competent programmer needs .
I follow the latest developments in the Python world very closely , so I did not expect to find something I did not know already , but I was very pleasantly surprised to discover I was wrong .
Basically the book focuses on three topics : how to use Python at its best ( about new and / or advanced Python constructs ) , how to write a professional Python application ( with tips about IDEs , DVCS , testing frameworks , optimization techniques , etc ) anf how to deliver and mantain an application ( how to document the code with reStructured Text and Sphynx , how to distribute it with setuptools and other tools such as PasteScript , zc.buildout , builbots , how to set up a bug tracker with Trac , and more ) .
The first chapter , about installing Python and setting up a confortable development environment , risked to be removed : as the author says in the preface " I almost removed this chapter since the book is not intended for beginners " .
I am glad that it was was kept at the end : there is useful information there even for an expert Pythonista like myself ( let me be a little immodest here ) .
For instance , there are tips about how to get a nice working environment under Windows by using MinGW and MSYS which I have never used ( I do not develop under Windows ; in the past I have used Cygwin which is a little bit too pervasive IMO ) .
If I needed to develop something on Windows in the future I would certainly take advantages of Tarek 's tips .
I liked the chapter about setuptools , since I learned a lot about how to make eggs for distributing Python code ( at work all of our code is for internal usage , we do not distribute it , so I was pretty much ignorant about the subject ) .
I plan to take advantages of setuptools to distribute a couple of Open Source libraries I am working on .
I must confess that the setup .py script for my own decorator module was contributed by an user , since I did not know how to use setuptools at the time .
There is an entire chapter about choosing good names , and I am glad there is , since choosing good names is possibly the most difficult thing in programming .
Moreover , the chapter gives a very good introduction to Python code style guide , the ( in ) famous PEP 8 , and it cites Pylint , a tool every Python developer should know about ( the other is pychecker , which is not cited , so I will cite it here ; ) .
Whereas the chapters about coding conventions and documentation are for everyone , the book contains good advice for experts too : they will enjoy the chapters about profiling and debugging .
There is even a paragraph about Guppy and Heapy , a tool to track memory usage I was never able to use ( as the author says " Heapy is not easy to use and needs a bit of practice " ) .
For people working with databases , there is also a nice introduction to SLQAlchemy , the major database toolkit for Python .
The last chapter about patterns is definitely well written and it may appeal to pattern aficionados .
I personally I am an not estimator of patterns .
Instead of motivating my position , I will just report a couple of citations from comp.lang.lisp ( you may substitute Lisp with Python ) :
I remember when I read the original " Design Patterns " book , thinking " wow , non-Lisp languages sure make you jump through all sorts of hoops to do things we take for granted . "
That 's why they need to give names to all the patterns , because you can't " just do it . " -- Barry Margolin
Yeah , I remember having the same reaction - kind of sad when a language is so broken that there is a list as long as your arm of collected workarounds that are glorified as " design patterns . " -- Raffael Cavallaro
I must confess that I liked a lot the chapter about the MRO , since my own paper is extensively cited there as " the reference document " about the subject .
I certainly would not have expected such a result when I wrote it six years ago .
At the time , I was just a hobbyist programmer who had freshly learned OOP and I wanted to give a very minor contribution to the Python documentation , since I could not give a contribution in code .
It turns out , however , that there are very few programmers who are willing to give contribution to the documentation , so that whatever you write becomes " the reference document " .
As a consequence , nowadays , every Python programmer who wants to call himself an expert ( and there thousands of them ) has to read my paper : frankly , this is quite flattering ;)
Moreover , Tarek also talks about metaclasses and he cites the first paper of our ( our here means David Mertz and me ) trilogy .
However , I would have cited the original version appeared in IBM DeveloperWorks and not the republished version appeared on OnLamp .
I am glad about those citations since it looks like the time we spent in documenting such arcane features was well spent , somebody actually read the result of our efforts , and we did actually contributed something back to the community .
On the other hand , Tarek writes a lot ( and very well ) about decorators but he does not cite my own own decorator module .
Helas , you cannot win always ;)
It does a very good job with descriptors instead .
Tarek also gives very sound advice about tricky Python constructs , such as Python super ( use it consistently ) and multiple inheritance ( do not use it ) .
I also liked his advices about testing ( both unittest and doctests ) and documenting .
Tarek is also a great fan of Documentation Driven Development , an idea I started advertising at least from 2003 .
As a final note , I would like to see a couple of words about the publisher , PACKT .
I must admit I did not know it , probably because they entered in business only few years ago and they do not sell many Python books .
However , I have looked at their web site now , and I see that they have a really large offer especially about Web Development books .
If all their books are of the same quality as " Expert Python Programming " , it is certainly a worthy publisher .
I have not seen a single mispell in the entire book ; moreover the paper , the cover , the pictures , the fonts and in general the look and feel are just fine .
The book is certainly worth its money and more .
It is also good to know that part of the revenue will go to the Python Software Foundation .
In general I like very much their support for Open Source and their marketing strategy : it makes a lot of sense to me , I sincerely hope their business model will pay off , as it seems to be the case .
All in all , Expert Python Programming is the best book in its category I have ever read .
I definitely recommend it and I will ask the company to buy one for the office library .
You are adviced to do the same !

The new MySpace Music service launched in the US on Friday There will be an " exodus " of music artists from MySpace in a row over the website 's new music download service , a record label boss has warned .
Independent record labels have cried foul after failing to reach a deal for their acts to appear on MySpace Music .
" MySpace has been floundering lately already , and people have been moving toward Facebook and so on , " said Tom Silverman , boss of Tommy Boy Records .
MySpace said in a statement it remains " committed " to independent music acts .
" We believe that all artists will be able to enjoy the benefits longer term .
In the meantime we invite and welcome discussion with artists , labels and independent representatives at any time , " it added .
MySpace has joined forces with the four major record labels for their stars to appear on the service .
But many in the independent sector feel that much of MySpace 's success has been built on the presence of new and indie acts .
That has led Mr Silverman , who signed De La Soul , Queen Latifah and Coolio , to comment that " our lovers were cheating on us " .
" Now we need to hire a great divorce lawyer , " he told the Los Angeles Times .
He added that the latest developments would " accelerate the exodus " of acts from the site .
Top destination MySpace is widely seen as the top destination for new and established artists to showcase their songs and keep in touch with fans .
An estimated five million acts have MySpace pages .
The new ad - funded service , which has just launched in the US , lets MySpace members listen to streamed tracks for free or download them through partner site Amazon.com .
MySpace continually states that it is embracing the independents - it's a pretty listless and cold embrace
Bob Frank
Koch Records
The four major labels have been given a stake in the new site and the independent labels want a similar deal .
They say that is not currently the case , although MySpace said it had provided everyone with the " same opportunities " .
The indie labels include Beggars Group , which has Radiohead , MIA and Vampire Weekend on its roster .
Beggars chairman Martin Mills said : " We believe that independent music and artists are worth every cent as much as that of the majors , and will not be supporting this potentially exciting new service until we see fair play . "
Other companies not signed up include Domino , home of the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand , as well as rock label Epitaph , dance hothouse Warp and Koch , the largest independent label in the US .
' Similar terms ' Koch president Bob Frank said : " Our issue is not with the majors having equity , but with MySpace believing that we would accept this without similar terms .
" MySpace continually states that it is embracing the independents .
It 's a pretty listless and cold embrace . "
Indie rights body Merlin is negotiating for its 12,000 labels , which have a 9 % share of the US music market - roughly the same as the smallest major , EMI .
In a statement when the service launched , MySpace said : " We have offered Merlin a relationship that provides the same opportunities to Merlin 's labels and artists that we have provided to all labels and artists . "
A UK version of MySpace Music is expected to launch in early 2009 .

McCain aide : Campaign tired of ' catching the spears ' from Obama RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday September 23 , 2008
Print This Email This
The McCain campaign is preparing to resurrect attacks on Senator Obama for his past associations with controversial figures such as Rev. Jeremiah Wright and college professor and Weather Underground co-founder William Ayers , sources say .
" Our position is we are no longer constrained to avoid his very real associations in contrast to the very fictional associations he has imputed to John McCain in this campaign , " one aide told the New York Sun .
Mark Salter , a top McCain aide , told the Wall Street Journal last Friday that the campaign was tired of " catching the spears . "
" They played it one way , " he said , " we played it another way .
Now we 're both going to play it the same way . "
" We 've seen all throughout the [ Democratic ] primary this guy has a lot of associations that are very problematic , " added campaign spokesman Michael Goldfarb .
" Of course the McCain campaign is going to run these ridiculous , gutter ads , " countered Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor .
" Their strategy is to change the subject from the fact that John McCain put seven top Washington lobbyists in charge of his campaign and is so out of touch that he said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong on the day of a financial crisis . "
In April , Senator Obama expressed " outrage " at comments made by his former pastor Wright , and said that Wright was " not the person that I met 20 years ago . "
If you want to get a quick sale for your house , you will have an added advantage when you do a home staging .
These home staging tips will help you get the most bang for your buck .
When real estate agents such as movoto talk about home staging , they refer to redecorating your house to showcase potential buyers ’ most critical assets .
A home buyer is not necessarily looking for a building to inhabit ; they are looking for a place to call home to fulfill their dreams and lifestyle .
The moment a buyer walks inside your house , they can know if they want to live there or not , according to how well you have uplifted it .
As a seller , whether you are looking forward to making a quick sale , or improving a stagnant property listing on the market , here are some tips for staging your home without breaking the bank .
Uplift important rooms
Not all the rooms require staging .
Focus on the most critical places , such as the living room , kitchen , and master bedroom .
These rooms make the first impression on a buyer so , redecorating them helps them envision it as their dream home .
Declutter
Buyers are attracted to big houses .
A fully packed house tends to look more squeezed ; hence , it will turn off the buyers .
Pack away all your knickknacks .
It will help you create more space and make the rooms look bigger .
For example , if its summer , winter coats should n’t be in the front hallway .
Remember , you ca n’t just toss all the junk in the closet .
The buyer will want to check the closet ’s space too .
You can put all the nonessential items in carton boxes and pack them up in the garage until the home gets a potential buyer .
You can leave a few minimalistic decor items like wallpapers and anything else that enhances the house ’s appearance .
The fewer things you have in the rooms , the bigger it will look and the more appealing to buyers .
Depersonalize
Depersonalize the house by removing all personal items in the house .
They include framed family photos on the walls , refrigerator stickers , bathroom items like towels and personal toiletries , and keep clothes out of sight but well arranged in the closet .
Create a natural look while only leaving the elements that add charm and a touch of style .
Depersonalizing helps the buyer connect more to the home and visualize the home as their own .
Some people say depersonalizing makes the house weirder to live in , but it is essential to impress prospective buyers .
Patch up and repair
Be sure to repair anything that is damaged .
Inspect all the rooms , sinks , built - in kitchen appliances , walls , ceiling , and check the roof for any leakages .
It is because such things can be deal - breakers to potential buyers .
You may also add some touch - up paint to improve the appeal of the walls .
It is to show the buyer that you have put effort into maintaining the property ; hence you will get a valuable deal .
Clean thoroughly
A dirty house will be a complete turn off to a buyer as they will not want to imagine themselves living in such a place or having to do all the thorough cleaning after purchase .
So , clean like you have never done before with cleaning products and disinfectants .
Clean the corners of the bathroom , the ceiling , the refrigerator , and make everything spotless .
Hire professional cleaning services if you have to .
A squeaky clean house will be worthwhile in the end .
Remove odors
Make sure you remove odors that can be a turn off to buyers .
As an inhabitant , you may be immune to your house aromas so , call an outside person and ask them what place to improve on .
Dry moist bathrooms and wash up the dishes as they can be the source of the smell .
Remember to do pest control to keep the pests away and take care of your pets .
You can use an air freshener , burn scented candles , or bake cinnamon - coated apples to deodorize your home .
Remember to take the garbage bin out , and you can also grind lemons in the dumping corner to absorb bad smells .
Define rooms and let there be light
For instance , if you use the guest house as your junk room , clear it up and redefine it .
Make each room appear useful even if the buyer may not want to use them in the same way .
It includes the basement too .
Additionally , light up the rooms to make them look more vibrant and happy .
It will help the buyer see the versatility that your house will offer .
The bottom line
Staging has benefits for both the buyer and the seller .
Home staging triggers an emotional purchase ; hence you get to make a quick sale .
The buyer receives an uplifted home that will not require them to incur the cost of redecorating .
Staging has a significant effect on how the buyer visualizes the property .
They can envision the property as their own , and it also decreases the amount of time the house is on the market .
Follow these home staging tips to get a quick and easy sale for your home .

The Federal Communications Commission has announced that it will investigate a Department of Defense propaganda program to determine whether news networks or military analysts violated the Communications Act of 1934 and FCC rules .
Earlier this year , The New York Times reported that a Department of Defense program had ex-military officers presenting the Bush administration ’s position on the War on Terror as objective analysis on major television news programs and 24 - hour cable news networks .
Congresswoman Rosa L. DeLauro and Congressman John Dingell wrote to the FCC to investigate allegations that the news networks and the analysts failed to disclose the ex-military officers ’ ties to the Pentagon — and if that violated sponsorship identification requirements in the Communications Act .
“ Given the revelations in the [ New York Times ] article , had the FCC not heeded our request for an investigation , it would have raised serious questions about their oversight capabilities .
I am pleased with today ’s news , but will continue to monitor the situation to ensure the FCC fully investigates the networks in addition to the analysts , ”  DeLauro said in a
statement Tuesday .
According to the Times report , Department of Defense documents described the analysts as “ message force multipliers ”  instructed to deliver “ administration themes and messages ”  to the public “ in the form of their own opinions . ” 
The report found that these analysts — who The Times called “ a media Trojan horse ”  for the administration — were encouraged to convey specific Defense Department talking points to the public , even when they suspected the information could be exaggerated or false .

... and one to end the week on ... never be late
A priest was being honoured at his retirement dinner after 25 years in the parish .
A leading local politician and member of the congregation was chosen to make the presentation and to give a little speech at the dinner .
However , he was delayed , so the priest decided to say his own few words while they waited :
' I got my first impression of the parish from the first confession I heard here .
I thought I had been assigned to a terrible place .
The very first person who entered my confessional told me he had stolen a television set and , when questioned by the police , was able to lie his way out of it .
He had stolen money from his parents , embezzled from his employer , had an affair with his boss 's wife and taken illegal drugs .
I was appalled .
But as the days went on I learned that my people were not all like that and I had , indeed , come to a fine parish full of good and loving people .'...
Just as the priest finished his talk , the politician arrived full of apologies at being late .
He immediately began to make the presentation and gave his talk : ' I 'll never forget the first day our parish priest arrived , ' said the politician .
' In fact , I had the honour of being the first person to go to him for confession . '
And the moral of the story : Never , Never , Never Be Late
And on that note , have a great weekend .
Cheers .

Update : Alright , I ’ve uploaded a few more pictures .
The last five images are the new ones I put up on the site .
So I received my issue of Nintendo Power and have taken some screenshots of GTA : Chinatown Wars that seemed to have been missed before .
Some are partial duplicates ( I think there are one or two of those ) .
Other than that , these screens have n’t been posted for .
And I ’ll try to update the photos later because I realize that one picture or so is slightly dark .
Also , I ’ll have two or so more photos that did n’t come out so well in a bit .

Archaeologists in Iraq believe they may have found the lost tomb of King Gilgamesh - the subject of the oldest " book " in history .
Gilgamesh was believed to be two - thirds god , one - third human
The Epic Of Gilgamesh - written by a Middle Eastern scholar 2,500 years before the birth of Christ - commemorated the life of the ruler of the city of Uruk , from which Iraq gets its name .
Now , a German - led expedition has discovered what is thought to be the entire city of Uruk - including , where the Euphrates once flowed , the last resting place of its famous King .
" I do n't want to say definitely it was the grave of King Gilgamesh , but it looks very similar to that described in the epic , " Jorg Fassbinder , of the Bavarian department of Historical Monuments in Munich , told the BBC World Service 's Science in Action programme .
Magnetic
In the book - actually a set of inscribed clay tablets - Gilgamesh was described as having been buried under the Euphrates , in a tomb apparently constructed when the waters of the ancient river parted following his death .
" We found just outside the city an area in the middle of the former Euphrates river ¿ the remains of such a building which could be interpreted as a burial , " Mr Fassbinder said .
Who can compare with him in kingliness ?
Who can say , like Gilgamesh , I am king ?
The Epic Of Gilgamesh
He said the amazing discovery of the ancient city under the Iraqi desert had been made possible by modern technology .
" By differences in magnetisation in the soil , you can look into the ground , " Mr Fassbinder added .
" The difference between mudbricks and sediments in the Euphrates river gives a very detailed structure . "
This creates a magnetogram , which is then digitally mapped , effectively giving a town plan of Uruk .
' Venice in the desert '
" The most surprising thing was that we found structures already described by Gilgamesh , " Mr Fassbinder stated .
Iraq has long been the site of some of the most important historical finds
" We covered more than 100 hectares .
We have found garden structures and field structures as described in the epic , and we found Babylonian houses . "
But he said the most astonishing find was an incredibly sophisticated system of canals .
" Very clearly , we can see in the canals some structures showing that flooding destroyed some houses , which means it was a highly developed system .
" [ It was ] like Venice in the desert . "
Exploitation of North Americaâ€™s shale and tar - sand oil reserves could increase atmospheric CO 2 levels by up to 15 % , a new report from WWF - UK and the major UK financial group Co-Operative Financial Services ( CFS ) has warned .
Extraction of the projected 1,115 billion barrels of recoverable oil from unconventional fuel sources such as Albertaâ€™s oil sands and Coloradoâ€™s oil shale , which involve much more energy intensive procedures for extraction than traditional oil reserves , would significantly increase global risks of dangerous climate change , the report said .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Unconventional Oil : Scraping the bottom of the barrel reported that companies including Shell , ExxonMobil and BP have announced over $ CAN 125 billion worth of development in Canadaâ€™s oil sands by 2015 .
Increasing oil prices are also increasing interest in unconventional oil sources has been given added impetus by rising oil prices .
" The extraordinary lengths some oil and gas companies go to in attempting to make the climate - hostile fuels somewhat less so should be re-directed to bringing forward low - carbon energy , " said Ian Jones , head of Responsible Investment at Co-Operative Investments , part of the CFS group .
" Most oil companies have hardly begun to factor in the externalities that are currently imposed on the environment . "
These externalities include mass deforestation , such as Albertaâ€™s Boreal forests , which lie above 140,000 square kilometres of oil sands , and are now crisscrossed with seismic lines and open - cast mines .
This region , identified as a " life support system for the planet , " is home to 11 % of global terrestrial carbon sinks , themselves necessary for mitigating the climate change .
Production of oil sands is also extremely water intensive , requiring three barrels of water to produce each barrel of oil .
This is threatening the ecosystem of the Athabasca river by reducing flows to dangerous levels .
Canadaâ€™s indigenous communities are also concerned with water quality in former wetlands now featuring tailings ponds up to 50 square kilometres in size which can be seen from outer space .
Only 5 - 10 % of waste water is judged sufficiently non-toxic to be returned to waterways
Risks to investors
Scraping the bottom of the barrel outlines potential risks to investors from the high capital costs of sand and shale to oil projects , looming regulatory restrictions , the likelihood of litigation , environmental liabilities from tailing ponds and restoration requirements and reliance on unproven technologies such as carbon capture and storage .
Investors could end up with stranded assets ,
The authors of the report themselves call for tighter regulations such as the Emissions Standards in place in California that , by prohibiting sales of fuels with high lifecycle emissions , would effectively outlaw fuel extracted from tar sands and oil shale .
" Companies and investors claim to recognise the need to tackle climate change and support international efforts such as Kyoto .
In oil sands we have an activity that is going against this imperativeâ€ ¦it is time for investors to challenge this strategy " said James Leaton , WWF - UKâ€™s senior oil and gas adviser .
" Shareholders should challenge those oil companies that fail to steward investment responsibly . " added Jones .

“ I ’m really mad ! ” shouted a man in the audience in Waukesha , where Mr. McCain and his running mate , Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska , were conducting a town - hall - style meeting .
“ And what ’s going to surprise you , it ’s not the economy .
It ’s the socialists taking over our country . ”
A short time later , James T. Harris , a conservative talk radio host in Wisconsin who was one of the few African - Americans in the crowd , stood up and told Mr. McCain that in the next presidential debate , on Wednesday , “ it ’s absolutely vital that you take it to Obama , that you hit him ” where it hurts , because “ we have all of these shady characters that have surrounded him , ” as well as , he said , Mr. Obama ’s former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr.
Although Mr. McCain did not mention Mr. Ayers , a founder of the radical group the Weather Underground , by name , his intent was clear in his response to a question about Mr. Obama .
A man told Mr. McCain that “ we ’re all wondering why Obama is where he ’s at ” in the polls and then asked , “ Is there not a way to get around this media and line up the people he has hung with ? ”
Mr. McCain responded , “ Well , sir , with your help and the people in this room , we will find out . ”
He added : “ Look , we do n’t care about an old washed - up terrorist and his wife , who still , at least on Sept. 11 , 2001 , said he still wanted to bomb more .
You know , but that ’s not the point here .
The point is , Senator Obama said he was just a guy in the neighborhood .
We need to know that ’s not true . ”
Although Mr. McCain raised questions about Mr. Obama ’s ties to Mr. Ayers in a televised interview last spring , he has refrained from attacking Mr. Obama on the trail for his association with Mr. Ayers in the general election campaign .
He had left those attacks to his campaign operatives and Ms. Palin .
Senator John McCain ’s top domestic policy adviser , former Congressional Budget Office director Douglas Holtz - Eakin , recently said in a conference call with reporters that Mr. McCain ’s health care proposal would “ put 25 to 30 million individuals out of the ranks of the uninsured , into the ranks of the insured . ”
In an article released Tuesday , a panel of prominent health economists concludes that Mr. Holtz - Eakin ’s projection is off by , well , 25 to 30 million .
The article , published in the journal Health Affairs , argues that “ initially there would be no real change in the number of people covered as a result of the McCain plan . ”
After a short - term reduction of 1 million in the number of people without coverage , the number of uninsured would increase by 5 million after five years , the authors predict .
There are currently 45 million people without insurance , or 15 percent of the population , according to the Census Bureau .
Mr. McCain ’s plan is designed to create greater equity between the group and individual insurance markets .
He would end the exclusion of employer - provided health benefits from federal income taxes , an advantage not enjoyed by those who buy insurance on their own , and replace it with health care tax credits of $ 2,500 per individual and $ 5,000 per family .
That , the McCain campaign asserts , would drive more people into the individual market , fomenting competition , reducing premiums and discouraging consumers from buying more coverage than they need or can afford .
The economists wrote that many “ people are likely to have far less generous policies than those they have today . ”
The analysis was written by Thomas Buchmueller of the University of Michigan , Sherry A. Glied of Columbia , Anne Royalty of Indiana University - Purdue University of Indianapolis , and Katherine Swartz of Harvard .
Eliminating the tax exclusion , they wrote , “ would greatly reduce the number of people who obtain health insurance through their employers . ”
They put that figure at 20 million , and calculated that it would be offset at first by the 21 million who would be able to afford individual coverage using Mr. McCain ’s tax credits .
Within a few years , however , the trend would reverse , the study asserts .
That is because , according to Mr. Holtz - Eakin , the McCain health care tax credits would be indexed to “ regular inflation , ” presumably the Consumer Price Index , which is typically lower than annual increases in health care costs .
Unless costs can be substantially reined in , the credits would therefore enable fewer people to afford coverage each year , leading to an eventual rise in the number of uninsured .
Mr. Holtz - Eakin did not respond to a request for comment .
The estimates in Health Affairs are comparable to those made in July by the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution , which projected that 1 million people would gain coverage after one year under Mr. McCain ’s plan , that almost 5 million people would gain coverage after four years , and that the number of uninsured would then creep upward .
By comparison , Senator Barack Obama ’s plan , which would provide heavy government subsidies for insurance for low - income workers , would reduce the number of uninsured by 18 million in 2009 and by 34 million in 2018 , according to the Urban Institute / Brookings Institution report .
That would still leave Mr. Obama well shy of his goal of achieving universal coverage .
The arrests followed a lengthy counter - terrorism investigation Five men have been arrested under the Terrorism Act in a series of dawn raids across the Birmingham area .
The men , aged between 29 and 36 , are being held on suspicion of being involved in the commission , preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism .
The arrests were made at five separate addresses and searches were also being carried out at two business properties .
West Midlands Police said the action followed a complex investigation by its counter - terrorism unit .
Families supported
Throughout the day , officers have been searching the properties where the raids took place , located in Sparkhill , Ward End , Hodge Hill , Bordesley Green and Aston .
Another residential address in Stechford and business premises in central Birmingham and Kenilworth , in Warwickshire , were also being searched .
All his life , I have had no trouble from him
Sobat Khan , father Meanwhile , specially trained officers have been supporting the men's families and have been speaking to community leaders .
Sobat Khan , the father of one of the men arrested , has protested his son's innocence .
" My son is not bad , he is a good boy , " he said of 29 - year - old Mohammed Shabir , who was arrested at their home in Benton Road in Sparkhill .
" All his life , I have had no trouble from him .
He just goes to work , that is all . "
In a statement , police said they were not seeking anyone else at this stage and stressed the arrests were not related to any immediate plot or threat to the public .

What are these ?
Palestinians ceased to exist in the United States on Thursday night .
Both Joe Biden and Sarah Palin managed to avoid the use of that poisonous word .
" Palestine " and " Palestinians " – that most cancerous , slippery , dangerous concept – simply did not exist in the vice - presidential debate .
The phrase " Israeli occupation " was mercifully left unused .
Neither the words " Jewish colony " nor " Jewish settlement " – not even that cowardly old get - out clause of American journalism , " Jewish neighbourhood " – got a look - in .
Nope .
Those bold contenders of the US vice - presidency , so keen to prove their mettle when it comes to " defence " , hid like rabbits from the epicentre of the Middle East earthquake : the existence of a Palestinian people .
Sure , there was talk of a " two - state " solution , but it would have mystified anyone who did n't understand the region .
There was even a Biden jibe at George Bush for pressing on with " elections " – again , the adjective " Palestinian " went missing – that produced a Hamas victory .
But Hamas appeared to exist in never - never land , a vast landscape that gradually encompassed all the vast and black deserts that stretch , in the imagination of US politicians , from the Mediterranean to Pakistan .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" Pakistan 's ( nuclear ) missiles can already hit Israel , " Biden thundered .
But what was he talking about ?
Pakistan has not threatened Israel .
It 's supposed to be on our side .
Both vice - presidential candidates seemed to think that our ally in the " war on terror " was now turning into an ally of the axis of evil .
Even Islam did n't get a run for its money .
Indeed , one of the funniest reports of the week , yet another investigation of Obama 's education , came from the Associated Press news agency .
The would - be president , the Associated Press announced , had attended a Muslim school but had n't " practised " Islam .
What on earth did this mean , I asked myself ?
Would AP have reported , for example , that McCain had attended a Christian school but had n't " practised " Christianity ?
Then I got it .
Obama had smoked Islam but he had n't inhaled !
Travelling across the US this week – from Seattle to Houston to Washington and then to New York – I kept bumping into the results of America 's White House - induced terror .
A well - educated , upper - middle - class lady at a lunch turned to me and expressed her fear that Islam " wanted to take over America " .
When I suggested that this was pushing things a bit , she informed me that " the Muslims have already taken over France " .
How does one reply to this ?
It 's a bit like being informed by a perfectly sane and rational person that Martians have just landed in Tennessee .
So I used the old Fisk trick when confronted by ravers of the " admit George Bush did 9/11 " school .
I looked at my watch , adopted a shocked expression and shouted : " Gotta go ! "
But seriously .
There was Biden on Thursday night , telling us that along Pakistan 's border with Afghanistan – he was referring , of course , to the old frontier drawn by Sir Mortimer Durrand which most Pushtuns ( and thus all Taliban ) regard as fictional – " there have been 7,000 madrassas built ... and that 's where bin Laden lives and we will go at him if we have actually ( sic ) intelligence " .
Seven thousand ?
Where on earth does this figure come from ?
Yes , there are thousands of religious schools in Pakistan – but they 're not all on the border .
In another extraordinary bit of myth - making , Obama 's man told us that " we kicked the Hizbollah out of Lebanon " – which is totally untrue .
And , of course , Israel – a word that must be uttered , repeatedly , by all US candidates – became the compass point of the entire Middle East , this " peace - seeking nation ... our strongest and best ally in the Middle East " ( quoth Palin ) of whom " no one in the United States Senate has been a better friend ... than Joe Biden " ( quoth Biden ) .
Israel was " in jeopardy " if America talked to Iran , Palin revealed .
" We have got to assure them that we will never allow a second Holocaust . "
Thus was the corpse of Hitler dug up yet again – just as McCain resurrected the shadow of the Second World War last week when he blathered on about Eisenhower 's sense of responsibility before D - Day .
That Israel can quite adequately defend herself with 264 nuclear warheads went , of course , unmentioned , because acknowledging Israel 's real power undermines the image of a small and vulnerable country relying on America for its defence .
Israelis deserve security .
But where were the promises of security for Palestinians ?
Or the sympathy which Americans would immediately grant any other occupied people ?
Absent , needless to say .
For we must gird ourselves for the next struggle against world evil in Pakistan .
Biden actually demanded a " stable " government in Islamabad , which was a little bit hypocritical only a few days after US troops had crossed its sovereign border to shoot up a Pakistani house allegedly used by the Taliban .
As General David Petraeus told The New York Times this week , " The trends in Afghanistan have been in the wrong direction ... wresting control of certain areas from the Taliban will be very difficult . "
It 's an odd situation .
Obama and Biden want to close down Iraq and re-conquer Afghanistan .
The Palin College of Clichés characterised this as " a white flag of surrender in Iraq " while continuing to warn of the dangers of Iran , the name of whose loony president – Ahmadinejad – defeated McCain three times in last week 's pseudo - debate .
But it 's the same old story .
All we have learned in America these past two weeks , to quote Joan Littlewood 's Oh !
What a Lovely War , is that the war goes on .
Games and virtual reality simulators are becoming increasingly popular tools for training both mental and physical .
VR simulations and games are already in use by the army , various police forces , and even in certain medical areans as well .
If a new pilot program called " InSight " pans out for Allstate , though , the next place you could be seeing video games is at the local DMV .
Allstate is currently piloting a new program which seeks to find out if playing driving video games could make better drivers out of those over 50 .
If the study shows that it can , the insurance company plans to offer discounts to mature drivers who pass the online tests and the current , single - state pilot would be spread across other states next year .
The initial run at the program is taking place in Pennsylvania .
Select customers in the state aged 50 to 75 will be brought in to test out the special games as part of a free option in the customers ' current insurance plan .
The total number of hours played by this experimental group will be tracked and then accident rates will be compared to a control group that had no contact with the games .
" As Allstate seeks ways to reinvent protection for the consumer , we are taking intelligent risks that are focused on finding new ways to bring value to our customers , " a company spokesperson said in a statement .
" This innovative approach to improving driver awareness and reaction time has the potential to significantly reduce accidents .
That would make the roads safer — and potentially save lives . "
Posit Science , a software developer from San Francisco , is behind the games in question .
Surprisingly , the games are n't actually driving simulators , but rather various types of other brain - challenging games specifically designed to test and improve certain mental capacities .
Unlike most brain - fitness software , InSight is designed to " reverse age - related cognitive decline and greatly improve a driver 's visual alertness , " according to a company press release .
InSight claims that its software can reduce dangerous driving maneuvers by up to 40 percent and significantly increase reaction rates for stopping distance and lower general crash risk as well .
Jewel Diver is one of five games
Allstate is using to test driver 's sight and reaction times .
Allstate made one of the games available for press and the public to try out .
Jewel Diver : Divided Attention , one of the five adaptive games in the InSight suite , tests the player 's ability to track multiple moving objects at once .
The theory is that the ability will essentially correlate to the user 's ability to track many vehicles on the road .
Jewel Diver is a very simplistic web - based game .
The game begins by showing the location of a number of red gems .
The red gems are then hidden within the bodies of fish .
The screen is then populated with other , similar - looking fish before the lot of them are shuffled around .
The player must then correctly click on the fish containing the red gems .
It 's very similar to the classic " three shells and a pea " game .
Both managing editor Eric Bangeman and myself gave the game a go .
I , a 24 - year - old male with 20 / 20 vision , a perfect driving record , and nearly 20 years of gaming experience , topped out at tracking 3.56 jewels at a time , while Eric , a 40 - year - old male with crappy vision and a driving record unblemished for the last 13 years , managed to track 4.22 jewels at a time .
Contrast this with the data indicated following the test , which states that the average 20 - year - old can successfully track almost 25 percent more than the average 50 - year - old — and almost twice as much as an 80 - year - old .
Allstate says that the increase in older drivers across the nation is a driving force behind the new initiative , citing a study that shows an 18 percent increase in the number of drivers aged 65 or older from 1996 to 2006 .
The company points out that this number " will only continue to rise as those from the baby boomer generation become seniors . "
Games have proven to be successful tools in various other training capacities , specifically when it comes to hand - eye coordination and mental awareness , so seeing an insurance company attempt to leverage them for older drivers is n't entirely surprisingly .
That said , the InSight project is another important advance in games ' increasingly prominent role in today 's society .
And hey , if the pilot does n't work out , at least we know that the A.I. for the games will wind up taking over the driving for the driver anyway .
World 's oldest man dies at the age of 138
According to records Habib Mianindias was born on May 28 , 1870
A great - grand father believed to be the world 's oldest man has died at the age of 138 .
Habib Mian passed away early yesterday morning after a brief illness at his home in the Alwar district , Rajasthan , India .
According to records Habib was born on May 28 , 1870 .
The grand old man was a witness to the life and times of two kings of Jaipur , the dominance of the British Raj and the decades after the Jaipur princely state of the erstwhile Rajputana merged into the Indian Union after Independence .
The Limca Book of World Records recognises him as the oldest living man in the world in its 2005 edition .
But the Guinness Book of Records did not give him this recognition because his pension papers say he was born on May 20 , 1878 at Rajgarh in Alwar district .
Habib Mian also held the distinction of being the oldest Haj pilgrim having visited Mecca in 2004 and the longest beneficiary of old age pension which he has received since 1938 .
Dead at 138 : Habib Mian is burried in Jaipur
Habib , who outlived his wife by 70 years , was buried at the Ghat Gate graveyard in the Alwar district , after the " Zuhar " ( afternoon ) prayers .
Though his birthday had become a public event ever his age came to people 's notice , Habib Mian did not celebrate the day this year as he was distressed by the May 13 serial blasts in the city that claimed 68 lives .
Mourners pay tribute to Habib Mian who was born on the 28th of May 1870
Reinvention is coming , but here are 10 reasons why we should n't expect the newspaper industry to lead it :
In other words , the industry is already in the midst of an interregnum , most metro newspapers will not survive it , and those that reach the other side will bear scant resemblance to their 2008 ancestors .
That 's a radical change from what I believed in 2005 - 06 , but the abject failure of our industry to act upon what it knew then ( thanks in large part to John and a few other pioneers ) portends doom for most American metro papers now .
The chance to act with foresight in advance of the coming wave came and went , and now these once - proud press flagships are swamped , broken and sinking .
So do I .
But here lies the rub : I no longer believe that ( non-national ) metro newspapers will play a significant role in the reinvention of the press in its 21st century configuration .
1. Newspapers ' core audience still does n't want change , but they 're aging and they like a product that nobody else wants .
The newspaper dilemma : Change the product in hopes of attracting new readers and you piss off your loyal core .
Do nothing and you 'll watch your circulation drop every day on the obituary page .
All too often , newspaper management responds by promoting bizarre changes that do n't attract new customers and alienate existing ones .
2 . The culture of newspaper management is a dysfunctional relic of a low - bandwidth , monopoly era .
It still has n't adapted to the lessons of Web 2.0 , it 's generally beholden to a short - term stock price instead of a long - term re-investment strategy and it simply refuses to accept that you can't expect 20 profit margins in a competitive market .
Instead of leading , it is a legacy anchor .
3 . The culture of newsroom leadership contains a fatal 20th century flaw : A fundamental belief that equates all new trends with dangerous " fads . "
Newsrooms do n't trail the leading edge simply because they 're too dumb to keep up :
They 're behind because their editorial leadership believes that keeping pace with rapid change is a fool 's errand .
Many senior editors do n't simply fear change -- they resent change that succeeds without their endorsement .
4 . No budget for research , development or training means most newspapers can't see what 's coming , do n't have the necessary tools for survival and could n't use those new tools effectively anyway ( Hey news executives !
Try this newsroom pop quiz :
Give each staff member a pencil and tell everyone to stop what they 're doing and write out the tag that creates a hypertext link .
If most can't , you 're not spending enough on training .
If anyone in your management team can't , you 've got a crisis ) .
It 's also a sign of a dirty little secret :
Many papers gave up on staff development several rounds of budget cuts ago .
5. Newspapers do n't " own " enough creative technological expertise ( programmers , database / mashup designers , XHTML / CSS coders , video editors , Flash animators , graphic communicators , etc ) to constitute a viable tech infrastructure .
Instead , most newspaper payrolls are bloated with pluralities of resentful Luddites who struggle with the complexities of e-mail .
6. Inertia , uncertainty and toxic paralysis rule most newspaper companies .
Even if newspapers promoted strong , visionary leaders to positions of authority tomorrow , most would still fail to implement their best ideas fast enough to catch up to their already - accelerating new - media competition .
What 's worse , even when companies are lucky enough to find innovators ( such as Smith and Savalli from Spokane ) they 're often ether marginalized or scapegoated as slow - to - react companies founder in panic and greed .
7. Individual ad - reps still make more money selling print ads than Web ads .
Until Web becomes the primary profit - center within newspaper companies , all the incentives within their business operations will point toward the status quo .
It 's hard to believe , but Web ads are still merely " upsell " throw -ins to print - advertising contracts at many papers .
It 's practical short - term tactics vs. long - term business strategy .
8. Newspapers have already lost one of their key selling points : Social currency .
In 2008 , all meaningful political discourse -- the essential element of social currency -- takes place on the Web .
Print ( and televised ) political coverage is now but a pale shadow of the real action online .
9 . The connection between quality and profitability has been broken irreparably .
Boosting short - term profits by cutting quality is obviously a losing strategy , and the recent wave of newspaper layoffs and buyouts only exacerbated the trend .
Editors will admit this privately , but the public already knows .
10 . Finally : Newspaper companies hate modern journalism .
Yes , that 's an enormously over - broad tarbrush , but this is a message I want to deliver via 2x4 : Newspapers companies will not survive the transition to the multimedia future so long as the people within those companies oppose the rules , conventions and culture of that future .
You 'll never successfully reinvent your company if you 're punishing the innovators , killing the messengers , rewarding the political infighters and sneering down your noses at the " pajamas - clad rabble " you blame for your troubles .
Well , you say , what can be done ?
That 's really not my problem at the moment , but I 've got some ideas on that subject .
If a good discussion evolves here in comments we can talk about it .
If not , no great loss .
From those surveyed , almost a third of people ( 32 per cent ) said they woke up to the sound of either their television or radio and nearly three - quarters ( 71 per cent ) said listening to the television or radio or using their computer was the last thing they did before going to sleep at night .
Your digital camera is a diligent archivist .
Each time it captures an image , it records the time the photo was taken as well as the settings that were used — details you can use later to help track down the photo in your collection .
For most of us , though , it ’s easier to remember where we took a picture than to remember when .
However , most digital cameras do n’t possess this sort of location awareness .
Two exceptions include the $ 500 Nikon Coolpix P6000 and the iPhone 3G ( or the original iPhone with the 2.0 software update ) .
For photos taken with other cameras , you can easily embed the coordinates after the fact through a process called geotagging .
Geotagged images provide you with a new way of sorting and organizing your photos .
For example , you can search for pictures shot in a particular locale or create an interactive map of your latest vacation showing not only where you went , but also images from points along the route .
But before you can take advantage of any of these features , you have to tag your images with geographic information .
Fortunately , there ’s now a wide variety of Mac tools that can get the job done .
Adding Geotags
When you geotag an image , you ’re simply storing latitude and longitude coordinates for that image in the file ’s metadata .
This means you ’ll first need to get those coordinates .
Using Google Earth
One of the easiest ways to do this is with Google Earth ( ) , Google ’s free , three - dimensional , navigable model of the globe .
Simply download the software , use the search and navigation tools to locate the destination of your photo , then add a placemark ( Add : Placemark ) to get exact coordinates .
You ’ll also need a program that can insert those coordinates into your files .
While there are lots of programs that do this , I prefer Stanton Software ’s free Geotagger which works in conjunction with Google Earth .
Once you ’ve pinpointed a location in Google Earth , drag the photos you want to tag with those coordinates onto the Geotagger application icon .
Geotagger will automatically launch , retrieve the latitude and longitude from the location you chose in Google , and embed it in the metadata of your images .
From iPhoto
If you ’re an iPhoto user , you ’ll need to geotag your images with Geotagger before you import them into iPhoto .
For photos already in your iPhoto library , you can add geotagging data with the help of Ovolab ’s $ 25 Geophoto .
Like Google Earth , Geophoto presents you with an interactive globe .
Click on the Media button to import images from your iPhoto or Aperture library , and then drag them onto the map to tag them with specific locations ( see “ Geophoto ” ) .
The globe view does n’t get as close to a location as Google Earth does ; however , you can use the small Google Map panel on the left to zoom in closer and locate specific positions — even street - level addresses .
Once you ’ve placed your images , select Item : Update Original With Location Information to add the GPS data to the original photos in your iPhoto library .
This data stays with the newly updated files even if you later export the photos to use elsewhere .
Geophoto also works as a viewing program ; you can see your images scattered about the globe or perform geography - based searches .
Viewing and Sharing Geotagged Images
Once you ’ve gone to the trouble of geotagging your images , there are a lot of ways to exploit the location data now embedded inside them .
If you ’re running Mac OS X 10.5 , for example , you can quickly map any geotagged photo with the help of Preview .
Simply open the image in Preview ( iPhoto users must first export the image ) and then select Tools : Inspector .
If the image has been geotagged , you ’ll find a GPS tab within the Inspector window ’s More Info pane .
Click on the Locate button , and Preview will open your Web browser and show you that location using Google Maps .
But why limit the enjoyment to just yourself ?
With very little effort , you can create custom maps and displays of your photo - studded trip and share them with others .
From iPhoto
If you ’re an iPhoto user , try Stanton Software ’s free iPhoto plug - in iPhotoToGoogleEarth , which will export a KMZ file of your geotagged images .
KMZ files are Google Earth data files that contain location data , images , and more .
After installing iPhotoToGoogleEarth , you simply select the geotagged images that you want to see in Google Earth , and then choose iPhotoToGoogleEarth from iPhoto ’s Export dialog box .
Enter a name that you ’d like to appear on the images in Google Earth and then click on Export .
Next , name the KMZ file , and then select a destination on your hard drive .
Double - click on the resulting file to open it in Google Earth .
You should see a photo icon on the planet at each location with which your images were tagged .
Double click on the photo icon to view a larger version .
To share your trip with others , simply send them the resulting KMZ file via e-mail ( they ’ll need to have Google Earth installed ) .
When they open it up , they ’ll see your images pinned to their correct locations .
From the Finder
If you ’re not an iPhoto user and still want to see your geotagged images in Google Earth , use Houdah Software ’s HoudahGeo , which automatically pins your images to their correct locations .
At [ euro ] 25 , HoudahGeo is a little pricey .
But if you have a GPS device , the program can also pull a log file from it and use that to tag your images .
And like iPhotoToGoogleEarth , the program will export a KMZ file that you can share with others .
From Flickr
The popular photo - sharing site Flickr also fully supports location metadata , and lets you view your images on a map or search for images tagged with particular locations .
To activate this feature , log in , select You : Your Account from the top of the page , and then select the Privacy & Permissions tab .
Click on the Edit button next to the Import EXIF Location Data option and follow the directions .
Now , when you import geotagged images , you can use the Map tab to see the photos displayed in their proper locations .
Want to see others ’ photos ?
Choose Explore : World Map to browse for images by location as well as other tags .
By the way , Flickr includes its own geotagging interface .
However , once you ’ve done this , you ca n’t easily get your tagged data out and apply it to your original image files — which means you ca n’t use it with other applications .
It ’s better to geotag your images before uploading them to Flickr .
Geotagging Hardware
Although software solutions let you geotag your images once you get home , they also require a lot of work .
If you ’re serious about geotagging , you may want to consider investing in a device that can automate the process .
f you already have a GPS unit , you can use HoudahGeo to synchronize route information with your photos .
If you do n’t have a GPS unit , a couple of devices will do something similar :
ATP PhotoFinder
This $ 90 device is powered by two AAA batteries for eight hours of use .
You simply turn on the Photo Finder and wait for it to lock on the GPS signal .
Then make sure your digital camera ’s clock matches the time displayed on the PhotoFinder and go about your way .
The PhotoFinder records a log of everywhere you go .
When you ’re done shooting , insert your camera ’s SD card ( or plug an external card reader ) into the PhotoFinder and it will match the time of each image to your recorded location , and add latitude and longitude to your images automatically ( I ’ve found that , depending on its view of the sky , it can be off by as much as 100 yards ) .
Currently , the PhotoFinder only works with JPEG files .
Gisteq PhotoTrackr
The $ 100 PhotoTrackr is slightly smaller than the PhotoFinder and requires a single AA battery for up to three weeks of use .
Like the PhotoFinder , the PhotoTrackr maintains a log of your locations , but it does n’t have a media slot .
Instead , you use the included software to add the data to your images .
However , in my tests it ’s location data was a little more accurate than the PhotoFinder — though neither device was perfectly accurate .
Do n’t Get Lost
While you may not need to geotag all of your images , if you establish a smooth geotagging workflow , you ’ll probably find it easy enough to at least tag each image with a city or general location .
Once you have a tagged library , you can start exploring some of the ways that you can browse and play with your tagged images .

What happened when the world 's smallest man met the woman with the longest legs
One is the smallest man in the world , the other is the woman with the longest legs and the instructions from the former to the latter when they met this morning : ' Do n't look up . '
At just 29.37in tall , He Ping Ping 's little head barely reaches Svetlana Pankrtova 's knees .
But then , her legs do go on a fair way - measuring 51.96 in long .
A right knees up :
The world 's smallest man , He Ping Ping , and the woman with the longest legs in the world , Svetlana Pankratova , get together in London this morning
At 6ft 7in from head to toe , Pankratova is well short of being the tallest living woman .
That honour goes to Yao Defen , who stands 7ft 9in .
But the Russian 's relatively short body means that those pins are the longest ever recorded for a woman .
An impression she seemed keen to emphasise this morning by wearing what appeared to be the world 's shortest skirt .
Not that He Ping Ping seemed to mind , happily posing underneath Pankratova 's legs - and he even had a sneaky look up .
The 20 - year - old had jetted in from his home in northern China to help launch the latest edition of the Guinness World Records Book in Trafalgar Square , Central London .
Brought to book : Little and large on the steps of the National Gallery this morning .
The pair appear for the first time in this year 's edition
Craig Glenday , the book 's editor , recently told the Daily Record newspaper how much he enjoyed his work .
He said : ' It 's a great job , and there 's so much travel involved .
Earlier this year I did my own world record for travel , which was 44 hours non-stop .
' I was in Inner Mongolia meeting He Ping Ping , the world 's shortest man ( 74.61 cm ) who actually lives quite near Bao Xi Shun , the world 's tallest man ( 2 m 36.1 cm ) .
' I was on my way , via Paris , to Chile for a flight to Antarctica with the band Fall Out Boy , who were trying to set a record for the shortest time it would take to play on every continent in the world .
' Unfortunately the weather was so bad that we could n't make it in the end . '
The Guinness World Record Book is out tomorrow .
PinpPing sits on a piles of the new book while Pankratova stretches out her long , long legs
More of the world 's weirdest records !
It is one of the best - selling books of all time , published in 25 languages in more than 100 countries .
HONG KONG ( MarketWatch ) --
The bombshell of Lehman Brothers ' plan to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection ripped across Asian markets Monday , pounding financial shares in Sydney , though some of the other major regional bourses delayed the hit due to holiday closures .
The Lehman LEH , news sent the U.S. dollar sharply lower against the yen , while stock futures pointed to a plunge of more than 300 points for the Dow Jones Industrial Average .

Reports said the firm is seeking a bridge loan from the Federal Reserve .
Several key regional markets managed to side - step the full force of the financial blowout , at least for now , thanks to holiday closures in Japan , China , Hong Kong and South Korea .
Sydney 's benchmark S&P / ASX 200 closed 1.8 % lower at 4,817.70 .

" The process of destroying bank capital is about three - quarters done , but the fallout from that has only just begun , " he said .
The U.S. dollar , which had ended with gains last week , fell to 105.34 yen at mid-afternoon in Singapore , from 107.90 yen late Friday in New York .
Gold bullion for October delivery jumped $ 11 to $ 772.00 an ounce in electronic trading .
Crude oil for October delivery fell below the $ 100 threshold , hitting $ 96.81 a barrel , down $ 4.37 for the session .
Asian stocks appeared to draw little support from the announcement that Bank of America BAC , - 1.32 % had agreed to buy Merrill Lynch & Co. MER , +27.69 % for roughly $ 29 a share , following a frenzied 48 - hour negotiation .
The boards of the two firms have approved the merger .
However , reports of new liquidity - pumping measures seemed to provide some support , helping lift stocks from session lows , although the mood among market participants remained gloomy .
The Wall Street Journal reported that given Lehman 's situation , the Federal Reserve is expected to expand its lending facilities , taking a wider array of securities -- including equities -- as collateral for loans .
A group of global banks and securities firms , including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group , said early Monday they would back a $ 70 billion loan program designed to help financial companies access lines of credit .
" This only compounds the flight to safety that we 've been seeing in markets over the past several weeks , " said David Cohen , Singapore - based director of Asia economic forecasting at Action Economic , referring to the faltered plan to rescue Lehman .

An official release date has n’t been announced as of yet .
Since this update gives greater bluetooth headset support and support to the official headset , the Socom Bundles being released today would make you believe that the update should go live sometime today .
No promises .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Wal - Mart Stores Inc said on Friday it has warned U.S. store managers in recent weeks about the possible consequences of a labor - friendly bill backed by Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama that would make it easier for workers to form unions .

Wal - Mart said on Friday it has held meetings with U.S. store managers warning them of issues that could arise if Democrats win power and pass a law that would make it easier for workers to unionize , but stressed it was not telling workers how to vote .

But the retailer , which has kept its U.S. stores free of unions , stressed it was not telling employees how to vote .
The Wall Street Journal reported that about a dozen employees who attended meetings in seven states said executives had told them that unionization could force Wal - Mart to cut jobs as labor costs rise , and that employees would have to pay hefty union dues and get nothing in return .
The Journal said Wal - Mart human - resources managers who run the meetings do not specifically tell attendees how to vote in November ’s presidential election , but they make it clear that voting for Obama would be tantamount to inviting unions in .
“ If anyone representing Wal - Mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote , they were wrong and acting without approval , ” Wal - Mart spokesman David Tovar said .
Wal - Mart opposes proposed legislation called the Employee Free Choice
Act that would make it easier for workers to unionize , by signing a card rather than holding a vote .
Obama , a co-sponsor of the original bill , has called for passage of the act .
Last June , presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain voted against it .
“ We believe EFCA is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time , ” Tovar said .
“ We feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do . ”
Wal - Mart has long been the target of union - backed groups that criticize the retailer for everything from its pay practices to its health care benefits .
News of the store manager meetings drew the ire of Wal - Mart critic groups Wal - Mart Watch and WakeUpWalMart.com , as well as the AFL - CIO labor federation .
“ Wal - Mart has once again been exposed for what it really is : a corporation that will go to any length to put profits ahead of its workers , ” Meghan Scott , spokeswoman for WakeUpWalMart.com , said in a statement .
“ Wal - Mart has talked a lot about changing its ways on health care , the environment and workers rights , but this article shows that all that talk has n’t translated into action , ” she said .
The art of burying invisible malware deep inside a Linux machine is about to go mainstream , thanks to a new open - source rootkit released Thursday by Immunity Inc. , a firm that supplies tools for penetration testers .
When implemented , Immunity 's DR , or Debug Register , makes backdoors and other types of malware extremely difficult to detect or eradicate .
It 's notable because it cloaks itself by burrowing deep inside a server 's processor and availing itself of debugging mechanisms available in Intel 's chip architecture .
The rootkit , in other words , mimics a kernel debugger .
By exploiting a CPU 's native ability to generate interrupts , DR escapes some of the pitfalls that have visited more traditional types of rootkits , which modify an operating system 's system call table .
That 's of increasing importance as more and more Linux distributions make it harder to make changes to the syscall table and rootkit detection programs such as chkrootkit and rkhunter actively check for such modifications .
Over the past few years , a growing body of malware has incorporated rootkits , making detection much harder .
Until now , the benefit of using a rootkit was counterbalanced by the difficulty of building one .
DR , which is available here under version 2 of the general public license , will make it profoundly easier .
" In the old days , to attack a computer , you needed to 1 ) find a bug , 2 ) write an exploit , 3 ) run the exploit 4 ) hide yourself , " Charlie Miller , principal security analyst for Independent Security Evaluators , said in an email .
" The gap between a script kiddie and a hacker just got a little smaller . "
While DR simplifies the task of cloaking nasty malware on Linux boxes , it does n't support symmetric multiprocessing or actively hide itself at the kernel level .
The good news is that those are shortcomings that limit the rootkit 's functionality and make it easier to detect .
The bad news : these features could be added with about a week 's worth of development time .
Indeed , Immunity is offering commercial support for DR as part of its Canvas toolkit , so stay tuned . ®
Now this is some serious computer theft .
We 're talking 19,709 pieces of stolen computer equipment from the US Naval Research Laboratory in Washington , DC .
The theft included everything from PCs and printer toner to hard drives , software and other office equipment amounting to over $ 120,000 according to court documents and published reports .
The systems administrator , Victor Papagno plead guilty in federal court today to stealing the items in a period between 1997 and 2007 to benefit Papagno and his friends , reports said .
He took so much stuff that he stored some of it in neighbors ' houses , according to WTOP.com a local news outlet .
That report indicated that no secret technological information had been taken but that private information from 14 employees and contractors who worked at the laboratory from 1998 to 2002 had been found on CDs or zip drives , and those people were contacted , the agency said .
Sentencing is set for December when Papagno could face up to two years in jail for the thefts .
The US Naval Research Laboratory calls itself the Navy 's corporate laboratory and conducts all manner of scientific research .
Gadget buyers today can purchase PCs , cell phones and mp3 players with significantly more memory than their predecessors for just a few dollars more than they paid a few years ago .
To wit : you can purchase an 80 - gigabyte iPod today for the same price ( around $ 250 ) you paid for one with just 30 gigabytes of memory two years ago .
But consumers are in for a rude awakening if technology makers fail to find a way to shrink memory components enough to continue packing more of them into ever - tinier gadgets .
Computers and other electronic devices use different types of memory to perform different functions .
PCs use a hard disk drive , for example , to store large amounts of data for the long term and Random Access Memory ( RAM ) — also called " solid state " memory — to retain data outside the hard drive , where it can be accessed quickly and repeatedly .
In an attempt to ensure that memory is not sacrificed with size , however , device makers are eyeing an experimental approach called " universal memory , " which not only takes up less space but is also faster than the RAM now available .
Currently only a handful of companies are investing in the budding technology , but that could change as new forms of universal memory emerge , most notably IBM's " racetrack " memory and Nantero , Inc. 's nano RAM ( NRAM ) .
These join slightly more mature — yet still unproven — universal memories such as magnetoresistive RAM ( MRAM ) , which uses magnetic polarization to store information permanently on a device 's microprocessor , and " phase change " memory , which stores data in a glassy substance called chalcogenide as it is heated and its atoms are rearranged .
Each type of solid - state memory ( which includes static RAM , dynamic RAM and flash ) has its benefits and drawbacks .
" Because of cost , it 's often impractical to have all three , so the designer needs to make hard choices and sacrifice something ( such as speed , battery life , et cetera ) and go with only one or two out of the three memory types , " says Greg Schmergel , Nantero 's co-founder , president and chief executive officer .
SRAM , often used for cache memory in microprocessors , can rapidly read and write data without sucking up a lot of power , but it cannot hold as much data as DRAM .
DRAM , however , is slower than SRAM and requires more power , making it impractical for portable devices running on batteries .
Flash 's main advantage is that it retains information ( such as an address book in a cell phone ) even when the device is powered down , but it is not as fast or as durable as its counterparts , which means too much use will cause it to wear out and lose data .
To create NRAM , Woburn , Mass . –based Nantero places billions of carbon nanotubes on a silicon chip to store data .
When an electrostatic force is applied , the carbon nanotubes move up and down to represent the 0s or 1s of data .
The company has demonstrated , Schmergel says , that NRAM 's approach has the speed and capacity to surpass other memory types and that it can be manufactured in existing chip - making facilities ( called fabs ) .
The question is whether major chipmakers such as Intel , Micron or Samsung can be persuaded that NRAM can be efficiently and reliably manufactured in high volume .
Researchers at IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose , Calif. , meanwhile , are placing their bets on racetrack memory , which stores data in a magnetic pattern on thousands of nanowires — each 1,000 times thinner than a human hair — arranged on a silicon chip .
Pulses of electrical current use the spin of electrons to move the entire data pattern along the wire as though on a racetrack ( hence the name ) .
Using the electron 's spin , rather than its charge , may allow for devices that consume much less energy , says Stuart Parkin , an IBM Fellow and manager of Almaden 's magnetoelectronics group .
IBM projects that it could , within the next decade , enable a handheld device such as an mp3 player to store about 500,000 songs or 3,500 movies — 100 times more than is possible today — without increasing the device 's cost or decreasing battery life .
Chipmakers are reluctant to use a new , unproven type of memory on their microprocessors that might raise the price tag of their products .
" RAM is placed on the silicon chips used in electronic devices , and the companies that make these chips have it down to a science , " says Jim Handy , a director with Objective Analysis , a semiconductor market - research firm based in Los Gatos , Calif .
" Every year , they put more memory on smaller chips while keeping their prices relatively steady .
The whole idea with memory is the cheapest wins . "
However , as chipmakers such as Intel continually shrink the size of their chips so they can act as the brains of increasingly smaller devices , they need new approaches to memory that combine the best assets of solid - state and hard - disk memory and keeps costs comparable , if not lower .
" Consumers expect that , for the same price they paid last year for a cell phone , they can get a new one this year with more memory , " says Handy , who adds that the role of universal memory is to allow this trend to continue .
Flash memory is the cheapest , currently costing about $ 3 per gigabyte ( a price that 's expected to drop 40 percent by next year ) .
Similarly , DRAM , which costs about $ 9 per gigabyte will likely cost about $ 6 per gigabyte next year .
SRAM goes for about $ 100 per gigabyte and does not change much in price from year to year .
It 's hard to say how much universal memory will cost in any of its potential incarnations .
" Price projections for new memory technologies are not usually worth the paper they are printed on before those technologies have reached volume production , " Handy says .
Costs could go down once the technology catches on and is in full - scale production .
In addition , manufacturers would be able to make smaller computer chips ( that use less silicon ) if universal memory is more compact than flash , DRAM or SRAM .
That would mean smaller , more powerful electronics for many years to come .
Outline
Federalist 9 begins by stating “ a firm Union will be of the utmost moment to the peace and liberty of the States , as a barrier against domestic faction and insurrection . ”
After that opening , and an initial barrage against the “ petty republics of Greece and Italy ” which never had a stable peace , there are 10 more paragraphs :
Paragraph 2 . “ Advocates of despotism ” use the “ petty republics ” to decry not merely “ republican government , ” but “ the very principles of civil liberty . ”
However , “ stupendous fabrics reared on the basis of liberty ” have “ refuted their gloomy sophisms . ”
Paragraph 3 .
There truly are problems with petty republics , and the “ advocates of despotism , ” um , have a point .
But “ the science of politics … has received great improvement [! ] ”
Thing was , the poor ancients , they understood politics “ imperfectly ” or did n’t know the principles that made politics work at all .
So what are the improvements in the “ science of politics ? ”
“ The regular distribution of power into distinct departments ” “ the introduction of legislative balances and checks ” “ the institution of courts composed of judges holding their offices during good behavior ” “ the representation of people in the legislature by deputies of their own election ”
Hamilton says these are “ wholly new discoveries , ” or “ have made their principal progress towards perfection in modern times , ” because clearly no one could ever figure out before that voting for a representative was a good thing , and no one cared if judges were corrupt before .
To his “ wholly new discoveries , ” he adds a fifth “ discovery , ” one that sounds suspiciously like something the United States is stuck with more than dependent on : “ the enlargement of the orbit ” (# 5 ) , i.e. the Union is going to comprised of States ( a “ confederated republic ” ) and will be massive .
Paragraph 4 . Confederacy of this sort – for the sake of “ tranquility ” internal and “ external force and security ” – is n’t new .
Some people say the republic should be “ contracted , ” and cite Montesquieu to make this argument .
But Montesquieu is not of so firm a belief as them .
Paragraph 5 .
If you want the republics to be as small as what Montesquieu “ recommends , ” you ’d have to break up the States into smaller pieces .
Paragraph 6 .
You could reduce the states in size , but the possibility of confederate government would not be disallowed still .
Paragraph 7 . Montesquieu is quoted with an eye to “ reconciling the advantages of monarchy [!] with those of republicanism . ”
Paragraph 8 . See ?
The “ tendency of the Union [ is ] to repress domestic faction and insurrection . ”
The quotes by Montesquieu above , of course , talk about states ganging up on one state they do n’t like in the Confederated Republic ( either it is an “ usurper , ” or it might experience “ popular insurrection ” ) , and crushing it for the sake of “ internal happiness . ”
Paragraph 9 . Confederacy vs. consolidation of the States .
People argue that a confederacy should n’t care for any aspect of “ internal administration , ” and there should be “ an exact equality of suffrage between the members . ”
Hamilton dismisses these notions , symbolic but not necessarily constitutive of liberty and equality generally , as “ the cause of incurable disorder and imbecility in the government . ”
Paragraph 10 .
Hamilton says that “ the proposed Constitution , so far from implying an abolition of the State governments , makes them constituent parts of the national sovereignty , by allowing them a direct representation in the Senate , and leaves in their possession certain exclusive and very important portions of sovereign power , ” thus completely attempting to refute the argument in the paragraph above .
Paragraph 11 .
An ancient example of a Confederate Republic is given , one that seems to correspond to how representatives in the House are now delegated .
Popular representation is the order of the day , as the “ largest ” cities got the most votes .
Comments ( to be changed / expanded upon later ) :
The center of the list – the middle paragraph – is the key .
It is there the issue of Union becomes that of “ confederate government ” ( cf. Machiavelli , Discoursi Bk. 3 ) .
What happens is that “ size ” no longer is a concern for Hamilton in that paragraph .
“ Size ” is metaphorical – in ancient discussions of politics , cf. Plato , Aristotle , Cicero – size stands for whether a city will be moderate or not , whether it will educate in virtue or not .
A small city is not imperial .
Empire is more than conquest : it is a rejection of the idea that there are limits in life .
The city that expands is implicitly telling its citizens that the world is their playground .
So when “ size ” is dismissed , what is really being dismissed is any concern for the formation of moderate citizens .
We are not going to teach a sense of value to our citizens ; that ’s the province of “ freedom of conscience . ”
Even knowledge in this political order will be a form of acquisition – i.e. the emphasis on technology , on practical schooling .
This is the deep reason why the ancients were wrong : they were concerned to have a happy , moderate people .
The concern in this paper is security exclusively – take especial note of Paragraph 4 .
Hence the logic of Constitutionalism does cut against “ states rights , ” and even against a Bill of Rights to a degree : this is n’t Hamilton being sneaky , or Thomas Paine and other people who insist on “ rights ” being correct .
If there is no security , you can forget about rights of any sort , and do notice that under “ states rights ” there ’s always , no matter how peacefully the argument is put in tone , the threat of secession and insurrection , even now .
The ancient concern for moderation is a stronger ground than “ states rights ” or “ rights ” generally , because it can not be refuted by the logic of the Constitution as thoroughly as an insistence on “ rights ” can .
The ancient concern for moderation means there is a distinction between simply living and living well .
The latter takes precedence .
But “ simply living ” is all that an insistence on rights adds up to ultimately :
Who is anyone to say what is the right way to live ?
So what ends up happening is that Hamilton ’s / Madison ’s / Montesquieu ’s / Machiavelli ’s logic wins out , and it wins out in the most subtle way .
After all , the states are preserved – they ’re left intact more than they might be if a national council was formed .
The only thing is , they play a new role in Union .
They oppose the federal government .
The federal government opposes it .
The federal government is divided into three branches which oppose each other .
Elections in those branches pit people voted directly by all Americans ( representatives ) against Senators ( from state legislatures ) against a Judiciary ( from the President and the Senate ) against the President ( the Electoral College , set up so there is not one popular vote or vote by a state legislator directly ) .
Get the idea ?
The fundamental difference between ancient and modern politics is that we consign politics to mechanism .
No one can truly be trusted to rule .
A moderate , virtuous society , on the other hand , can theoretically allow everyone to rule and obey in the highest sense .
Here , we just set people up against each other and let the system run .
What makes the mechanism “ work ” is the same thing that always threatens to tear it apart : factionalism , or unleashed passion .
That ’s why “ states rights ” succumbs completely to the Machiavellian logic – if the desire for empire defines every single person , and if the insistence on “ right ” is merely a claim to dominion by each individual over the other , then the system that works best is the system that allows all to compete against each so no one can ever win .
Of course , there are several deep problems with this logic , which we ’re facing now .
In short :
We ’re all dumb .
There ’s no way around this .
We ’re imperial even when we try to be moderate .
Where is the money for all those socialist programs Obama wants going to come from ?
Oh yeah , that depends on us being the most powerful and wealthiest country in the history of the world , I forgot about that .
How do we know when the system is working , or is threatened ?
Ultimately , the politics of mechanism exist to instantiate the popular will .
So should I look at our cultural decline as not that important , and only focus on how Constitutional form has changed ?
But if I do that , how do I know exactly when Constitutional form has changed for the worse , given that the Constitution itself was made purposely malleable ?
News in Science
' Old - boys club ' holding back innovation
Science needs to break free of its power - brokers and embrace a participatory web - based culture to boost innovation , says one expert .
John Wilbanks , of Science Commons - a project of Creative Commons - says the plethora of machine - generated data , that characterises today 's scientific activity , needs the power of open networks to make sense of it properly .
" The value of any individual piece of knowledge is about the value of any individual piece of lego , " Wilbanks said in a keynote address to the Open Access and Research Conference held in Brisbane last week .
" It 's not that much until you put it together with other legos . "
He says the ability to connect knowledge brings scientific revolutions .
For example Watson and Crick 's breakthrough on the structure of DNA involved them reading all the scientific papers on nucleotide bonding and encoding it in the form of a physical model , says Wilbanks .
But this kind of " human scale " analysis is no longer feasible in an age when automated laboratory processes generate vast amounts of information faster than the human mind can process it .
" For example , we have 45,000 papers about one protein or one gene , " says Wilbanks .
He says a scientist might once have analysed the impact of one drug on one gene , but now pipetting robots are capable of analysing 25,000 genes at a time .
" Most of the research says the smartest of us can handle five or six independent variables at once - not 25,000 , " he says .
Science commons
Wilbanks says we now need to harness the power of machines to help us make the best sense of all this data we 're generating .
He wants to see the results of scientific experiments made freely available in an open commons of information .
Related bits of knowledge should be integrated and easily searched and shared via publicly - accessible databases on the web , says Wilbanks .
" It 's really about building a network culture for knowledge , " he says .
For example , he says , it should be as easy to search for all the potential gene targets for Alzheimer 's disease as it is to search for a hotel online .
Wilbanks says the technology involved is not " rocket science " and is already used by wealthy institutions , including the pharmaceutical industry .
But many researchers can't take advantage of such knowledge integration due to their lack of access to the technology or because they can't afford information protected by copyright or patents .
" The participatory culture on the web has n't really made it into the sciences yet , " says Wilbanks .
He says a network that is open to as many people as possible increases the chance of someone in the network connecting information in a way that causes a revolution in knowledge .
Reward system
Wilbanks says as well as freedom from intellectual property restrictions a science commons would rely on researchers actively sharing knowledge .
But he says most researchers are currently rewarded for publications and patents rather than sharing .
This has led to a world of " over- atomised " disconnected knowledge that is stifling the possibility of scientific revolutions , says Wilbanks .
He says the cost of research and its control by " old - boys clubs " also encourages researchers to stick to tiny and " safe " questions that fit in with existing tracks of thinking .
Wilbanks argues a science commons could boost the chance of knowledge revolutions by reducing the cost of taking risks , freeing up researchers to ask big questions and to generate and test lots of hypotheses quickly .
" There are 10,000 questions you can ask about signal transduction and neurones .
I would like to have all 10,000 questions asked every day , " he says .
Pioneers
Wilbanks says the Science Commons project is working with foundations that fund non-profit disease research to develop tools that can be used to network scientific information .
He says they are drawing on innovations by those in the new discipline of synthetic biology , which builds ' designer life ' , and relies on sharing DNA information on the web .
Wilbanks says in a relatively brief period of time student researchers in synthetic biology have already used shared DNA information to design bacteria that can detect arsenic in groundwater .
" Synthetic biology is an example of where the absence of a control culture has led to very rapid innovation , " says Wilbanks .
Republican strategist Rob Stutzman agreed , saying the move provided McCain with an “ opportunity to demonstrate leadership . ”
As for Obama , Stutzman said , “ His campaign probably should n't fall for the bait and call it a political ploy .
He should come back to Washington and try to match McCain toe for toe . "
But top Democratic strategists said that Obama could not afford to let McCain dictate the campaign narrative .
“ Obama should continue to press his advantage .
He ’s broken the race open .
He should n’t make himself an accomplice to McCain ’s cheesy desperate stunt , ” said Jim Jordan , who served as John F. Kerry ’s campaign manager early in the 2004 race .
Tad Devine , Kerry ’s chief strategist in 2004 , viewed McCain ’s proposal as an act of desperation .
“ You do n’t do something like this if you think you are in good shape .
This is a Hail Mary , ” he said .
“ The McCain people feel they have to somehow put the brakes on this slide . ”
Steve Elmendorf , Kerry ’s deputy campaign manager in 2004 , said that in rejecting McCain ’s proposal , Obama is “ showing people he ’s presidential , and McCain looks desperate . ”
Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - Ill. ) , who negotiated debate rules for Obama , said that the two candidates were not needed in Washington and that the debates should go on as planned .
“ I'm not so sure that their presence is going to resolve this issue , ” he said in an interview on MSNBC .
“ We know where we have to go , what we have to do , and we 're making the good progress to do that . ”
Not all criticism of McCain came from the left .
“ What idiot came up with this stunt ? ” former Republican Rep. Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma asked in a post on Politico ’s Arena forum .
“ Sorry , John ; it really sounds like you 're afraid to debate .
This sounds like the sort of ploy we used to use in junior high school elections . ”
The final verdict , of course , will come from voters .
A Survey USA poll conducted immediately after the announcement showed that roughly three out of every four Americans think the debate should go on as scheduled , while only 14 percent agreed with McCain that it should be suspended .
Thirty - six percent of those who thought the debate should still be held said the focus should be shifted from foreign policy to the economy .
Nearly half , 46 percent , said it would be “ bad for America ” if the debate was pushed .
Politico reporters David Kuhn , Avi Zenilman and Alex Burns contributed to this report .
ANCHORAGE — Like so many other distinctions about Alaska — the biggest , wildest , coldest state not even half a century removed from its territorial days — being governor here is just flat different .
“ Alaska is its own world , ” said Tony Knowles , a Democrat who served as governor from 1994 to 2002 .
Sarah Palin ’s experience as Alaska ’s governor since taking office in late 2006 has been a keystone argument by Republicans that she is fit to serve as vice president .
At the convention Wednesday in St. Paul , Ms. Palin and other speakers contended that her time as governor has given her more practical experience than Mr. Obama .
Many Americans in other states , though , might not recognize the job she holds or the unusual challenges she has faced — from managing a $ 5 billion budget surplus in a time of economic distress elsewhere , to upending an entrenched political establishment within her own party that was literally around for the state ’s founding .
Alaska ’s economic well - being — sustained , as most things are here , by oil and federal spending — has allowed Ms. Palin to avoid some of the tough budgetary choices vexing governors in dozens of other states .
That in turn raises questions for some people about how much her experience is relevant to the rest of the nation and how much she can relate to the troubles of struggling blue - collar workers in places like Ohio and Pennsylvania , worried about the winter gas bills and the mortgage .
John McCain is a blowhard and a fraud .
Behind his strained , twinkling - eyed smile is a man set to explode , especially whenever anyone threatens to expose him .
As former CIA counterterrorism expert , Michael Scheuer , put it : McCain 's " a little man with mediocre intelligence , a taste for bullying , and an appalling temper who thinks the presidency is his birthright . "
At his blowhard worst , Senator McCain will tell you , as he did in June 2008 , " Look , I know the area .
I 've been there .
I know wars .
I know how to win wars , and I know how to improve our capabilities so that we will capture Osama Bin Laden - or put it this way , bring him to justice .
We will do it .
I know how to do it . "
Bullshit !
If McCain knew how to capture Osama , he'd be honor bound to give President Bush , the U.S. intelligence services , or the U. S. military the benefit of his supposedly invaluable knowledge - rather than let Osama remain at large .
Thus , McCain 's either a reckless blowhard seeking to dupe the " impaired " among our electorate , or he 's deliberately subordinating U.S. national interest to his political ambitions .
( Keith Olbermann spoke forcefully about this matter during the September 10 , 2008 edition of Countdown . )
McCain also boasts that he's the only presidential candidate to possess the experience and judgment necessary to keep Americans safe and secure in this dangerous world .
Yet , notwithstanding his supposedly superior experience and judgment , McCain enthusiastically supported Bush 's decision to launch an unprovoked attack on Iraq - a war crime under international law .
And he did so without even reading the CIA 's October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate about Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
Which is why he could say such asinine things as : Saddam Hussein is " on a crash course to construct a nuclear weapon . "
Such recklessness supports the conclusion reached by Jeffrey Goldberg , in the October 2008 issue of The Atlantic : " In one area , though , " McCain " has been more or less constant : his belief in the power of war to solve otherwise insoluble problems . "
Thus , McCain supported an illegal invasion and devastating occupation that needlessly murdered tens of thousands ( if not hundreds of thousands ) of innocent Iraqis , forced the dislocation of some 5 million Iraqis , sparked ethnic cleansing and a simmering civil war , provoked an explosion of terrorist attacks around the world , enhanced the influence of Iran in the Middle East and trashed America 's reputation worldwide .
As U.S. Defense Secretary Gates admitted in February 2008 , " many Europeans do not support NATO 's security mission in Afghanistan because they opposed the invasion of Iraq . "
And , as the New York Times reported on February 10 , 2008 , Gates ' " remarks were also an acknowledgment that the war in Iraq has exacted a significant political cost , even among Washington 's closest allies . "
Thus , when John McCain talks about " winning " in Iraq , after all of this needless carnage , it 's a sure sign that he 's a man possessing a very constricted view of honor and shame .
Even General Petraeus has asserted that " he did not know that he would ever use the word ' victory ' : ' This is not the sort of struggle where you take a hill , plant the flag and go home to a victory parade ... it's not war with a simple slogan . ' "
Moreover , were it not for the existence of a huge number of impaired American voters - including a subset of political morons known as die - hard Republicans -- it would go without saying that Barack Obama demonstrated vastly superior judgment , when he opposed Bush 's invasion of Iraq months before the invasion took place .
He said the war would lead to " an occupation of undetermined length , with undetermined costs and undetermined consequences . "
Imagine all the lives , money and reputation that could have been saved , as well as devastation that could have been avoided , had the U.S. listened to Barack Obama back then .
It 's certainly not something John McCain wants Americans to contemplate .
Which is why he touts the success of the " surge " and criticizes Obama for opposing it .
Yes , the " surge " - along with the stand - down of Shiite militias and the rise of the Sunni " Awakening " - has helped to reduce violence in Iraq .
But Bush 's " surge " was never meant to be anything more than a means to an end .
Bush 's goal was the political reconciliation Sunnis , Shiites and Kurds , which has yet to occur .
As Travis Sharp recently put it : " The purpose of the surge , as President Bush said , was to provide breathing space for Iraqis to achieve political reconciliation .
Tactical military successes under the surge are to be applauded , but political results are the ultimate objective .
Lacking political progress , the United States is simply surging to nowhere . "
While McCain seems content to hold American forces hostage to Iraq 's political dithering , Obama has correctly noted that America 's military forces have been stretched to the breaking point by an unnecessary war that has distracted us from the fight against against bin Laden and al Qaeda , undermined America 's ability to confront other foreign policy challenges and , actually , has rendered the United States less secure .
As Mr. Sharp correctly observed : " Barack Obama demonstrated … that he is thinking several moves ahead on the chessboard in Iraq .
John McCain seems content to remind us how great he is at checkers . "
McCain continues to dispute Obama 's claims , but Obama 's chessboard wisdom was vindicated - and McCain 's checkers childishness demolished - when Russia decided to play its " Iraq card . "
In June 2008 , while McCain was boasting about his still secret knowledge that will enable him to capture bin Laden ( but only if you elect him President ! ) , an editorial in the Russian newspaper , Nezavisimaya Gazeta , was urging that Russia 's diplomats finally play its Iraq card against the United States .
According to the editorial : " Moscow took a principled stance right from the start by condemning the invasion of Iraq .
At the same time all these years it behaved passively with regard to the conflict and made no use at all of the Iraq card to advance its own interests in other areas in the dialogue with Washington . "
" During this same period the United States has been able to accomplish quite a few actions which run directly counter to Russia 's security interests ( missile defense , rapprochement with Georgia and Ukraine ) and has not fulfilled its promises , including repealing the Jackson - Vanik amendment .
The time evidently has come for more active diplomacy on the Iraqi salient as well . "
If Russia did " behave passively with regard to the conflict , " such passive behavior hardly indicated Russian good will toward the U.S. For , as the prominent Russian pundit , Vyacheslav Nikonov , personally told me - during private conversations in St. Petersburg in 2004 and 2005 - " From a humanitarian point of view , we all would like to see a rapid termination of America 's war against Iraq .
But , from the perspective of Russia 's national interests , America 's invasion has benefited Russia in three ways : ( 1 ) By raising the price of oil , which Russia exports , ( 2 ) by drawing terrorists away from Chechnya to Iraq and ( 3 ) by sinking the U.S. military in a quagmire , thus limiting the possibilites of U.S. mischief elsewhere in the world . "
( That is not an exact quote , but its captures the essence of our conversations )
But recent talk about playing a diplomatic Iraq card suggested that prominent Russians no longer subscribed to Mr. Nikonov 's point of view .
Yet , little in the Russian discussion suggested that , when Russia played its Iraq card , it would do so militarily and not diplomatically .
In a cogently argued article in the latest issue of The New York Review of Books -- one that actually understates the long list of legitimate Russian grievences against U.S duplicity - George Friedman of Stratfor cites U.S. meddling in Ukraine 's " Orange Revolution " and America 's recognition of the independence of Kosovo as the two main reasons motivating Russia 's decision to exercise its Iraq card militarily , by invading Georgia .
" From the Ukrainian experience , the Russians became convinced that the United States was engaged in a plan of strategic encirclement and strangulation of Russia .
From the Kosovo experience , they concluded that the United States and Europe were not prepared to consider Russian wishes even in fairly minor affairs .
This was the breaking point . "
And although Friedman makes it quite clear that Georgia actually started the war ( by bombing the civilian population of Tskhinvali in South Ossetia while they were asleep in their beds ) , he suspects " Russia had laid a trap , hoping for a Georgian invasion to justify its own counterattack . "
By invading Georgia , Putin played his Iraq card .
What does that mean ?
As Mr. Friedman puts it : " While the United States is tied down in the Middle East , American guarantees have no value .
The lesson is not for American consumption .
It is something that , from the Russian point of view , the Ukrainians , the Balts , and the Central Asians need to digest .
Indeed it 's a lesson Putin wants to transmit to Poland and the Czech Republic as well . "
" The more vocal senior U.S. leaders are , the greater the contrast with their inaction , and the Russians wanted to drive home the idea that American guarantees are empty talk . "
After all , not only is the U.S. bogged down in Iraq , Russia is quite more difficult to intimidate than most countries , given that it alone possesses a nuclear arsenal capable of obliterating most of America 's major cities within an hour 's notice .
Thus , while blowhard John McCain spins fables about his unique ability to capture Osama bin Laden and touts his so - called superior national security experience and knowledge , the Taliban in Afghanistan , al Qaeda in Pakistan and , now , the Russians in Georgia , have exposed the strategic stupidity of his obsession with keeping most of America 's military forces tied down in Iraq .
One can only speculate which country will next play the Iraq card to America 's detriment .

When I think of the " Best Gay Bars , " I think of places where anything can happen , where raucous theme nights are the norm , where the locals are crazy and possibly hot , and where fun , unpredictable , bad behavior abounds .
So I sent out emails to a lusty batch of travel writers , hard - partying friends and media folks from around the country , asking them ...
" What are the best gay bars in the U.S . ?? ? "
The results are personal , rather than scientific .
And the surprising common theme which evolved was the soft - spot people have in their hearts for kistchy , dive -y , messy bars where a sketchy queen might be found lip- synching to Crystal Waters ' til the wee hours .
And interestingly , most of the places tend to draw a mix of people : Old and young , rich and not - so - rich , men and women , high - class and trashy , gay and lesbian and trans and then some .
After all , the more things get mixed up , the wilder things get , right ?
To add a bit of pomp and circumstance , I 've got the Top 3 bars picked .
They 're the ones that more people chimed in about the most .
And after the Top 3 , read on for a state - by - state round - up of what scored raves from our contributors .
And yes , your favorite bar may be left out , so write me at [ email protected ] and let me know your thoughts .
Thanks to my esteemed contributors for their input .
And Happy Pride , y'all !

Who even knew Tucson was a city let alone had a gay bar ?
IBT 's is where the drags to the bears to the gay cowboys saddle up to the bar and drink everything from beers to IBT 's famous Judy Garland special ( which honestly , I think is just a vodka - cranberry , but that 's " exotic " in Tucson so it deserves a name ) .
A must - see if going to Tucson !

Brachiosaurs and other long - necked giants of the dinosaur world weighed as much as 10 African elephants .
Researchers now think they know why the tubby vegetarian beasts got so big :
They swallowed high - energy foods whole .
Their small heads helped , too , by allowing those long necks to reach nutritious leaves high up in the trees .
With body lengths of more than 131 feet ( 40 m ) and heights of 56 feet ( 17 m ) , sauropods dwarfed meat - eating dinosaurs and even the largest land mammals ever .
Sauropods appeared on the scene about 210 million years ago in the Late Triassic and dominated Earth 's ecosystems for more than 100 million years from the Middle Jurassic to the end of the Cretaceous .
P. Martin Sander , a paleontologist at the University of Bonn in Germany , and Marcus Clauss of the University of Zurich propose how the plant - eaters could have reached such super sizes and thrive for so long .
For one , unlike duck - billed and horned dinosaurs , sauropods must not have listened to mom , as they did n't chew their food .
In general , food chewing and the associated saliva that gets mixed in help to digest food .
Sauropods instead relied on giant bellies for storing lots of food , which could take a long time to digest .
Past research has shown that the ferns and other plant material eaten by sauropods packed high amounts of energy needed for growth .
Smaller jaws
While a complex gut region was necessary , sauropods did n't need big jaws since they did n't chew their food .
The smaller jaws meant sauropods could have small heads , which was a prerequisite for having a lengthy neck ( their necks could n't support too much weight ) .
The neck meant the beasts could snag food that was out of reach for their stumpy - necked neighbors .
But life 's tough for big guys .
For instance , getting rid of excess body heat could have posed a problem for such a big body .
And with such a long neck , a large volume of air had to trek through the also - lengthy windpipe before that fresh air reached the lungs .
These dinosaurs solved both problems with a bird - like breathing system .
Instead of flexible lungs that expand and contract , sauropods ( and modern birds ) had a system of air sacs that pumped air through rigid lungs .
Other air sacs and hollow spaces lined the spinal column and helped to shuttle unwanted heat away from the body core .
Sauropod eggs
Sauropods also had staying power .
One way their giant genes survived involved sauropod reproductive biology .
While mammalian plant - eaters give birth to one offspring at a time , sauropods laid several small eggs at once .
This would help to increase the dinosaurs ' population size and therefore lower the chances of extinction .
Once hatched , the tiny dinosaurs would grow from about 22 pounds ( 10 kg ) to a fully - grown weight at rates similar to those of land mammals .
The fast growth would mean a sauropod would quickly reap the benefits of being so large , such as protection from predators .
The researchers suggest sauropod gigantism may have led to the oversized meat - eating dinosaurs , which also were much larger than carnivorous land mammals .
One idea is that sauropod eggs would have provided an easy feast for a growing meat - eater .
Since mammals have few young that are well - protected , such a food source would be unavailable to meat - eating mammals .
The research , which will be detailed in the Oct. 10 issue of the journal Science , was funded by the German Research Foundation .
McCain , shown in 1985 , did not list his service on the board of the U.S. Council for World Freedom on mandatory congressional disclosure forms .
McCain did n’t report ties to Contra group
As a freshman congressman in the early 1980s , John McCain did not disclose his connections to a controversial group that was implicated in a secretive plot to supply arms to Nicaraguan militia groups during the Iran - Contra affair .
McCain did not list his service on the board of the U.S. Council for World Freedom on mandatory congressional disclosure forms asking about positions he held outside government .

McCain ’s aides said he was n’t required to report the affiliation .
Democrats in the past several days have seized on McCain ’s ties to the U.S. Council and its founder John Singlaub to push back against the McCain campaign ’s increasing focus on ties of Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) to Bill Ayers , a founder of the 1960s radical group Weather Underground .
McCain joined the board of the U.S. Council soon after Singlaub founded it in McCain ’s adopted hometown of Phoenix in November 1981 as the U.S. branch of the World Anti-Communist League .
The league billed itself as a supporter of “ pro-Democratic resistance movements fighting communist totalitarianism , ” but it had also been branded by critics as a haven for extremists , racists and anti-Semites .
McCain aides now say he felt comfortable affiliating with the group because Singlaub had taken steps to purge those elements .
Singlaub , while a controversial figure , also boasted a storied career as a decorated veteran in World War II and the U.S. conflicts in Korea and Vietnam .
He retired from the Army as a major general .
But McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers told Politico that McCain notified the group of his intent to leave the board in September 1984 because “ questions were raised about its activities . ”
A review of the personal financial disclosure forms McCain filed after his election to the U.S.
House in 1982 show that he did not list the group in the section of his 1982 , 1983 and 1984 reports in which he was required to disclose all positions he held outside of government .
The instructions on the form require filers to report “ the identity of all positions held on or before the date of the filing during the current calendar year as an officer , director , trustee , partner , proprietor , representative , employee , or consultant of any corporation , firm , partnership , or other business enterprise , any nonprofit organization , any labor organization , or any educational or other institution . ”
But Rogers told Politico “ those directions have never been understood to include advisory boards or other positions which exercise no control over the organization and no fiduciary responsibilities for the organization . ”
And he said “ our understanding is that his involvement did not involve any fiduciary responsibility for the organization and no control over the organization . ”

When I first heard of [ 9/11 truth ] and how the NIST " scientists " involved in 911 seemed to act in very un-scientific ways , it was not at all surprising to me .
By 2001 , everyone in NIST leadership had been trained to pay close heed to political pressures .
There was no chance that NIST people " investigating " the 911 situation could have been acting in the true spirit of scientific independence , nor could they have operated at all without careful consideration of political impact .
Everything that came from the hired guns was by then routinely filtered through the front office , and assessed for political implications before release .
Communication dated October 1 , 2007 : " NBS / NIST had become fully hijacked from the scientific into the political realm well before he became involved .
That hijacking happened in the mid-90's , and has only grown stronger to the present .
Prior to that time , the Director of NBS / NIST was appointed via the political process ( Presidential nomination , Congressional confirmation ) , but with the firm understanding in the scientific community that the job was essentially a non-political one , as the leader of the government 's premiere scientific research institution .
Directors were carefully selected from a field of well - known senior scientists with management skills , typically from within the NBS staff , after gaining much credibility in their fields .
Once appointed , Directors tended to stay on for several years , through different administrations in an essentially career mode , usually until they retired .
That all changed under the Clinton administration .
I saw it happen .
After retirement from the Army , in 1983 I joined then - NBS as a scientist on the staff .
After 3 years , I decided to move on ( engineering on the Star Wars project ) .
Becoming sick of that charade in 1989 , I succumbed to my former boss ' entreaties and returned to now - NIST in a supervisory scientist position at the top civil service grade .
I retired from there in 2001 , and worked as a part - time contractor for them until last year .
So I 've had a chance to observe some of the higher - level NIST goings - on up close and personal for some time , and was personally involved in some of its politicization .
I do n't know whether the NBS Director , Dr. John Lyons , was forced into retirement by the Clinton administration ; I just remember the abruptness of the change after only 3 years on his job .
He was replaced by a relatively unknown and also quite young scientist from DARPA .
What I remember about her is her lack of credibility in representing NIST in scientific circles , her choice of senior staff with little regard for their scientific standing , and her keen emphasis on political sensitivities .
She departed after a long four years , and the Director 's office ( and hence the whole Institute ) has been in turmoil ever since .
Four of her six successors to the present time have been " Acting " , meaning in a practical sense that they may well not have had the personal credibility and scientific standing to survive the scrutiny of the confirmation process .
About the time of this major reduction in stature of the Director 's office , some other major shifts took place at NIST , the echoes of which may have direct relevance to [ 9/11 truth ] .
Prior to that time , we were focused on scientific research and standards development that tended to be independent of what other government agencies were doing .
All of a sudden , the senior levels of NIST were flooded with what I perhaps over - harshly termed " political commisars " , whose job was principally to deal with what may be called " the political sensitivities " of our work and also making sure it supported big industry .
That support became an overtly - stated major mission for us .
We lost a major share of our direct research funding , and from then on have been largely dependent upon receiving funds from other government agencies ( the majority from Depts of Defense and Energy ) for research and standards - making to support their own work .
This " other agency " work amounted to about 40 % of our total budget in my last several years there .
In essence , we lost our scientific independence , and became little more than " hired guns " .
Sorry this blurb became overly long , but I did want to make sure that an " insider 's view " got onto the record .
" Email dated October 2 , 2007 : " A little more general insight into what I referred to as the NIST politicization , some of which may be of interest to you .
In addition to the NIST " front office " looking closely over our shoulders , we had three major external oversight groups keeping close track of our little part of NIST , which admittedly dealt at times with some sensitive issues regarding technological security .
One was NSA ( no surprises there ! ) , another was the HQ staff of the Department of Commerce , which scrutinized our work very closely and frequently would n't permit us to release papers or give talks without changes to conform to their way of looking at things .
A third was a bit of a surprise to some -- the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) had a policy person specifically delegated to provide oversight on our work .
Just as a reminder , the OMB is an arm of the Executive Office of the President .
One more tidbit - a gentleman named William A Jeffrey served as NIST Director from July 2005 until last month .
Interestingly , Dr. Jeffrey 's previous assignment was in the EOP's Office of Science and Technology Policy !
Talk about high - level oversight !!
So one can be certain that on so hot a topic as yours , Dr. Jeffrey ( and his previous political handlers in the WH - if they still were " previous " ) would be very personally involved at every step .
I do n't know what more I can add that might be relevant , as I have been once - removed from NIST for the past 6 years as a contractor via [ a defense company ] .
However , I do have some good NIST friends who are rather highly placed , so if you have any other questions re NIST , I might be able to ferret out an answer .
Would be worth a shot anyway . "

One of the saddest stories of the 20th century is the fate of air travel .
In 1900 it was a dream , feverishly speculated upon , subject to all manner of Jules Verne imaginings ; by 1999 it was a chore , a tedious , uncomfortable ritual undertaken in order to get from A to B .
A large portion of the blame for this depressing non-event can be laid at the airport , that warren - like combination of the shopping mall and the high - security prison , which is the focus in Britain for a tortured air - angst every summer .
In 2008 , what Evening Standard headline writers might pithily call " Heathrow chaos " was centred on the botched opening of the new Terminal Five .
Designed by Mike Davies at Rogers Stirk Harbour , it was only the second aesthetically distinguished structure at Heathrow - which ranges grimly from the ridiculously inappropriate red- brick mannerisms of the control tower and the original terminals to the claustrophobic hell of Terminal Four .
Finally - around 50 years after Owen Williams 's brutalist BOAC hangar - a decent building .
Inside , Terminal Five is majestic : a thrillingly Constructivist space , with huge spans of glass and steel , open to the expanse of the surrounding airfield .
Yet within weeks of opening , 28,000 bags were lost , and 500 flights cancelled .
And to ensure that people milling around in limbo keep themselves busy spending money , the terminal only has 700 public seats .
Today , amid the airline bankruptcies , an advert declares " Terminal Five is working " , as if we should be impressed .
This tragicomic distinction between the airport as ( sometimes ) designed : as metaphor for speed , transience and progress ; and airport as used : as mall , panopticon and fiercely guarded border , runs through Alastair Gordon 's brilliant Naked Airport .
This is an impressively illustrated , comprehensive " cultural history " of airports as buildings , from the earliest days of makeshift sheds and hangars to the vast , glassy terminals designed by architectural multinationals such as Foster +
Partners .
The book 's narrative begins two decades after the Wright brothers , and after the widespread deployment of fighter - planes in the First World War .
The airport became a focus for speculation about design and modernity between the 1910s and the 1930s , appropriately at a time when architects were full of futurist fantasies about cities in which flight and movement determined form .
Unsurprisingly , the earliest of these speculative schemes were those of the Italian Futurists .
The draughtsman Antonio Sant 'Elia 's still stunning cities of ruthless modernity tended to feature airports in very inappropriate places .
Gordon notes that few architects had serious knowledge of the mundane practicalities of landing and take - off .
Le Corbusier , whose insistence that " an airport should be naked " provides the book 's title , proposed that an airport be at the heart of a city , much like a rail terminus .
In his 1922 design project , " Contemporary City for Three Million Inhabitants " , the airport is at the centre of a Cartesian grid of skyscrapers , with the planes flying dangerously close to the glass walls .
Meanwhile , actual flights and actual terminals at this point were a strange combination of shabby and aristocratic .
Lindbergh 's transatlantic flight ended with his landing on a mud track , while early flyers were almost always members of the upper-crust , usually either Americans taking advantage of the Monroe Doctrine to laze in the Caribbean , or British and French travellers sunning themselves in the colonies .
One decidedly racist 1920s poster for PanAm depicts a grinning black porter taking the bags of stylised , glamorous figures .
The Jazz Age 's flappers and flyers travelled through shoddy airfields , via clumsily neoclassical terminals .
Gordon argues that the first place truly to find an appropriate form for the airport was Europe .
Glass and concrete created calm , rationalist spaces , without unnecessary reference to past forms .
By the 1930s , Amsterdam or Hamburg were leading the world , making New York and Washington , for all their surface glitter , look staid .
Gordon devotes a whole chapter to the Roosevelt administration 's interventionist response .
Massive public spending and nationalisation created a network of publicly owned fac ilities such as Washington 's " People 's Airport " .
These , although they still hedged their bets stylistically between reassuring classicism and vertiginous modernity , were at least vastly more efficient than their colonial - style precursors .
Gordon notes that , as ever , war was a motor for technological progress in airport design , particularly in the Axis countries .
From 1936 , Berlin - Tempelhof was the world 's largest airport , in a modernised classical style that would be dubbed " Luftwaffe Modern " , as nobody was in any doubt about why Germany needed such a huge facility ; and in early 1940s Italy , Pier Luigi Nervi designed intricate , gravity - defying han gars that would greatly influence a generation of postwar architects .
The author also finds intriguing material on the camouflaging of American airports , against the Japanese or German attack that never came - disguising them as residential exurbs , which in turn gave way to actual exurbs growing round the naked airports themselves after the war .
The most fascinating chapters are those that deal with the postwar years , where within a decade the airport went from the most optimistic space in America to the site of hijackings , security and surveillance .
Naked Airport has much on Eero Saarinen 's breathtaking TWA Terminal at JFK , a swooping expressionistic fantasy - not only does a brief autobiographical description of it open the book , but a chapter on the " Jet Age " features incredible illustrations of this improbable building .
Designed as a gigantic concrete bird , it provided the most emblematic structure of a semi-fictional world of allegedly willing air hostesses , fetishistic synthetic uniforms , and wildly futuristic designs .
Today , it serves as the unacknowledged blueprint for the career of the currently fashionable Spanish engineer - auteur Santiago Calatrava .
Yet between 1969 and 1978 , there were 400 plane hijackings , quickly leading to a massive upgrade in security , and a new paradigm in airport design .
Gordon claims that the manager of Dallas / Fort Worth took as a model an advert depicting a passenger moving seamlessly from car to port to plane , without any contact with the outside world .
After the shock of terrorism , and Jimmy Carter 's deregulation of US airlines , airports became stealthy , paranoid structures , centred on shopping and surveillance .
The book outlines how easily the 9/11 hijackers passed through security , so another level of increasingly tedious and invasive frisking and scanning arrived in the aftermath .
Meanwhile , the seemingly more optimistic models - the glass hangars of the 1990s and into the 21st century , by Rogers , Foster , Calatrava et al - have their own sinister underside .
Gordon notes that Chek Lap Kok , Foster 's huge Hong Kong sky - city , was constructed by helots , whose standard of workmanship was unimpressive - within a year , the building was a laughing stock .
The constant expansion of the airport is as spatially rapacious as it is ecologically disastrous , to the point where it becomes difficult to pinpoint exactly where it begins and ends , as anyone disturbed by the in - train films and muzak on the Heathrow Express train will have noticed .
The extremely bleak prognosis that ends Naked Airport is shared by Politics at the Airport , a collection of academic papers edited by Mark B Salter .
From the start , the editor ( unfairly ) classes Naked Airport as a work of technocratic boosterism , and the book sniffily dismisses Marc Augé and J G Ballard 's ambiguous eulogies to airports as seamless , transient , clean and serene " non-places " as the perspective of the privileged .
Instead , Salter and his contributors - mostly specialists in the study of surveillance and security - concentrate on the spatial politics of the airport after 9/11 .
Politics at the Airport stresses that , in Deleuze and Guattari 's terms , the airport both " deterritorialises " and " reterritorialises " .
It might appear to the frequent traveller as a smooth international zone under a steel and glass canopy , but to the asylum - seeker or the terrorist suspect , the airport is an effective high - security border with attached prison .
Colin J Bennett 's essay notes that the US government 's lists prohibiting flight have included Bolivia 's socialist president Evo Morales , children , and anyone with the name David Nelson .
Gallya Lahav writes on how an intricate system of private - public partnerships means an all - pervasive retail obsession coexists with the armed might of the state in the same space .
Others profile the recent use of a " biometrics " that makes the body itself the locus of security , with passengers being identified by scans of the iris - it seems airports are taking their inspiration from Philip K Dick 's stories of non-people condemned in non-places .
Politics at the Airport 's blizzard of acronyms and academic name - checks belies its importance as a reminder that the airport is a deeply sinister space , no matter how much architectural " transparency " might try to restore some of its tarnished glamour .
The final essay , Gillian Fuller 's " Welcome to Windows 2.1 " takes a critical look at the Foster / Rogers rhetoric of transparency , which " alternates between an illuminating display of what was previously hidden to the dark suspicions of ' what have you got to hide ? '''.
With that , we 're back at Terminal Five , glassily housing a source of environmental catastrophe , central to a society of shopping and surveillance .

Tom Brady Injured in Season Opener ( Video )
New England Patriots quarterbacksustained an injury to his left knee in the first quarter of the season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday .
The two time Super Bowl MVP was dropping back for a deep pass to Randy Moss when he was tackled by Chiefs safety Brandon Pollard .
Pollard hit Brady 's left leg causing it to buckle under him .
Brady , who who had n't played in the preseason because of an injury to his right ankle , was helped off the field , limping down the stairs to the dressing room .
Backup quarterback Matt Cassel led the Patriots to a 17 - 10 victory over the Chiefs .
The Patriots announced that Brady 's return is questionable , opening the door for Cassel to have his first real turn at the position .

Democratic Confederalism and Movement Building in South Africa by Shawn Hattingh Agenda for the Global South After COVID - 19 by Vijay Prashad Η θε ωρία το υ Μ&... by Matthew Crossin Parecon vs. Revolutionary Class - Struggle Anarchism international | the left | opinion / analysis Monday September 29 , 2008 08:23 Monday September 29 , 2008 08:23 by Wayne Price - NEFAC ( personal statement ) by Wayne Price - NEFAC ( personal statement ) drwdprice at aol dot com Responding to Albert - 1
This is a part of an exchange on Znet which contrasts revolutionary class struggle anarchism with Parecon ( " participatory economics " ) .
The following article is meant to follow an essay by Michael Albert , co-author of Parecon theory : " Parecon and Movement Building " which can be found at http://www.zcommunications.org/znet/viewArticle/18943.
My organization , NEFAC ( Northeastern Federation of Anarchist - Communists ) , does not have an official opinion about Parecon ( participatory economics ) .
Some members have been favorably influenced , others feel negatively about it , and perhaps most have no opinion .
Therefore I will present my own views on the relationship between Parecon and revolutionary class - struggle anarchism .
Parecon vs. Revolutionary Class - Struggle Anarchism
Where We Agree and Where We Disagree On what do our two tendencies agree ?
Quite a lot .
While supporting struggles for reforms , we agree that our goal should be a revolution which gets rid of capitalism and all forms of oppression ( gender , national , race , sexual orientation , etc. ) as well as the state .
This should be done by a movement of all the oppressed , including , but not limited to , the working class .
In place of both the state and the capitalist economy should be a federation , rooted in directly - democratic councils of communities and workplaces .
Organized neither by the market nor by centralized planning , the economy should be democratically planned - from - the - bottom - up by these councils .
A stateless , self - managed , polity should consist of federated councils .
Under corporate capitalism , there has been a huge expansion of middle class layers , which are capable , under certain circumstances , of replacing the bourgeoisie as a new , collectivist , ruling class .
For this and other reasons , a free society should seek to reorganize work so that jobs include both creative , mental , aspects , as well as less interesting , laborious , aspects .
Also , for this and other reasons , we should work to make present - day organizations of opposition as radically democratic as possible .
Obviously we have a great deal of agreement .
Where do we disagree ?
Let me give two examples of where revolutionary anarchists disagree with the Parecon model .
Virtually all varieties of anarchism are decentralist , even though we also believe in national and international federations .
We want small regions which rely mostly on local resources and which integrate self - managed industries with sustainable organic agriculture , creating democratic communities and workplaces .
While Parecon advocates local councils , its primary economic units are whole nations , such as the U.S. ( an arbitrary entity ) .
Planning primarily for a unit which covers most of a continent is inefficient in both production and distribution , leads to ecological disaster , and makes it difficult to have truly democratic economic planning or politics .
The historic mainstream of anarchism has advocated libertarian communism , whereby people work for social reasons and share in the social wealth according to their needs .
Parecon instead advocates paying able - bodied workers differently according to the amount and intensity of their labor .
Since peoples abilities and needs are unequal , this is still a form of inequality , a remnant of capitalism .
It will be inconsistent with the full potential productivity of modern technology , which could eventually reduce required labor to almost nothing .
I would not object to this aspect of Parecon , if it were proposed as transitional to full communism , to be phased in with improved productivity and moral consciousness .
But that is not the Parecon program .
The Parecon Method I could expand on these and other points about the Parecon image of post - capitalist society .
Instead I will comment on the method of Parecons model - building .
Apparently this is based on a set of moral criteria , which were chosen by Michael Albert and Robin Hahnel .
Then a model was constructed of an economy which could fulfill these criteria .
This presents a moral vision which is counterposed to the evils of capitalism .
I agree with the need for a utopian vision .
And I see the usefulness of developing a detailed model of how such a society might actually ( possibly ) work .
This is counterposed to the scientistic method of Marxism , which refuses to present a moral vision , because socialism will supposedly develop ( automatically and inevitably ) out of the dynamics of capitalism .
However , Parecon goes too far in one direction .
Its model is almost completely divorced from an analysis of capitalism and its dynamics and from a program to abolish capitalism ( which is presented only in the broadest of strokes , as opposed to the details of the Parecon model ) .
There is no discussion of how a post - capitalist society might arise out of a revolutionary upheaval .
Yet the basic ideas of a councilist economy are based not on abstract models but on the real experiences of past revolutions , in which councils were created by working people without the benefit of theorists !
Perhaps , after a revolution , a free society will immediately implement the Parecon program .
Perhaps not .
Or perhaps some regions will attempt it and others will experiment with other variations of a councilist economy and polity .
We are too far from a revolution to know .
I am not against attempts to work out possible models to aid future generations ( Parecon being only one such model ) , but I reject any insistence on making one model the official program .
Michaels goal seems to be for Parecon to become the widely shared vision held by a large part of the left .
This vision is not to be a general commitment to a councilist , anti-authoritarian , socialist viewsuch as the paragraph of things anarchists and Pareconists agree on which I presented earlier .
No , it has to be the specific Parecon model .
This goes along with his rejection of the label of socialism  ( and , no doubt , of  communism ) as meaning the same as state socialism although , inconsistently , he does not reject the label left ,  even though the mainstream left is just as historically identified with statism as is mainstream socialism .
Similarly he makes no mention of anarchism .
( I get the impression from other writings that he is ambivalent about anarchism ; however , Robin Hahnel regards Parecon as a version of libertarian socialism . )
To try to make the left committed specifically to Parecon instead of , in general , libertarian socialism ( socialist anarchism and anti-statist Marxism ) is inflexible , unexperimental , and , frankly , sectarian .
Sectarian ?
Opportunist ?
Or Revolutionary ?
But Michael says he rejects sectarianism .
 There is not only one right way forward and most strategic commitments need to be flexible , and certainly not dismissive much less sectarian . 
Who could disagree ( at this level of generalization ) ?
Flexibility , humility , and respect for others , even when disagreeing , are important .
Yet there are two things wrong with Michaels statement .
First is that , while Michael condemns ultra - left sectarianism ( with good reason ) , he unfortunately does not warn about the reciprocal danger of opportunism .
By this I do not mean personal corruption but a political capitulation to capitalism .
Does Michael agree that there is a right danger of opportunism ?
I do not know .
Second , surely every strategic commitment cannot be equally correct .
Some may be wrong .
It is not sectarian to say this and to have a respectful and open discussion of political differences .
For example , we are at the climax of a national election and radicals have differing views ( strategic commitments  or agendas ) on what to do and say -- although radicals all are pretty marginal right now and these views are mostly propaganda for the future .
The Democratic Socialists of America and the Communist Party are for working in the Democratic Party .
The International Socialist Organization and most other Trotskyists are for rejecting the Democrats and building ( what amounts to ) new , middle class , pro-capitalist parties ( Greens , the Nader campaign , New Party , Labor Party , etc. ) .
Michael himself does not make a big deal out of electoralism , but has written that if he were in a swing state , he would vote for Obama .
Instead , revolutionary class struggle anarchists advocate that labor and oppressed communities break with the Democrats and all electoralism , in favor of non-electoral mass action , particularly the general strike .
These views can not all be right .
Some have to be wrong .
It is obvious what I support without my condemning the motives of those who I think are wrong .
Just recently I listened to the debate between the presidential candidates .
McCain sounded like a crazed war - monger ( sounded to me , not necessarily to the average voter ) .
Obama said he would expand the war in Afghanistan , remain in Iraq until he could responsibly  withdraw , unilaterally attack Pakistan , threaten Iran and possibly attack it , and bring Ukraine and Georgia into NATO , which means that if Russia attacks either , the U.S. would be at war with Russia .
In brief , Obama will be an imperialist aggressor , mass murderer , and war criminal .
And he has the support of the liberals and most of the left !
Forgive me for saying that this view is wrong , politically and morally , for those who regard themselves as socialists , anarchists , or revolutionaries .
It is political opportunism .
In summary , Michaels Parecon and revolutionary class struggle anarchism have a great deal in common ; they are , in my opinion ( and that of Robin Hahnel ) , both varieties of libertarian socialism .
Anarchists have some criticisms of the Parecon model of a post - capitalist society , of which I refer to two .
More significantly perhaps , I have criticisms of the method of Parecon model - making , which I feel is too much divorced from an analysis of how capitalism functions and how a movement will be built .
Finally , I believe that it is not only important to be against ultra - left sectarianism , but also against the right danger of opportunism , such as support for the imperialist Democratic Party and its candidates or for any form of electoralism .
On what do our two tendencies agree ?
Quite a lot .
While supporting struggles for reforms , we agree that our goal should be a revolution which gets rid of capitalism and all forms of oppression ( gender , national , race , sexual orientation , etc. ) as well as the state .
This should be done by a movement of all the oppressed , including , but not limited to , the working class .
In place of both the state and the capitalist economy should be a federation , rooted in directly - democratic councils of communities and workplaces .
Organized neither by the market nor by centralized planning , the economy should be democratically planned - from - the - bottom - up by these councils .
A stateless , self - managed , polity should consist of federated councils .
Under corporate capitalism , there has been a huge expansion of middle class layers , which are capable , under certain circumstances , of replacing the bourgeoisie as a new , collectivist , ruling class .
For this and other reasons , a free society should seek to reorganize work so that jobs include both creative , mental , aspects , as well as less interesting , laborious , aspects .
Also , for this and other reasons , we should work to make present - day organizations of opposition as radically democratic as possible .
Obviously we have a great deal of agreement .
Where do we disagree ?
Let me give two examples of where revolutionary anarchists disagree with the Parecon model .
Virtually all varieties of anarchism are decentralist , even though we also believe in national and international federations .
We want small regions which rely mostly on local resources and which integrate self - managed industries with sustainable organic agriculture , creating democratic communities and workplaces .
While Parecon advocates local councils , its primary economic units are whole nations , such as the U.S. ( an arbitrary entity ) .
Planning primarily for a unit which covers most of a continent is inefficient in both production and distribution , leads to ecological disaster , and makes it difficult to have truly democratic economic planning or politics .
The historic mainstream of anarchism has advocated libertarian communism , whereby people work for social reasons and share in the social wealth according to their needs .
Parecon instead advocates paying able - bodied workers differently according to the amount and intensity of their labor .
Since peoples abilities and needs are unequal , this is still a form of inequality , a remnant of capitalism .
It will be inconsistent with the full potential productivity of modern technology , which could eventually reduce required labor to almost nothing .
I would not object to this aspect of Parecon , if it were proposed as transitional to full communism , to be phased in with improved productivity and moral consciousness .
But that is not the Parecon program .
I could expand on these and other points about the Parecon image of post - capitalist society .
Instead I will comment on the method of Parecons model - building .
Apparently this is based on a set of moral criteria , which were chosen by Michael Albert and Robin Hahnel .

Magnetic Air Car
This Magnetic Air Car appears to be an absolute miracle of engineering .
We ’re talking a vehicle that will travel at 100 mph plus for ‘ an unlimited driving range ’ without needing to refuel .
Oh yes folks , you read that right .
The technology seems to involve something called an air - bearing turbocharger which uses a $ 70 battery to run a magnetic motor to compress , use and re-compress air in the onboard storage tanks .
The secret sauce as they call it is their new Air Cycle Machine , which apparently stirs up air through convection .
Confused ?
Yep , same here .
See if this magazine article helps .
Oh and the flyer text [ PDF ] may help too ( under the right hand top photo ) .
What we are building is similar to an electric car but with compressed air tanks instead of expensive rechargeable batteries that can only provide short driving distances .
We believe our engineers have developed a solution for manufacturing air while the vehicle is in motion which may provide an unlimited driving range .
We use only one specially designed battery the size of a regular car battery which has three times the charging capacity and a much longer life cycle .
Instead of $ 3,000 - $ 5,000 for lithium batteries , our battery costs less than $ 70 .
The battery does not contain acid , it will retain its first charge sitting on a shelf for up to three years …

Here ’s a simple problem : “ How do you make an LED turn on when it gets dark ? ”
You might call it the “ nightlight problem , ” but the same sort of question comes up in a lot of familiar situations – emergency lights , street lights , silly computer keyboard backlights , and the list goes on .
Solutions ?
Lots .
The time - honored tradition is to use a circuit with a CdS photoresistor , sometimes called a photocell or LDR , for “ light - dependent resistor . ” ( Circuit Example 1 , Example 2 . )
Photoresistors are reliable and cost about $ 1 each , but are going away because they contain cadmium , a toxic heavy metal whose use is increasingly regulated .
There are many other solutions as well .
Look here for some op - amp based photodetector circuits with LED output , and check out some of the tricks used in well - designed solar garden lights , which include gems like using the solar cell itself as the sensor .
( Our own solar circuit collection is here . )
In this article we show how to build a very simple– perhaps even the simplest– darkness - activated LED circuit .
To our LED and battery we add just three components , which cost less than thirty cents altogether ( and much less if you buy in bulk ) .
You can build it in less than five minutes or less ( much less with practice ) .
What can you do with such an inexpensive light - controlled LED circuit ?
Almost anything really .
But , one fun application is to make LED throwies that turn themselves off in the daytime to save power .
Throwies normally can last up to two weeks .
Adding a light - level switch like this can significantly extend their lifetime .
Here are our components :
On top : a CR2032 lithium coin cell ( 3 V ) .
On the bottom ( L - R ) : the LED , an LTR - 4206E phototransistor , a 2N3904 transistor , and a 1 k resistor .
This LED is red , blindingly bright at 60 candela , in a 10 mm package .
It casts a visible beam , visible for about twenty feet in a well - lit room .
We got the LEDs and batteries on eBay , and the other parts are from Digi - Key , but Mouser has them as well .
As we mentioned , the last three cost about $ 0.30 all together , and much less in bulk .
The LTR - 4206E is a phototransistor in a 3 mm black package .
The black package blocks visible light , so it is only sensitive to infrared light– it sees sunlight and incandescent lights , but not fluorescent or ( most ) discharge lamps – it really will come on at night .
Our starting point is the simplest LED circuit : that of the LED throwie , which has an LED driven directly from a 3V lithium coin cell .
( Funny looking example
here . )
From this , we add on the phototransistor , which senses the presence of light , and we use its output to control the transistor , which turns the LED on .
The circuit diagram looks like this ; please ignore the messy handwriting . ;)
When light falls on the phototransistor , it begins to conduct up to about 1.5 mA , which pulls down the voltage at the lower side of the resistor by 1.5 V , turning off the transistor , which turns off the LED .
When it ’s dark , the transistor is able to conduct about 15 mA through the LED .
So , the circuit uses only about 1/10 as much current while the LED is off .
One thing to note about this circuit :
We ’re using a red LED .
That ’s because the voltage drop across the transistor allows less than the full 3 V across the LED .
The full three volts is really only marginal for driving blue LEDs anyway , so two - point - something really does n’t cut it .
( Might be able to work around that with a cheap FET– have n’t tried yet . )
And now , let ’s build it .
You can certainly put this together on a breadboard , but there ’s something more satisfying about the compact and deployable build that we walk through here .
First get the transistor and the resistor .
The pins of the 2N3904 are called ( left - to - right ) Emitter , Base , Collector , when viewing it from the front such that you can read the writing .
We ’re going to solder the resistor between the leads of the Base and Collector of the transistor .
Unusual part : hold the resistor with its leads at 90 degrees to those of the transistor while you solder .
Stay safe when you do this : Use Mr. Hands .
After soldering , clip off the excess resistor lead that is attached to the transistor base ( middle pin ) , as well as the excess length of the collector pin .
Next , we add the phototransistor .
Note that it has a flatted side , much like an LED does .
This pin on that side is the collector of the phototransistor .
Solder the collector ( flatted side ) to the middle pin ( the base ) of the transistor , again at 90 degrees .
The other pin of the phototransistor , the emitter , is left unconnected for the moment .
( Here is an alternate view of what that should look like when you ’re done . )
Finally , we need to add the LED .
To do so , we need to know which side is the “ positive , ” or anode side of the device .
Regrettably markings of LEDs are not consistent , so the best way to be sure is to test it with the lithium coin cell– put the LED across the terminals of the cell and , when it lights up , note which side is touching the (+ ) terminal .
( Usually , it ’s the one with the longer lead . )
Solder the “ positive ” lead of the LED to the emitter pin of the transistor– it ’s the one on the left , which does n’t have anything soldered to it .
Trim away the excess lead of the LED that goes past the solder joint .
Solder the other pin of the LED ( the “ negative ” pin , or cathode ) to the emitter of the phototransistor , the pin on the non-flatted side , which does not have anything connected to it yet .
By this point , there are only two pins sticking down below the components :
One that goes to the resistor and collector ( rightmost pin ) of the transistor , and one that goes to the emitter of the phototransistor and to the cathode of the LED .
To test the circuit , squeeze the coin cell between these two terminals , positive side goes to the lead touching the resistor .
You ca n’t see the LED on here because these photos were taken with incandescent lighting – it would n’t turn on .
Bending the leads to contact the lithium cell a little more reliably , you can try it out a little more easily .
In the photo on the right , I cupped my hand over the circuit– so the LED turned on .
To make this into an actual “ throwie , ” you still need to add some tape and a magnet , but that ’s quite easily done .
This one makes a pretty good nightlight attached to the top of a doorframe– when the room lights are off , it shines a bright , bright spot on the ceiling .
Where to go from here ?
While this little circuit can do something on its own , it would probably also be happy as part of a larger circuit .
At a minimum , note that if you work with batteries that have lower internal resistance than the lithium coin cells , you should place an appropriate resistor in series with the battery before trying to operate this circuit– or else you may put too much current through the LED .
Certainly , this is one of the easiest and least expensive ways to control an LED with a photosensor .
( Unlike , say , this method ? )
You could also consider crossing it with some more extreme mods , like the
Talkie Throwies that know Morse code , or for more extreme hackers , bagel throwies .
Note added , May 2012 :
This set of components works well , and is a pretty neat little dark detector .
We have received hundreds of responses to this article both here in the comments ( which are now closed due to abuse ) and by e-mail , asking ( a ) how you would modify this circuit to do X , Y , or Z , ( b ) whether you can use component THX1138 for the phototransistor , because that ’s the only one available on the tropical island where you live , or ( c ) why your circuit does n’t work , because you only made two substitutions .
We are , for the most part , unable to respond to inquiries like these .
Designing circuits is not always trivial , and we do n’t want to give flippant ( or worse , wrong ) answers , when people are trying to solve problems .
To give the quick set of answers to some of the popular questions :
This it is a special set of parts that is chosen to work well together , and several simplifications have been made on the basis of which particular components are used– for example , we rely on the internal resistance of the coin cell , so that we do n’t need an external current - limiting resistor .
Because of this , there are n’t many simple direct substitutions that work well .
There are plenty of great CdS ( “ LDR ” ) phototransistor circuits out there .
For better or worse , this is not one of them .
( We happen to think betterfor a number of reasons . )
You ca n’t just substitute a white ( or UV , or blue , etc ) LED directly , because there is n’t enough voltage to drive it well .
( We did actually show how to do this one– see below . )
You ca n’t just substitute 12 V , because the current will be too high , and will blow out your LED .
Yes , there are ways to do it , but you have to think it through .
Some other phototransistors will work , and some will not .
If you would like to know which , you can compare their datasheets , or– better yet –just try it !
If you would like to see a couple of other examples of dark - detecting circuits , please see here :

Welcome to the Jungle or how to survive in New York City on a bike
The jungle is scary but it is also a lot of fun .
And riding a bike is probably the fastest way to get around .
Meet the other animals Taxis :
The big danger here is getting doored .
When you see a taxi stop , that means that the passenger is lying in wait to kick the door open with his feet .
Taxi doors are wide and passengers almost never look to the rear before opening them .
People also get out of taxis at red lights .
In general it is OK to pass between cars standing in traffic .
Taxis are a different matter .
Use extreme caution .
Another interesting pattern of behavior exhibited by taxis is pulling into open parking spaces with no warning to drop off or pick up passengers .
This is deadly when you happen to be riding in their blind spot .

Shaded windows , neon lights on the bottom , and blaring rap music are generally a bad sign .
In confrontation they cause more serious injuries than other vehicles because they hit you higher up .

Buses :
Buses are some of the more sluggish and predictable creatures out there .
Hence , they are relatively benign .
You can see from a mile away which way their front wheels point , and that 's the direction they move in .
The main danger is getting squeezed between two buses or a bus and a truck [ ref ] .
The back of the bus can't move sideways , but you need to know how far up the side it is safe to stalk a bus .

It is unhealthy to have one of these monsters roll over you .
It is actually a common mechanism of fatal accidents , despite the fact that these behemoths are usually quite slow [ ref ] .
Private garbage trucks are particularly scary with a staggering bike / pedestrian fatality rate of 24 per 100 million miles for 1994 - 1997 [ ref ] .

Pedestrians : Pedestrians are notable for their highly developed sense of morality .
When they know they are in the wrong ( e.g. , crossing in the red ) and they sense danger , they become suicidal and walk backwards , regardless of where the threat is coming from .
Aim for just in front of jaywalkers , not just behind them .

They are impossible to avoid .
The hazards Getting doored : Far and away the most common source of serious injury .
Experienced cyclists keep a door 's worth of distance from parked cars , even if that means riding in the midst of moving traffic .
Assert your right to a lane when you need it .
Do n't let agressive cars push you into the deadly door - zone .
Sometimes this means riding right in the middle of their lane .
Remember , you are a vehicle , just like they are .
Unless there is a bike lane provided , you have the right to occupy a lane just as much as cars do .

You never know which way it 's going to decide to turn .
Potholes , sinkholes and sewer grates :
It is widely believed that hell is actually located beneath the streets of New York City .
In most cities potholes are just little bumps in the road .
In New York they are gaping holes with no bottom in sight ( technically , these are called sinkholes ) .
Wheels , bikes , and bicyclists have been lost to the world below .
In the summer , bike - sinks spring up randomly overnight .
Please report dangerous potholes and sinkholes to 311 immediately and save a fellow cyclist .

Metal plates : Construction workers use large metal plates to cover up temporary entrances to the underworld .
The plates have sharp edges , are fixed with huge nails , and often there is are gaping slits in the asphalt right at their edges .
Your bike 's wheel can get stuck between two plates with predictable consequences .
In wet weather , the plates are like ice .
Do n't even think about changing direction when riding over them .
Recently , a cyclist got killed just this way [ ref ] .

Road markings , oil , sand , discarded food , and cobblestones :
In the rain , pedestrian crossings and cobblestoned patches of road become frighteningly slippery .
This also applies to the markings and pretty detailing on the bikepath by the West Side Highway .
Ride across these straight and at a lower speed .
Oil is of course a killer .
There are specific spots by the river where sand washes up creating another hazard .
Finally dropped food has also been a cause of accidents .
How to not get killed Wear a helmet .
The majority of bike fatalities as well as a large fraction of serious injuries are a result of head trauma [ ref ] .
Wearing a helmet does n't eliminate this mode of injury , but it reduces the risk .
This is a no-brainer .

Behave as a " normal " vehicle .
There is a whole theory of " vehicular cycling " advocated by John Forester [ link ] based on the premise that if you behave like a respectable vehicle , other vehicles are going to treat you as such ( in other words , if you can't beat them , join them ) .
I think the theory is about half valid .
In general , behaving assertively but predictably and respecting traffic laws just as you expect cars to respect them does help .
On the other hand , the whole point of cycling is that you can do things that cars can't do , like slip through between rows of standing traffic , [ editor 's note : more exciting bits removed from here ] .
The trick is to know when to switch between the two types of behavior : the serious no - nonsense vehicle and the stealthy but lithe creature slipping through the night ( well , almost ) .

Use lights , even on the front .
The city is well - lit , but it 's full of visual distractions .
It is easy to miss a cyclist .
A powerful flashing light really helps to draw attention to you and your bike .
The front light is essential to avoiding the " left turn without yielding to oncoming bike " type of accident .
Side reflectors mounted on the wheels are important in intersections .
reflectors and lights are also mandated by law , which means that if you ever get into a night accident they are going to make the world of difference in court irrespective of how stupid the driver who hit you was .
In erms of actual safety , a high visibility vest with large retroreflective surfaces might make even more of a difference .

The U.S. Army has begun a series of exercises that will prepare armed servicemen for Homeland Security operations at Fort Stewart , GA .
From crowd control to quick response in the event of a chemical , biological , or nuclear attack , the goal of such exercises is to ready those in the service for conducting armed operations on American soil .
The first of such exercises ran on September 30th under the scenario of a response to a nuclear attack .
The exercise scenario was a sobering one : a 10 - kiloton nuclear device detonated in America ’s heartland , quickly overwhelming civilian responders .
Military leaders who recently trained for this response say they are now thinking differently about how to move equipment , extract the injured and take care of people following this type of attack .
Their insights came from " Vibrant Response , " a week - long command post exercise designed to train the commanders and staff of the nation ’s dedicated force for responding to chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear and high - yield explosive incidents , or CBRNE incidents .
The units completed the exercise Sept. 18 at Fort Stewart , Ga. , just two weeks before their force , the CBRNE Consequence Management Response Force , or CCMRF , will be assigned to U.S. Northern Command to begin its mission .
MySpace turned it up to 11 today by launching MySpace Music , a joint venture we first heard about back in April between the social networking giant and the big four music labels .
As a dedicated new section of the main MySpace site , MySpace Music offers a five - million - strong catalog of songs for free web streaming or for purchase as MP3s from Amazon .
The record labels are placing big bets on this move , so we spoke with Steve Pearman , MySpace 's SVP of Product Strategy , about what this means for the music industry and the MySpace community .
Since MySpace was founded in part on helping musicians get their songs in front of an audience , MySpace Music feels like a natural evolution for the site .
Independent artists have long been able to upload their music ; users could add the streaming tunes to their profiles or , more recently , download them .
But today , MySpace joins others like Rhapsody and imeem in the web streaming movement by adding a healthy catalog of major artists from all four of the big labels , as well as independent distributor The Orchard .
Unfortunately , however , MySpace Music is currently available only to US users .
All songs are completely free to stream in their entirety , and a new Flash music player embedded across various areas of the site allows for browsing the entire catalog or tracks from a particular artist .
Songs can be added to a top 10 list ( for display on one 's profile ) or to an unlimited number of custom playlists ( which can only hold 100 songs each ) .
For you closet pop music fans , playlists can be kept public or private so you do n't have to let others find out about your Pussycat Dolls obsession .
" You 're effectively building a music collection here , but they 're all up in the cloud , " Pearman told Ars .
" Previous models have been about scarcity and building walls around content .
Subscription services were cool but did n't work on the one device that everybody had .
We figured that there was a model around building a business and opening content up . "
Monetizing the music
MySpace will , of course , rely heavily on advertisements displayed while rocking out to music , but it has also partnered with Amazon to incorporate an MP3 store for purchasing tracks .
Each song can be purchased as a DRM - free MP3 download , and Amazon 's optional PC and Mac - compatible downloader allows songs to be effortlessly shuffled into iTunes and Windows Media Player .
Users do n't need to use this downloader , however .
With the launch of these new features , MySpace did its best to boost the odds for the labels by integrating the music experience across its entire site .
When visiting an artist 's or friend 's page , any single embedded in his or her profile can be added to your own playlists with a couple clicks .
A " Featured Playlists " section will highlight not just what 's on top artists '
iPods , but playlists from MySpace users who " make kickass playlists . "
During the purchase and download process from Amazon , artist merchandise like t- shirts and coffee mugs are recommended , fulfilling MySpace chief executive Chris DeWolfe 's statement of " monetizing [ the artists ] in five or six different ways . "
When we asked Pearman about the exact nature of MySpace Music 's joint partnership with the labels , he would n't comment .
He would say , though , that MySpace music has been spun out to be " its own entity with its own staff .
Its own company , really . "
This gives it " the liberty to try new things .
The labels are on board to try and figure out what the future looks like . "
When it comes to independent artists , however , things are n't as positive just yet .
Ars has heard from indie distributors like Merlin and A2IM who are upset that they are n't being offered the same equity stake in MySpace Music that the major labels got .
“ It is incredibly disappointing that MySpace will launch their new service without having finalized a deal with the world 's most important independent labels and artists .
It certainly makes Chris DeWolfe 's public statements , that the ' indie bands are really the heart of MySpace , ' ring extremely hollow , " said independent label licensing collective Merlin CEO Charles Caldas .
" What is absolutely clear , however , is that any independent deal struck without an equity component ( as was done with the majors ) , will see independent labels face a situation whereby their major competitors will profit from the use of their repertoire without an appropriate upside opportunity being extended to them by MySpace Music and its major label equity partners "
It 's no secret that , while digital music sales have been steadily rising , CD sales have slumped .
But amidst a growing number of digital outlets with varying business models , MySpace already has a massive US user base of around 80 million users , all who now have unfettered access to a large catalog and the six degrees of product marketing that comes with it .
Introduction and Specifications
There 's an old cliche ' that certainly applies to commodity semiconductor and electronics technology , as well as many other competitive arenas ; " go big or go home " .
If you look at major semiconductor manufacturers , like Intel , AMD , Samsung and NVIDIA , you 'll notice that they generally do not enter a new market lightly .
In addition , they almost never partially resource a new market penetration effort .
Timing is definitely key but it usually does n't pay off to tread lightly when it 's time to execute .
It 's simply a question of doing the business case analysis , justifying the ROI and then placing your bets .
Go big or go home .
It 's all - in or sit on the sidelines and watch .
And you know , when Intel decides they want in , the stack of chips they 're playing with is n't the kind you find at the cheap tables .
With that in mind , let 's consider the future of the Solid State Disk market and where it 's going .
We 've said it before , the days of rotational media are numbered .
Though SSDs and spinning drives will likely coexist for some time , traditional hard drive technology will eventually go the way of the dinosaur .
SSDs have no moving parts to wear out , they consume much less power , produce very little heat and their performance will continue to improve over time , with the kind of scaling that comes along with a semiconductor performance evolution curve .
Though the migration will be gradual , starting first at the consumer level , then moving into the industrial and enterprise space , it 's a matter of time before the world literally goes solid state for its storage .
In the short term , especially at the consumer level , the SSD market is expected to have explosive growth over the next year or so , some analysts predicting well in excess of 100 % annually .
And so it goes without saying , Solid State Storage is a safe bet .
Today Intel just bellied up to the table and dropped their chips down on the SSD market , and in typical Intel fashion , they 're going in big .
The following is a full evaluation of Intel 's new consumer - targeted X25 - M Solid State Drive .
Is Intel playing to win ?
You tell us ...
Intel MLC Series Solid State Drives Specifications and Features
Model Name Intel X18 - M Mainstream SATA Solid- State Drive
Intel X25 - M Mainstream SATA Solid - State Drive Capacity 80 GB and 160GB NAND Flash Components Intel® Multi-Level Cell ( MLC ) NAND Flash Memory
10 Channel Parallel Architecture with 50nm MLC ONFI 1.0 NAND Bandwidth Up to 250MB / s Read Speeds
Up to 70 MB / s Write Speeds Read Latency 85 microseconds Interface SATA 1.5 Gb/s and 3.0 Gb/s Form factor X18 - M : 1.8 " Industry Standard Hard Drive Form Factor
X25 - M : 2.5 " Industry Standard Hard Drive Form Factor Compatibility SATA Revision 2.6 Compliant .
Compatible with SATA 3.0 Gb/s with Native Command Queuing and SATA 1.5 Gb/s interface rates Life expectancy 1.2 million hours Mean Time Before Failure ( MTBF ) Power consumption Active : 150 mW Typical ( PC workload )
Idle ( DIPM ) : 0.06W Typical Operating shock 1,000G / 0.5 ms
Operating temperature 0°C to +70 °C RoHS Compliance Meets the requirements of EU RoHS Compliance Directives Product health monitoring Self - Monitoring , Analysis and Reporting Technology ( S.M.A.R.T. ) commands plus additional SSD monitoring
As a precursor to this product overview and performance evaluation , if you have an extra cycle of bandwidth or two , we'd highly suggest checking out our recent 4 - way SSD round - up article , located here .
This article steps through various aspects of Solid State Disk technology , including the different memory types and their advantages and disadvantages .
Intel is actually launching two flavors MLC - based Solid State Disks today , the X18 - M and X25 - M .
We 'll be looking at an 80 GB X25 - M drive that is built on a 2.5 " form - factor , but Intel also has 160 GB densities and 1.8 " versions of the drive as well .
From there , this spec table is straight - forward .
Intel claims their drives are capable of a maximum read bandwidth of 250MB / sec and write bandwidth of up to 70 MB / sec .
Intel also specifies read latency of 85 microseconds , which is of course a fraction of even the fastest spinning hard drives at 4 ms .
or so .
Intel also specifies a 1.2 million hour MTBF ( mean time before failure ) , which is about on par with the average hard drive .
Power consumption on the other hand is again a fraction of what most spinning discs are measured at .
The average spinning drive weighs in with an active power consumption somewhere in between 8 and 10 watts , while most SSDs , including Intel 's , offer sub - watt power consumption under " typical conditions " , though as we 'll show you in the pages that follow , that does n't mean max power consumption is that low .
However , as you can imagine , when you read from or write to an SSD , you do n't have to light up all the flash memory in the drive to get at the data .

THE RUSSIA - Georgia war has revealed a new balance of power in the world -- and exposed the hypocrisy of U.S. politicians and the media who decry the imperialism emanating from Moscow , but embrace it when it 's made in the USA .
John McCain , of course , wins the prize for setting the most outrageous double standard .
" In the 21st century , " he informed us , " nations do n't invade other nations . "
Unless , of course , we 're talking about Afghanistan or Iraq , and the invading power happens to be the United States .
McCain demanded an immediate pullout of all Russian forces from Georgia and insisted upon its " territorial integrity " -- even as he claims the right for the U.S. to occupy Iraq for the next 100 years .
The supposedly progressive Barack Obama sounded little different .
" I have condemned Russian aggression , and today I reiterate my demand that Russia abide by the cease - fire , " he said .
" Russia must know that its actions will have consequences . "
One can imagine how a President Obama would respond if Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin or President Dimitri Medvedev declared that he would n't withdraw all troops from Georgia right away , but would leave behind a large occupation force in order to be " as careful in getting out of Georgia as we were careless in getting in . "
That , of course , is Obama 's excuse for keeping up to 50,000 U.S. troops in Iraq for " force protection , " the defense of U.S. military personnel and " anti-terrorist " missions -- the same kind of pretext that Russia used to move beyond Georgia 's disputed South Ossetia region to a full - fledged invasion .
Russian soldiers look on as Georgia burns
The media has been even more two - faced than the politicians .
The same news outlets that parroted the Pentagon whitewash of civilian casualties in the horrific U.S. blitz on Falluja in Iraq in 2004 or aerial bombardment of wedding parties in Afghanistan now breathlessly report on the Russian bombs and artillery shells that hit apartment buildings and markets .
For the U.S. media , when Washington military action causes civilian deaths -- between 600,000 and more than 1 million in Iraq , according to some estimates -- it 's " collateral damage , " a regrettable but unavoidable part of modern warfare .
Yet when a Russian plane drops a bomb that kills innocent bystanders , it 's a barbaric disregard for human life .
One wonders just how much more unpopular the U.S. war in Iraq would be if the media worked as hard at exposing civilian casualties in that country as it has in Georgia .
TO POINT out this U.S. hypocrisy is n't to downplay the imperial nature of Russia 's latest occupation of Georgia .
Georgia may have initiated the conflict by trying to smash the Russian - backed separatists among the Ossetian minority -- and likely did so with a green light from the U.S. But Russia seized the opportunity to make an example of Georgia through military might -- and not for the first time .
The Tsarist rulers of old Russia conquered Georgia more than two centuries ago .
After a brief interlude following the Russian Revolution of 1917 , Georgia was again imprisoned in Stalin 's USSR .
The Georgian nationalist movement revived in the 1980s despite murderous repression by the supposedly liberal Mikhail Gorbachev , the last president of the USSR .
The 1991 collapse of the USSR saw the non-Russian " federal republics , " including Georgia , gain independence .
With Russian imperialism in crisis , U.S. imperialism was determined to fill the vacuum , not only in Moscow 's former puppet states in Eastern Europe , but in countries formerly part of the USSR .
Georgia , however , was slow going for the U.S.
The pro-Western Georgian nationalist leader , Zviad Gamsakhurdia , pushed a " Georgia for the Georgians " line that frightened the 30 percent of the population that was non-Georgian -- people whom Gamsakhurdia ominously referred to as " guests . "
The first non-Communist Party head of Georgia in the waning days of the USSR , Gamsakhurdia went on to revoke the autonomous status of Abkhazia and North Ossetia , which had been enshrined in the USSR 's constitution .
Resistance from the Abkhazians and Ossetians led to civil war and ethnic cleansing and , with Russian intervention , de facto independence for both regions since 1993 .
The situation was little changed under the regime of Eduard Schevardnadze , the former foreign minister of the USSR who returned home to Georgia to take over the presidency after Gamsakhurdia was ousted in a coup .
During Schevardnadze 's decade in power , Russia and the U.S. jockeyed for influence in Georgia .
Washington found a willing business partner in Schevardnadze .
He was in favor of an oil pipeline that would bypass Russia .
He was also a career Soviet politician who had run Georgia in the 1970s and who refused to take a consistent anti-Moscow line .
In 2003 , an election year in Georgia , Schevardnadze set off alarm bells in Washington by making a deal with the Russian electrical power monopoly AES , which followed an earlier " strategic partnership " with the huge Russian gas company Gazprom .
In late 2003 , the U.S. , then still in the confident " Mission Accomplished " phase of the Iraq war , decided to up the ante .
It backed the U.S. - educated lawyer Mikheil Saakashvili , the leader of the mass protests of the " Rose Revolution " that ousted Schevardnadze after his party tried to rig parliamentary election results .
Modeled on the rebellion that drove Slobodan Milosevic from power in Serbia in 2000 , the Rose Revolution was sustained in part by money from the foundation controlled by billionaire financier George Soros .
In the wake of the Rose Revolution the Soros foundation and other donors , as well as the United Nations Development Project , even paid salaries for 11,000 civil servants as part of a three - year aid program .
The U.S. saw the Saakashvili government as a means to accelerate its energy and defense plans for Georgia .
Saakashvili's presidential inauguration in 2004 was attended by then - Secretary of State Colin Powell , who announced $ 166 million in immediate aid as well as a three - year , $ 500 million aid package to promote " economic reforms . "
This was only part of a steady stream of U.S. dollars to a country of just 4.6 million people .
According to one study , Georgia is the second highest recipient of U.S. aid per capita in the world .
Meanwhile , the European Union and the World Bank pledged another $ 1 billion in assistance to Saakashvili 's government .
SOON , THE White House was ready to plant the U.S. flag in the heart of the South Caucasus .
George W. Bush visited Tbilisi in May 2005 to " underscore his support for democracy , historic reform and peaceful conflict resolution , " as the U.S. Embassy in Georgia put it in a press release .
These " reforms , " according to Kakha Bendukidze , the Russia - based industrial oligarch turned Georgian economy minister , meant that the Georgian state would privatize " everything that can be sold , except its conscience . "
With Saakashvili in power , Washington moved aggressively to create in Georgia a crucial gateway for oil and gas pipelines that could bypass Russia on the north and Iran on the south .
It was under Saakashvili that the long - sought Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan ( BTC ) oil pipeline was finally completed in 2005 , providing a means to get oil from Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea across Georgia to a Turkish port on the Mediterranean .
The U.S. had to strong - arm Western oil companies into building BTC -- ultimately , BP agreed to take the lead .
The U.S. also had to pressure the International Finance Corporation , the private development arm of the World Bank , to loan $ 250 million for construction of the pipeline .
" In the South Caucasus , U.S. and European state interests are bound up with the commercial interests of major oil companies that form the principal Caspian energy consortia , " wrote Damien Helly and Giorgi Gogia , two experts on Georgian politics .
" To secure their investments in the Caspian Sea Basin , these companies have found allies among U.S. geostrategists who support a strong U.S. presence among Russia 's neighbors .
High - level former officials such as Zbigniew Brzezinski , Brent Scowcroft , John Sununu , James Baker and Richard Cheney ( when he was head of Halliburton ) have all visited Baku [ Azerbaijan ] and the Caspian region and lobbied in favor of the oil companies . "
These U.S. economic and political projects had to be secured militarily .
Thus , in the wake of 9/11 , the U.S. began to send military advisers to Georgia .
That move rankled Moscow , which also accused Georgia of doing too little to stop the flow of arms and insurgents across its border into neighboring Chechnya , where separatists were fighting the Russian armed forces .
For Russia , Georgia was seen as a red line that the U.S. and NATO could not cross .
In the early 1990s , Russia had no choice but to allow the expansion of NATO to include its former satellites in Eastern Europe and the three former Soviet Republics on the Baltic .
But the U.S. push to include Georgia and Ukraine in the alliance -- as well as efforts to place anti-missile systems in the Czech Republic and Poland - - was too much for the Kremlin .
After Saakashvili took over in Tbilisi , U.S. - Russian tensions over Georgia increased dramatically .
In 2004 , NATO approved Georgia 's " Individual Action Partnership Plan , " the first step toward membership of the alliance , and stationed a liaison officer in Tbilisi .
In the years since , the U.S. and Israel have sent military trainers to upgrade Georgia 's military to NATO standards , and Saakashvili has showed his loyalty to the U.S. by sending 2,500 Georgian troops to participate in the occupation of Iraq .
By 2007 , the Georgian armed forces , previously a ragtag outfit unable to defeat irregular militias in South Ossetia or Abkhazia , were well - drilled , lavishly equipped and NATO - ready .
The U.S. pushed for a fast - track acceptance into the alliance .
All that state - of - the - art weaponry , of course , is now smashed or captured by the Russian army , and the armed forces shattered by the Russian occupation .
What began as the latest U.S. attempt to use a small nation as an outpost of the American Empire has ended with a brutal invasion by a rival empire , one just as determined to police its own " backyard " as the U.S. has been in Latin America .
And in the wake of the Russia - Georgia war , oil - rich Azerbaijan -- which has its own separatist region populated by ethnic Armenians allied with Russia - - will think twice about crossing Moscow to sign up with the U.S. and NATO .
But the consequences of the Russian invasion go far beyond the South Caucasus region .
The war has exposed the expanded NATO as a hollow organization .
" For an organization that has come to rely heavily on words and symbolism , NATO issued a disconcertingly evasive communiqué at its emergency meeting on Georgia , " journalist Vladimir Socor wrote .
" The first mention of Russia appears only in the second paragraph , and it is a positive mention : NATO ' welcomes the [ armistice ] agreement reached and signed by Georgia and Russia . '
No reference to the Russian military duress , under which this flawed armistice was ' reached . '
The communiqué urges prompt , good - faith implementation of the armistice , politely ignoring its loopholes . "
So much for NATO 's vaunted " one - for - all , all - for - one " principle .
The U.S. and NATO have bankrolled and armed a tiny nation , encouraged or tolerated a military attack that was bound to trigger a response from a neighboring great power -- and , when that small country was invaded and occupied , stood back and did nothing .
So much for the neoconservative dream of a " new world order " under U.S. domination , guaranteed by pre-emptive warfare and regime change .
The U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were intended to allow Washington to consolidate its grip on the Middle East and project its power into the Caucusus and Central Asia .
Instead , the U.S. finds itself militarily overstretched , incapable of protecting its new client states and unable even to get a strong resolution out of NATO condemning Russia 's invasion of Georgia - - to say nothing of NATO countries ' reluctance to commit troops to the losing war in Afghanistan .
There are other examples of waning U.S. imperial clout -- the ouster of Pervez Musharraf as dictator of Pakistan being the latest serious example .
The cracks in the empire , in turn , are widened by the ongoing U.S. financial crisis , which is increasingly dragging down the entire world economy .
The entire U.S. economic model -- the pro-business , free - trade neoliberal program -- is being discredited .
The recent collapse of the latest World Trade Organization negotiations is a case in point .
U.S. imperialism is far from a spent force , of course .
The country still has enormous military might and economic resources , and a President Obama would likely bring in a foreign policy and military team that 's more competent than the Bush administration hacks .
But no matter who 's in charge in the White House , the shift in the world balance of power -- economically , militarily and politically -- is bound to lead to further instability and crises .

Of Nichols , author Gore Vidal says : “ Of all the giant slayers now afoot in the great American desert , John Nichols ’s sword is the sharpest . ”
Onkruid ( Netherlands )
The magazine " Onkruid " [ " The Weed " ] , which is the main ' alternative ' print magazine here in the Netherlands [ with a New Age slant ] , has 8 pages dedicated to polyamory in its Juli / August 2008 number .
Much of this is an interview with Ageeth Veenemans , whom you mentioned on May 17 , 2008 .
The article is called Dertig jaar na de seksuele revolutie : van partnerruil naar polyamorie , or " Thirty years after the sexual revolution , from partner swapping to polyamory " .
It starts by talking about the ability to love multiple people , as opposed to just have sex with multiple people as was long the focus of the sexual revolution .
The suite of articles includes a column by Iteke Weeda , a Dutch sociologist who has written books and columns about the concept since the mid-80's , when it was called liefde in meervoud , " love in plurality " .
There are also sub-articles dealing with the origins of polyamory , a rather simple test to see how poly you are , " From Jealousy to Frubble " , " Polyamory and Spirituality " , and " Polyamory as a Trend " .
Thirty years after the sexual revolution : from partner swapping to polyamory
By Judith van der Graaf
Do you remember ... the sexual revolution and its effects ?
Or is that way before your time , and are you more into monogamous relationships as came afterwards ?
In either case , summer is a good time for love .
However , what to do if you 're already in a relationship and have butterflies in your stomach over someone else ?
Cheating is cumbersome , and ' swinging ' does n't have all the answers either .
Polyamory might provide you with an alternative : Openly loving more than one person at the same time .
In a conversation with Ageeth Veenemans who wrote a book about it , we 'll shed some light on this phenomenon and take a look at its spiritual content .
Also , a look - back by Bob Snoijink and Iteke Weeda as experts on the achievements of 30 years of sexual revolution .
----------
Ageeth Veenemans ( age 44 ) has made polyamory her life 's work .
She wrote the book Ik hou van twee mannen ( I love two men ) .
A book about her personal struggle with love and falling in love while being married , with a happy ending .
At the same time it 's a guide : how do you actually do this , and how do you become a full - fledged ' polyamorist ' ?
Q : What is polyamory ?
A : " Polyamory is a life - philosophy in which you admit that you can love more than one person and that you can be loyal , open and respectful towards each other .
Typical qualities can be : Friendship , intimacy , emotional or spiritual closeness , and / or sexuality .
In essence it is love , not sex .
it 's about love without limitations rather then sex without limitations .
Love is an energy that you can feel , and that you can show by loving .
I see sex as the most beautiful and intense way of communicating love .
However that is where the taboo lies : having sex with someone else than your partner "
Is polyamory limited to gender and age ?
" Often men are more interested in sex and women more interested in intimacy .
In a sense you could say that polyamory is more of a woman 's thing .
However , in principle it 's not connected to gender or age .
In the forums most people are 35 - plus .
This is natural : by then you will have had a steady relationship for a while , and it is possible that you will fall in love with someone else .
There are people in their 20's who practice it .
These usually are students who are very conscious about their life .
I even know people aged 80 and above who have been practising polyamory for several decades ! "
Do you belief that deep in their hearts , everybody is polyamorous ?
" I belief that everybody can feel love for several people at a time .
But not everybody will be suited to the polyamorous life .
I sometimes call it ' love for advanced students ' , because in practice , it 's not an easy road . "
What to do when your partner is polyamorous and you are not , or the other way around ?
" Indeed , it is tricky if you differ from your partner in that way .
however I do n't believe in perpetrators and victims . "
What do you think about 50 - plus men who say : my wife is getting old , with all the wrinkles , I 'm going to add a younger woman ?
" I see two or three people who will have to work that out .
Sometimes you 'll see , especially in older generations , that such a wife has learned to sacrifice herself and take care of her husband .
In return she expects his sexual fidelity .
How awkward that he should fall in love with another .
I 'd want to challenge such a woman : take care of yourself , assume responsibility .
Do n't become a victim of the situation .
That will be bad for your self - image .
But I can see how difficult that is ! "
And the man , does falling in love with ' a young flower ' offer him any chances on self - development ?
" I think he does , often involving insecurity about his age and looks .
I find it hard to understand this focus on superficialities .
For me it 's all about the ' click ' .
On the other hand I do seem to fall for taller men , so perhaps I have some things to work out about my height ! "
What is the link between polyamory and ' swinging ' ?
" The morality needs to adjust itself to the reality .
Swinging is a way to deal with that : sex with other people is allowed , but restricted by rules .
Love is often not allowed .
Sometimes it works .
I know people who experience an enormous amount of freedom , by only having the guts to do that , and who develop beautiful friendships because of it .
Personally I feel that sex for the sex is in no way comparable with loving sex .
In polyamory it 's all about the love , and is sex a possible result , not a purpose . "
What is your personal mission in writing this book and doing this work ?
" I was raised Catholic and monogamous , got married , had three children , and thought that this would be the way it would be for the rest of my life .
Until seven years ago when I fell in love with a co-worker : Bob .
Cheating was a big personal taboo , and I condemned it strongly in other people .
However when he kissed me , all the fuses blew and I started a secret affair .
" I was so much in love , that I considered leaving husband and children for him .
Maybe you should experience something like that yourself to understand how this can happen in a life .
My brother had the same experience :
He had a relationship of 17 years and a child a year old when he fell head over heels for another woman .
He was convicted by people around him , his wife left him , taking his child , and he lost everything he had in one fell swoop .
One time we talked about it , and I saw him cry .
About how intense his love felt , but also about how he still loved his wife , and missed his child .
Unfortunately he had a cardiac arrest a few months later in this stressing period of his life , which cost his life .
" I have literally seen what kind of misery the monogamous norm can bring .
I myself went through a harsh time : I confessed to my husband and said my farewells to Bob .
I was completely open to my husband about that , because I did n't want to cheat any more .
" But what was the alternative ?
That was when I found the website ( www.polyamory.nl) and thought : how is it possible that I did n't know that this existed !
I immediately decided : I 'm going to write a book about this !
The writing began to process my own experience , but also to lend support to all the people in that situation .
" Polyamory saved my marriage .
Only when we were able to talk about this , could our relationship improve .
Finally I could show my sorrow for my lost love , and my husband could show his emotions about my deceit , and through all this openness we came to each other again .
" Before I went public under my own name , I extensively talked with my husband about it .
I like the way we live and want to express it .
And I have experienced that you can do it : I continued to live , and feel that people even respect us .
Only the pre-war [ WWII ] generation cannot seem to muster understanding .
The generation that experienced the sexual revolution is usually quite open to it .
" I could n't consider leaving my husband any more and would be extremely embarrassed if I had taken the care of their father away from my children .
An important part of my mission is : Assume responsibility for your children .
Sometimes divorce is the way to go .
But I want to show :
This is the alternative , take a look , maybe it 's something for you . "
Sociologist and love - researcher Iteke Weeda ( age 65 ) :
' It should be possible ' becomes ' It should be allowed if it can be done ' .
" Polyamory is one of the biggest taboos ; still , a majority of people have to deal with love - experiences with others in their relationship .
Is n't that weird , a taboo for something that lives with most of society ! "
Iteke Weeda has been talking about ' love in plurality ' [ liefde in meervoud ] for years , a term that she coined for the phenomenon of erotic feelings of love for several people at the same time .
She has an enormous amount of letters and depositions from men and women who have experience of this .
" In the 50's the sexual morality was very strict : you find your true love between your 18th and 25th year of age , and you marry him , without having sex before marriage .
It was rather immature if you fell in love after 30 .
If you had a partner , flirting with another was not done , and cheating was direct cause for divorce .
The period 1965 - 1975 was a a time filled with experiment to topple the sacred ideals , especially in the more elitist groups : the time of communes , anti-authoritarian raising of children and partner - swapping .
Actually partner - swapping was still a bit traditional because you experimented within marriage , and emotions wore not allowed .
' It should be possible ' became the new motto .
Of course it was n't that simple : new love and jealousy did develop , with many divorces as a result . "
In the second half of the 70's the number of experiment declined ; monogamy was nourished more .
In the 80's AIDS reinforced this trend .
Did the sexual revolution fail because of that ?
" Oh no , I see it this way : first we ran ahead 25 steps and then we fell back 15 .
But those 10 remaining steps we kept : we never returned to the way of thinking of the 50's .
Slowly we developed ourselves further , we become emotionally stronger .
And this is the requisite for such experiments as polyamory ; this allows you to cope with the painful emotions that sometimes come with it .
The new morality is turning into ' everything should be allowed if it can be done ' .
I meet many people who are finding their way into polyamory .
It can be an enrichment if all parties can deal with it , and if it can happen in the open .
Through secrecy , you distort the intuition of the other , who really can tell that something is happening .
This does n't mean that you should share everything , including the tiniest bed - details .
There is something like privacy . "
The long , slow arc of world history bends toward human betterment .
At least that 's what most of the Western world has believed since the Renaissance and the Enlightenment .
The ideal of historical progress toward ever greater knowledge , humanism , civilization , and reason  an ideal aborted in the United States  continues in Europe , the place that gave birth to the Enlightenment and the concept of historical progress itself .
These ideals remain especially strong in the Northern European countries .
So in a place like the Netherlands , people tend to be unthreatened by new ideas about better human relations .
European societies do tend to behave more traditionally around issues of home , family , and community than Americans do  what with our own ideals of individualism , private gain , and mobility , which have led to social fragmentation .
Few of us Americans pay much attention to our neighbors any more or even know who they are .
This individualism does give American polys a lot of breathing room , despite the hostile ruling ideology .
But in societies that believe in the idea of progress  that we are here to throw off the darknesses and cruelties of the past , and to strive for a happier , more humane future ( as America itself once believed )  in such places , the notion of polyamory lands on friendlier ground .
All this is by way of introduction to a letter I got from GeekFox in Amsterdam :
He has translated the main article for us , shown below .
" It was n't easy , " he writes , " as Dutch has a lot of flowery sayings and idioms , and the article has used a lot of them .
^.^
I 've tried to keep close to the original ; I hope this has n't created clunky English .
" GeekFox also translated the sidebar on Iteke Weeda :
The magazine did n't put the articles on its website .
If it does , remember that you can translate ( very roughly ) a whole site by pasting the URL into Google Language Tools

In two separate campaign appearances today both Barack Obama and Joe Biden proclaimed Sarah Palin ’s pregnant 17 year old daughter Bristol , politically off limits .
Speaking to reporters in Monroe , Michigan Obama said , “ Let me be as clear as possible .
I think people ’s families are off - limits , and people ’s children are especially off - limits .
This should n’t be part of our politics .
It has no relevance to Gov. Palin ’s performance as governor or her potential performance as a vice president . ”
The Democratic nominee pointed out that he was the child of an 18 year old mother , and that his supporters should back off of this story , “ How a family deals with issues and teenage children , that should n’t be the topic of our politics , and I hope that anybody who is supporting me understands that ’s off - limits . ”

While campaigning in Florida , vice presidential nominee Joe Biden was asked about Palin , “ I do n’t know the governor … I know people worry about Biden - style talk , but the truth is I simply do n’t know .
I take her on face value .
She ’s a governor , that ’s no mean feat and she seems to have a strong personal story . ”
He also added that , “ children are off limits . ”
I think that the family of the candidate should be off limits .
Teenagers get pregnant sometimes .
It happens to both good and bad parents .
If anything this story demonstrates why the abstinence only sex education programs that social conservatives are always touting , do n’t work .
I think that Obama and Biden have got it right .
There is no place in the campaign for that kind of attack on a teenage girl .
If anything this is a problem for the McCain campaign , because this is another story that takes the focus off of their convention and their candidate .
Obama has been steadfast all through this election in saying that family should be off limits .
Some fringe right wingers have seen fit to attack Michelle Obama , but going after a pregnant 17 year old girl is an entirely different ballgame .
By jumping on this story , the Obama campaign risks being viewed as mean , and could possibly create a tidal wave of sympathy for Palin .
To me , this story has nothing to do with the election and the Democrats are right to leave it alone .

Fox cites unreliable text poll declaring Palin winner , ignores real polls Nick Juliano and David Edwards
Published : Friday October 3 , 2008
Print This Email This ' Bigger flag pin ' also meant Palin won , Doocy says
The perky conservatives at Fox & Friends had a challenge before them Friday morning .
While Sarah Palin bested the abysmally low expectations that preceded her vice presidential debate performance , ' good enough ' just was n't a good enough spin for Steve Doocy and his crew .
Where to turn for some positive spin on Palin 's merely adequate 90 - minutes on stage ?
Why , to Fox 's own conservative audience , of course .
" There was a text poll that Fox News ran while you were watching you could actually text and let us know who won , " Doocy declared .
" Overwhelmingly by a margin of 87 to 11 , you thought that Sarah Palin was the big winner . "
Hooray !
Happy days are here again .
Doocy just knew that Palin could recover from a disastrous week of media appearances if only all the good boys and girls in the audience just believed real hard and clapped their hands -- or in this case , worked their thumbs .
( Call it the Tinkerbell strategy . )
The hosts continued their hagiography of Palin 's valiant victory for several more minutes -- all the while ignoring various legitimately scientific polls which showed Biden as the winner .
Even Fox 's unscientific online poll found Biden was the winner as of midday Friday .
And in touting the text - message poll , the Fox hosts relied on a format one of their network 's stars dismissed just last year after a similar poll declared Ron Paul the winner of a GOP primary debate .
Oh well .
It was n't long before they moved on to an even more irrelevant metric for deciding victory .
" There is a clear winner this morning .
...
Examine the flag pins , " Doocy said .
" Joe Biden had a flag pin , Palin had a flag pin .
...
Her 's is about three times the size of his , so I would say flag pin-wise , she is the hands down winner . "
Co-host Gretchen Carlson chimed in to remind everyone that " she 's got a few more jewels on hers , " drawing an especially lecherous - sounding reply from Doocy .
" Yes she does , " he said , his tone of voice raising the question of just how much time he spent Thursday night leering at Palin 's lapel .

Gas costs have skyrocketed , and with them , the cost of flying .
This greenie is n’t 100 % upset : with the cost of fuel increasing exponentially in the past few years , people are examining their transportation patterns and needs and trying to find cost - and fuel - effective methods of getting from Point A to Point B. Smaller , more fuel - efficient cars are selling well , and ridership on public transit is up .
But for many Americans , particularly those in smaller cities and towns , public transit is non-existent .
For those living anywhere but the East Coast , Amtrak is slow , unreliable , or non-existent .
We ’re a country for whom the cost of cheap fuel has promoted individual car use to the detriment of other forms of transportation .
Here in the Midwest , it ’s incredibly frustrating how limited rail and bus is .
I frequently travel between St Louis and Minneapolis , and unless I have the luxury of a few days to travel , rail and bus are extremely inconvenient .
Do n’t get me started about trying to get to Des Moines , where my parents live , from St Louis–it ’s basically fly or drive .
Flying has become extremely expensive and unthinkably uncomfortable .
I find myself wedged in a coach seat longing for the relative space and comfort of Amtrak but knowing that my options from St Louis are limited .
Fortunately , change is bubbling .
Talk of expanding mass transit is everywhere .
California just greenlighted a high - speed bullet - style train from LA to San Francisco that will make the almost 400 - mile trip in less than three hours .
Democratic Party Vice - Presidential Nominee Joe Biden is an Amtrak enthusiast who has used the rail system religiously during his time on Capitol Hill , and he and Barack Obama pledge to expand mass transit if elected .
Public transportation is experiencing record ridership as people abandon their cars for the cost - saving ( and often time - and peace of mind - saving ) bus or light rail in their cities .
I made a list in my head of the traits my dream transit system would embody .
It would include efficient , extensive bus systems like in Curitiba , Brazil .
It would include high - speed , intercity rail systems like those in Japan , and those systems would connect every state and all major cities .
Rail systems would offer sweet weekend deals for leisure travelers , like when I lived in Germany and five people could travel anywhere on Deutsche Bahn for 28 € total .
There would be an expansion of bike lanes and bike paths for two - wheeled transportation .
And , all these things would pay for themselves through fuel taxes or carbon taxes , and citizens would view transit as an efficient system that truly served them .
Car ownership would truly become an option for most Americans .
So what ’s your dream for transit in America ?
How can we implement infrastructures that will not only encourage mass transit , but make it affordable , convenient , reliable , and environmentally - friendly ?
What models can we look to when planning ?
What experiences abroad have you had that you wish we could have here ?
Do you think these dreams can or will become a reality ?
What obstacles are stopping us from extensive , efficient , affordable mass transit ?

WASHINGTON  President Bush appealed to the nation Wednesday night to support a $ 700 billion plan to avert a widespread financial meltdown , and signaled that he is willing to accept tougher controls over how the money is spent .
As Democrats and the administration negotiated details of the package late into the night , the presidential candidates of both major parties planned to meet Mr. Bush at the White House on Thursday , along with leaders of Congress .
The president said he hoped the session would “ speed our discussions toward a bipartisan bill . ”
Mr. Bush used a prime - time address to warn Americans that “ a long and painful recession ” could occur if Congress does not act quickly .
“ Our entire economy is in danger , ” he said .
On Capitol Hill , Democrats said that progress toward a deal had come after the White House had offered two major concessions : a plan to limit pay of executives whose firms seek government assistance , and a provision that would give taxpayers an equity stake in some of the firms so that the government can profit if the companies prosper in the future .
Details of those provisions , and many others , were still under discussion .
Human Rights
Watch , a US - based group claiming to be a non-governmental organization , but which is in fact funded by government - linked quasi- private foundations and a Congressional funded political propaganda organization , the National Endowment for Democracy , has issued a report " A Decade Under Chavez : Political Intolerance and Lost Opportunities for Advancing Human Rights in Venezuela " ( 9/21/2008 hrw.org ) .
The publication of the " Report " directed by José Miguel Vivanco and sub-director Daniel Wilkinson led to their expulsion from Venezuela for repeated political - partisan intervention in the internal affairs of the country .
A close reading of the " Report " reveals an astonishing number of blatant falsifications and outright fabrications , glaring deletions of essential facts , deliberate omissions of key contextual and comparative considerations and especially a cover - up of systematic long - term , large - scale security threats to Venezuelan democracy posed by Washington .
We will proceed by providing some key background facts about HRW and Vivanco in order to highlight their role and relations to US imperial power .
We will then comment on their methods , data collection and exposition .
We will analyze each of HRW charges and finally proceed to evaluate their truth and propaganda value .
Background on Vivanco and HRW
With the return of electoral politics ( democracy ) in Chile , Vivanco took off to Washington where he set up his own NGO , the Center for Justice and International Law , disguising his right - wing affinities and passing himself off as a ‘ human rights ' advocate .
In 1994 he was recruited by former US federal prosecutor , Kenneth Roth , to head up the ‘ Americas Division ' of Human Rights Watch .
HRW demonstrated a real capacity to provide a ‘ human rights ' gloss to President Clinton 's policy of ‘ humanitarian imperialism ' .
Roth promoted and supported Clinton 's two - month bombing , destruction and dismemberment of Yugoslavia .
HRW covered up the ethnic cleansing of Serbs in Kosovo by the notorious Albanian terrorists and gangsters of the Kosovo Liberation Army and the unprecedented brutal transfer of over 200,000 ethnic Serbs from the Krajina region of Croatia .
HRW backed Clinton 's sanctions against Iraq leading to the deaths of over 500,000 Iraqi children .
Nowhere did the word ‘ genocide ' ever appear in reference to the US Administrations massive destruction of Iraq causing hundreds of thousands of premature deaths .
HRW supported the US invasion and occupation of Afghanistan where Kenneth Roth advised the US generals on how to secure the colonial occupation by avoiding massive civilian deaths .
In words and deeds , HRW has played an insidious role as backer and adviser of US imperial intervention , providing the humanitarian ideological cover while issuing harmless and inconsequential reports criticizing ‘ ineffective ' excesses , which ‘ undermine ' imperial dominance .
HRW most notorious intervention was its claim that Israel 's murderous destruction of the Palestinian city of Jenin was ‘ not genocidal ' and thus provided the key argument for the US and Israeli blocking of a UN humanitarian mission and investigative report .
As in all of its ‘ research ' their report was deeply colored by selective interviews and observations which understated the brutality and killings of Palestinian civilians by the Israeli state - even while the fanatics who run the major pro-Israel organizations accused HRW of bias for even mentioning a single murdered Palestinian .
Method
HRW currently makes a big play of its widespread interviews of a broad cross section of Venezuelan political and civic society government and opposition groups , as well as its consultation of most available documents .
Yet the Report on Venezuela does not reflect anything of the sort .
There is no careful , straightforward presentation of the government 's elaboration and justification for its actions , no academic critiques of the anti-democratic actions of anti-Chavez mass media ; no discussion of the numerous journalists ' accounts which expose systematic US intervention .
The Report simply records and reproduces uncritically the claims , arguments and charges of the principle publicists of the opposition while dismissing out of hand any documented counter - claims .
In other words , Vivanco and company act as lawyers for the opposition rather than as serious and objective investigators pursuing a balanced and convincing evaluation of the status of democracy in Venezuela .
The political propaganda intent of Vivanco - HRW is evident in the timing of their ‘ investigations ' and the publication of their propaganda screeds .
Each and every previous HRW hostile ‘ report ' has been publicized just prior to major conflicts threatening Venezuelan democratic institutions .
In February 2002 , barely two months before the US backed military coup against Chavez , HRW joined the chorus of coup planners in condemning the Chavez regimes for undermining the ‘ separation of powers ' and calling for the intervention of the Organization of American States .
After the coup was defeated through the actions of millions of Venezuelan citizens and loyalists military officers , HRW moved quickly to cover its tracks by denouncing the coup - but subsequently defended the media moguls , trade union bureaucrats and business elites who promoted the coup from prosecution , claiming the coup promoters were merely exercising their ‘ human rights ' .
HRW provides a novel meaning to ‘ human rights ' when it includes the right to violently overthrow a democratic government by a military coup d'etat .
Following the military coup in 2002 and the bosses ' lockout of 2003 , HRW published a report condemning efforts to impose constitutional constraints on the mass media 's direct involvement in promoting violent actions by opposition groups or terrorists .
President Chavez ' " Law for Social Responsibility in Radio and Television " provided greater constitutional guarantee for freedom of speech than most Western European capitalist democracies and was far less restrictive than the measures approved and implemented in Bush 's US Patriot Act , which HRW has never challenged , let alone mounted any campaign against .
Just prior to the political referenda in 2004 and 2007 , HRW issued further propaganda broadsides which were almost identical in wording to the opposition ( in fact HRW ‘ Reports ' were widely published and circulated by all the leading opposition mass media ) .
HRW defended the ‘ right ' of the US National Endowment for Democracy to pour millions of dollars to fund opposition ‘ NGO's ' , such as SUMATE , accusing the Chavez government of undermining ‘ civil society ' organizations .
Needless to say , similar activity in the US by an NGO on behalf of any foreign government ( with the unique exception of Israel ) would require the NGO to register as a foreign agent under very strict US Federal laws ; failure to do so would lead to federal prosecution and a jail term of up to 5 years .
Apparently , HRW 's self - promoted ‘ credibility ' as an international ‘ humanitarian ' organization protects it from being invidiously compared to an agent of imperialist propaganda .
HRW : Five Dimensional Propaganda
The HRW Report on Venezuela focuses on five areas of politics and society to make its case that democracy in Venezuela is being undermined by the Presidency of Hugo Chavez : political discrimination , the courts , the media , organized labor and civil society .
1.Political Discrimination
The Report charges that the government has fired and blacklisted political opponents from some state agencies and from the national oil company .
Citizen access to social programs is denied based on their political opinions .
There is discrimination against media outlets , labor unions and civil society in response to legitimate criticism or political activity .
Between December 2002 and 2003 , following the failure of the military coup of the previous April , the major business organizations , senior executives of the state oil company and sectors of the trade union bureaucracy organized a political lockout shutting down the oil industry , paralyzing production through sabotage of its computer - run operations and distribution outlets in a publicly stated effort to deny government revenues ( 80 % of which come from oil exports ) and overthrow the democratically elected government .
After 3 months and over $ 20 billion dollars in lost revenues and hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to machinery , with the aid of the majority of production workers and technicians , the bosses ‘ lockout ' was defeated .
Those officials and employees engaged in the political lockout and destruction of equipment and computers were fired .
The government followed normal procedures backed by the majority of oil workers , who opposed the lockout , and dismissed the executives and their supporters in order to defend the national patrimony and social and investment programs from the self - declared enemies of an elected government .
No sane , competent , constitutional lawyer , international human rights lawyer , UN commissioner or the International Court official considered the action of the Venezuelan government in this matter to constitute ‘ political discrimination ' .
Even the US State Department , at that time , did not object to the firing of their allies engaged in economic sabotage .
HRW , on the other hand , is more Pope than the Pope .
Nothing captures the ludicrous extremism of the HRW than its charge that citizens are denied access to social programs .
Every international organization involved in assessing and developing large social programs , including UNESCO , the World Health Organization and the UN Food and Agricultural Organization , have praised the extent and quality of the coverage of the social programs instituted by the Chavez government covering 60 % of the population and almost 100 % of the poor .
Since approximately between 20 - 30 % of the poor still vote for the opposition , it is clear that needy citizens critical of the government have equal access to social programs , including food subsidies , free health care and education .
This social safety net is more inclusive than ever before in the history of Venezuela .
In fact some of the poor suburbs of Caracas , like Catia , which voted down the 2007 referendum , are major recipients of large - scale , long - term social assistance programs .
Only scoundrels or the ill informed could be convinced of the HRW charge of discrimination against mass media outlets , labor unions and civil society groups .
The opposition controls 95 % of the newspapers , a majority of the television and radio outlets and frequencies , with the widest national circulation .
The government has ‘ broken ' the ruling class monopoly on information by funding two major TV stations and a growing number of community based radio stations .
There are more trade union members and greater trade union participation in enterprises , internal debates and free elections than ever before under previous regimes .
Rival lists and intense competition for office between pro and anti-government lists are common in the trade unions confederation ( UNT ) .
The entire HRW ‘ Report ' is based on complaints from the authoritarian CTV ( Confederation of Venezuelan Workers / Confederacion de Trabajadores de Venezuela ) bureaucrats who have lost most of their supporters and are discredited because of their role in supporting the bloody April 2002 coup .
They are universally disdained ; militant workers have not forgotten their corruption and gangster tactics when they collaborated with previous rightwing regimes and employers .
2. The Courts
HWR claims that President Chavez has " effectively neutralized the judiciary as an independent branch of government " .
The claim that the judiciary was ‘ independent ' is a new argument for HRW - because a decade earlier when Chavez ' 1999 constitution was approved by referendum , HRW decried the ‘ venality , corruption and bias of the entire judicial system ' .
After years of releasing the leaders of the 2002 coup , postponing rulings and undermining positive legislation by elected legislative bodies and after revelations of high and lower court bribe taking , the Government finally implemented a series of democratically approved reforms , expanding and renewing the judicial system .
The fact that the new court appointees do not follow the past practices of the opposition - appointed judges has evoked hysterical cries by HRW that the new reformed courts ‘ threaten fundamental rights ' .
The most bizarre claim by HRM is that the Supreme Court did not ‘ counter ' a 2007 constitutional reform package .
In fact the Supreme Court approved the placing of constitutional reforms to a popular referendum in which the Chavez government was narrowly defeated .
The Venezuelan Supreme Court subsequently respected the popular verdict - unlike US Supreme Court , which overturned the popular vote in the 2000 and 2004 Presidential elections , a constitutional crime against the popular will , which Kenneth Roth , Vivanco and the rest of HRW have yet to condemn .
3 . The Media
Every outside media specialist has been highly critical of the advocacy of violent action ( leading up to the coup ) and gross falsifications and libelous ‘ reports ' ( including racist epithets against Hugo Chavez ) propagated by the ruling class - dominated mass media .
A single opposition television network just had one of its many outlets suspended for openly backing the opposition military seizure of power , an action that any Western capitalist democracy would have taken in the wake of a violent uprising .
HRW did not , has not and will not condemn the arrest of dozens of US and international journalists , some brutally beaten , covering the Republican and Democratic Presidential Conventions .
Nothing even remotely resembling the extraordinary powers of ‘ preventive detention ' of journalists by the US Homeland Security / local and state police forces exists in Venezuela .
The wanton destruction of journalists ' cameras and tape recorders by the police at the US Republican Party Convention would be un-imaginable in Venezuela today .
In contrast the only offense prosecuted in Venezuela against the media is the act of supporting and advocating violence aimed at overthrowing democratic institutions .
Like all countries , Venezuela has laws dealing with libel and slander ; these are far weaker than any comparable statutes in the countries upholding the tradition of the Magna Carta .
HRW blatantly falsifies reality by claiming state control of the print media :
All one needs to do is peruse any newsstand in Venezuela to see a multiplicity of lurid anti-government headlines , or tune into the radio or television stations and view news accounts that compete for the worst anti-Chavez propaganda found in the US Fox News or CNN .
4. Organized Labor
HRW claims that the Venezuelan government has violated ‘ basic principles of freedom of association ' because it requires state oversight and certification of union elections and that by denying the right to bargain collectively to non-certified unions , it undermines workers ' rights to freely join the union of their choosing and to strike .
Practically every government in the West has rules and regulations regarding oversight and certification of union elections , none more onerous than the US starting with the Taft - Hartley Act of the 1940's and the ‘ Right to Work ' Laws current in many states , which have reduced the percentage of unionized workers in the private sector to less than 3 % .
In contrast , during the Chavez Presidency , the number of unionized workers has more than doubled , in large part because new labor legislation and labor officials have reduced employer prerogatives to arbitrarily fire unionized workers .
The only union officials who have been ‘ decertified ' are those who were involved in the violent coup of April 2002 and the employers lockout intended to overthrow the government , suspend the constitution and undermine the very existence of free unions .
José Miguel Vivanco delicately overlooks the gangsterism , thuggery and fraudulent election procedures , which ran rampant under the previous rightwing Venezuelan labor confederation , CTV .
It was precisely to democratize voting procedures and to break the stranglehold of the old - guard trade union bosses that the government monitors oversaw union elections , many of which had multi-tendency candidates , unfettered debates and free voting for the first time .
I attended union meetings and interviewed high level CTV trade unions officials in 1970 , 1976 and 1978 and found high levels of open vote buying , government and employer interference and co-optation , collaboration with the CIA - funded American Institute of Free Labor Development and large - scale pilfering of union pension funds , none of which was denounced by HRW .
I attended the founding of the new Venezuelan union confederation , Union Nacional de Trabajadores ( UNT ) in 2003 and a subsequent national congress .
I have witness a totally different unionism , a shift from government - run ‘ corporate ' business unionism to independent social movement unionism with a decidedly class oriented approach .
The UNT is a multi-tendency confederation in which diverse currents compete , with varying degrees of support and opposition to the Chavez Government .
There are few impediments to strikes and there is a high degree of independent political action with no inhibition to workers resorting to strikes in order to demand the ouster of pro-employer labor officials .
For example , this year , steel workers in the Argentine - owned firm SIDOR , went on strike several times protesting private sector firings ( HRW , of course never discussed private sector violations of workers rights ) .
Because the Venezuelan Labor Minister tended to take the side of the employers , the steelworkers marched into a meeting where Chavez was speaking and demanded the dismissal of his Minister .
After conferring with the workers ' leaders , Chavez fired the Labor Minister , expropriated the steel plant and accepted workers demands for trade union co-management .
Never in Venezuelan labor history have workers exercised this degree of labor influence in nationalized plants .
There is no doubt that there are government officials who would like to ‘ integrate ' labor unions closer to the state ; the new unionists do spend too much time in internal debates and internecine struggles instead of organizing the informal and temporary worker sectors .
But one fact stands out : Unionized and non-unionized Venezuelan workers have experienced greater social welfare payments , rising living standards , greater job protection and greater free choice in union affiliation than any previous period in their history .
It is ironic that Vivanco , an uncritical apologist of the AFL - CIO ( the declining and least effective labor confederation in the industrialized West ) , should launch a full - scale attack on the fastest growing , independent and militant trade union movement in the Western hemisphere .
Needless to say , Vivanco avoids any comparative analysis , least of all between Venezuelan and US labor over the spread of union organizing , internal democracy and labor representation in industry , social benefits and influence over government policy .
Nor does HRW refer to the positive assessment by independent international labor organizations regarding union and labor advances under the Chavez Presidency .
5. Civil Society and HRW : The Mother of All Perversities
José Miguel Vivanco shamelessly claims that President Chavez has adopted " an aggressively adversarial approach to local rights advocates and civil society organization . "
President Chavez has actively promoted a multitude of independent , democratically elected community councils with over 3 million affiliated members , mostly from the poorest half of the population .
He has devolved decision - making power to the councils , bypassing the party - dominated municipal and state officials , unlike previous regimes and US AID programs , which channeled funds through loyal local bosses and clients .
Never has Venezuela witnessed more intense sustained organization , mobilization and activity of civil society movements .
This cuts across the political spectrum , from pro-Chavez to pro-oligarch neighborhood , civic , working class and upper class groups .
Nowhere in the world are US - funded groups , engaged in overt extra-parliamentary and even violent confrontations with elected officials , tolerated to the degree that they enjoy freedom of action as in Venezuela .
In the US , foreign - funded organizations ( with the exception of Israeli - funded groups ) are required to register and refrain from engaging in electoral campaigning , let alone in efforts to destabilize legitimately constitutional government agencies .
In contrast , Venezuela asked the minimum of foreign government - funded self - styled NGOs in requiring them to register their source of funding and comply with the rules of their constitution , that is , to stay out of virulent partisan political action .
Today , as yesterday , all the ‘ civil society ' organizations , including these funded by the US , which routinely attack the Chavez government , can operate freely , publish , assemble and demonstrate unimpeded .
Their fundamental complaint , echoed by HRW , is that the Chavez government and its supporters criticize them :
According to the new HRW definition of civil society freedom , the opposition has the right to attack the government - but not the other way around ; some countries can register foreign - funded organizations - but not Venezuela ; and some government can jail terrorists and coup - makers and identify and criticize their accomplices - but not Venezuela .
The grotesque double - standard , practiced by Human Rights Watch , reveals their political allegiances :
Blind to the vices of the US as it descends into a police state and equally blind to the virtues of a growing participatory democracy in Venezuela .
The ‘ Report ' contains egregious omissions .
It fails to mention that Venezuela , under President Chavez , has experienced twelve internationally supervised and approved elections , including several presidential , congressional and municipal elections , referenda and recall elections .
These have been the cleanest elections in Venezuelan history and certainly with more honest vote counting than one would find in the US presidential contests .
The ‘ Report ' fails to report on the serious security threats including the recording of phone conversations of active and retired high military officials planning to violently seize power and assassinate President Chavez .
Under the extraordinary degree of tolerance in Venezuela , not a single constitutional right has been suspended .
In the US , similar terrorist actions and plans would have led to a state of emergency and the probable pre-emptive mass incarceration of thousands of government critics and activists .
HRW ignores and downplays security threats to Venezuelan democracy - whether it involves armed incursions from Colombian paramilitary groups allied with the pro-US Venezuelan opposition , the assassination of the chief federal prosecutor Danilo Anderson who was investigating the role of the opposition in the bloody coup of April 2002 , the US - backed secessionist movement in the state of Zulia , the collusion of the mass media with violent student mobs in assaulting Chavez supporters on campus or the economic sabotage and panic caused by the private sector 's hoarding of essential food and other commodities in the lead - up to the 2007 referendum .
One of Vivanco 's most glaring omissions is the contrast between Venezuela 's open society approach to the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrant workers from Colombia and the US authoritarian practice of criminalizing its undocumented laborers .
While the US Homeland Security and Immigration police have implemented arbitrary mass arrests , assaults and deportation of working heads of immigrant families - leaving their wives and children vulnerable to destitution , Chavez has awarded over a million undocumented Colombian immigrant workers and family members with residency papers and the opportunity for citizenship .
HRW has yet to protest Washington 's brutal denial of human rights to its Latin American and Asian immigrant workers in recent months .
HRW did not issue a single protest when US - backed local oligarch politicians , local government officials and racist gangs in Bolivia went on a rampage and slaughtered three dozen unarmed Indian peasant workers .
Vivanco 's squalid selective slandering of Venezuela is only exceeded by his systematic silence when there are abuses involving US collaboraters !
Conclusion
The Human Rights Watch Report on Venezuela is a crude propaganda document that , even in its own terms , lacks the minimum veneer of ‘ balance ' , which the more sophisticated ‘ humanitarian ' imperialists have put out in the past .
The omissions are monumental : No mention of President Chavez ' programs which have reduced poverty over the past decade from more than 60 % to less than 30 % ; no recognition of the universal health system which has provided health care to 16 million Venezuelan citizens and residents who were previously denied even minimal access ; and no acknowledgment of the subsidized state - run grocery stores which supply the needs of 60 % of the population who can now purchase food at 40 % of the private retail price .
HRW 's systematic failure to mention the advances experienced by the majority of Venezuelan citizens , while peddling outright lies about civic repression , is characteristic of this mouthpiece of Empire .
Its gross distortion about labor rights makes this report a model for any high school or college class on political propaganda .
The widespread coverage and uncritical promotion and citation of the ‘ Report ' ( and the expulsion of its US - based authors for gross intervention on behalf of the opposition ) by all the major newspapers from the New York Times , to Le Monde in France , the London Times , La Stampa in Italy and El Pais in Spain gives substance to the charge that the Report was meant to bolster the US effort to isolate Venezuela rather than pursue legitimate humanitarian goals in Venezuela .
The major purpose of the HRW ‘ Report ' was to intervene in the forthcoming November municipal and state elections on the side of the far - right opposition .
The ‘ Report ' echoes verbatim the unfounded charges and hysterical claims of the candidates supported by the far right and the Bush Administration .
HRW always manages to pick the right time to issue their propaganda bromides .
Their reports mysteriously coincide with US intervention in electoral processes and destabilization campaigns .
In Venezuela today the Report has become one of the most widely promoted propaganda documents of the leading rightist anti-Chavez candidates .
For the partisans of democracy , human rights and self - determination , every effort should be made to expose the insidious role of HRW and its propagandist , Vivanco , for what they are - publicists and promoters of US - backed clients who have given ‘ human rights ' a dirty name .

The Schnidejoch glacier records human activity in the region Melting alpine glaciers are revealing fascinating clues to Neolithic life in the high mountains .
And , as a conference of archaeologists and climatologists meeting in the Swiss capital Berne has been discussing , the finds are also providing key indicators to climate change .
Everyone knows the story of Oetzi the Ice Man , found in a glacier on the Austrian - Italian border in 1991 .
Oetzi was discovered at an altitude of over 3,000 m .
He lived in about 3,300 BC , leading to speculation that the Alps may have had more human habitation than previously suspected .
Now , more dramatic findings from the 2,756 m Schnidejoch glacier in Switzerland have confirmed the theory .
It all started at the end of the long hot summer of 2003 , when a Swiss couple , hiking across a melting Schnidejoch , came across a piece of wood that aroused their curiosity .
They took it down with them , and gave it to canton Berne 's archaeological department , where careful examination and carbon dating revealed the piece of wood to be an arrow quiver made of birch bark , dating from about 3000 BC .
Unique findings " Finds in the Alps are very rare anyway , " explains Albert Hafner , chief archaeologist with the canton of Berne .
" But this is unique ; we do n't know of a quiver like this anywhere else in the world . "
At first , the news of the find was kept quiet ; historians feared treasure hunters on the Schnidejoch as the ice melted .
But teams of archaeologists went up , and more and more artefacts were discovered .
The ice has protected the leather for thousands of years " We now have the complete bow equipment , quiver and arrows , " says Mr Hafner " And we have , surprisingly , a lot of organic material like leather , parts of shoes and a trouser leg , that we would n't normally find . "
And the finds are not confined to 3000 BC .
Some of the leather found , and a fragment of a wooden bowl , date from 4500 BC , older even than Oetzi , making them the oldest objects ever found in the Alps .
And from later periods , a Bronze Age pin has been discovered , as well as Roman coins and a fibula , and items dating from the early Middle Ages .
Key to climate change
What fascinates scientists about the age of the finds is that they correspond to times when climate specialists have already calculated the Earth was going through an especially warm period , caused by fluctuations in the orbital pattern of the Earth in relation to the Sun .
At these times , historians now speculate , the high mountain regions became accessible to humans .
Archaeologists needed time to investigate the area For Martin Grosjean , a climatologist at Berne University , the Schnidejoch has become a mine of information on changes in the Earth 's climate .
" The site is exactly at the point where the glacier responds most sensitively to short - term climate change and temperature variations , " he explains .
" So if we get more carbon datings from this site , we can get the most precise picture of short - term glacier fluctuations for the past six or 7,000 years . "
The Roman coins found on the Schnidejoch are being seen as proof that the Romans used this route to cross the Alps from Italy to their territories in northern Europe .
Interestingly , one of the Earth 's chillier periods coincides with the decline of the Roman empire .
Proof that the Romans came this way As the Earth cooled and the glaciers grew again , the Schnidejoch and other passes like it would have been blocked by ice .
So did fluctuations in the Earth 's climate contribute to the fall of the Roman empire ?
" Well that may be stretching things a bit , " laughs Martin Grosjean .
" But what we do know is that the climate has fluctuated throughout history ; in the past the driving force for the changes was the Earth 's orbital pattern , now the driving force is green house gas emissions . "
Global patterns For Martin Grosjean , the leather items found on the Schnidejoch , dated at over 5,000 years old , are proof , if any more were needed , that the Earth is now warming up .
" The leather is the jewel among the finds , " he says .
" If leather is exposed to the weather , to sun , wind and rain , it disintegrates almost immediately .
Bit by bit , the Neolithic way of life is being revealed " The fact that we still find these 5,000 - year - old pieces of leather tells us they were protected by the ice all this time , and that the glaciers have never been smaller than in the year 2003 and the years following . "
Scientists and archaeologists from all over the world attended the conference in Berne to hear about the Schnidejoch findings , and present research of their own .
Patterns have begun to emerge : researchers in Canada 's Yukon region have found evidence of Neolithic farming and domesticated animals at high altitudes .
Again , they correspond with the calculations climatologists have made about the Earth 's warmer periods .
Unexpected history In Norway , Atle Nesje has been analysing glaciers for the past 25 years .
His calculations for the Norwegian icefields show a similar shrinkage and growth pattern to the alpine glaciers .
" Now these archaeological findings seem to fit quite nicely with our glacier reconstructions , " he says .
" This is very important in the debate about climate change in the past , the present , and also in the future . "
A reconstruction of the shoes these mountain people used to wear For historians however , the Schnidejoch is unexpected evidence that early man was far more at home in the high Alps than had been previously thought .
" In 1991 , we were completely surprised by Oetzi , " remembers Albert Hafner .
" Up to then , we had always thought the Alps were not used , that people never went there .
" Now with Schnidejoch we know they were rather keen on mountaineering .
It was a big challenge for them ; look at the shoes , no Goretex for them .
But we know they went up regularly . "

No Small Steps for Man , One Giant Leap for Prius
September 22nd , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
On September 7 a robotic Prius took a cruise around San Francisco .
The “ Pribot ” maneuvered through city and highway traffic along a 40 mile course .
The only mash - up ?
A scrape at the Bay Bridge exit .
I welcome our new vehicular overlords .
In all seriousness , if this technology were to become affordable , would you buy in ?
How much trust are you willing to invest in a robot , no matter how stylish ?
Lesser versions of this kind of technology already exist in luxury Nissan , Volvo and Lexus models .
They alert a driver if the vehicle begins to drift out of its lane or even automatically make corrections .
So why not take the leap and let your car tackle the morning commute ?
Who really wants to go through rush hour ?
Turns out , not the inventor .
Anthony Levandowski , a 28 year old computer engineer , built the Pribot in his spare time .
“ I commute a lot , ” Levandowski said .
“ It ’s really stressful … If I could be more productive and be safer , while doing that , that ’s ( better ) . ”
Though Levandowski works for Google , he started his own company to explore computer programming for robots and other machines .
So let ’s think about the bigger picture .
Can most drivers get better mileage than a computer ?
If not , could it pay itself off in fuel savings ?
If the technology becomes available in say , ten years , would cities replace their bus drivers with robots ?
Taxis ?
There ’s also a not - so - small issue of safety .
Even if the system is safer than a road - raging speed demon , changes in road conditions will still occur with accidents and / or construction .
How will every other Pribot know to avoid an obstacle ahead ?
Suddenly small debris in the road , which any person could easily see and avoid , becomes a big issue .
But if given a choice without exorborent cost , I would definitely give a future version of the Pribot a try , so long as I ’m allowed to take over if I so choose .
Would you ?
Let us know , leave a comment below .

ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( CNN ) --
The legislative investigation into Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's firing of her public safety commissioner needs to go ahead despite the increasingly heated opposition of the McCain - Palin campaign , a leading Republican said Tuesday .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is being investigated for the possibly improper firing of a state official .
Since becoming the Republican vice presidential candidate in August , Palin has halted her previously promised cooperation with the Legislature 's investigation of the July dismissal of Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan .
Campaign aides have attacked the state senator managing the investigation , Hollis French , as a Democratic partisan running a " tainted " inquiry , and Palin 's husband , Todd , and several top aides have refused to comply with subpoenas from French 's committee .
But Rep. Jay Ramras , the Republican chairman of the Alaska House Judiciary Committee , said Tuesday that he still has confidence in the Legislature 's investigation and said it should go forward .
" I think it 's going to be benign in the conclusions that it reaches , anyway , " he said .
" But I think it 's important to reach a conclusion . "
Ramras called himself " a conservative , pro-life Republican " who is supporting GOP presidential nominee John McCain 's ticket .
But , he added , " We all took an oath of office , and this is an important report to come out . "
The investigation was commissioned by a bipartisan committee of the Legislature in July , after Monegan 's dismissal .
French , the chairman of the Alaska Senate Judiciary Committee , has been under fire since a September 2 interview with ABC News in which he said the inquiry could lead to an " October surprise " for the GOP ticket .
For more than a week , Republican campaign officials have held routine " truth squad " news conferences to criticize French and accuse Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama 's campaign of attempting to manipulate the investigation .
But Ramras , whose committee concurred with the September 12 decision to issue subpoenas to Todd Palin and 12 others , discounted the criticism .
" The hyperbole from the truth squad is a little farfetched , " he said .
" To those of us who have monitored this thing from the front - row seats , it 's a misnomer . "
Palin insists that the Personnel Board , whose members are appointed by the governor 's office , is the only legitimate forum for inquiry .
The governor 's lawyer met with the special counsel hired by the three - member board Monday to discuss documents and interviews , and Palin will cooperate with that inquiry , campaign spokeswoman Meg Stapleton said Monday .
Monegan says he was sacked after he refused to fire the governor 's former brother - in - law , a state trooper who was involved in an acrimonious divorce from Palin 's sister .
Palin has denied any wrongdoing , telling Fox News last week that Monegan was " insubordinate " in disputes over budget issues .
The Legislature 's inquiry is scheduled to be completed October 10 , and Ramras said there was " zero chance " it would be shut down .
Though two lawsuits have been filed to halt the investigation , he said the investigator hired by lawmakers has enough documents and interviews to write a " materially complete " report .
" There 's no question the report is going to be produced , " he said .
" There is a question of which folks will participate in it and which ones wo n't . "

The Federal Treasury is on the verge of bailing out Wall Street with an infusion of $ 700 billion of taxpayer dollars .
Bad decisions by many actors ( banks and lenders , consumers , insurers and others ) have contributed to the crisis , we are told , and now it is an emergency .
What a difference a policy area makes .
In our nation ’s social welfare programs , such as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) program , bad decisions are grounds for sanctions and a denial of assistance – not a helping hand or a cash infusion ( Just imagine ! ) .
Certainly , our leaders have not treated poverty as an emergency or a reason for government action .
Other differences abound ….
Corporate welfare : Corporate executives , mostly men , being bailed out .
Social welfare : Mostly low - income women with children , being given minimal assistance , and certainly not enough to help move them out of poverty .
Corporate welfare : Few restrictions on the money .
Social welfare : TANF beneficiaries face numerous restrictions , including having to sign a “ personal responsibility ” statement in some states ( Something , personally , I ’d like to see these corporate executive do ) .
Corporate welfare :
It is a major “ concession ” not to cap compensation to the executives in the affected firms .
Social welfare : Under TANF , most states impose income and asset limits on eligibility .
For assets , these limits are generally between $ 2,000 and $ 3,000 .
In some states , if your car is worth much more than this , you are not eligible .
( States similarly limit eligibility for Food Stamps and Medicaid . )
So , how many of our corporate executives would be disqualified from the bailout if this were taken into account ?
Corporate welfare :
Few details about the accountability required under this bailout are available .
Given the lobbying frenzy around the agreement , do n’t expect much .
Social welfare : Significant oversight , including additional and burdensome requirements around supervision and documentation of program participation enacted in 2005 and codified in regulations earlier this year .
Corporate welfare : $ 700 billion .
Social welfare : $ 16 billion per year , which has not changed since 1996 .
Just think what a $ 700 billion investment in poverty reduction could do .
Bailouts to help low - income single mothers get job training to move them into careers with good pay and benefits , and a lifetime of economic independence .
Bailouts to support access to quality child care so that single mothers could afford to leave their children in a safe environment while they go to work .
Bailouts to support transportation vouchers that would get low - income parents to job training sites or worksites so that they can gain access to the careers and salaries that would eventually make them economically secure .
If only …

Earlier this year , Ohio election officials sent notices marked “ Do not forward ” to the state ’s registered voters , alerting them to the March primary .
To the surprise of voting rights activists , 573,444 notices were returned as undeliverable in five counties alone , including the urban areas of Cleveland , Columbus and Cincinnati .
The heavy return rate alarmed liberal activists .
They feared that numerous voters -- many of them young and minorities -- could lose their right to vote in November , perhaps because they had moved and failed to update their records .
Since about 1 in 7 Americans changes residence every year , the large volume of returned mail also hints at a potential problem in voter rolls nationwide .

In Ohio , the large amount of returned mail set off a three - way tussle -- involving Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner , a Democrat ; the leaders of the state Republican Party ; and two voting rights groups -- over how to handle possible discrepancies in the voting records .
Disputes over voter records could loom large in Ohio and other battleground states , where the 2008 presidential race is likely to be decided .
In nearly every state , citizens who want to vote Nov. 4 must register in advance , and the data on file must be up to date .
This year , it is easy to check that information .
In the past , counties maintained their own voter rolls .
But when Congress adopted the Help America Vote Act after the Florida election debacle in 2000 , it told states to create a computerized database of all their voters by 2006 .
The databases have triggered -- or perhaps magnified -- disputes over the voter rolls .

What , for instance , should be done if a computer check turns up a voter who appears to be registered at two addresses ?
What about a newly registered voter whose address does not match other state records , including the driver ’s license ?
Florida ’s election officials announced last week that they would enforce the state ’s “ no - match , no - vote ” law by not counting the ballots of new voters unless they cleared up any discrepancy between the registration form and other state records .
Two weeks ago , Ohio sent out another notice to registered voters , and voting rights advocates fear that the names on the returned mail will give GOP officials a long , ready - made list of voters to challenge .
In Michigan , Republican leaders denied a blogger ’s report that they planned to use foreclosure notices to challenge voters -- but they did say that they planned to challenge voters whose addresses did not match records .

“ This will be a very big deal in the few states where the margin is very close , ” said Doug Chapin , director of Electionline.org , a project of the Pew Center on the States that tracks states ’ election rules .
“ I do n’t see any evidence of a deliberate partisan purge of the voter rolls in any state .
But there is a concern that a large number of voters could be challenged , and the impact will be magnified if the outcome depends on a few thousand votes . ”
In Ohio , both parties are working hard to register voters .
“ We are expecting an 80 % turnout , ” Brunner said .
A former state judge , Brunner ran for secretary of state after the 2004 controversy over her Republican predecessor , Kenneth Blackwell , who served as the state ’s election chief at the same time he co-chaired President Bush ’s reelection campaign in Ohio .
He also took a strong stand against counting the votes of people who cast ballots in the wrong precinct .
Upon her election in 2006 , on the same day that Blackwell was soundly defeated in his run for governor , Brunner pledged to ensure that “ Ohio elections are free , fair , open and honest . ”
This year , she said , “ every eligible voter who wants to vote should be able to do so freely . ”

But she is also charged with administering the state ’s strict voter registration rules .
One requires that a notice be sent to all voters two months before an election , a notice that is not to be forwarded .
In August , lawyers for the Advancement Project , a legal and public policy group committed to racial justice , and Project Vote , which aids in the registration of low - income and minority voters , said these notices “ threaten to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Ohio voters in the November 2008 election . ”
The records of undeliverable notices are public , and “ we anticipate that significant numbers of minority voters will be included on the county - generated caging lists , ” they said in a letter to Brunner .
Vote “ caging ” refers to the practice of sending mailings to certain groups of voters and setting aside the mail that is returned .
In some states , the names on those envelopes have been compiled by party officials who use them to challenge the ballots of those voters .
In an interview , Brunner said she was troubled that the state was inadvertently creating such a list .
“ I found it rather disturbing that this was being paid for by the government , ” she said .
“ These returns are a public record , and they can be used to file a challenge to a voter 20 days before the election . ”

On Sept. 5 , she sent a directive to election officials : Voters may not be removed from the rolls simply because a notice was returned as undeliverable .
The voter must first be notified and given a hearing .
Teresa James , a lawyer for Project Vote , applauded Brunner ’s move .
“ Partisan challengers who have obtained a list of returned letters should not be allowed to intimidate low - income and minority Ohioans or strip eligible voters of their rights , ” she said .
But Sheila Thomas , a lawyer with the Advancement Project , said the real fight was ahead .
“ The caging aspect has n’t been dealt with yet , ” she said .
If 600,000 notices were returned again , “ any one of these can be a basis for a challenge . ”
GOP leaders have not disclosed their plans .
“ We do n’t get into the business of sharing strategy or tactics , but I can tell you we are not taking any option off the table , ” said Kevin DeWine , deputy chairman of the Ohio Republican Party .

He said a returned notice should result in a mark placed next to the voter ’s name on the local voter roll , and on election day such voters can show proper identification to confirm their address or cast a provisional ballot .
“ We want to ensure the integrity of the vote .
We say those who properly registered should have their votes counted .
For those not properly registered , do n’t count them , ” he said .
The rules for counting those provisional ballots are not entirely clear , said Daniel P. Tokaji , an election law expert at Ohio State University ’s Moritz College of Law .
“ If we have a close election in any state , and especially here in Ohio , ” he said , “ the parties will be fighting hard over the counting of those provisional ballots . ”

Not only did John McCain ditch Late Show host David Letterman for Katie Couric and mislead him about it , it turns out the Republican presidential nominee spent the entire night in New York and did n't fly to DC until the next morning .
So , in a reprise of last night , Letterman will spend a good chunk of his show this evening bashing the Arizona senator .
" The economy just barely held on long enough for him to get back " to DC , Letterman joked .
As theatrical as the Letterman - McCain feud has become , Letterman could probably score more points talking about the $ 700 billion banking bailout than about the mechanics of late - night TV booking .
Here 's to hoping that , when the full show airs , he does .
( Click the video icon to watch some excerpts . )
Bill Keller , executive editor of the Times , sees the timetable for the Ayers uproar in a very different way , telling Politico that the paper was motivated to report out the Ayers link because the McCain campaign has been pushing it — not the other way around .
NYT : McCain camp pushed Ayers report
As the McCain campaign has launched a full - scale assault on Barack Obama ’s relationship to ‘ 60s radical William Ayers , vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin has explained the timing this way : The New York Times made us do it .
The Times published a front - page story about Ayers and Obama on Saturday , and Palin said Tuesday she was simply “ responding to the news of the day ” by repeatedly mentioning Ayers on the stump .

Bill Keller , executive editor of the Times , sees the timetable for the Ayers uproar in a very different way , however .
He told Politico that the paper was motivated to report out the Ayers link because the McCain campaign has been pushing it — not the other way around .
“ We 've reported the Ayers relationship before , and we had it on our to - do list for a while to take a more comprehensive look , ” Keller said in an e-mail .
“ When the McCain campaign began to make it a major focal point of ads and stump speeches , we decided the time was right . ”
“ It did n't take any prodding , ” Keller continued .
“ When the conversation on something controversial reaches a certain level , curious readers look to the Times to help them sort the facts from the fictions and figure out what to make of it .
That 's what we did . ”
While Palin and John McCain — as well as talk radio and the conservative blogosphere — continue to cite the Times report as damaging , its tone was quite the opposite .
The Times ’ 2,100 - word piece concluded that while Obama “ has played down his contacts ” with Ayers — a former leader of the Weather Underground who ’s now an education professor at the University of Illinois — “ the two men do not appear to have been close . ”
Keller ’s correct that the Times previously reported on Ayers and Obama .
In April , the paper followed up on the Democratic debate in Philadelphia , where the issues surrounding the Obama - Ayers link came up .
But there had been no comprehensive report on the matter during this campaign cycle , including a serious look into Obama ’s six - year role on the board of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge , an education foundation .
Ayers had been co-chairman of the Chicago School Reform Collaborative , a policy - setting body within the foundation .
Although records indicate that Ayers only attended six CAC board meetings in six years , Obama critics remain focused on what , if any , significant contact they had .
Despite blog reports that Ayers had a role in appointing Obama to the board , the Times did not find that to be true .
Although the McCain campaign ’s pushed the story , the Times was motivated , at least partly , by one of Obama ’s harshest critics .
On Sept. 23 , Stanley Kurtz — who ’s been covering Obama ’s activities in Chicago for National Review — published an op -ed in The Wall Street Journal in which he mentioned digging through the CAC archives , currently stored at the University of Illinois .
The Times had never sent a reporter to Chicago to investigate the archives .
And there was a feeling internally that the paper should have looked into the matter earlier in the campaign , according to a source with knowledge of the Times ' reporting process .
Shortly after the Kurtz piece ran , Times reporter Scott Shane was assigned to do a more comprehensive take on where the two men crossed paths .
Shane also spoke with blogger Steve Diamond , who claims the Obama - Ayers relationship runs deeper than has been previously reported .
However , the Times ' reporting proved differently .
The Times story managed to earn brickbats from both sides of the political aisle — often a standard for fair , objective journalism .
Critics on the right blasted the paper for not bolstering their claims of a tighter relationship — including Kurtz who dubbed it a “ whitewash . ”
But on Daily Kos and Huffington Post , among other left - leaning sites , some questioned about why the Times would promote the story on Page 1 , above the fold , if there was n’t any shocking revelation .
Keller said that was an “ easy decision , ” decided upon with managing editor Jill Abramson .
“ We 've run a lot of our pieces on the candidates ' backgrounds — including many installments of the Long Run series — in just that spot , ” Keller said .
“ The standard is not whether such a piece unearths some shocking new revelation .
The value is in offering curious readers a fair , authoritative account of an episode that has generated a great deal of partisan heat and misinformation . ”

On Sunday , September 7 , 2008 , Prime Minister Stephen Harper pulled the plug on his government , Canada 's 39th Parliament .
The Federal National Elections will be held on October 14 , 2008 , which is the day after the Thanksgiving holiday here in Canada .
Personally , I am not too happy going to the polls again so soon .
This will be the third election in four years , and who is paying for all this - well the Canadian taxpayers naturally .
So , a quick review about the happenings of the last couple of days .
On Monday , Elizabeth May , leader of the Green Party of Canada was excluded by a TV Network broadcasting consortium , CBC , Radio - Canada , CTV , Global and TVA , and the other four candidates , all men - Stephen Harper , Jack Layton , Gilles Duceppe and Stephane Dion .
Dion was the only party leader that actually wanted May present at the debates , but he also wanted to ensure that Harper was present for the debates .
Harper and Layton seems to be the main culprits .
Harper was exhibiting his sexism and bigotry by stating that the decision was already made by the consortium and there was nothing he could do about it .
Layton and Duceppe were also taking the position that May should not be present at the debates .
Layton wants to be seen as the " green leader " since he has much to lose with May representing a similar agenda .
Now he has to compete with her .
May decided to take the matter to court .
This debacle caught the Canadian public attention and ignited the blogoshere with everyone throwing in their two cents ..... Canadians were outraged ..... since Canadians are known for and pride themselves on their fairness and equality .
Hopefully , this will encourage everyone , especially women , to pay close attention to the upcoming elections and the issues that concerns them , their children and their families .
Voters should ensure that their political candidates earn their votes .
As of this morning , Dion came out defending May 's right to participate in the debates .
He had a meeting this morning in Mississauga with some women candidates of his party .
He comes out strongly by courting the womens ' vote right away .
I do n't recall the Liberals doing this so early during the last election .
Duceppe , Layton and Harper , respectively , have now fallen into line , and May will be participating at the upcoming debates .
So now we will have all five political leaders at the debates in October .
The second brouhaha was about a Conservative party website that showed a puffin continually " pooping " on Dion 's right shoulder ..... yes , that is correct ..... Let us not debate the issues , let us throw mud at each other ... So the score is -: Harper is being juvenile and sexist , the underdog Dione has defended another underdog ( May ) , so he gets $ 200 and passes Go , Layton is not the strong leader that he says he is ( Jack , you should have known better ) and Duceppe , well he just keeps on ticking ... only in Quebec .
And the winner is Elizabeth May , leader of the Green Party .
I think many Canadians were very unaware of May and the Green Party .
By trying to exclude her from the debates , a move that was perceived by Canadians as being undemocratic , May has become a household name and the Green Party has emerged finally , in full bloom , on the Canadian national political landscape .
There are some things money just can't buy .
This was priceless for the Greens .
Yucky but useful : Maggots make compost
I 've been composting my kitchen waste for 20 years , and there 's not much in the way of rotting food that can gross me out anymore .
But last summer , the maggots appeared .
For years we'd had an open - air compost pile that we 'd manage by layering food scraps with leaves and soil , then turning it over periodically .
We saw bugs occasionally , but the turning kept them from getting too comfortable .
Then the city of Santa Cruz sold us a set of plastic , rodent - proof compost bins .
The shape of the bins prevented turning of the compost , which then took ages to decompose and left layers of deoxygenated slime that stank to high heaven when you shoveled it out .
One afternoon , during a midsummer heat wave , I went to toss a bucket of food scraps into the bin .
The surface of the pile was gently undulating .
A carrot top appeared to be waving at me , a scrap of bread bobbed up and down .
I bent in for a closer look .
Big mistake .
The bin was boiling with brown and beige maggots , big leathery fellows 3 / 4 inch long and nearly 1/4 inch wide .
My scalp tingled , and I frantically checked my bare legs for creepy crawlies .
I hurled the scraps into the bin and fled .
I did n't know what to do about this infestation , so , once my alarm subsided , I decided to do nothing .
I was curious to see what would happen .
If the result was unpleasant , I figured , those rodent - proof bins would be history .
Hungry , hungry maggots
Over a period of weeks I noticed a few things about my new tenants :
They ate like crazy .
If you tossed it in , it vanished within hours .
And the compost no longer stank ; it now had the mild odor of damp straw .
The maggots were very responsive ; they pounced on new food and retreated from direct sunlight .
You could hear them .
The mass of moving larvae made a wet rustling sound , exactly like falling rain .
Yet nothing appeared to be hatching from the larvae , which had increased in number to oh , say , a billion .
Oddly , the compost flies had vanished .
I became rather fond of my maggots .
I took frequent breaks from the computer to watch them at work , and fretted about them when we went on vacation .
I found myself saying things like , " Come and get it ! " when I brought out a new load of scraps .
Vegetable peels , plate scrapings , the newspapers that lined the compost bucket - about 5 gallons of waste per week - all were gobbled up so fast that the compost pile began to recede .
I tossed in squishy plums and wormy apples from our trees , 5 or 10 gallons at a time .
They 'd be gone by morning .
They 'll eat anything
There are things you 're not supposed to put in your compost pile , such as cheese , meat and oily cooked food .
But I wondered what the maggots would do , so one day I cleaned out the refrigerator .
My bucket was brimming with forbidden items : old sour cream , chicken parts , a wad of newspapers soaked through with bacon grease .
I felt like a bad , bad gardener .
I tossed it in anyway .
An hour later I peeked in and there was a party going on .
The maggots were thrashing about in a feeding frenzy .
Most arresting was the fate of a fist - size ball of formerly fresh mozzarella .
The maggots had tunneled into the cheese , which held its shape but quivered violently .
Within a half hour it was gone .
I took my husband out to show him the action .
He gazed into the mosh pit , raised an eyebrow and said , " Do n't fall in ! "
I decided it was time to find out if our bugs had any dodgy habits that the health department might be interested in .
Useful , native flies
A little Internet surfing revealed : Our maggots were the larvae of black soldier flies ( Hermetia illucens ) , often referred to as BSF , a native fly whose amazing environmental usefulness is just now being explored .
While BSF have probably always lurked around my compost pile , they did n't thrive in large numbers until the rodent - proof bins prevented me from turning the pile .
Mice , rats , raccoons and birds all consider BSF larvae quite delicious , and had probably picked off the ones that managed to hatch .
When kept warm and protected , BSF larvae are probably nature 's best composters .
They can consume the manure from factory farms , food scraps from homes and restaurants - almost any type of wet and icky organic waste .
The worst thing about falling into a vat of maggots would be the resulting nightmares : BSF can somehow tell the difference between living and nonliving tissue and eat only the dead stuff .
Because they eat so quickly , microbes can't begin to break down the waste and produce smelly methane gas , one reason why my compost stopped stinking .
In addition , the larvae secrete chemicals that kill bacteria , converting even pig poop into a safe , non-smelly soil amendment , according to one study .
The lack of adult flies was because of the BSF 's solitary nature .
Adult flies live less than a week and do n't eat .
The mature larvae crawl away from the compost pile to pupate , and the flies quickly mate , lay eggs and expire .
Our other compost - loving flies had vanished because the BSF eat so fast that other flies can't get established and they are prevented from breeding .
And unlike other flies , BSF are not attracted to human homes or food and do not spread disease .
Sluggish in the cold
The disadvantage of BSF larvae is that they become sluggish as the temperature drops below 68 degrees .
A hard freeze will kill them , but in moderate climates they survive by burrowing deep into organic matter and going dormant until the weather warms .
Commercial bug farmers ( yes , there 's a market ) have figured out how to keep their grubs warm and happy all winter long , but my free - range population dwindled away by Thanksgiving .
I could have waited for them to reappear as spring arrived , but lacked the patience .
Thank heavens for mail order !
I contacted the Phoenix Worm Store in Tifton , Ga. , and within two days received 600 small BSF larvae , hungry and ready to go .
The Phoenix Worm Store sells mostly to reptile owners because BSF larvae are packed with calcium , and their wriggling stimulates the reptilian appetite .
Phoenix Worm founder Craig Sheppard , a retired entomologist and expert on BSF , raises his larvae on a sterile grain - based diet .
But his pampered maggots instantly burrowed into my icky compost , ate like champs and began to pupate within three weeks .
I 'm now waiting for the next generation to turn my pile back into a teeming maggot buffet .
My refrigerator is due for another cleaning .

Dear Cecil : Dear Cecil :
How come the U.S. is practically the only country in the world where household electricity is 110 volts instead of 220 volts ?
Mark , Berkeley , California
Cecil replies :
The penalty of leadership , champ .
While inventors in many countries contributed to electric power technology , the U.S. was way out front in putting that technology to practical use .
In the early days , lower voltages were the most practical for electric lights — higher voltages burned out the bulbs .
So the hundreds of power plants built in the U.S. prior to 1900 adopted 110 volts ( or 115 or 120 volts ) as their de facto standard .
Trouble was , power transmission at higher voltages was more efficient — you did n’t have to use so much copper in the wires .
By the time most European countries got around to making big time investments in electricity , the engineers had figured out how to make 220 - volt bulbs that would n’t burn out so fast .
So , starting in Germany around the turn of the century , they adopted the 220 - volt ( or 230 - or 240 - volt ) standard .
But the U.S. stayed with 110 volts ( today it ’s officially 120 volts ) because we had such a big installed base of 110 - volt equipment .
But do n’t worry that we ’re stuck with a technological dinosaur .
Fact is , homes with standard 3 - wire electrical service in most parts of the country get 240 volts .
The three wires that come in from the street are 120 volts positive , zero volts ( neutral ) , and 120 volts negative .
( I know , this is alternating current , not DC , so we ca n’t really say “ 120 volts positive , ” but do n’t bother me with details . )
Take the neutral and either of the other wires ( the usual practice ) and you ’ve got 120 volts .
But tap into your plus - 120 and minus - 120 and you ’ll get a 240 - volt jolt , handy for energy - hungry appliances like air conditioners or electric stoves and clothes dryers .
The telltale sign in the fusebox is a special double - width circuit breaker that straddles the plus - 120 and minus - 120 bus bars .
Not the most vital fact in the world , but at least next time you ’re poking around in there when the lights blow you ’ll have some idea what you ’re looking at .
Static
Dear Cecil :
Are you going to explain to your readers that , with the three - phase wiring prevalent in the world , the two lines are only 120 degrees apart in phase , and not of opposite polarity as you stated ?
And that therefore tapping across them provides only 208 volts , not 240 ?
Or do you figure nobody will miss the other 32 volts AC ?
And that explaining three - phase polarity is n’t worth the space , justifying your fudge ?
— Robert Goodman , Bronx , New York
Sarcasm plays better when you have at least a general idea what you ’re talking about , Robert .
Three - phase power is used primarily in commercial applications , not homes .
When I was an electrician ’s apprentice , I remember we installed it in a garment factory for use with portable electric cloth cutters .
The electrical service in most U.S. homes is 240 volts single phase with a center tap , giving you the 120 volts needed for most household uses .
To be fair , New York , in this as so many things , is an exception .
There 208 volts is the standard high - end voltage .

What changes might a new US administration make to its Cuba policy ?
Sen. John McCain ( R ) of Arizona supports keeping the tight travel restrictions and limits on remittances that President Bush added to the US trade embargo with Cuba .
He said in May that to soften the restrictions " would send the worst possible signal to Cuba 's dictators . "
His stance resonates with the traditionally conservative positions of the Cuban - American community in and around Miami – a key voting bloc in an important swing state that usually votes Republican .
But Cuban - American attorney and embargo law expert Pedro Freyre says that a younger generation of Cuban - Americans is far less dogmatic than their elders .
This generation does n't remember fleeing their homeland during Castro 's revolution .
Mr. Freyre points out that Democratic candidate Sen. Barack Obama ( D ) of Illinois got a standing ovation at the Cuban - American National Foundation when he proposed lifting sanctions on Cuban family remittances and visits to the island .
" Obama is making significant inroads , " he says .
" The dynamics are changing very rapidly . "

Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin took a live road test before the entire nation Wednesday night , and she did n't crash .
Whether she broke Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama 's record of 38.4 million viewers for his convention speech in Denver last week remains to be seen .
The bigger question could be whether she will outshine the man who put her on the GOP ticket .
Sen .
John McCain , who accepts the Republican nomination tonight , has been engulfed by the Palin gale since he plucked the obscure 44 - year - old governor from the farthest reaches of the continent to be his running mate .
In the five days since , Palin has managed , without doing anything , to steal the focus from both parties ' nominees in what was already a historic election .
Even Republicans were calling Palin " the hottest ticket on the convention floor " among delegates more interested in her than McCain .
Now an overnight celebrity herself , Palin delivered a homespun justification for her candidacy that sought to hit the touchstones of ordinary voters and play up the likeability quotient that has made her the most popular governor in the United States .
Looking at the signs in the audience declaring , " Hockey Moms 4 Palin , " she ad - libbed with a smile , " Know the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull ?
Lipstick . "
Palin came out like a pit bull .
She leveled a swipe at Michelle Obama , saying people in small towns " love their country , in good times and bad , and they 're always proud of America . "
She took aim at Obama , saying people in small towns like the one she grew up in " do n't quite know what to make of a candidate who lavishes praise on working people when they are listening , and then talks about how bitterly they cling to their religion and guns when those people are n't listening .
We tend to prefer candidates who do n't talk to us one way in Scranton and another way in San Francisco . "
The crowd devoured it .
A rocky start
It was Palin 's first chance to define herself and push back against a media onslaught that has raced from her beauty queen past and mooseburger diet to investigations of her earmark requests and fundraising for indicted Alaska Republican Sen .
Ted Stevens .
Things got off to a rocky start as she arrived on stage an hour past her scheduled time , at 10:30 p.m. on the East Coast , but she dove straight into the task , defending her family by way of introducing them .
If a first rule in politics is to define yourself before others do , Palin had a difficult task reintroducing herself to a public that has already begun forming strong opinions of her character and her positions .
She attacked the assignment with gusto , burnishing her reformist credentials by way of mocking criticisms of her experience .
Looking increasingly at ease on stage as she warmed up , Palin described Obama as " a man who has authored two memoirs but not a single major law or reform " and " who can give an entire speech about the wars America is fighting , and never use the word victory except when he 's talking about his own campaign . "
The Obama campaign has been scrupulous in leaving the attack on Palin to the media and left - leaning allies , who have sought to paint her as another Dan Quayle , a former vice president intended as a fresh young conservative face who quickly devolved into a caricature of a callow dolt .
As a woman , Palin may be more difficult to deride , and her performance Wednesday night was superior to anything Quayle delivered .
Yet , like Quayle , Palin has distracted attention from her running mate .
The familiar and less telegenic McCain faces an enormous hurdle Thursday in breaking through the hubbub .
And with new e-mails leaked about Palin 's pressure on a state official to fire her ex-brother - in - law from his job as a state trooper , questions will continue to dog her , as they did Quayle , through the rest of the campaign .
Palin dove into the attack role traditionally assigned to vice presidential candidates , despite questions about her qualifications to step into the presidency , made more acute by McCain 's age and history of melanoma .
National gut check
As a former sportscaster and as a governor , Palin knows cameras , but nothing in any of her previous incarnations could compare to her debut before a national television audience and millions of voters waiting to see and assess for themselves what stuff she is made of .
Her next big national televised event , an even more herculean assignment , will be her Oct. 2 debate with Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden at Washington University in St. Louis .
With 36 years in national politics as a Delaware senator - a seat he won at just 29 years old , 15 years younger than Palin is now - along with two runs for the presidency and chairmanship of two high - profile Senate committees ( Foreign Relations and Judiciary ) , Biden is as thoroughly versed in national policy as anyone in Washington .
Palin , by contrast , will be cramming until the day of the debate .
From Minneapolis , Palin probably will be heading to battleground states to fuel the fires of conservative fever that were lighted the moment her name was announced , as well as shore up support among female , blue - collar , rural and independent voters .
She also will headline fundraisers as a star draw for McCain 's coffers .
" She 's attractive , she speaks well , and ... it's who she is that 's her great advantage " in the setting of the GOP conclave , said Marion Just , a Wellesley College political scientist and media specialist at Harvard University .
" It 's also her disadvantage outside of that setting . "
Former supporters of Democratic Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton are probably unreachable , Just said , given Palin 's positions , but " among independents , and women who are conservative on social issues , I think she has a good chance . "
After launching Contrastream
I ’ve always wanted to create a script that would automatically add new albums to the site as they were released ( saving me a lot of time ) .
The idea was to scrape a bunch of album titles from review sites and combine it with information from the Last.fm .
The task seemed daunting at the time , so I never jumped in and tried it .
After a year I finally wrote my first script and realized how wrong I was .
Scraping sites with ruby is surprisingly easy .
For my first project , I decided to try the simple task of pulling product information from homedepot.com .
Here ’s how I did it after some trial and error .
See the completed script : http://www.pastie.org/267676
The Plan
Go to http://homedepot.com
Search for “ Hoover Vacuums ”
Find the First Product in the Results
Click Product Details Link
Fetch Name + Description
Repeat for Each Product in the Results
Save Data to MySQL
What You Need
This is purely a ruby script but I used Rails to save the data using Mass Assignment + ActiveRecord ( MySQL ) .
Firefox + Firebug + XPath Checker
Set up basic Rails application framework Install scRUBYt !
plugin ( sudo gem install scrubyt –include - dependencies )
Set up the database .yml file Create homedepot.rb in [ rails_root ] / scripts folder
Now the fun part begins …
Fetching the site
Add this to the top of the script .
require '. ubygems ' require ' scrubyt ' Scrubyt .
logger = Scrubyt :: Logger .
new product_data = Scrubyt :: Extractor .
define do fetch ' http://www.homedepot.com/'
These are the basic scRUBYt includes plus the rails environment so we can use ActiveRecord .
After that you need to direct the script to the site your scraping ( called fetching ) .
Searching the site
Now that the page is loaded up , it ’s time to search the site .
fill_textfield ' keyword ' , ' hoover vacuums ' submit
I highlighted the search input box in Firefox and viewed source .
I found that the input name was “ keyword ” .
The second string is the search query “ hoover vacuums ” .
Find the First Product in the Results ( Create a Pattern )
The search results page shows a list of Hoover products .
The next step is to create a pattern that the script will follow .
In this case , the pattern is : for each product in the results I want to click and see the product details .
product_row " //div[@class='product ' ] " do … end
From viewing the source I found that each product is wrapped in div class= ” product ” .
Now for each div with a class= ” product ” the next action will take place .
Click Product Details Link
The link to the product details page is the name of the product .
For example , the link “ Hoover Legacy Pet Rewind Vacuum ” goes to the details page .
Because the link that will be clicked is unique on each row , I need to use the xpath of the link to create a pattern .
( Otherwise , I would have used product_link “ View Details ” . )
product_link " / form / div [ 1 ] / p[ 1 ] /a " , : generalize => false do
To find the xpath , right - click the first link in Firefox and click view XPath .
This is the xpath for the link inside the div : “ / form / div [ 1 ] / p[ 1 ] / a ” .
This shows that the link was wrapped in a form tag , followed by div , followed by a p ( all within div class= ” product ” ) .
Now , scRUBYt has a pattern : for each product in the search results , click the link ( located inside a form , div and p tag ) .
Each product in the results has the same HTML structure so the script can easily find the next product in the results .
Grab Title + Description
Now that the script is in the product details page , it ’s time to start scraping some data .
I wanted two things from this page , the name and description .
product_details do product_record "//p[@class='product -name ' ] " do name " Homelite 20 In .
Homelite Corded Electric Mower " end parent " //div[@id='tab - features ' ] " do description " / p[ 1 ] " end end
First , from looking at the HTML , I found the name was wrapped in the class “ product - name ” , so now I can grab the contents .
I copied the title from the first product so scRUBYt can create a pattern for the rest of the products .
Now the script knows exactly what data to kick back ( the text within the “ product - name ” div ) .
The description is similar except I used the xpath “ / p[ 1 ] ” to create a pattern instead of copying the whole paragraph of text .
The “ name ” + “ description ” preceding the paths above it is the label attached to the data when you export the data later on .
Save to MySQL
The script is pretty much done ; it is now searching for hoover vacuums , going to each product page and grabbing the name / description .
Now you can save the data to MySQL ( or any ActiveRecord DB ) .
The first step is to name your database columns the same name as what you labelled the data above .
In this case , I used “ name ” and “ description ” .
The mass assignment will automatically save the data to the corresponding DB columns .
product_data_hash = product_data .
to_hash product_data_hash .
each do | item | @product = Product . create ( item ) @product .
save end
Now , we save it to the DB by converting the data to a hash .
Each item creates a DB entry and mass assignment automatically sorts the data into the columns .
Note : you could also save the data to XML or a basic text file .
The Complete Script
You can view the complete script here : http://www.pastie.org/267654
To run the script , run “ ruby homedepot.rb ” in a command line .
One policy that I strictly follow is that the examples I post here come from professionals .
I believe it 's important to let the learners learn and , therefore , consider school assignments , messageboards , and hobby projects to be " off limits . "
But really , how fun are rules if you can't break 'em every once in a while ?
Especially when there 's an opportunity to present a website design technique that Justin recently came across .
It 's called flyer - to - print - to - photo - to - print - to - scan - to - web ( or , Web 0.1 ) :
Using your favorite word processing software , design a flyer that contains the information you 'd like to convey to your website visitor
Once designed , print the flyer on a color printer Lay the printed sheet of paper face - up on a table , preferably a clean , wooden table Take a photograph of the flyer using a camera , preferably a digital Download and print ( or develop ) the photograph of the flyer
With a normal scanner , scan the photograph of the flyer Upload the scanned image to a frame on your website
Here is a screenshot of one early adopters of this technique ...
Though it may not seem to visible in the screenshot , the designer certainly went with the preferred technique of the wooden table / digital camera .
One of the bitter ironies anti-racists face when working to end white - supremacist thinking and action is that the folks who most perpetuate it are the individuals who are usually the least willing to acknowledge that race matters .
( bell hooks , Teaching Community , 2003 , p. 28 )
You may be wondering what 7 astronauts have to do with a quote about anti-racism work from bell hooks .
I too would be curious .
Well , let me attempt to fill in several bits of context and hopefully you ’re wonder will be satiated .
Last week , while checking out a NASA - related post from one of my favorite blogs , the Boston Globe ’s “ Big Picture Blog , ” I happened to observe that none of the 7 astronauts for NASA ’s latest space shuttle mission were people of color .
There were already 15 comments on the post .
Most of the comments praised the ingenuity of NASA or extolled the fantastically big pictures on the post / site .
I decided to post a seemingly innocent question regarding the racial makeup of the 7 astronauts in picture # 23 :
The pool of astronauts is n’t the most diverse is it ?
7 white people .
6 guys and only 1 woman .
Where are the astronauts of color ???
~ Eric Stoller
I had no idea that my comment would generate a shower of racist rhetoric and inflammatory comments .
Here are the comments ( that specifically refer to my comment ) that were posted after my first comment :
( Note that not a single comment after my initial one references or responds to the fact that not only is the photo racially homogeneous , but it is also lacking in very much gender diversity . )
diversity and the best for the job do n’t always go hand in hand .
~nasausa
Thus begins the trope that people of color are not present in the photo of the 7 astronauts because they are automatically assumed to not be qualified .
It is apparently the only vinyl in the room because it is the broken record that is played over and over again .
@ Eric : Diversity for the sake of diversity is just not diverse .
That ’s political correctness .
Also , if you want to sound politically correct , you might not want to call them “ astronauts of color ” .
~ Brendan
I never said anything about diversity for the sake of diversity …oh and look Brendan has pulled out trope # 2 : dismissing any conversation or observation of race as being “ pc ” .
ERIC .
You are drawing the line at color .
These incredible people draw a line between us and them .
They are trully amazing and gifted people who are not just the kid that got all A’s in High school .
Research just one of their stories .
~ Dean
I wonder if he means that I am “ drawing the line at color ” like how Crayola used to have that one crayon that was called “ nude ” or “ skin tone ” when it really should have been called dominant paradigm or white privilege .
Maybe Eric is looking for the TOKEN black guy ?
~ Peter
People of color apparently only means Black folks to Peter .
I decided to respond to their comments :
It ’s interesting that the comments in response to mine assume that there are no astronauts of color ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_color ) because there were no qualified people of color for the job .
Why not assume that institutionalized racism was the cause as opposed to the qualifications of the white astronauts .
Why not assume that the white astronauts got to where they are because they did n’t have to overcome institutions that oppress folks of color ?
Why would an astronaut of color automatically be considered a “ token ” ?
How am I “ drawing the line at color ” when every astronaut in the photo is white ?
~ Eric
This is when I apparently pulled out my social justice can opener because the worms were released …
I have not yet responded to the comments that ensued after my last comment , # 51 … the rhetoric went from bad to worse :
Looks like there ’s a brother in pic 19 … ~ Son of R2D2
Somehow my comment , that clearly referred to just the photo of the astronauts , was misplaced by the Son of R2D2 .
Stick with Star Wars trivia , it ’s easier .
Eric Stoller – there have been quite a few “ astronauts of color ” over the years that the Shuttle has been flying .
Or are you offended because there are n’t any on this mission ?
Well , I ’m sorry – but as an American Tax Payer , I ’d prefer that the people qualified for the mission be the ones training and set to do the job – not someone who goes just because NASA is afraid on stepping on someone ’s toes .
I ’d prefer that the Commander of the shuttle be one who has the training and experience – not some wet - behind - the - ears pup who is chosen just because of the color of their skin .
Spaceflight is no place to be playing the Race Game .
You must chose the people who are ready and trained and qualified – Period .
~NB
Words keep coming out of my mouth but I ’m not saying them .
It ’s an interesting phenomenon .
I was n’t offended .
I merely made an observation .
Once again , what ’s up with the trope that folks of color are not qualified while white folks are automatically promoted to Commander status ?
When did race become a game ?
Oh I get it , that ’s just one more way of dismissing the importance of race and how it plays out in large U.S. - based institutions .
Keep paying your taxes mister status quo .
I am pretty sure that “ Token ” was meant to be a joke .
Not that your argument should be taken aback as I feel you have valid points .
Yet unfortunately , I think that there is a lot more to talk about ( at least on this page of the site ) than ANOTHER conversation involving ethnicity or color of skin .
~ Anonymous
I wish that had I gotten the token joke .
Sometimes my funny bone does n’t work when it ’s already been fractured .
Ok .
Awesome , I have valid points … umm wait , stay , do n’t leave …here we go again .
Race in space does n’t matter to the anonymous commenter .
To Eric S. - I suppose the concept of determining color of a person is getting a bit more difficult these days , and should be evidence to the pettiness of keeping score ad naseum by color - counters such as yourself .
Do you have a color meter to determine if someone meets your criteria of being a person of color ?
Can you “ just tell ” when you look at a group picture to be able to pick out people of color ?
Is there a color test you give ?
How many non-color parents can an individual have , and still qualify to be a person of color that meets your specifications ?
Tell me , just how do you determine that someone is an individual of color ?
~robroy
Why is n’t anyone using their full names ?
Curious .
I ’m not keeping score .
I actually do n’t even like sports trivia .
Oh , I see .
This is another reference to the trope that discussions of race are just a game .
Nice tie in !
In all fairness to robroy , I should have stated that the 7 astronauts were read by me as being all white .
It ’s a guess .
No color meter present .
Eric Stoller – your own commentary is in its self racist .
I am a Caucasian American of Irish and German descent .
My wife is mostly Irish .
My two daughters are mixed Irish / German .
My step son is 1 / 4 black , 1/4 Cherokee indian , and 1/ 2 irish .
His father is ½ black and ½ Cherokee , is a mathematician and a successful well respected businessman , and he and his cherokee mom black dad and mixed siblings attend our MIXED family get togethers such as Thanksgiving and / or Christmas .
… So DON ’T YOU DARE call me prejudiced , sir .
AMERICA IS A MELTING POT .
Color is not anymore and should never have been an issue here .
I work with a multitude of black engineers and scientists , just as I work with a multitude of Asians , and Middle - Easterners .
Caucasians such as myself are just part of the mix in my world .
– In fact , current estimates have shown that demographically I may actually be a minority in my field within 20 years or so .
People like yourself are merely pushing an agenda based upon fear and hostility bred by events that took place years before our present generation had anything to say about it !
Does that mean that atrocities were not committed ?
NO !
Of course things were wrong !
That ’s why change was necessary .
Nowadays , however , the change is done .
Color is not the issue at hand anymore .
That is why I can safely say that with respect to any given crew of astronauts …
Crew selection has nothing to do with gender , race , or skin tone .
The issue is , HOW QUALIFIED AN INDIVIDUAL IS TO GET A JOB DONE , and on the part of NASA ’s mission planners , the issue is also about PICKING QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT A MISSION AT THAT TIME .
This is the very same reason why AGE is an important factor in astronaut selection for missions …
Just because there is no one 60 years old flying our missions , do you hear folks screaming anything about AGE discrimination ?
Of course not !
We all know that a certain level of physical fitness must exist for any one person to be selected to fly on a mission costing American Taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars .
…. So , please , just accept the fact that the crew was selected for the right reasons …
And if you ’re not happy with that then feel free to get over it , stop complaining , and work happily alongside the rest of us in this world who are most interested in making this world a better place and doing something to make that happen every day .
~ Engineer Jones
Wow .
When the hell did I say that this fellow was prejudiced ?
Am I making comments in my sleep again ?
Can we all just place this comment in the rhetorically racist bucket and move on …all in favor ?
Okay .
Done .
All I see are seven brave folks .
Mainly Americans , but more importantly , human .
With the help of 10’s of thousands of other brave folks who spend their careers , and in some cases , their lives , to do the impossible .
Every day .
To be honest , I do n’t care if the crew is black , white , green or purple .
Male , female or ‘ other ’ .
I have just one question – Are they the best people for the job ?
Nothing more .
Nothing Less .
~ Fred in IT
Fred in IT does n’t see color .
Fred is a white dude .
A guess of course … but usually when someone starts mentioning green people or purple people , they are almost always white .
Green +
Purple = White .
Eric , and others wondering about lack of diversity – according to NASA , 13 % of America ’s 136 astronauts are African - American , Asian - American or Latino .
There have been at least 10 NASA astronaunts of African American ancestry , including one who died in the Challenger disaster .
See more here .
Also , see the diversity in this mission from 2006 .
Just because there are no faces like that in these 23 photos , do not infer an institutional bias .
Now , please , can we drop the discussion of race or diversity in this context ?
Thanks .
~ Alan Taylor ( Alan Taylor is the creator , admin , and journalist / programmer that runs the Big Picture Blog. ataylor@boston.com )
Dear Alan , I ’m surprised that you weighed in on this comment thread .
I had assumed that as a journalist ( it ’s a default title that comes with the gig ) and proprietor of the site that you would n’t join in on the “ race does n’t matter in space ” bandwagon .
By the way Alan , Native Americans are people of color too .
Apparently if you ’re Native American , you do n’t get to go to space .
To reiterate , my comment referenced a single photo , not the entire history of the space program .
7 white people .
0 people of color .
In what context would you be comfortable discussing race and diversity ?
Just curious …
Not quite yet alan .
I want to add that from the STS - 107 ( Columbia ’s fatal mission ) flight , Kalpana Chawla was an immigrant from India , Ilan Ramon was an Israeli citizen , and Michael Anderson was , I believe , African American ~ James
Once again , my comment was regarding a single photo .
I was not referring to any other moments in the history of NASA .
You might want to add that the current female record holder for number of days in space is a local girl , Suni Williams , recently returned last year from the Int’l Space Station .
One of her parents ( father ) is Indian according to web info , and her mother is described as being of Slovenian descent , with Suni being described as Indian - Slovenian .
See how this ethnic counting breaks down so fast and loses relevance ?
But for some reason , in my experience , when someone protests like Eric about not enough color , being of Indian descent ( as in Asian - Indian ) does n’t seem to quite count as “ color . ”
I hope the ethnic milestones cited above in previous posts and put to rest any preoccupation with the “ first ethnic this ” or the “ first gender that ” , and the science and engineering achievements can be celebrated and appreciated for themselves .
~robroy
My comment has been upgraded to “ protest ” status .
I think that needing to clarify that fact over and over again really says a lot about how people read what they want to read and how that might not quite match up with what was actually written .
Mr Uppity Eric , African Americans represent 13.8 % of the US Population and represent 13 % of the astronauts .
Noting these facts , you really sound like you are grasping at straws with your commentary on “ institutional racism ” , since they have EXACTLY proportional representation .
I seriously HOPE that * only * qualifications and skills are taken into account in the selection of shuttle crews .
A number much HIGHER than this would indicate that maybe the case , would n’t it ?
Given 13 % of the population , any given group of 7 people has a 38 % chance of NOT containing someone in your magical “ pick me ” color box .
The mission in 2006 with three black astronauts … well , by random statistics , that would be highly unlikely , seeing that they comprise just 13 % of the population ( only about a 5 % probability of finding 3 on a crew ) .
On the whole , “ people of color ” are actually represented MORE than their constituent 13 % should dictate over the last several years .
Maybe I should write the anti-defamation league .
That ’s not fair !!!!!!!!!!!!
Or maybe you ’re just full of hot air ?
So , next time you choose to gripe , perhaps you should do it with a tad more deference to reality rather than some fairy tale rainbow - circus world .
~ Matt
“ Uppity . ” Interesting word choice .
Especially since it ’s connected with all sorts of racist rhetoric .
I guess Matt decided that I was “ griping ” in addition to the “ protesting ” and “ complaining ” .
I really should mention that the most common theme that runs through most of the comments is dismiss , dismiss , dismiss .
And for Eric Stoller : sweetheart , just take a nap .
you ’ll feel better .
really .
~ Marjorie Brown
I felt fine when I wrote those two comments .
Alert , creative , and sincere .
Why is it assumed that when someone asks a question about race that they are not feeling well .
Discuss race and you must have a temperature .
Matt .
Please be careful using the word “ uppity ” .
It has a long well known history of being followed with the “ n ” word .
~ Clifford
Thanks Clifford .
Although you sort of seem to be protecting Matt and not really addressing the racist theme that saturates the comments .
It would be nice to keep our race issues on this planet and out of space and the exploration of new world ’s , that would be wonderful .
Peace to all .
~ S.M.S .
Yes , because in space , white astronauts can still not see color .
Sorry , I could n’t resist .
They are all astronauts of color : Orange .
~ Freddie
Dismiss .
Call it a game .
And mock .
The trifecta .
Oh and do n’t forget to never , ever use your full name .
Would n’t want anyone to know that you troll around the web cementing racist comment threads .
Eric Stoller :
Obsession with people ’s race is precisely the OPPOSITE of Martin Luther King ’s dream .
I am sorry to inform you that you are a Politically Correct Neo-Racist .
That being said …
Go Astronauts !
~ Mark G .
I never did say that I was obsessed with race .
All of these interesting words that keep being placed in my mouth .
I think I need to floss .
Wow .
I ’m a what ?!
As for those who make racial comments , “ Wake up to the world ” , Crew members must be selected on technical ability and not on some politically correct basis ~ Robert Flemington
Welcome back trope # 1 .
Folks of color do n’t have the skills according to Mr. Flemington .
Hey !
He used a full name and everything .
I thought the world ( is n’t NASA just a United States venture ? ) was a diverse place made up of lots of folks of color and white people .
My son Alan has created this wonderful series of photo essays .
He has discovered a venue that allows him to interact with the world that fascinates him .
As many have noted , it is not just the rich and substantive photos that he selects , it is the opportunity to thoughtfully explore topics that we might otherwise have missed .
Most of his followers share his wonderment of this place we all share .
Some out there could do some work on forgiveness and understanding .
For example , this piece is about the space program .
Why hijack it for race relations ?
You can be sure that if a current event highlights race relation issues , Alan will find a thoughtful and sensitive way to depict where we seem to be .
His work stands on its own merit .
Needless to say , his friends and family are delightfully pleased and proud .
Look forward to each piece and hope he shares his perspectives so long as it makes him happy .
Love you son .
~ Mike Taylor
Dear Greg and Gail ( the parentals ) , I am appalled and saddened that you have never come to my defense on a comments thread .
Shoddy parenting … just kidding :-) .
WTF .
Mike , I was not commenting on the quality or editorial process of the Big Picture Blog .
Just that single photograph with 7 white astronauts .
Read my damn comment !
Wow .
I “ hijacked ” the post with my comment .
Are you serious ?
Are you saying that once again , in space , white astronauts do not see color and therefore this post should not either ?
Race exists in every single context .
I just have to comment on how great it was seeing Eric “ I Am A Racist Myself ” Stoller getting absolutely floored by his totally unwarranted and 100 % ridiculous comments regarding racism in NASA .
Anyone who follows the space program knows that NASA has an outstanding record when it comes to fair representation in regards to race .
I am so sick of seeing the race card pulled out especially in places like this .
The ignorance that it requires to accuse NASA of such unfair practices is absolutely staggering .
It shows that not only are such people utterly clueless about the space program but also completely incapable of doing any sort of research on such topics before making such outlandish claims .
The only racist I see in here is you Eric and again it was absolutely beautiful seeing you get your you know what handed to you in brilliant fashion .
It brings a new meaning to the term owned .
I guess that ’s probably why you quickly disappeared and havent come back since .
Good riddance as this quality website does n’t need people like that .
To the people that destroyed Eric ’s comments , Very nice job indeed !!
~ OrangeCrush
I need to create a book with all of the names that I have been called in the blogosphere .
Name calling .
Still not nice , even in the virtual sphere .
Oh snap .
Did I just see another mention of the elusive “ race card ” ?
Oh yes , there it is .
It would seem that “ this quality website ” does n’t need uppity folks like myself causing a stir by mentioning race .
Racist – check .
And Orange , I prefer to be “ pwned . ” “ Owned ” is so 1990 ’s .
And I did n’t really disappear .
I just did n’t want to sink any of my energies into the web of racist comments on the post .
Trolls bore me and according to Marjorie ’s comment , I am already in need of a nap .
Eric ….. just a little clue …….
You ’re an Idiot .
A super accomplishment by AMERICA and you throw a race card in the mix .
Now , go get you Food Stamp card and your WIC card and go get some free groceries from Star Market for all the little liberal kids you and your many concubines have fostered .
Please do n’t forget to buy condoms this time .
~ You Got Told
Yes , America is raceless .
How could I have forgotten .
My bad .
Wow .
YGT decided that racism was n’t enough and decided to sprinkle in large amounts of classism .
Bravo for changing our ism mix .
Reply to # 16 … … Comments like yours usually come from stupid people !
You do n’t have to do a ton of research , to figure out why there are n’t an abundance of people of color in NASA or many other high tech positions …
… Just check out Bill Cosby ’s comments on Oprah recently ……….
He said , “ The high school DROP OUT RATE ( For people of color ) IS ASTRONOMICAL ” !!!!
So tell me Eric , should we put them right into the space program , as soon as they drop out , and hope that they catch on ????
Get a life !….. Get a job !…….
Get educated before you mouth off !
~ Les Madaus
Les Madaus , you do n’t have to do any research to see that my comment referred to the photo of the 7 white astronauts .
And damn , your comment is quickly headed to the rhetorically racist bucket .
Goodbye .
So now dear reader , I hope that you understand why I placed the most excellent quote from bell hooks ’
“ Teaching Community ” at the beginning of my post .
Race matters here on Earth as well as in space .

As I ’ve written before , if the McCain campaign would simply release John McCain ’s full cancer records , and the media would do their job , there would be no reason for us to speculate publicly as to whether John McCain is ill .
Unfortunately , neither the McCain campaign nor the media has shown any intention of getting the bottom of McCain ’s recent confusion , erratic behavior , and facial spasms .
So I have asked a number of our readers who are M.D.s to weigh in .
And they have .
This M.D. weighed in yesterday , and mentioned that he would have liked to have seen a full video of McCain ’s speech in which he had the facial spasms and then became confused .
The full unedited speech was online , so I sent it to him .
Here is his report after having viewed the entire video :
There were several issues that I noticed upon viewing this video .
First of all – he clearly has a medical problem known as ptosis .
This is demonstrated in him by his inability to hold up the eyelid on the left side .
Another famous person who has this exact same problem is Forrest Whittaker .
I have not really spent a lot of time looking at John McCain – not sure if this is a chronic condition .
Nevertheless , that would suggest that he either has a significant central nervous system problem ( ie brain tumor ) OR something could be happening to the delivery of neuronal information from the brain to the eye .
That would be over Cranial Nerve III .
In my experience , diabetes is the most common cause of this problem – but old age is certainly right up there .
Clearly , he could have had some severe damage to CN – III during surgery and or radiation therapy .
If you look at the wiki entry on this problem – you can clearly see that diabetes and brain tumors are right up there as the causes .
I would assume that if Senator McCain has had this problem for a while – this would have been thoroughly worked up .
However , without access to him or his medical records – it is impossible to know .
Furthermore , there are many subtle differences in ptosis and neurological problems like this – for example – what are the sizes of his pupils ?
– do they respond to light ?
etc etc etc – making certain diagnosis by video absolutely impossible .
Secondly , Senator McCain blinks constantly .
Notice the blinking is much more prominent on the right eye – because the left eye as stated above is not functioning as well from a motor standpoint .
If I had to guess , I would suggest that this possibly represents dry eyes .
The seventh cranial nerve – or the facial nerve – is in charge of innervating the lacrimal gland or tear glands .
That nerve is clearly compromised based on his other facial problems .
It would not be a stretch to assume that his ability to make tears is compromised – and people tend to blink a lot when this happens .
Again , there are many other questions I would like to ask him — does he have any trouble tasting food ?
–
Do his eyes burn during the day ?
Again , this is all educated guesswork without a patient in front of you .
Thirdly , Senator McCain has very clear facial asymmetry – both neurologic and anatomic .
By neurologic asymmetry , I mean that he clearly has trouble with his facial muscles and moving them around appropriately – this is obvious with still photos – his left mouth is hanging – not appropriately “ up ” like the right .
When he smiles – he cannot seem to move the left mouth like his right .
There are clearly other facial muscles involved – but not his forehead and eyebrows – both do quite well .
This neurologic asymmetry is very likely secondary to massive nerve damage to cranial nerve VII on the left .
He has evidence of damage to Cranial Nerve III and V as well .
Cranial Nerves IV and VI are less likely to be involved because he does not seem to have trouble moving the actual eye itself – in other words he is not cross-eyed when he speaks .
He has anatomic asymmetry – involving the big scar down his left face – as well as a pouched out area around his left jaw .
This could be left over from facial reconstructive surgery – or he could have some lymphatic issues from radiation or surgery .
I just would have no idea without medical records .
Toward the end of the video – when the massive nervous twitching was happening – his voice did seem to soften – and he paused frequently .
There was no speech slurring .
There did not seem to be any problem with other motor movements – ie he was still able to stand up straight – no leaning to one side or the other .
I still stand by what I said earlier – this twitching toward the end was distinctly different and corresponded to a time when he was confused .
He momentarily did not appear as robust as he had been .
Given these symptoms – and his obvious confusion – a visit to a physician immediately is in order .
I would also add that cognitive dysfuntion like we have witnessed over the last several weeks is also quite concerning .
He may be tired – but John believe me – that is what they all say .
I see this kind of presentation all the time – concerned family members bringing grandpa in because something just is not right – and then on exam it is clear that grandpa has had a little stroke .
He needs to be evaluated now .
In my professional career , I have done countless executive physicals and attestations to corporate boards and personnel offices .
It is customary for men and women in leadership positions to get a thorough physical examination and follow up on anything out of the ordinary .
In my career , I have seen several people turned down for jobs as CEOs or CFOs for the most trivial of reasons .
This , however , is not one of those times .
There are enough serious issues going on – pointed out to me today – that I believe he really needs to be evaluated and shoot straight with the American people – his future board of directors ( assuming he is elected ) .
Based on the results of a year - long supercomputer simulation , the Global Extinction Awareness System ( GEAS ) has reset the “ survival horizon ” for Homo sapiens – the human race – from “ indefinite ” to 23 years .
– SEPTEMBER 22 , 2019
This is the premise for Jane McGonigal ’s newest game , Superstruct .
The game ’s goal is to crowdsource forecasting for the Institute For The Future .
And based on that premise the IFTF is hoping that participants will do no less than help them find solutions to super - threats ( climate refugees , water , carbon quotas and more are listed ) .
The game will launch September 22nd and will last for six weeks .
During that time players will learn more information about the world in 2019 .
The players will share how they would deal with this new world .
They ’ll be able to use a network of sites to write their thoughts , find examples in their town or upload a short documentary .
A nice example of this is Mr. Judkins ‘ photo of an empty shelf and a sign from a supermarket announcing a peanut shortage .
As with ( almost ) any game there is a point system .
In this case participants with the most insight will get high - ratings and an ever increasing audience .
Of course the points will also help the IFTF find some of the trends they are seeking .
You can learn more about the game in Discover Magazine .
Jane developed the game in collaboration with Jamais Cascio and Kathi Van .
Kathi is the IFTF ’s Director of the Ten - Year Forecast .
This is an annual exercise done by the Institute and is funded by their many corporate customers .
Jane worked on a similarly - structured game entitled World Without Oil last year ( Radar post ) .
In it participants made pretend that they lived in a world with increasing oil costs .
They shared energy - saving schemes with each other via blogs and forums .
Others modified their lifestyle and did not use the car as often so that they could keep within their new gas budget .
I am sure that some of those tips are coming in handy now .
I hope Superstruct ’s scenarios do n’t also come true .
Toronto May Ban the Coffee Cup
Image : Toronto Star
Toronto has an ambitious plan to reduce waste to landfill by 70 % by 2010 .
This means that consumption of one - time use containers will have to decrease dramatically .
As you can see in the above picture from the Star , trash on city streets is made up of plastic bags , coffee cups , and fast food containers .
Just imagine what would happen to New York City ’s trash volume if Starbucks forced all their patrons to bring their own cups !
According to the Toronto Star , the city is considering three options :
An outright ban .
A levy or tax on the items .
( Charging extra would presumably influence consumers to use recyclable cups or containers . )
A deposit - return program similar to the provincial bottle return program , whereby consumers get at least a portion of their money back if they turn in the container , making the seller responsible for recycling it .
Toronto ’s ambitous plans are spurred by a landfill that ’s nearing capacity and the desire to avoid incineration , which can release toxic gases and large amounts of global warming gases .
But will their initiative work ?
Reducing waste to landfill through legislation
Let ’s take a look at the three options presented by the Toronto government , as well as their possible pros and cons :
Ban : Considering that the ban would take place on a business level , I think it would be very successful .
All one would need to do is pop into any coffee shop and see if they ’re handing out disposable cups , then slap a big fine on the company .
Since this ban eliminates consumer choice , there are actually very few points of mediation between the government and potential offenders ( limited to business owners ) .
However , jumping from no regulation to ban at breakneck speed leaves little room for consumers or businesses to change their habits , and will likely lead to ill will and resistance , even amongst those who agree with the cause in principle .
Tax : I think taxes are the best solution here .
No one likes taxes , and they may not affect the type of person who goes into a coffee shop for a $ 4 mocha latte , but that fact is that taxes get things done .
Would you bring your favorite coffee mug to get coffee on the way to work if it meant saving a dollar a week ?
I would .
And for all those people who do n’t want to conserve and would rather pay the tax , that money can go to recycling or waste management programs to otherwise deal with the problems caused by disposable food containers .
Deposit : Deposits sound nice in principle , but when was the last time anyone ever turned in a can for deposit ?
There is a program in my state , but I ’m too lazy to do it , so I just put my recycling out and expect nothing in return .
Plus , because most of the waste in question here is food waste , the return system would have to be handled within the place of business , which would not only inconvenience people grabbing food and leaving , but the businesses that now have to collect and store trash in a new way , as well as issue deposit refunds .
I actually think this would be more burdensome than an outright ban , and would eventually fail insofar as it would not affect any real change .
How would you handle Toronto ’s current trash problem ?

CNN 's Drew Griffin took his network 's Special Investigations Unit to Lake County , IN yesterday in an attempt to document election problems in the area .
Did he discuss the active and legitimate voter suppression campaign taking place there , in which local Republicans are blocking early voting in three Democratic leaning cities ?
Not at all .
Instead , he focused on faulty registration cards submitted by the current bete noir of the conservative movement , the community organizing group ACORN .
What 's worse , his report ( and most other media accounts ) grossly misrepresented the intent and professionalism of ACORN 's registration efforts .
Watch it :
In the report , Ruthann Hoagland , a Republican member of the Lake Co. Board of Elections , tells Griffin that ACORN submitted 5,000 new registrations in the past two weeks .
But during the verification process , employees found that about half were fraudulent , including multiple forms turned in with the same handwriting , one signed " Johns , Jimmy " using the address of a Jimmy John 's sandwich shop in Crown Point , and others with the name of registrants that are now dead .
Nationwide , registrar 's offices have come across similar problems in recent days .
What Griffin fails to note , however , is that ACORN made very clear that some registrations they gathered from canvassers in Lake County may have been faulty .
An ACORN spokesmen explained this in an October 7 press release :
ACORN flags and turns in three kinds of cards , those that it can verify , those that are incomplete , and those that it flags as problematic .
It turns those in labeled in a special way and are very conservative in terms of what it flags as problematic .
It has stacks of problematic cover sheets . [...]
The Lake County Board knew about the questionable registrations today because ACORN flagged them for the board .
For example , the Jimmy John ’s card is one that a caller had flagged and labeled as problematic .
ACORN can get that caller to talk to the press .
According to Regina Harris , the Director of Registrations for Lake County , this claim checks out .
" It 's certainly true .
They did have three batches separated . " she told me this morning .
" There was a pile they knew were good , there was some they said had missing info -- like no voter ID number or a missing birthday -- and another batch they called ' suspicious . ' "
Why would ACORN submit registration forms it had deemed " suspicious " ?
Because under most state laws , voter registration organizations are required to turn in all the forms they receive .
In a phone conversation today , ACORN press coordinator Charles Jackson confirmed that this is the case in Indiana .
So what explains all the faulty registration forms ?
There are two probable causes .
One is that some registration forms can contain simple errors .
That means the registrant did n't intend to subvert the election process , but rather just made an honest mistake .
The other scenario involves the canvassers themselves .
If employees want to boost their performance in the eyes of their boss or simply do n't want to do the work of finding legitimate new voters , they could turn in forged or faulty registration forms . *
This is illegal and can wreak havoc on registrar 's offices , but there 's no evidence these imaginary people turn around and vote in November .
Given Indiana 's strict voter ID law , it would actually be next to impossible for anyone to cast a ballot under the name of a submarine sandwich chain or a dead person .
But these facts have n't stopped conservative critics and some in the media from incorrectly implying that ACORN 's faulty registrations prove the organization is trying to forge votes and steal the election in November .
An editorial in the Investor 's Business Daily said , " [ John ] McCain would be wise to start preparing a challenge to voter registration rolls should he lose the race in a close contest . "
CNN even set up Griffin 's segment with a graphic that read “ Voter Fraud ? "
What dynamic is at play here ?
It 's the conflation of voter registration fraud -- the more common problem outlined above -- and " voter fraud , " the unproven fetish of Karl Rove and his conservative cronies .
By spending their energy and resources vilifying ACORN without providing the proper context , CNN and others are ignoring an actual threat to fair elections : systemic , illegal voter disenfranchisement .
* CORRECTION :
This post originally stated that many ACORN canvassers are paid by a quota system .
That is inaccurate .
All ACORN canvassers are , in fact , paid by the hour .
Coffee room drinkers pay more when watched by a pair of “ Big Brother ” eyes ( Image : Newcastle University )
We all know the scene : the departmental coffee room , with the price list for tea and coffee on the wall and the “ honesty box ” where you pay for your drinks – or not , because no one is watching .
In a finding that will have office managers everywhere scurrying for the photocopier , researchers have discovered that merely a picture of watching eyes nearly trebled the amount of money put in the box .
Melissa Bateson and colleagues at Newcastle University , UK , put up new price lists each week in their psychology department coffee room .
Prices were unchanged , but each week there was a photocopied picture at the top of the list , measuring 15 by 3 centimetres , of either flowers or the eyes of real faces .
The faces varied but the eyes always looked directly at the observer .

In weeks with eyes on the list , staff paid 2.76 times as much for their drinks as in weeks with flowers .
“ Frankly we were staggered by the size of the effect , ” Gilbert Roberts , one of the researchers , told New Scientist .
Powerful signal
Eyes are known to be a powerful perceptual signal for humans .
People behave more cooperatively when they are being “ watched ” by a cute image of a robot ( see Pay up , you are being watched ) or even abstract “ eye spots ” on a computer screen .
But this , says Roberts , is the first time anyone has observed the effect in a natural situation , with people using their own money .
It could have far - reaching implications .
In previous experiments , people consistently appeared to behave more generously than they needed to for their own self - interest , even when told their actions were anonymous .
This has led an influential school of economists to argue that altruism in humans is innate , rather than being based on cynical self - interest .
But if just a photocopied pair of eyes can treble honesty , the Newcastle team suspects that these previous experiments may somehow have been spoiled by subliminal cues that made people feel they were being watched .
In other words , self - interest may play a large part after all , with people feeling the need to be seen as honest .
“ Those results might need to be re-examined , ” says Roberts .
Meanwhile , the Newcastle team wants to repeat the work with more people , in different situations , perhaps posting pictures of eyes where tickets are sold for public transport .
They would also like to discover what kind of eyes work best .
