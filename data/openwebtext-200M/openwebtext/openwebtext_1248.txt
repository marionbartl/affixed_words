7 reasons why religion is a form of mental illness
I would like to propose that religious beliefs be placed in the DSM as a category of mental illness for the following reasons :
(1) Hallucinations - the person has invisible friends who ( s ) he insists are real , and to whom ( s ) he speaks daily , even though nobody can actually see or hear
these friends .
(2) Delusions - the patient believes that the invisible friends have magical powers to make them rich , cure cancer , bring about world peace , and will do so eventually if asked .
(3) Denial / Inability to learn - though the requests for world peace remain unanswered , even after hundreds of years , the patients persist with the praying behaviour , each time expecting different results .
(4) Inability to distinguish fantasy from reality - the beliefs are contingent upon ancient mythology being accepted as historical fact .
(5) Paranoia - the belief that anyone who does not share their supernatural concept of reality is " evil , " " the devil , " " an agent of Satan " .
(6) Emotional abuse - ­ religious concepts such as sin , hell , cause feelings of guilt , shame , fear , and other types of emotional " baggage " which can scar the
psyche for life .
(7) Violence - many patients insist that others should share in their delusions , even to the extent of using violence .

The House - approved healthcare overhaul would raise the costs of healthcare by $ 289 billion over the next 10 years , according to an analysis by the chief actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) .
( READ THE FULL REPORT HERE )
The CMS report is a blow to the White House and House Democrats who have vowed that healthcare reform would curb the growth of healthcare spending .
CMS 's analysis is not an apples - to - apples comparison to the cost estimate conducted by the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) and the Joint Committee on Taxation ( JCT ) because CMS did not review tax provisions , which help offset the price tag of the Democrats ' measure .
However , the CMS analysis clearly states that the House bill falls short in attaining a key goal of the Democrats ' effort to reform the nation 's healthcare system : " With the exception of the proposed reduction in Medicare ... the provisions of H.R. 3962 would not have a significant impact on future healthcare cost growth rates . "
Republicans immediately seized on CMS 's conclusions .
The long - awaited report should serve as a " stark warning to every Republican , Democrat and Independent worried about the future of this nation , " Ways and Means Committee ranking member Dave Camp ( R - Mich . ) said in a statement on Saturday .

Though House Republicans pressed to have this analysis completed before the lower chamber voted on the Democrats ' sweeping healthcare reform bill last week , it was not ready until late Friday .
Chief CMS Actuary Richard Foster , who prepared the report , recently told The Hill that he and his staff had only a few days to review the bill before it was voted on .
Brendan Daly , communications director for Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) , said , " The report shows that our health reform bill will extend the life of the Medicare trust fund by five years -- significantly longer than any proposal in recent years , " adding , " Medicare actuaries estimate $ 100 billion more in savings than CBO from Medicaid and Medicare . "

House parliamentarian to step down
Five things we learned from this year 's primaries Bad blood between Pelosi , Meadows complicates coronavirus talks MORE ( R - Ohio ) highlighted the CMS report on Saturday in a written statement .
" This report once again discredits Democrats ’ assertions that their $ 1.3 trillion government takeover of health care will lower costs , and it confirms that this bill violates President Obama ’s promise to ‘ bend the cost curve . ’
It ’s now beyond dispute that their bill will raise costs , which is exactly what the American people do n’t want . "
Republicans predicted that if the CMS numbers were available last Saturday when the House voted on the Democrats ' healthcare bill , the measure would not have passed .
“ This report confirms what virtually every independent expert has been saying : Speaker Pelosi ’s healthcare bill will increase costs , not decrease them .
I hope my colleagues in the Senate heed CMS ’ findings and refuse to rush ahead until any bill under consideration can be certified to actually reduce healthcare costs , " Camp said .
According to the 31 - page report , the House - passed bill would increase costs , cut Medicare and expand Medicaid .
“ In aggregate , we estimate that for calendar years 2010 through 2019 [ national health expenditures ] would increase by $ 289 billion , " the report notes .
" About three - fifths " or more than 60 percent of the uninsured would gain coverage by an expansion in Medicaid eligibility .
Medicare would be cut by " more than one - half trillion dollars ( $ 571 billion ) , ... possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries , " according to the report , and smaller companies would be " inclined to terminate their existing coverage . "
Camp said that the nonpartisan analysis demonstrates that the Democrats ' bill " does the opposite of everything they 've been wanting to do " in terms of reducing overall health costs .
He added the CMS report shows that " this is not healthcare reform , this is entitlement expansion . "
A Democratic aide said the CMS and CBO findings are not that different : " While the actuaries do not show tax increases , adding those amounts from JCT would also illustrated that the proposal reduces the deficit over the next 10 years . "
In an interview with The Hill on Saturday afternoon , Camp pointed out that CMS actuarial numbers were cited by Democrats back in 2003 during the Medicare prescription drug debate .
CMS estimated at that time that the GOP - crafted Medicare bill would cost more than $ 550 billion over 10 years while CBO estimated its pricetag at $ 395 over the same period .
The CMS cost estimate did not emerge until after the final conference bill was approved by Congress .
CMS 's findings are not binding on Congress , however .
Congress must abide by CBO and JCT estimates .

The Taxpayers ' Alliance , a campaign group that calls for tax and spending cuts and claims to represent the interests of taxpayers , has admitted one of its directors does not pay British tax .
The Guardian has learned that Alexander Heath , a director of the increasingly influential free market , rightwing lobby group , lives in a farmhouse in the Loire and has not paid British tax for years .
The admission , made by Matthew Elliott , the TPA 's chief executive and founder , is potentially embarrassing for the Conservative party , which has close links to the group that claims to be " the guardian of taxpayers ' money , the voice of taxpayers in the media and their representative at Westminster " .
At the Conservative party conference in Manchester this week , the TPA 's influence was underlined when David Cameron and George Osborne followed its recommendations for freezing public sector pay and capping civil servants ' salaries at the level of the prime minister , unless approved by the chancellor .
Senior Labour figures said the admission that a TPA director does not pay British tax " should ring alarm bells " about the group 's influence on the debate on tax and spending .
The group has also campaigned against green taxes , quangos and town hall pay .
Heath 's status emerged from an investigation into the TPA , which also revealed that the group is heavily funded by a group of businessmen and wealthy donors who also back the Conservatives .
" Mr Heath , a retired teacher , has lived in France since marrying his French wife in 1973 , " said Elliott in a statement .
" He is still a British citizen but he is a French taxpayer ( where taxes are higher than in the UK ! ) .
He is passionate about the Taxpayers ' Alliance . "
Elliott said Heath returned to the UK for about a fortnight each year and owned no property in Britain .
" The least we can expect for an organisation that purports to represent the interests of British taxpayers is that it is run by people that pay British tax , " said Jon Cruddas MP , who said he is one of many Labour MPs concerned about the TPA 's growing influence .
" When it emerges that one of the directors does n't [ pay British tax ] , their motivations seem questionable and alarm bells should start ringing for anyone who comes across the TPA . "
He said the organisation 's backers suggested there was " a revolving door " between Tory donors and supporters of the TPA , although the group denies it is a front for the Conservatives .
The TPA 's financial backers include Sir Anthony Bamford , the owner of the JCB digger company , and Tony Gallagher , the owner of Gallagher Estates , both Conservative donors , who with 32 other businessmen have donated about £ 80,000 to the group through the Midlands Industrial Council .
Malcolm McAlpine , the chief executive of contractor Sir Robert McAlpine , said he had also funded the group .
David Alberto , a property developer supplies office space to the group near Westminster worth an estimated £ 100,000 a year .
The campaign group refuses to publish details of its income or a list of donors , but when pressed , Elliott said the biggest single donation was no higher than £ 100,000 and its annual income from donations was about £ 1 m .
It is a rapid rise for a group which filed accounts for 2005 that showed donations of just £ 67,547 .
The TPA 's links to the Conservatives include monthly meetings where speakers have included Eric Pickles , the Conservative party chairman , Liam Fox , the shadow defence secretary , and Daniel Hannan , the Tory Eurosceptic MEP who recently claimed the NHS was " a 60 - year mistake " .

Advertisement Immigration officers have warned bosses that new rules designed to stop bogus students entering the UK are not working , the BBC has learned .
Non-EU students are supposed to apply to registered institutions , and must prove they can support themselves .
But claims are now verified in the students ' home countries , and UK staff say they have limited ability to challenge those they suspect .
The UK Border Agency insists all entrants must meet immigration rules .
Pressure One Heathrow Airport immigration officer - speaking on condition of anonymity - told BBC Radio 5 live 's Donal MacIntyre programme that UK staff were overwhelmed by the volume of student arrivals .
Anyone coming in to the UK must satisfy the border force officer that they meet the immigration rules
Jeremy Oppenheim
UK Border Agency " Student season has extended now to virtually the whole year , " he said .
" We are looking at upwards of 500 to 1,000 stuck in the hall , queues stretching for hundreds of yards down the terminal .
" On occasions we 've had to shut the hall as we could n't cope .
" That has led to planes being backed up ... to not allow them to proceed into Heathrow until we could clear what we 've got . "
Many of these students are entirely legitimate , but he said he and his colleagues are almost powerless to challenge those whom they suspect are not .
" If someone presents a case like that to a chief immigration officer , they take a look at the size and the number of people in the hall , and they turn around and say , ' Look , because of the pressure of work , they 've got a visa , get them into the country ' .
" It would take two officers off the desk for hours just to present a case to send them to a detention centre . "
And he believes this means people who have been denied entry to the UK on other grounds are able to enter the UK on bogus student visas .
" We have an awful lot of students who have been refused five , six , even up to nine visas to come here to this country , whether it be for working holidays or student applications , " he said .
" And they 're now coming here . "
Proof
Under the new system , colleges which offer courses to students from outside the European Economic Area must be accredited by the Home Office .

But the Heathrow immigration officer alleges that the list of approved institutions contains colleges which he and his colleagues know to have a history of awarding fake qualifications .
" It beggars belief that these places can be graded the way they are , when we know for a fact that we 've proved and got signatures from the passengers that they paid for their certificates , " he said .
The immigration officer told BBC Radio 5 live about a recent case of an Indian woman in her 50s who presented herself as a student enrolling on an advanced course , despite the fact that she could barely speak English .
" She was going to do an ACCA accounting course , of which when asked in Hindi what ACCA meant , she did n't have a clue , " he said .
" She was n't even able to say in her own language what the course was going to entail . "
' Tightened controls '
These concerns are echoed on an internal UK Border Agency online message board , seen by the BBC .
One officer wrote : " I can no longer feel proud of my role , given that I am forced on a daily basis to allow entry to passengers who clearly hold no ability or intention to follow any course of study in the United Kingdom " .
Another commented : " The introduction of the appallingly thought - out points - based system for students has , in one fell swoop , failed the UK taxpayer who expects us to do a good job in tackling illegal immigration . "
The website quotes an acknowledgement from chief executive Lin Homer that the Border Agency had " not got it right " on student visas .
But Jeremy Oppenheim , head of the points - based system at the UK Border Agency , insisted that the rules were working .
" The points - based system means that only those colleges and schools who provide quality education and take responsibility for their students will be licensed to bring in foreign students , " he told Radio 5 live .
" Schools and colleges are inspected by accreditation bodies and the UK Border Agency to ensure they are genuine .
Before we tightened controls , around 4,000 UK institutions were bringing in international students .
This currently stands at around 2,000 .
" Anyone coming in to the UK must satisfy the border force officer that they meet the immigration rules and will comply with any conditions attached to their visa .
If they cannot , the officer can and will refuse entry . "

This has got to stop .
We have to start cleaning house of this vermin that call themselves “ peaceful Muslims . ”
We know now that THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A PEACEFUL MUSLIM .
Even this Army Officer was probably thought to have been a “ peaceful Muslim ” proved to us that they do n’t exist .
They are filled with hate and violence toward all of what they , in their minds , call decent peace loving people , ‘ infidels . ’
If we are infidels , they are ‘ hatefidels ’ and we should take aim on them for a change .
Let ’s start a new trend here in what was once relatively peaceful America .
We should begin purging our federal government of ALL known Muslims and any others who associate themselves with any thing remotely Islamic .
They are not fit to be our neighbors or even be in the same country with us .
Their initial intent is to make us bow to THEIR will in OUR country .
I say , “ To hell with them ” and I mean that literally .
They are n’t fit to be around good honest , God-loving people , and I mean the God that is good and loving Himself ; not the one that tells his followers to go and KILL others so they can come to him in his heaven .
Good !
Go to him and I doubt you ’ll see any heaven where he resides ; more like the fires of Hell are in his so - called heaven .
There they will pay for their sins of killing innocent people just because those innocents did n’t conform to their unholy and dastardly way of life .
And perhaps we should start at the top ; the place where our lying leader says he loves America .
Yeah , he loves it alright ; he ’d love to see it in the hands of his murdering Muslim brothers and sisters .
Obama once said that he had visited all 57 states and we all snickered a bit over this bit of what we thought was erroneous information .
But guess what ?
He was probably right .
The Islamic world does in fact consist of 57 states and Islam is what is on the mind of this usurper who holds hostage our most revered political office once populated by George Washington , a TRUE and devout leader .
This is a quote from ‘ InfoPlease.com ’
“ The Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) is an international organization grouping fifty seven states which have decided to pool their resources together , combine their efforts , and speak with one voice to safeguard the interests and secure the progress and well - being of their peoples and of all Muslims in the world . ” ( Emphasis mine . )
Yeah , I would bet that Obama has been to all 57 states ; he did n’t make a mistake , he was just not thinking about American states .
A psychologist would call that a “ Freudian slip . ”
So let ’s grease the track for the quick departure from the United States and a very quick arrival to the “ holy ” 57 Islamic states .
Let ’s get all of the socialistic liberals out of our Congress next November and then when normal Americans are in place we can start impeachment proceedings to rid us of the head of the beast .
Or as an alternate so we wo n’t have to contend with the empty - headedness of Joe Biden , just let Obama stay on but with no powers for two years while our new Congress draws up new legislation abolishing all the harmful actions the current Congress and Administration have wreaked on our fair country .
Then we can also take on the anti-American MainStream Media ( MSM ) ; those head up their ‘ you - know - whats ’ that have aided and abetted the sorry bunch of socio / communistic that have been trying to lead us into the corrupt embraces of the United Nations .
What say America ?
Are your ready for some ‘ County First Actions ’ ?
We absolutely nailed this puppy to the wall over and over and over again , so it ’s only fitting we ’d be doing the first actual unveiling , right ?
We ’re not going to get too in - depth though , that will come at a later time .
Here are some brief thoughts before the photos :
It ’s running Android 2.0 .
Duh .
It ’s thin .
Just slightly thicker than an iPhone 3GS and the thinnest QWERTY - slider we ’ve ever seen .
It is the fastest Android device we ’ve ever used .
( It ’s running a TI OMAP3430 processor )
The feel of the device is very reminiscent of the OQO 02 model computer .
Just smaller .
It ’s metal with a non-spring - assisted slide , very sturdy , and half soft - touch plastic .
Awesome capacitive display .
Plus it ’s huge .
Easily the best screen we ’ve ever seen on an Android handset , and an amazing screen overall .
The QWERTY keyboard is actually pretty usable and has a soft - touch rubberized finish .
We ’ve been told the keyboard design is n’t final on this unit , thus the two no -shows .
Have we mentioned this phone flies ?
It ’s the Android device to beat , and easily the most impressive .
From what we ’ve been told , Google had a direct hand in the Motorola Droid .
Something to the point of almost dictating every move Motorola made when designing and making the phone .
Interesting , huh ?
There ’s a desktop cradle / charger that will ship with the Motorola Droid that we ’ve been playing around with .
It turns your Droid into a “ multimedia station ” and displays local weather , the time , etc .
No one wants to listen , but it makes the CLIQ looks like a child ’s toy ( partly because it is , and partly because the Droid , even in its non-final form , is the most impressive phone we ’ve used since the iPhone .
It ’s positively amazing ) .
Ok , enough of that — enjoy the photos !
We ’ll put together a nice little review soon .

Oxygen on a planet might be a sign of life , but in two peculiar white dwarf stars it could indicate a narrow escape from a violent death .
Their oxygen content marks them as failed stellar bombs – the remnants of stars that almost went supernova .
The new stars are among thousands of white dwarfs picked up by the Sloane Digital Sky Survey .
Like all white dwarfs they are the dead , cooling cores left behind by mainstream stars , and are mainly made of helium .
Usually the second most plentiful ingredient is carbon – but when a group of astronomers led by Boris Gänsicke at the University of Warwick , UK , analysed the spectrum of light from these two white dwarfs , they found that the objects hold far more oxygen than carbon .
“ It ’s extreme – these things look very different from any white dwarfs we ’ve seen before , ” says team member Danny Steeghs .
Creating so much oxygen requires a nuclear furnace fiercer than that needed for a carbon - rich mixture , so the stars that spawned these white dwarfs must have been hot and massive .
Simulations suggest that they must have been almost too big to end their days gently – any larger , and they would have grown a core so massive and dense that it would inevitably have collapsed , releasing enough energy to blow the rest of the star apart in a supernova explosion .

The critical mass needed to create such a supernova is thought to be between 7 and 10 times that of the sun .
These almost - bombs might help astrophysicists to pin down the threshold more precisely , and Gänsicke hopes to use the Very Large Telescope in Chile ’s Atacama Desert to get a clearer spectrum and reveal their chemistry in more detail .
“ It will give the theoreticians something to work with , ” he says .

Medical marijuana is an insult to our intelligence
The Justice Department says it 's backing off the prosecution of people who smoke pot or sell it in compliance with state laws that permit " medical marijuana . "
Attorney General Eric
Holder says " it will not be a priority to use federal resources to prosecute patients with serious illnesses or their caregivers . "
Party hardy !
I mean -- let the healing begin !
I do n't think the federal government should be spending a whole lot of time on small - time druggies , and I 'm undecided about legalizing pot , which enjoys 44 percent support among the general public , according to a recent poll .
Recreational use is not the wisest thing -- and if my 12 - year - old son is reading this , that means you ! -- but it 's no more harmful than other drugs ( e.g. , alcohol ) and impossible to eradicate .
On the other hand , I worry it 's a gateway to harder stuff .
So I think we probably should have an open debate about decriminalization .
But it should be a real debate , about real decriminalization , and not clouded -- pardon the expression -- by hokum about " medical marijuana . "
To the extent it puts the attorney general 's imprimatur on the notion that people are getting pot from " caregivers " to deal " with serious illnesses " -- as opposed to growing their own or flocking to " dispensaries " just to get high -- the Justice Department 's move is not so constructive .
I do not deny that for some people , including some terminal cancer patients and pain - wracked AIDS sufferers , marijuana is a blessed relief .
Let 'em smoke , I say , just as the Justice Department has usually ignored such cases since long before Holder spoke up .
But if you believe there is any scientific evidence that smoked marijuana has the multiplicity of therapeutic uses that advocates claim -- well , I 've got a bag of oregano I 'd like to sell you .
Usually , drugs have to pass exacting testing by the Food and Drug Administration before they go on the market .
There 's a good reason for this : we do n't want people spending money on products that might be ineffective or actually harmful .
In California and elsewhere , however , snake oil -- sorry , " medical marijuana " -- got on the market via a different route : popular referendum .
The pot for sale in dispensaries is subject to none of the purity controls that actual pharmaceutical drugs must meet .
Indeed , the new DOJ policy essentially recognizes a gray market for pot , leaving these supposedly seriously ill people at the mercy of their dealers -- I mean caregivers -- with respect to quality and efficacy .
What other substances should we handle this way ?
Cocaine ?
Laetrile ?
Did n't President Obama just sign a bill authorizing the FDA to regulate the nicotine content of tobacco ?
And I thought he promised to " restore science to its rightful place . "
Under California 's law , you do n't even need a prescription to get pot ( which would admittedly have been a problem , since the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency controls who gets a prescription pad , and not many doctors would use theirs to prescribe an illegal drug ) .
All it takes is a " written or oral recommendation " from a physician .
A few years ago , a California woman called Angel Raich took her defense of medical pot all the way to the Supreme Court .
She lost on the legal issue , which had nothing to do with the medical effectiveness of pot .
Along the way , though , she claimed that she was suffering from " life - threatening " weight loss ( due to a chronic inability to hold down food , which her doctors could not explain ) .
She also cited chronic pain from scoliosis , temporomandibular joint dysfunction , bruxism , endometriosis , headache , rotator cuff syndrome , uterine fibroids , and Schwannoma .
The Latin names of these latter conditions might have snowed some judges , but physicians recognized each of them as a common , non-life - threatening problem for which conventional treatments were available .
Raich listed a cornucopia of potent drugs , from Vicodin to Methadone , that she had tried previously and gotten no satisfaction .
This is not an isolated instance .
According to a survey by NORML , the pro-" medical marijuana " organization , which can be expected to emphasize the desperate health of users , only 22 percent of California medical marijuana users suffer from AIDS - related disease .
Most of the rest have more subjective maladies such as " chronic pain " or " mood disorders . "
Raich 's physician was Frank Lucido , a well - known Berkeley doctor and pro-pot activist -- he also makes money as an expert witness on " medical marijuana " -- whose Web site boasts that he was " investigated by the Medical Practices Board of California for cannabis evaluation practices in 2003 , and fully exonerated . "
The case involved his recommendation of marijuana to treat attention deficit disorder in a 16 - year - old boy , but , as I say , he was fully exonerated .
In a brilliant article ( requires subscription ) on this subject in the Hastings Center Report , a bioethics journal , lawyer and anesthesiologist Peter J. Cohen noted that " medical marijuana " groups have been notably passive about demanding FDA testing and approval for this purported elixir .
Instead , they took their case to the people .
As Cohen argued , this is no way to make health policy : " medical marijuana , " he wrote , should be " subjected to the same scientific scrutiny as any drug proposed for use in medical therapy , rather than made legal for medical use by popular will . "
The " medical marijuana " movement may not be a threat to our civilization , but it is an insult to our intelligence .
Clarification :
An earlier version of this posting said Angel Raich claimed that each of the medical conditions cited in her lawsuit was life - threatening .
She asked me to explain that she only contended that one of her conditions -- chronic weight loss due to an inability to keep food down -- was life - threatening .
I am happy to oblige .
She is about to undergo an operation to reduce her Schwannoma , which is a benign brain tumor .

It was 1999 , and Brian 's company 's new online marketing venture was finally off the ground and making a profit using an off - the - shelf conglomeration of bits and pieces of various content management , affiliate program , and ad servers .
Brian 's team had hit all of the goals for the first funding tranche , and the next step was to use those millions of dollars to grow the staff from twelve to fifty , half of whom would be software developers working directly for Brian .
The project was an $ 8 million , nine - month development effort to build , from the ground up , the best 21st - century marketing / e- commerce / community / ad network / reporting system mousetrap possible .
Leading a team of twenty people was a big step up for Brian , so he buckled down , read management theory books , re-read The Mythical Man Month , learned the ins-and - outs of project management software , invested in UML and process training , and carefully pored over resumes to find the best candidates .
Having assembled , trained , and indoctrinated his team in best practices , they went to work .
They held stakeholder interviews , pored over requirements , developed use - case models , charted process flow , designed domain entity models , and built their development plan .
They developed cleanly separated business logic , persistence , and user experience tiers .
They followed formal test - driven development .
They held weekly group code reviews .
They did just about everything right , so much so that Brian had never before been on a project which ran so smoothly .
Until the last week before release .
One of the key components was the custom - built ad server .
It used a single unique ID for each ad placement and handled the switching of creatives on the backend .
At the time , that was still uncommon , with many affiliate programs and ad servers hardcoding the creative images directly into the HTML ad serving code .
Being able to manage updates of creatives , optimize banner rotation , and take down unwanted ads on the back end was one of the major advantages as seen by the business users .
" Hey Brian , quick question . "
It was Barry , VP of Marketing .
The entire company was his brainchild , and he was CEO in all but name .
" Some clients are complaining that these IDs are kind of ugly , always ' F0DB57A3C10EE7D28277 ' or some other unpronounceable jumble . "
Now , the IDs were uniquely generated each time a new ad placement was created .
With dozens of client and hundreds of affiliates signed up representing thousands of web sites and tens of thousands of pages , they needed to generate them automatically .
Also , to avoid possible fraud , the IDs needed to be non-sequential but unique .
Plus , they were purely used on the backend — nobody needed to pronounce them .
" These are only shown to users as URL parameters , no different than the session ID , " Brian protested .
More diplomatically , he asked , " What 's the reason to for making them pronounceable ? "
" Well , " he admitted , " one of our biggest advertisers has this legacy accounting system which their IS department wo n't integrate with our online reports .
When talking by phone with people in different offices , they have to read the IDs to each other to be able to identify which accounts they are talking about . "
After thinking a moment , Brian realized that this was the perfect place to apply an algorithm he had learned about recently .
" Markov chains ! " he blurted .
" We can use statistical textual analysis to generate random words built up from natural phonemic combinations .
They wo n't be real words , but they will match expected English patterns , and people will be able to pronounce and read them completely naturally . "
Intrigued and satisfied , Barry assented , reminding him that the release at the end of the week still had to be met .
The deadline was n't an issue .
Barry was already off , thinking through the design in his head .
Over the next two days he developed a corpus analyzer to build the necessary statistical models , and created a generator to randomly string them together and output the " pronounceable IDs " .
It was a great success .
Everyone crowded around to see the server spitting out fake words like " enspattle " , " flargleblum " , " unclorifical " , and " macrodestic " .
Barry was ecstatic too , " This is great !
That client has been threatening to drop us because reading off those codes is slowing down their operations .
They 're our most well - known anchor client , so if they go , others will drop with them .
This is exactly what I we need to keep them .
Let 's demo it right away . "
The two of them drove up to the client 's offices in the city , and Barry proudly told them that he brought along the genius who came up with a way to make readable codes and increase their workers ' productivity .
Barry opened up a browser to the demo word generator page and clicked " New random word " .
" garglepussy " immediately popped up on the screen .
After a silent five seconds while the client stared in horror , Barry said " Well , it is random after all .
Brian , you can filter that , right ? "
" Sure , I 'll put a bad - word list together , " Brian said , groaning that he had n't thought of it before .
They ran through it a few more times , getting nice normal - sounding words like " blutterful " , " trimbolid " , " anavastic " , and finally left the client happily and contented in their offices .
During the drive back , Barry said , " I 've been thinking about it and it's too dangerous to just have a bad - word filter .
We 'll never be able to think up every possible offensive - sounding combination .
Can you make them sound like a foreign language instead of English ? "
It was a good idea — he already had a corpus analyzer and could plug in just about any text he felt like .
" Sure , I 'll show you some samples this afternoon , " Brian told him .
Brian spent the next few hours running the corpus on just about any foreign text he could find .
He plugged in " Lorem ipsum dolor " to get some fake Latin , the German libretto of Die Zauberflöte , some Balzac novels cribbed off of the French Gutenberg Project , the text from some Italian airplane manufacturer 's web site , and Don Quijote .
Barry stopped by and they tried the samples out , one by one .
Latin : " Everybody pronounces it wrong , differently . "
Hindi : " Too many weird vowels , and it makes me want to slip into an Apu accent . "
German : " All those consonants and throaty sounds are too hard . "
French : " Are you kidding ?
Most of the letters at the end of words are silent . "
Italian : " Better , but it look me two years to learn to say ' gnocchi ' right . "
Spanish : " Easy vowels , simple sounds , best yet !
But some of their staff are Hispanic . "
They sat there for a few minutes trying to think of something else when Barry cried out , " I 've got it ! "
And ran out of the room .
He came back with a Japanese study book .
" I 'm planning to expand overseas after this release , and bought this to study since everything is written in the English alphabet .
It 's perfect — there are simple vowels , only a few consonants , and no funny sounds to trip you up .
Even if people pronounce a little differently it 's still easy to figure out .
And nobody knows what it means so it can't be offensive ! "
The next day , one day before release , Brian had finished typing in page after page of meaningless Japanese and they were off once more to demo to the client .
Barry carefully clicked " New random word . "
" koremachiko " , " sabashimasu " , " tobetokaga " , " mitsukaremo " .
The client carefully read each example , and after a few minutes leaned back , chuckling , " That 's perfect , Barry .
Anyone can read these , and no chance of offense .
Thanks for doing this for us , we 're onboard for the launch . "
Barry was ecstatic .
By the next morning , everyone in the office was in a great mood , too .
The launch had gone smoothly , and their realtime reporting showed all of website activity , ad serving , and commerce transactions ramping up .
Everything was working perfectly .
Everyone was in the middle of a celebratory all - hands wine & cheese party in the conference room when Barry got a call and stepped out of the room .
Several minutes later he came storming back into the room , waving an email he had printed out and yelling , " Brian , Brian , you useless screwup !
What the hell is wrong with you ?
How do you explain this ?
Read it , OUT LOUD ! "
He shoved the paper at Brian , who took it apprehensively .
" fukushita " , " kakashite " , " fukumihado " , " diefatsu " , " tokaduki " , and " fukusuka " , he read , collapsing inwardly and visibly shaking as he read down the list .
" They dropped our contract ! " Brian shrieked , " Half our revenue is gone !
You 've killed our company ! "
Brian protested that dropping the bad - word filter and using Japanese were both Barry 's idea , but he could see that this would do nothing to abate his fury .
The next day he asked for , and was happily granted a two week vacation which he used to start looking for a new job .
Five years later at an industry mixer , Brian exchanged cards with a developer and saw that he worked in Barry 's department at his old company .
He told him that he had worked there years before and was glad to see the company had recovered and was going strong .
" You worked there too ? " he asked , looking at Brian 's name tag .
He suddenly got a strange look on his face .
" Wait , are you that Brian , who first developed the business platform ? "
Cautiously , Brian replied in the affirmative .
He broke out into a huge smile .
" You 're famous .
You know , we 're still using it .
We call it The Automated Curse Generator . "
In 1996 , when you travelled through the mountains of Chiapas , Mexico , soldiers would get on the buses every half an hour or so to check on the passengers .
They 'd look at papers , search random bags and occasionally take people off for a chat .
Some did not get back on .
There was an ongoing guerra sucia in Chiapas .
Two years earlier , when the Zapatista armies had risen up out of the jungle , there had been hundreds of casualties in the ensuing conflict .
In the seven months I was there , several Zapatistas were killed in skirmishes .
Then came the massacre of Acteal , where 45 Zapatista supporters , mostly women and children , were murdered by unknown paramilitaries .
The mood was oppressive , skittery , explosive .
Many activists in this country are supporters of the Zapatistas ; they were an inspiration in the 1990s .
But even the most partisan of fans can understand why the Mexican government saw them as a serious threat .
They had trained an entire army in secret ; they had called for revolution ; they maintained an autonomous zone and moved around in that area with their guns and ammunition belts in clear view across their chests .
There is a huge difference between the Zapatistas and our climate activists - you only need a drop of common sense to see this .
Yet recently , border officials in the UK used the Terrorism
Act to get four environmental campaigners off coaches for questioning , in a manner that reminded me strongly of Mexico .
Chris Kitchen was one of the four , on their way to Copenhagen for a pre-conference planning meeting .
He was questioned for 30 minutes about his work , his education and his family .
The coach left without him and he was finally allowed to travel the next day .
Can these climate activists seriously be suspected of terrorism ?
How have we come so far from any kind of sense about what constitutes a genuine and serious threat to national security ?
Much has been written about the vast amount of terrorism legislation that Labour has introduced , but you may not know that Blair 's government deliberately rewrote the definition of terrorism so that animal rights and environmental activists could be included : " Acts of serious violence against people and property have undoubtedly been committed in the UK by these domestic groups , " said a Home Office consultation paper on the new law .
" There is also the possibility that new groups espousing different causes will be set up and adopt violent methods to impose their will on the rest of society . "
OK , we can get our heads round that .
But does anyone seriously believe that Climate Camp or Climate Justice Action - the group that Chris Kitchen was going out to meet - plan to use violent methods ?
This particular bunch of activists are wedded to non-violence : the idea that they would plan to hurt anyone deliberately is nonsensical .
These people have disabled toilets and fire exits at their camps , for God 's sake .
The problem is that the terrorism legislation has been written so incredibly broadly that it is dependent on police and the courts using a lot of common sense .
I have an uneasy feeling that there is less and less of that around .

This week a statue will be dedicated in dowtown Pittsburgh in honor of Fred Rogers .
The bronze sculpture — 10 feet , 10 inches in height and weighing more than 7,000 pounds — was sculpted by Robert Berks and will be unveiled November 5th .
In addition , WQED , the PBS station in Pittsburgh that was the home of Mister Rogers ’ Neighborhood , is renaming its studio after the kiddie show host .
He was on the air at PBS for 40 years successfully entertaining children with no violence , little commercialism , and almost no special effects .
Think about it .
NEW YORK -- You 've seen how TV covers the immediate aftermath of a disaster .
A tornado or earthquake or whatever has just ripped through a community .
Rubble and bodies lie scattered .
Asked to comment , stunned survivors weep and confirm the obvious -- they 've lost everything .
Then the reporter 's wrap - up : " Now , the rebuilding begins .
Back to you , Bob . "
The impulse to clean up and move on after taking a hit is universal .
But the underlying assumption -- that everything will eventually be OK again -- is uniquely American .
Taking office four months into the economic collapse , President Obama played to our belief that gumption cures everything , saying in his inaugural address : " Starting today , we must pick ourselves up , dust ourselves off , and begin again the work of remaking America . "
They do n't roll that way in Yugoslavia , where Serbs still seethe over a battle fought in 1389 .
Nor in the Middle East , where displaced Palestinians hold on to deeds and house keys for homes they lost 60 years ago .
People nurse resentments .
They long for revenge .
Here in the United States , the overall unemployment rate is over 20 percent and rising .
Corporations collected trillions of dollars in government bailouts , while ordinary workers got nothing .
Millions of people are losing their homes to foreclosure , yet the president has yet to lift a finger to help them .
Meanwhile , companies like Goldman Sachs are paying their officers obscene bonuses .
How come there 's no social unrest ?
Where 's the outrage ?
As the little girl in the " Addams Family " movie said : " Wait . "
In the meantime , Americans ' tolerance for getting fired and becoming homeless owes everything to that trope : " Now , the rebuilding begins . "
Lost your job ?
Hit Monster.com and cut - and - paste your résumé until your index finger turns sore .
Lost your house to foreclosure ?
Your brother - in - law 's couch will see you through .
And those CEOs who profited from your misery ?
Admit it -- you 're jealous .
You'd do the same if you were in their position .
But there 's a rub .
A big rub .
After a layoff , the rebuilding does n't begin .
" On average , most workers do not recover their old annual earnings " after being laid off , Till von Wachter , a Columbia University economist , tells The New York Times .
Wachter studied the income histories of workers who lost their jobs a quarter - century ago , during the Reagan recession of 1981 - 1985 .
The results were startling .
" Even 15 to 20 years later , most on average had not returned to their old wage levels , " he found .
The former layoff victims now earn 15 to 20 percent less than comparable workers who had not gotten canned .
" One of the main reasons for the [ lower pay ] , according to economists , is that workers who endure a layoff are more likely to be laid off again , " reports the Times .
" What tends to happen is the worker has to start over with a new employer , sometimes in a new industry , " explains UC Davis economics professor Ann Huff Stevens .
" You 're at the bottom of the totem pole again . "
Many of the people Wachter studied " had been forced to drastically change their lifestyles to cope with lower incomes .
Several have struggled with long bouts of unemployment .
Some were laid off several times .
Many have been forced to lean heavily on spouses ' incomes . "
Layoff victims followed the rules .
But it did n't do any good .
During the 1980s and 1990s the rich got richer , the poor got poorer , and the middle class withered away .
Now , among industrialized nations , only Russia has a smaller middle class and higher poverty rate than the United States .
Maybe the rest of the world has it right .
If Americans began holding grudges against the corporate chiefs and politicians who exploit their labor and rip them off , they would n't have to silently absorb losing their jobs so some rich executive can give himself another raise .
There is a better way : ban layoffs .
In France , on the other hand , almost every worker receives a written employment contract .
Almost all French employment contracts are for an indefinite term .
You can keep your job as long as you --- not your boss -- feel like it .
Firing an employee in France is hard .
" Dismissals are subject to stringent , and often bureaucratic , procedural statutory constraints , " says the Parisian law firm Triplet & Associés .
" Redundancies , or layoffs on economic grounds , are subject to separate and complex procedural and substantive constraints particularly in the case of multiple dismissals ...
It is extremely easy and at virtually no cost for an employee to start litigation against his ( ex ) employer before separate Labor Courts ...
It is rare that the plaintiff be other than an employee and just as rare that claims be dismissed with no award whatsoever being made against the employer . "
French workers do n't have to dig out of nearly as many layoffs .
When they do , they 're entitled to generous severance packages .
Do n't these pro-worker protections allow slackers to keep their jobs ?
Do n't they hurt the economy ?
Nope .
According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , hourly productivity is higher in France than in the United States .
It 's time to eliminate the barbaric wage slavery of " at will " employment .
Only then can the rebuilding -- of the American middle class -- truly begin .

How many protesters were in attendance at Republican congresswoman Michelle Bachmann ’s tea party healthcare protest ?
“ I climbed the Capitol steps just before the event started so that I could get a good view of the whole crowd , ” the Washington Post ’s onetime White House reporter and columnist Dana Milbank wrote Friday .
“ I divided it into sections and counted .
That ’s where I came up with 5,000 .
It ’s possible more came after I did my count , but nothing near 10,000 . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
A few dozen Republican House members attended , aimed at stirring up a crowd against Democrats ’ healthcare reform bill .
Fox News ’ Sean Hannity interviewed Bachmann following the event .
“ 20,000 + people showed up , ” Hannity said .
“ Were you as surprised as I was ? ”
Bachmann smiled and replied .
After showing the clip , Stewart said : “ Anywhere between 20 and 40,000 people .
Or , as the Washington Post put it , 10,000 . ”
Stewart then showed two clips Fox News employed to underscore the size of the event .
He pointed out that the clips appeared to have been from two entirely different protests .
“ I ’m sorry , can we get back again , ” Stewart remarked .
“ That was weird .
Because when that clip started , it was a clear fall day in Washington , D.C.
Not a cloud in the sky , the leaves have changed .

“ All of a sudden , the trees turn green again , and it ’s cloudy , and it looks like thousands and thousands of more people arrived , ” he continued .
“ If I did n’t know any better , I would think they just put two different days together and acted like they did n’t . ”
The bogus footage , Stewart found , actually came from a Sept. 12 protest two months ago , and was used on Fox News ’ Glenn Beck program two months ago .
This video is from Comedy Central ’s The Daily Show , broadcast Nov. 10 , 2009 .
A couple of weeks ago , we told you about new Resident Evil 5 content coming as a new Japanese version of the game called RE5 Alternative Edition .
We asked you guys to tell us how you wanted to get your mitts on the content and gave you the option to vote for either digital download or a new boxed product .
We let the poll run for a couple weeks and then snagged a bunch of your comments from the original blog posting as well as from threads in the forums and presented it all to the RE5 team in Osaka .
As of this morning , we had close to 1500 people vote for DLC and close to 900 vote for a new physical product .
In addition , we had over 300 comments on the blog posting , which is amazing to all of us here at Capcom .
And here ’s an example of Capcom Unity in action : based on your feedback , in North American , European and Australia territories , Capcom will be making the new RE5 content for both Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 available as downloadable content .
You will not be asked to purchase a new copy of the game just to get at the new stuff , just make sure to hold on to your RE5 disc and you ’ll be ready to roll in Spring 2010 when we make available new Resident Evil adventures ( and some other things we have n’t told you about yet ) for you .
Keep that in mind when thinking about selling RE5 back or handing it off to a friend ;)
I 'll be honest : we had a strong feeling going in that most folks were going to be ticking the box for digital delivery .
Seeing as how we were asking you ONLINE to tell us if you would like to nab new game content via the internet , we thought we may have been skewing the results a bit .
What surprised us , however , was just how many of you ended up voting for a new physical package .
We ’re still trying to wrap our heads around this strongly stated position from a vocal range of the community , but we 've definitely heard you guys loud and clear as well .
Thanks to all of you as part of Team Unity in helping us reach this decision !
Ninety - five Colombian farmers are suing the oil company BP in the high court in London for allegedly causing serious damage to their land , crops and animals .
In the first case of its kind , the farmers are claiming that BP Exploration Company ( Colombia ) Ltd , which joined forces with Colombia 's national oil company and four foreign multinational corporations in a consortium to construct the 450 - mile ( 720 km )
Ocensa pipeline , caused landslides and damage to soil and groundwater , causing crops to fail , livestock to perish , contaminating water supplies and making fish ponds unsustainable .
The farmers are claiming damages against BP for breach of contract and negligence .
If the court accepts the evidence of environmental damage caused by the project it could open the way for similar claims by other communities in developing countries who say they have been adversely affected by oil pipelines .
In 1988 and 1992 BP discovered two oilfields in Colombia and in 1995 it began construction of a pipeline to transport crude oil to an exportation terminal 515 miles away .
The pipeline crossed 192 villages and most of the land was owned by small - scale peasant farmers .
It has a capacity to transport 620,000 barrels of crude oil a day .
According to the claim lodged by the farmers ' lawyers , an environmental impact assessment conducted by BP prior to construction of the pipeline acknowledged significant and widespread risks of damage to the land , but the farmers , most of them illiterate , were not informed of these risks .
BP promised compensation to the farmers for damage that might occur but said there would be no long - term environmental damage .
" BP , part of one of the largest oil companies in the world with world - class expertise , should have known the possible effects , " the lawyers state .
Pedro Florez , one of the farmers suing BP , said : " Now that my land has been destroyed I realise that the money I was paid for the pipeline to be built across my farm was a mere pittance and that BP took advantage of my inability to read and write and my lack of understanding of technical language .
I can no longer keep the same number of animals or crops , or fish in the local lake , because of the poor quality of the water .
It is now very hard to survive on the income that the farm produces . "
The farmers claim that during construction of the pipeline natural vegetation that protected the soil from sun , wind and rain was removed and replaced with vegetation that did not protect the soil .
They say there has been significant soil erosion and that sediment flowing towards lower ground has altered the land and aquatic ecosystem , silting up water sources including reservoirs .
Because the land was not stabilised after construction of the pipeline it is susceptible to landslides .
" The region has been profoundly and adversely affected causing many farms to close or drastically reduce production and causing some farmers to leave the land , " the court documents state .
The farmers say BP has failed to compensate them for all of the damage caused to their farms , including the long - term damage , failed to ensure an adequate water supply for farming and domestic use and failed to provide equitable compensation for the damage caused .
The company is negligent and in breach of a duty of care to the farmers , they conclude .
A group of Colombian farmers previously reached an out - of - court settlement with BP for alleged environmental damage caused by the pipeline .
BP did not admit liability in this settlement and avoided a costly and potentially embarrassing court case in London .
Now the company has decided to change tack and fight the farmers ' claims in court .
It declined to comment on the reasons for this .
BP denies that it acted negligently and that the construction of the pipeline has caused long - term damage to the farmers ' property .
It argues that the main cause of soil erosion and sedimentation is the removal of forests by farmers for cattle grazing .
The farmers ' solicitors have lodged further papers in court disputing BP 's defence .
No date has yet been set for the court hearing .
The area where the pipeline was laid – from the Cusiana - Cupiagua oilfields , in the region of Casanare , to the port of Covenas – has been plagued by paramilitary activity .
Farmers say they have experienced harassment and intimidation meted out by Colombian paramilitaries employed by the government to guard the pipeline .
Colombian lawyers who tried to help the farmers claimed they faced intimidation by local paramilitary groups .
Marta Hinestroza , one of the farmers ' lawyers , fled Colombia for Britain when she discovered that her name was on a paramilitary hit list .
In November 2002 the UK government granted her asylum on the basis of the risks she faced because of her work in the area .
Paul Dowling , of Leigh Day & Co , a solicitor for the farmers , said : " The construction of this pipeline has destroyed the livelihoods of many poor families living in an often violent area of Colombia .
Unfortunately BP has forced them into a position where they have had to issue legal proceedings in a distant country to seek fair compensation for the hardship they have suffered .
They intend to fight for as long as it takes to ensure that justice is done . "
A BP spokesman said that as the legal action was ongoing , the company would not comment on the case beyond the defence lodged in the high court .

Since the smoking ban in Kenya , people can only smoke in special zones
At Jeevanjee gardens in Nairobi , smokers gather during their lunch hour to read , chat and light up .
It is one of the few zones in the Kenyan capital where people can smoke in public , since the ban on smoking in public came into effect in 2007 .
As he takes a puff , one of the young men describes his habit .
" I 've been smoking for 40 years but I hate it , " he says .
" I have often tried to give up by throwing cigarettes into the toilet , but I have not succeeded in stopping smoking . "
He says he smokes about 40 a day , but would smoke more if he had more money .
" It is expensive for me so I sometimes go without lunch . "
According to some researchers , tobacco addiction is rapidly increasing in Africa .
Dr Twalib Ngoma , president of the African Organisation for Research and Training in Cancer ( AORTIC ) , says that Africa is on the brink of a smoking epidemic .
FROM BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from BBC World Service " Africa is in the area of the pre-epidemic and so we should prevent the epidemic , " he told the BBC World Service .
" We should not wait until there is an epidemic and then work on it .
We should prevent the epidemic . "
Tobacco - related cancer was one of the key topics discussed at a recent international cancer conference in Tanzania .
One of the reports presented there warns that African nations are set to undergo the highest increase in the rate of tobacco use among developing countries .
The report , released jointly by the American Cancer Society and the Global Smokefree Partnership , says that more than half of African countries will double tobacco use within 12 years if current trends continue .
But the authors say that there is still time to do something about it .
' Preventing the epidemic ' " For the first time in history , we have the tools in hand to prevent a pandemic , " says Dr Otis W Brawley , chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society .
" Smoke - free public places are one example of a low - cost and extremely effective intervention that must be implemented now to protect health . "
As well as Kenya , Niger also recently introduced a smoking ban in public places .
Egypt is unlikely to introduce a smoking ban in public places Mauritius also recently passed a law that the American Cancer Society says is close to meeting the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control ( FCTC ) standards , ranking the laws among the most robust anti-smoking measures in the world .
But the report says that many other countries have not taken any action .
For some countries , introducing a smoking ban would face too much popular opposition .
While in Egypt a fatwa , or Islamic ruling , gives wives the right to divorce their smoking husbands if the smoke affects their health , there are no laws about smoking in public places yet .
Since around half of the population indulge in cigarettes or water - pipes , such a measure would prove extremely unpopular .
' They lobby and lobby '
Dr Ngoma says that while many governments in Africa have signed up to legislation on tobacco , it is difficult to enforce those laws .
" We have legislation in Tanzania ... but enforcement of that legislation is not easy .
Tobacco companies are all too powerful .
They lobby and lobby and lobby . "
If a consumer is addicted to tobacco , then it is possible to put prices up and they will go without lunch
Adam Spielman
Tobacco industry analyst
He also blames advertisers who he says are hooking in Africa 's younger generations .
" Tobacco companies are targeting poor , developing countries in Africa . "
" If you drive from the airports to most towns you will see a lot of billboards promoting tobacco , saying that if you smoke you are going to be successful . "
The American Cancer Society agrees , saying that the tobacco industry in Africa tries to hold back legislation .
It says the companies try to convince African governments that tobacco is important to economic activity and that raising taxes on cigarettes and implementing smoke - free laws will result in revenue and job - losses .
The organisation says that in Kenya , for example , the tobacco industry has issued a legal challenge to a strong smoke - free law passed by the parliament .
And in Zambia , they say that British American Tobacco has helped to dilute proposals for a smoke - free law .
But British American Tobacco say that this accusation does not reflect reality .
They say that while they were consulted on the draft bill in Zambia last year , the bill has never been finalised .
They add that they support tobacco regulations in the countries they do business in as they recognise that tobacco consumption poses real risks to health .
Their policy on public place smoking is that they support the creation of smoke - free areas but that a ban on all indoor smoking in work and public places goes too far .
Raising prices
So just how important is the African market to tobacco companies ?
Adam Spielman , a tobacco industry analyst with Citigroup , says that the African market forms around 10 % or less of the profits of the biggest companies , but that this area is growing .
While he says that there are looser advertising restrictions on the continent , he says tobacco companies are not as concerned with growing volume , as long as they can put their prices up .
" If a consumer is addicted to tobacco , then it is possible to put prices up and they will go without lunch . "
But Mr Spielman says that he expects that over time , increasing advertising restrictions and bigger health warnings will come into place in African countries .
But in the meantime , as long as there are smokers who will sacrifice lunch for a packet of cigarettes , there will always be consumers .

From a media release :
Leaving the comforts of the Trailer Park for the chaos of Port Cockerton
Showcase commissions The Drunk and on Drugs Happy Funtime Hour
New series from the stars of Trailer Park Boys
What do you get when you pair three former Trailer Park Boys , guitarist Alex Lifeson from RUSH and some “ magic ” berries ?
You get the outrageous new Showcase series The Drunk and on Drugs Happy Funtime Hour ( working title ! ) .
As announced exclusively on showcase .ca this morning , the half - hour comedy series has been greenlit for six episodes that will air on Showcase in 2010 .
The Drunk and on Drugs Happy Funtime Hour is a genre - breaking and highly innovative mix of narrative and sketch comedy that builds on the success of Trailer Park Boys and follows in the proud tradition of such comedy classics as Monty Python ’s Flying Circus and the more recent British import The League of Gentlemen .
Transformed through innovative costumes and make up , Mike Smith , Robb Wells and JP Tremblay play many of the quirky characters in the series .
The Drunk and On Drugs Happy Funtime Hour opens as the three boys ‘ wake up ’ after shooting has wrapped on their new TV series – a children ’s show filmed in the sleepy town of Port Cockerton called The Happy Funtime Hour .
Production on the series was going smoothly until Alex Lifeson , hired to play a German scientist who teaches children about nutrition , goes too far and assumes the personality of his character after synthesizing a powerful and addictive hallucinogen from local berries .
Chaos ensues as the cast unknowingly ingests the drug and begin to believe they really are the characters they are portraying on the show – including deranged pirates , playboys from a 1980 ’s television show and a group of not -very - super , superheroes .
As the series unfolds , Robb , Mike and JP must deal with the bizarre cast of hallucinating children ’s show characters , a dysfunctional crime family that runs the town , and a dangerous cult , all while trying to piece together what has happened to them and get out of Port Cockerton alive .
“ Trailer Park Boys ’ fans have been clamoring to find out what Robb , Mike and JP will do next and we are delighted to be able to say that they are once again teaming up with Showcase , ” said Christine Shipton , Senior Vice President , Drama and Factual Content , Canwest .
“ Their creativity and colourful imaginations will make this one of the most dynamic and entertaining series to hit Canadian airwaves . ”
“ When we first came up with the idea for the show we knew that we could n’t really do this with any channel but Showcase , ” said Mike Smith .
“ The series is definitely a departure from our previous work , but with bold characters and a storyline that pushes the envelope Drunk and on Drugs still has a huge dose of our trademark humour that I think our fans expect from us , ” adds Robb Wells .
“ I think the new series will appeal to a very broad audience .
It ’s definitely not like anything that ’s ever been on Canadian television before , ” said JP Tremblay .
The Drunk and on Drugs Happy Funtime Hour is written by Mike Smith , Robb Wells and JP Tremblay .
They also serve as Executive Producers on the series alongside Louis Thomas .
Ron Murphy has been tapped as Director and Producer is Paul Pope .
The series is produced by Happy Funtime Productions 2007 Incorporated in association with Showcase and The Canadian Television Fund .
Greenpeace has harped on electronics companies — Apple in particular — to " clean up " their act by publishing its annual Guide to Greener Electronics .
Apple , however , has made great strides to improve the environmental impact of its products and operations over the last decade .
This is despite constantly getting low ratings on " green " issues based mostly on the way Apple reports information about greenhouse gas emissions or the lack of published goals for certain environmental initiatives .
The company has long argued that actions speak much louder than words , though , and it has now published data that firmly supports this contention .
To give an idea of how Apple seems to be unable to earn any cred for its green efforts , consider the most recent rankings by Greenpeace .
All of Apple 's computers earn an EPEAT gold rating , meet or exceed all Energy Star requirements , have phased out nearly all use of PVC , BFRs , and have made efforts to eliminate mercury , arsenic , and other harmful chemicals from its entire product line .
That did n't stop the company from earning 4.7 points on a 10 point scale , mainly because the company did n't report certain details in the format that Greenpeace wanted , did n't give specific information about renewable energy use , and did n't state specific goals about the reduction of GHG emissions .
Despite Greenpeace lauding the company 's efforts to make its products more green , Apple actually fell back one place among the companies that Greenpeace tracks , while other manufacturers that offer less " green " products but make certain promises to make changes in the future earn higher rankings .
Others have put Apple way behind other companies as well .
For instance , Newsweek recently published a ranking of the " Greenest Big Companies In America . "
It put Apple in 133rd place , well behind the Marathon Oil at 100 , while HP and Dell were ranked number one and two respectively .
The disparity seems to defy all logic and common sense .
This is why Apple has long sought to reframe the issue as one of concrete action versus published promises — which can be , and are , easily broken .
Apple 's latest data shows that the efforts Apple has made to improve its products , making them more environmentally friendly and more energy efficient , are actually paying off more than initiatives to reduce greenhouse emissions at its offices , for instance .
" A lot of companies publish how green their building is , but it does n't matter if you 're shipping millions of power - hungry products with toxic chemicals in them , " CEO Steve Jobs told BusinessWeek in an interview .
" It 's like asking a cigarette company how green their office is . "
A comparison of Apple 's overall CO 2 emissions by source .
Product use over its projected lifetime accounts for the vast majority of those emissions .
Apple has now made a comprehensive , detailed analysis of carbon emissions for the entire life cycle of each of its products .
While information is available for each individual product in the comprehensive " Environmental Reports , " an aggregate of the data shows that the vast majority of carbon emissions come from manufacture and use of its products .
Manufacturing , including everything from the extractions of raw materials up to final product assembly , accounts for 38 percent of Apple 's carbon emissions , while use of its products over a standard lifetime — 4 years for a Mac or 3 years for an iPod or iPhone — accounts for a whopping 53 percent of the carbon emissions .
Transportation , maintaining it facilities , and recycling account for just 9 percent , with facilities alone responsible for just 3 percent of the company 's 10.2 million metric tons of yearly carbon emissions .
That does n't mean Apple is n't making improvements in facilities energy use .
By the end of this year , the company will run its Cork , Ireland , and Elk Grove , California operations completely on renewable energy sources .
Its Austin , TX offices use renewable energy as well .
The company also provides incentives to use public transportation instead of driving in to work , including running biodeisel - fuled busses that transport as many as 600 employees per day .
What 's more , Apple continues to " green " its business in several other areas .
The company offers recycling in 95 percent of the countries it does business in , achieving a 42 percent recycling rate and aiming for an industry - leading 50 percent rate by 2010 .
Apple also continues to reduce the energy consumption of its products , reduce the materials used to make them , and reduce the amount of packaging they require .
And the company continues to reduce the amount of toxic substances used in its products .
" Not only is every Mac , iPod , and iPhone free of PVC and BFRs , we are also qualifying thousands of components to be free of elemental bromine and chlorine , putting us years ahead of anyone in the industry , " reads Apple 's website .
" In addition , all MacBook Pro models feature displays with mercury - free backlighting and arsenic - free glass . "
The company also requires its manufacturing partners to maintain " environmentally responsible manufacturing processes . "
Jobs admitted to BusinessWeek that criticism from Greenpeace and other groups encouraged Apple to improve its environmental initiatives , but says he wo n't start publishing certain specific , long - term goals just to satisfy those critics .
Instead , Apple will continue to publish comprehensive data that shows the efforts and improvements Apple is making .
Paul Dickinson , president of the Carbon Disclosure Project , applauded Apple 's effort to make a more sensible , comprehensive measurement of its environmental impact .
" Its approach is legitimate , and to be encouraged , " he said .
It may not gain the company any points with Greenpeace , but it sure seems like Apple is ahead of its competition in making real change when it comes to its impact on the environment .
ARTIST STATEMENT
" I paint to communicate to others how I see - not what I see .
The natural and persistant need to communicate , to relate , to understand and be understood by others is what draws me to paint the figure .
My expressive figurations are the allegorical road map of my inner dialogue with real and invented subjects .
My process follows a pattern of repeated revision , elimination , and reconstruction that allows for accidental self - discovery .
As with many painters , I have developed a set of personal rules for working with my materials that lend structure to my practice .
I begin with only single pigment acrylics and from there , mix all of my own colors ; nothing is allowed to go straight from the tube onto my surface .
When working on canvas I begin with putty - like " heavy body " paint .
I adjust the consistency and luminosity of the paint with as much consideration as I lend to the color , and by the time that the paint reaches the canvas it is entirely my own .
The process of preparing and laying out my materials serves as a period of meditation prior to the beginning of my paintings .
This structured ritual helps me to get out of my own way .
It is a welcomed period of cerebral silence that assists me in keeping any desire for a particular outcome at bay .
I strive to maintain a loose framework of intention guided by personally evolving questions . "

The Conservatives were accused by the French government tonight of " castrating " Britain 's position within the EU by adopting an " autistic " approach that would take Britain off the radar .
Speaking to the Guardian , Pierre Lellouche , France 's Europe minister , described as " pathetic " the Tories ' EU plans announced today , warning they would not succeed " for a minute " .
Giving vent to frustration across the EU , which has so far only been expressed in private , Lellouche – who said he was reflecting Nicolas Sarkozy 's " sadness and regret " – accused William Hague , the shadow foreign secretary , of a " bizarre autism " in their discussions .
He said : " They have one line and they just repeat one line .
It is a very bizarre sense of autism . "
Lellouche , one of the most Anglophile members of Sarkozy 's government , made his remarkable intervention after David Cameron outlined a fresh Tory approach to the EU in the wake of the full ratification of the Lisbon treaty .
A future Conservative government would seek to strengthen British sovereignty and repatriate a series of powers over social and employment legislation , the Tory leader said .
Cameron said he was not seeking an immediate " bust - up " with the EU , and would allow the repatriation of powers negotiations to last as long as five years .
But that position was not enough for the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan , who quit his role as the party 's legal affairs spokesman in Europe , saying he intended to fight for referendums to enable Britain to become " self - governing " .
France 's centre - right government condemned Cameron 's plans , saying that they would marginalise Britain within the EU .
Abandoning all diplomatic niceties , Lellouche said : " It 's pathetic .
It 's just very sad to see Britain , so important in Europe , just cutting itself out from the rest and disappearing from the radar map ….
This is a culture of opposition …
It is the result of a long period of opposition .
I know they will come back , but I hope the trip will be short . "
He said Cameron 's approach was in line with the Tories ' decision to abandon the main centre - right EPP grouping in the European parliament , of which Sarkozy 's UMP party is a member .
" They are doing what they have done in the European parliament .
They have essentially castrated your UK influence in the European parliament , " he said .
Lellouche said he has told Hague personally that his position was a " waste of time for all of us " .
" I have told William Hague : go away for two to three years , in your political economic situation you 're going to be all by your self and you 'll come back .
Go ahead and do it .
That is my message to them …
You want to be marginalised ?
Well , you go for it .
But it 's a waste of time for all of us , " the French minister said .
Lellouche made clear the Tories had no hope of securing support for their plans .
" It 's not going to happen for a minute .
Nobody is going to indulge in rewriting [ treaties for ] many , many years .
Nobody is going to play with the institutions again .
It 's going to be take it or leave it and they should be honest and say that , " he said .
" It is a time of tumultuous waters all around us .
Wars , terrorism , proliferation , Afghanistan , energy with Russia , massive immigration , economic crisis .
It is time when the destiny of Europe is being defined – whether or not we will exist as a third of the world 's GDP capable of fighting it out on climate , on trade , on every … issue on the surface of the Earth .
" We need to be united , otherwise we will be wiped out and marginalised .
None of us can do it alone .
Whether you 're big or small , the lesson is the same .
And [ Britain 's ] risk is one of marginalisation .
Irrelevance . "
He explained : " Finally we have institutional package , but it took 15 years of looking at our navel and getting everybody bored to death with sterile debate " .
In a sign of France 's determination to resist the Tory plans to opt out of key EU legislation , Lellouche warned the French would attempt to reduce Britain 's EU budget rebate which will be up for negotiation during the next parliament .
He pointed out that France is a net EU contributor to the tune of € 5bn ( £ 4.5 bn ) , unlike Britain which receives a rebate .
" If we get a government that is ferociously anti European that will vote down this kind of legislation then I think the relationship is going to be very difficult .
As we enter the next phase one of the issues we have to discuss midterm is of course finances .
France is a net contributor to the tune of € 5bn a year , of which € 1.5 bn is the same as British rebate .
That should tell you quite a bit huh ? " he said .
Cameron will be angered by the attack , and what it implies for Tory relations with the rest of Europe although in the short term he will be more concerned to ensure his strategy of abandoning a referendum on the Lisbon treaty does not provoke cries of betrayal on his backbenches .
Hague reacted to the French criticism by insisting that Lellouche 's comments did not represent the true reception of the Tories ' plans in Europe .
" That is not how we are seen across Europe , " he told BBC2's Newsnight , adding his party had established good relations with Sarkozy 's party .
" I do n't think you will find that 's representative of the reaction in Paris or other European capitals , " he added .
After the first ArtsBeat post on the South Park controversy appeared today , a commenter using the identifier “ RW , ” wrote , “ Did n’t ‘ queer ’ used to be a derogatory name for homosexuals – and yet today many gay groups embrace the term . ”
RW is correct .
Here ’s a Times article from 1991 on efforts at that time to take the sting out of that slur .
If you ’ve been following the conversation today , a lot of it will sound familiar .
Savage Love Poor Man's Bidet
Perhaps I Should n't Show Our Friend Favor
Hundreds of big-ass Internet companies have gone under in the last two years , including stars like Pets.com , Kozmo.com , eToys.com , Homegrocer.com .
So I must say I was shocked to find that MyBladder.com -- that 's right , MyBladder .com -- is still open for business .
MyBladder.com is " a unique on - line community dedicated to encouraging people with bladder control problems to seek help rather than suffer in silence . "
I 'll say it 's unique .
According to the site , 12 million American adults have bladder control problems .
Does that make adult bed - wetting a more common problem than one would imagine ?
That depends , I guess , on how many bed wetters the average person imagines there are , assuming , of course , that the average person spends much if any time at all contemplating the numbers of bed wetters .
Going out on a limb , I would guess that the number of people out there wetting beds is significantly higher than the number of people out there contemplating the number of people wetting beds .
I know that prior to receiving your letter , PISSOFF , I had n't wasted any time imagining bed wetters .
( My imagination is wholly devoted to images of Brad Pitt coming all over Ashton Kutcher 's face . )
But you 're dating a bed wetter , so you do n't have much choice but to think about it .
Would it be morally shallow not to sleep with the woman again ?
Yes , I think so .
You liked this woman well enough to sleep with her before you found out she had a medical problem ; if you drop her cold now you 'll not only contribute to her feelings of shame ( something bed wetters suffer from , according to MyBladder.com ) , but you 'll wrack up some serious bad karma .
Drop this woman for wetting the bed and God will give you bladder control problems of your own .
So instead of dumping this woman , I 'd urge you to try to help her .
According to MyBladder.com ( how I love typing that ! ) , only one in five people with bladder control problems seeks medical help .
But of those who do , " 80 % can be cured or can achieve substantial improvement . "
Before you can help her , though , you 're going to have to broach the subject .
She was no doubt embarrassed when she wet your bed , but saying nothing was n't necessarily the most sensitive thing you could do .
A truly sensitive guy would spend some time on MyBladder.com ( before it goes tits up ) , learn about bladder control problems and treatments , and then have a heart - to - heart with the leaky miss .
If she denies she has a problem , or refuses to get help , you can either dump her or invest in plastic sheets .
When guys poop , do they hold their balls out of the way ?
I 've asked all my friends but no one knows and they do n't want to ask their boyfriends .
Wonder Woman
I shared your letter with a straight male friend .
He read it , looked hurt , and then asked , " Why would a woman think a man 's scrotum was in the way during a poop ? "
We pondered this for a moment -- like bed - wetting , this was n't a subject I 'd previously given much thought to -- and then I slapped my forehead .
Of course !
The only time a woman sees a man 's scrotum up close is when she 's giving him a blowjob .
Since men typically receive blowjobs lying flat on their backs , she 's probably seen one or two larger scrotums draped over a man 's butthole .
Having seen scrotums hanging down toward buttholes , she assumes that a man who does n't hold his balls up gets shit all over his balls .
Most men want women to kiss and lick their balls , which is n't something you want to do if men have dirty balls .
But a man does n't take a dump lying flat on his back , WW , he takes a dump sitting upright on the can .
His balls hang straight down as he takes a dump , dangling over the toilet water at the front of the toilet bowl , far from his butthole , which is toward the rear of the toilet bowl .
And when people , male or female , sit upright , our assholes point away from our bodies , which is why turds hit the back of the toilet , not the front or center .
There 's no need for him to hold them out of the way .
They are out of the way already .
Does this mean all men's balls are clean after taking a dump ?
Not necessarily .
What should concern you is n't feces coming into contact with scrotums , but the horror of splashback .
Sometimes a large piece of crap will hit the water with such force that it has a cannonball effect , sending a small plume of water , germs , and god - only - knows - what up toward his ass cheeks , balls , and , most horrifying of all , directly onto his exposed , vulnerable asshole .
I assume this happens to women as well .
My friend Brad calls it the " poor man 's bidet . "
So when a man asks you to take his balls in your mouth ( sometimes known as teabagging ) , do n't worry about poop on his balls , which would be stinky and obvious .
Instead , worry about splashback residue , which is not quite as stinky , completely invisible , and almost as revolting .
Since splashback residue is undetectable , it 's not unreasonable to ask a man to shower off before you get it on .
Dan , the letter from the woman whose sister was alarmed by her father 's passion for porn was a heartbreaker .
Many women seem to feel that a progression from passive voyeur to criminal molester is just a slippery slope for all men .
Most men have fail - safe circuit - breakers in their hearts and souls that draw huge distinctions between model vs. sister , actress vs. daughter , and private fantasy vs. flesh - and - blood niece .
And why is it that people who would never think of rifling through a friend 's or relative 's pockets , closet , or desk drawers seem to have no problem when it comes to rifling through their computer ?
Sad For Dad & Private Eyes
People who do n't want anyone else to read their diaries are told not to leave them out where others can find them .
Why ?
Because diaries are irresistible reading material , and if you leave one in the open , you can't really blame someone for succumbing to temptation .
In a way , a computer is like a diary -- it stores little facts about us -- but it's also an appliance , like a dishwasher or a toaster , which everyone in the house feels they have a right to use .
If my dad left a list of the porn sites he visited tucked in the toaster , well , I 'd be tempted to read it -- would n't you ?
Hell , I could n't refrain from reading it .
Likewise , people who leave a list of the porn sites they 've visited on a computer are asking for trouble .
The solution ?
A house computer for general use and a laptop computer for personal use .

French scientists say it might be Europe 's best set of dinosaur tracks
French fossil hunters have discovered huge dinosaur footprints , said to be among the biggest in the world .
The footprints were made about 150 million years ago by sauropods - long - necked herbivores - in chalky sediment in the Jura plateau of eastern France .
The depressions are about 1.5 m ( 4.9 ft ) wide , corresponding to animals that were more than 25 m long and weighed about 30 tonnes .
French experts say the find at Plagne , near Switzerland , is " exceptional " .
" The tracks formed by the footprints extend over dozens , even hundreds , of metres , " the National Centre for Scientific Research ( CNRS ) said .
The 30 - tonne dinosaurs may have looked like this
" Further digs will be carried out in the coming years and they may reveal that the site at Plagne is one of the biggest of its kind in the world . "
The footprints , from the Upper Jurassic era , were found in April this year by a pair of amateur fossil hunters , but have only now been authenticated by scientists .
Another layer of sediment , now rock - hard , had preserved the footprints .
They were revealed when local tree - felling exposed the earth underneath , French media report .
The region was near a shallow , warm sea at the time the sauropods lived there .

Protests by Change.org , the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ( GLAAD ) and OutRage !
have forced PepsiCo to apologise , after it sponsored a concert by singer Beenie Man - who encourages the killing of lesbians and gay men .
At his Ugandan concert on Saturday 5 December , Beenie Man sang the song , , which includes a call to cut the throats of gay people .
Uganda is currently considering introducing the death penalty for " aggravated " homosexuality and for " serial ( gay ) offenders .
" Following the protests , Pepsi expressed regret over their sponsorship of Beenie Man .
In a statement to Change.org PepsiCo said : Peter Tatchell of London LGBT rights group OutRage !
said : Earlier , of OutRage ! wrote to PepsiCo : wrote Mr Allison .
Beenie Man has a long history of inciting the murder of LGBT people .
His hit tune , , instructs listeners to kill gay DJs and boasts that people would gladly go to jail for killing a queer :
In another song , , he sings : includes the lyrics : Beenie Man is also notorious for the track ,

OTTAWA–Would the conversation at 24 Sussex go something like this ?
" Eeeek .
Canadian news is on .
Quick .
Gimme that remote . "
" Oh c'mon Stephen , we just want to know what 's going on in the country .
Ca n't we just catch the top of the news ? "
" Not a chance .
I might be on it .
Put on Corner Gas . "
We do know Prime Minister Stephen Harper likes the Prairie sitcom because he did a cameo appearance on it .
And one assumes the Rick Mercer Report is a safe bet .
Did that cameo , too .
Certainly he likes TSN 's hockey broadcasts .
He 's gone on that network 's shows at least a couple of times .
So what to make of Harper 's declaration that he does n't watch Canadian news ?
This is what Harper told a Toronto business audience Wednesday :
" I watched the last several elections in the United States very closely .
I tend to watch mainly American news because I do n't like to watch Canadian news and hear what Allan ( Gregg , a pollster and CBC pundit who was in the audience ) and everybody else is saying about me , so my hobby is to watch politics elsewhere . "
It 's not the first time Harper has suggested he does n't pay attention to Canadian news , but the first time he 's done so publicly .
Never mind that it comes as Canadian television networks struggle for audiences , advertising and federal help through tighter regulation of cable licensing fees .
Never mind that it comes on a day when the public broadcaster was trying to rebrand its news programming , news network and news personalities .
In fact , given all the interviews he gives to American broadcasters Fox News , CNN , MSNBC and others , Harper 's words ring true .
Which NDP Leader Jack Layton thinks is kind of scary .
" Perhaps if he watched Canadian news more often , he would understand the negative impact of his policies on Canadian families .
And if he actually likes Fox News better than Canadian news , then Canadians ought to be concerned , " Layton told the Star .
But is it a bit like Harper 's professed disdain for artists and galas ?
A love - hate thing ?
Is it just a political dodge to make him appear above the fray ?
Liberal MP Bob Rae was skeptical .
" I 'm surprised – if it 's true – I 'm surprised that it 's the case .
I find that quite shocking .
Because we all have an obligation to know what 's going on and to know what other people are reporting and what 's taking place , " he said .
" I 'm quite astounded that the Prime Minister would be so unaware of the world around him . "
Rae confessed he " always " watched TV news , even in his darkest days as Ontario's NDP premier in the last recession .
" I also read the newspaper . "
Still does .
" Look at the colour of my hair .
Of course , I still read it . "
" Well , of course , " said Finance Minister Jim Flaherty when asked if he watches Canadian news .
Asked if the Prime Minister should too , Flaherty seemed puzzled by the question .
" I think the Prime Minister probably does . "
Told he did n't , Flaherty chuckled and escaped .
" Oh you could ask him about that . "

Immigration Minister Jason Kenney said he " occasionally " watches the political news shows that are broadcast from the Commons lobby – but not to check out his own performance .
" No , I hate to see myself on TV . "
Asked if the PM should watch Canadian political news , Kenney smiled .
" It 's up to him .
Look , um .
I 'm glad to hear if the Prime Minister is n't sitting there glued to the TV .
It means he 's doing his job .
That 's a good thing . "
Peter Kent , a former newscaster and Harper 's minister of state for foreign affairs , watches " news from all sorts of sources " – the BBC , Latin America and Canadian news .
He said the PM does n't watch news " about himself , " but he " absolutely " watches some Canadian news .
Asked if he knew that for sure , Kent admitted , " Well , I 've never sat with him , " but he assumed Harper did .
Industry Minister Tony Clement was frank .
The Prime Minister may be " exaggerating , " Clement suggested , before challenging a Star reporter 's summary of Harper 's comments .
" I do n't believe you . "
Asked if he believed the Prime Minister , Clement summed it up .
" I think he watches Canadian news , he reads Canadian news , he watches American news , he reads American news .
He probably watches European news .
We all do that .
" We 're news junkies , all of us are .
Come on .
You know what we 're all about . "
Shortly after that , Harper 's spokesman Dimitri Soudas replied to an earlier request for a list of the Prime Minister 's news consumption habits .
" The Prime Minister does n't watch himself on the news .
That is why he tends to mainly watch American news . "
Really ?
He does n't watch himself on the news .
All right then .
Something tells me the Google Street View team should be equipped with emergency response gear and training .
What tells me this ?
This van that 's totally on fire , for one thing .
UPDATED

Yesterday , the Toronto Star saw the same Google SV item we did , and investigated .
According to the workman who owns the truck that is n't on fire , he was able to move his truck out of the way before the van " blew up . "
It was apparently a relatively safe explosion — nobody was hurt and nothing else burned down — but an explosion nonetheless .
Damn .

Jerusalem , November 25 , 2009 - How does our biological system know that it is supposed to operate on a 24 - hour cycle ?
Scientists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem have discovered that a tiny molecule holds the clue to the mystery .
Human as well as most living organisms on earth possess circadian a ( 24 - hour ) life rhythm .
This rhythm is generated from an internal clock that is located in the brain and regulates many bodily functions , including the sleep - wake cycle and eating .
Although the evidence for their existence is obvious and they have been studied for more than 150 years , only recently the mechanisms that generate these rhythms have begun to be unraveled .
A researcher of the Alexander Silberman Institute of Life Sciences at the Hebrew University , Dr. Sebastian Kadener , and one of his students , Uri Weissbein , are among a collaborative group of researchers that have now found that tiny molecules known as miRNAs are central constituents of the circadian clock .
Their discovery holds wide - ranging implications for future therapeutic treatment to deal with sleep deprivation and other common disorders connected with the daily life cycle .
The sleep - wake cycle , the most characterized manifestation of the circadian clock , is generated thanks to specialized neurons found both in humans and fruitflies .
( The mechanism governing the circadian clock in fruitflies is almost identical to the one mammals -- and humans -- have . )
These neurons have the striking capability of counting time very accurately via a complex process of gene activation and repression that result in a tightly controlled process that takes exactly 24 hours .
The new research by Dr. Kadener and his colleagues , published in an article in the journal Genes and Development ( and that was highlighted in Nature Review Neuroscience ) , has shown that a new mode of regulation has a pivotal importance for the ability of our internal clock to accurately count those 24 hours each day .
Specifically , they have shown that the very tiny miRNA molecules are necessary for the circadian rhythms to function .
MiRNAs have recently been discovered and have been shown to be involved in different processes in animals .
By the use of new state - of - the - art techniques ( most of them developed in the present study ) the authors demonstrate that one specific miRNA ( called bantam ) recognizes and regulates the translation of the gene clock .
This constitutes the first example of a defined miRNA - gene regulation in the central clock .
Perhaps even more importantly , the researchers were among the first to prove that there is a clear role of miRNA regulation in the brain in general and behavior in particular .
###
In addition to Kadener and Weissman , others participating in the research were Prof. Michael Rosbash , Dr. Jerome Menet , Dr. Pipat Nawathean , Prof. Sacha Nelson and Dr. Ken Sugino from Brandeis University in the US and Prof. Phil Zamore , Dr. Michael Horwich and Dr. Vasia Vagin from the University of Massachusetts Medical School .

Sen. Lieberman ( I - Aetna ) Meets Americans Willing to Put Their Body on the Line for Real Healthcare Reform
An OpEdNews Exclusive
At 9:20 AM ET , Senator Joe Lieberman received a visit at his D.C. Office from a band of citizens determined to make sure Lieberman is not allowed to govern on behalf of insurance companies or obstruct health care reform with shameless tomfoolery any longer .
The band of citizens entered his office with the intention of convincing Lieberman to stop accepting lobbying dollars from health insurance companies .
The group waited patiently hoping to negotiate with Lieberman , but when Lieberman refused to meet the individuals , they began a sit-in and were unwilling to leave until their demands for Lieberman were met or they were arrested .
I do n’t often write about alternative remedies for serious medical conditions .
Most have little more than anecdotal support , and few have been found effective in well - designed clinical trials .
Such trials randomly assign patients to one of two or more treatments and , wherever possible , assess the results without telling either the patients or evaluators who received which treatment .
Now , however , in describing an alternative treatment for asthma that does not yet have top clinical ratings in this country ( although it is taught in Russian medical schools and covered by insurance in Australia ) , I am going beyond my usually stringent research criteria for three reasons :
¶ The treatment , a breathing technique discovered half a century ago , is harmless if practiced as directed with a well - trained therapist .
¶ It has the potential to improve the health and quality of life of many people with asthma , while saving health care dollars .
¶ I ’ve seen it work miraculously well for a friend who had little choice but to stop using the steroid medications that were keeping him alive .
Many of the changes made under Hitler , put in place to remove the influence of the Jewish - born baby Jesus , are still in use today , much to the alarm of modern Germans .
NEW evidence has made it more likely that remnants of Martian microbes were transported to Earth in a meteorite , it was revealed today .
A study by scientists from the American space agency Nasa has found chemical signatures in the rock strongly associated with life .
The discovery strengthens the case for believing that worm - like structures in the meteorite are ' microfossils ' of ancient Martian bugs .
Sceptics have pointed out that similar - shaped structures could be formed from non-biological processes .
Another unanswered question is whether the microfossils were the result of contamination by Earthly bacteria .
This was originally ruled out by Nasa but has raised doubts in the minds of other experts .
The meteorite , catalogued as Allen Hills ( ALH ) 84001 , crashed onto the frozen wastes of Antarctica 13,000 years ago and was recovered in 1984 .
Scientists believe the rock was blasted off the surface of Mars by an asteroid or comet , reaching Earth after floating through space for around 16 million years .
It would have formed part of the planet 's crust at a time billions of years ago when many experts believe water flowed on the surface of Mars , and conditions were suitable for life .
In 1996 Nasa and the White House made the explosive announcement that the rock contained traces of Martian bugs .
Photographs were released showing elongated segmented objects that appeared strikingly lifelike .
However , the excitement did not last long .
Other scientists questioned whether the meteorite samples were contaminated .
They also argued that heat generated when the rock was blasted into space may have created mineral structures that could be mistaken for microfossils .
The new study was conducted using advanced high resolution electron microscope techniques which were not available 13 years ago .
News of the findings , expected to be released soon by Nasa , was leaked to the space news website Spaceflight Now and picked up today by the Sun newspaper .
The research was led by Dr Kathie Thomas - Keprta and members of the original team at the Johnson Space Centre in Houston , Texas , that claimed to have found evidence of life in the meteorite .
It focused on a more detailed analysis of magnetite crystals - tiny magnetic particles - and carbonate discs within the rock .
Certain bacteria on Earth are known to contain magnetite crystals , which they are believed to use as tiny compasses to help them navigate .
Originally published as Martian bugs crashed to earth
No – it should have been a drop ball , awarded at the point where the football and the beachball made contact .
It 's all about what impact the beachball had on play .
In this case it clearly deflected the shot past the keeper : otherwise he could have made a save .
So the moment the two balls made contact the beachball becomes an " outside agent " – the same as a fan , a dog or any other unexpected arrival on the pitch that clearly changes the course of a game .
If the ball had simply struck the outside agent on its way into the net without changing direction or speed then the goal would stand – the key here is that the outside agent has caused the ball to enter the net , by changing the course of its flight and distracting the keeper .
It was a tough call for the officials given Glen Johnson was sticking his foot out at the same time , but the goal should not have been given .
Allan Williams , manager of the National Collection of Aerial Photography based in Edinburgh , which now holds Tara , said : " The skill of the photo reconnaissance pilot was incredible - they were among the best pilots in the air force .
As so many of them lost their lives the archive has become a memorial to them and the events on the ground they photographed .
How they could take the photos they did is astonishing .
When you remember they were taken in combat , and often being shot at - it's astounding "

North Korea is thought to have thousands of missiles North Korea has said it is ready for direct talks with the US on rolling back its nuclear programme but will " go its own way " if Washington refuses .
North Korea 's foreign ministry said wider talks including North Korea 's neighbours were possible depending on any direct negotiations with the US .
Pyongyang pulled out of the long - running six - party nuclear disarmament talks earlier this year .
In May , the North conducted an underground nuclear test .
Strong hint " The conclusion we have reached is that the direct parties , which are the North and the United States , must first sit down and find a rational solution , " the foreign ministry spokesman said in comments reported by the official KCNA news agency .
NORTH KOREA 2009 TESTS 12 Oct -
Five short - range missiles fired 4 July - Seven suspected ballistic missiles fired 2 July - Four short - range cruise missiles launched 25 May - Second underground nuclear test brings new UN sanctions 25 / 26 May - Series of short - range rockets fired 5 April - N Korea says long - range rocket was satellite launch
North Korea 's missile programme
What is North Korea 's game plan ?
" Now that we have shown the generosity of stating the position that we would be willing to talk to the United States and hold multilateral talks including the six - way talks , it is time for the United States to make a decision , " the spokesman said .
" If the US is not ready to sit at a negotiating table with the [ North ] , it will go its own way . "
The latest comments offer the strongest hint yet that dialogue could resume .
Last month , leader Kim Jong - il said he might consider a return to the nuclear talks he had previously declared dead - after direct talks with Washington .
But the state department says it has not yet decided whether to accept Pyongyang 's invitation for a visit by the US special envoy on North Korea , Stephen Bosworth .
The six - party talks include the two Koreas , the US , Japan , China and Russia .
Envoy
The foreign ministry statement came as North Korea 's second - ranking nuclear envoy , Ri Gun , ended a rare visit to the US meeting academics and former officials .
The US contacts said after these meetings that the North appeared to be more open to resuming the six - way talks on its nuclear programme .
Mr Ri held talks in New York with Sung Kim , the US special envoy on the North 's nuclear disarmament .
They also met later on the sidelines of a California forum .
In 2007 , North Korea agreed to disable its nuclear facilities , as a first step towards their dismantlement , in exchange for fuel aid and political concessions .
But after receiving much of the aid , the North abandoned the process earlier this year and conducted a second nuclear test .
This was followed by warnings that it was weaponising its plutonium stocks and had begun to enrich uranium - which would provide a second way to build nuclear weapons .
May 's nuclear test prompted a round of UN sanctions , which some analysts say has prompted Pyongyang 's recent move to return to the negotiating table .
North Korea has long demanded direct talks with the US , saying they were the only way to end resolve the nuclear stand - off .
The North 's foreign ministry spokesman said if the two countries " end the hostile relationship and build trust , there will be a meaningful step towards the denuclearising of the Korean peninsula " .
But he added : " If the United States is not ready to sit down face - to - face with us for talks , we can not but go on our own way . "

Maine .
September , 1917
by Jeremy Hooper
The Pine Tree state legislature had enacted a bill granting women the right to vote , throwing their strong support behind the measure .
But first , the matter had to be ratified at the polls , putting a minority 's right was put to the whims of a majority vote .
Sound familiar ?
Yeah , you know the script .
The anti-side warned their troops to come out against the " unwise policy " before it was " everlastingly too late " :
Kennebec Journal , Sep. 10 , 1917
The pro-equality side ( in this case " yes " ) tried everything they could to combat the other side :
Kennebec Journal , Sep. 10 , 1917
In support of fairness , suffragists looked to the more progressive Canada , refuted claims that the state had more pressing issues to take on , shot down the idea that women did n't actually want this right , and even had to distance themselves from " militant " activists .
It 's all remarkably familiar to modern gays :
Kennebec Journal July 25 , 1917
But when the votes were cast , the fair - minded side still lost .
In fact , the fear of the lady - vote was apparently even more pronounced than the current fear of the 'mo marriage :
Kennebec Journal , Sep. 27 , 1917
But as it turned out , some of them did n't even know what the hell they were voting on :
Kennebec Journal , Sep. 14 , 1917
Yet despite what had to be an enraging situation then ( as it is now ) , the fair - minded team vowed to march on :
Kennebec Journal , Sep. 24 , 1917
And two years later , Maine ratified the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , which finally gave women this fundamental right .
Stay the course , folks .
We remember history , and we will not be condemned by it .
Your thoughts
Jeremy ,
Thank you for this .
An excellent parallel and a wonderful reminder .

As the old saying goes , " There 's nothing new under the sun .... "
Yes , we WILL prevail , not only in Maine , but in all 50 states eventually ... and the bigots against us know this deep inside of them .
Stay the course !!
Posted by : David Twombley | Nov 9 , 2009 1:35:54 PM
Wait ...
I thought Legislatures ratified amendments , not voters ?
Is it different in Maine ?
Because if it's not , then chances are , 2 years later , Maine voters still did n't want to give women the vote ... but enlightened politicians knew better ....
Posted by : Tommy | Nov 9 , 2009 4:03:39 PM
Oops , Tommy .
Yes , that was miswording .
It was the leg .
that ratified the 19th in 1919 .
Correcting it now .
And yes , I 'm sure public opinion was still against ratification .
I do n't have that data , but I can't imagine it changed that much that quickly .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Nov 9 , 2009 4:11:30 PM
Clearly you will NOT prevail .
Voters in all 30 states that have asked them have spoken against the changes you seek .
It 's not happening .
And that , my friend , is what I know deep inside of me .
Posted by : John Rocksbury | Nov 9 , 2009 4:18:42 PM
And in 5 years , Mr. Rocksbury , we have won marriage equality in SEVEN STATES , with a couple more on the horizon .
Yes , two of those were overturned -- but we have still made considerable progress .
I am married .
Legally .
You will never take that away from me .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Nov 9 , 2009 4:28:37 PM
Fascinating stuff .
It 's almost sad how the script never changes .
Hope you do n't mind , but this post reminded me of an article I was working on a few weeks ago about the National Woman 's Organization .
http://blog.mattalgren.com/2009/11/learning-from-history-in-the-end-we-win/
Posted by : Matt Algren | Nov 9 , 2009 4:29:00 PM
Mr. Rocksbury , you may delude yourself all you wish but 20 years ago DPs / civil unions never would have even been considered , let alone approved .
Gays are being accepted more and more in society than I ever thought I 'd see in my lifetime .
Keep dreaming , marriage equality is coming even if you folks successfully delay it for a little bit longer .
Just wait until these amendments start to be repealed .
I predict that DPs and civil unions will happen first within 10 years in the 19 states that currently ban them .
That 's the first step .
Marriage equality will follow .

I want to see the bigots who would n't shut up about how " the majority chose this ! " dance around the facts and pretend this can't be compared .
Of course I 'll never even get that far if I link directly back here , they 'll just say " LOL BLOG " and ignore it .

Ah , Mr. Rocksbury ; 'me thinks you dost protest too much '...
I think I , and others , have struck a nerve .
Your comment just reinforces what I posted earlier ; you know that this is inevitable .
Deny it all you want ; it will happen .

Jeremy , you are legally married .
You were married in the state of Connecticut ( and it looked like a fabulous party , too ! ) .
Maybe that 's what needs to happen ... same sex couples go en masse to Massachusetts , Connecticut , Iowa , NH ( after Jan 1st ) , Vermont and just get married .
And then go home to their home states and say , as you have , " I am legally married .
You can't take that away from me . "
And then stand up and demand all the rights and benefits that accrue to legally married couples .
I was married in NY .
Since I have been married I have lived in Illinois and Maine .
No one has ever asked to see my marriage license , nor has anyone ever questioned my marriage .
Maybe same - sex couples need to just start getting married and then ... be married .
My 2 cents for this evening .
Still hurting from last week .

Yep , that 's the beauty of the public initiative process .
I have a feeling we saw some of that same confusion on Question 1 last week .
Face it , it 's only a 5.5 % difference between yes and no .
That 's a statistical anomaly .

What a facinating article !
I really truly enjoyed this , Jeremy , what a great parallel .
It 's crazy looking back to a point in time where women could n't vote , and that people were actually gunning to keep it that way !
Just goes to show you how stupid the " majority " can be , and why such civil liberties should NOT be put to the vote of the people , many of whom ( as this blog showed ) do n't even know the main arguments of the argument itself !

Having just seen the movie , MILK , and having just had wonderful discussion about the perseverence and hope that Harvey Milk embodied , and recognizing how far rights for the GLBTQ community have come in the last 30 years , I have every hope and belief that I will see the day that all people are treated equally in the USA as the writers of the Declaration of Independence intended 233 years ago .
The parallels between the womens ' suffrage movement , the civil rights movement and the gay rights movement are astounding .
God bless our future USA , where all people have the right to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .

Fascinating , interesting , all true --- and really thank you so much for sharing this .
It just makes me that much angrier , that much more frustrated .
Oh well --- patience --- no civil rights advances happened quickly ---- sigh

Trust me , it would take much more than your wishful thinking to strike a nerve :-) .
It 's just funny how at first , people tried to force these changes through the courts .
Then voters started approving ammendments to their state constitutions en masse , so then the tactic changed from trying to get their way through the courts to bringing the vote before the people .
And what 's funny is that same - sex marriage has failed miserably at the ballot .
Now the general sentiment here seems to be that voters are stupid and do n't know anything , so take it to the legislature .
But then you look at Maine , a New England state that is overwhelmingly liberal , and even those voters overturned the legislation .
If voters in liberal states like Maine and California disapprove , how can you even make the argument that you are winning the battle ?

The Al Qaeda Diaries
Until the Pakistani Army swept into this small , hill - flocked valley on Nov. 3 , Sararogha had served as the South Waziristan headquarters of the powerful terrorist group Tehrik - i- Taliban Pakistan — known in English as the TTP .
Despite the chaos since the death of its founder — Baitullah Mehsud , killed by a U.S. drone strike on Aug. 5 — the TTP had the area firmly in its grip , and made it a virtual black hole for government security and intelligence forces .
The TTP had seized the town in a surprise raid on a paramilitary fort on Jan. 25 last year .
They instantly executed half of the two dozen Frontier Corps soldiers , a move that filled the roughly 8,000 inhabitants with fear and forced them into silence .
The stones and debris still litter the ground of the fort — the result of heavy artillery fire that the army used while entering the town .
" It all started from here , the challenge to the state of Pakistan , " Brig .
Muhammed Shafiq , the commanding officer , told me during a recent visit .
" Sararogha has turned into a symbol of the TTP terror in the region . "
But this month , the Army overtook the town and its southern ridge — Point 1345 — which overlooks Sararogha and the road to the periphery of the valley .
The fight for this point has been fierce and bloody , with one soldier losing one of his legs to gunfire from the TTP and al Qaeda militants .
The soldier is currently under treatment at a military hospital in Rawalpindi , where the Pakistani Army is headquartered , and officials will not name him for security reasons .
Officials claim they have killed more than 550 militants in the current campaign thus far , while suffering close to 100 casualties themselves .
Since access to the area — dubbed the " terror den " by many Army officials — is extremely limited and the military has choked all the arteries leading into it , independently verifying these claims is not possible .
The entire civilian population has moved away , taking away potential sources of context .
There are no precise counts of how many TTP and al Qaeda fighters there are in the region , though local journalists generally say 10,000 to 15,000 .
Regardless of the exact numbers , the most important consequence of the latest offensive is that the Army has wrested control over an area it had once lost .
Two things made this possible .
First , squabbling between politically tainted Asif Zardari , the president , and Nawaz Sharif , the former two - time prime minister , following last February ’s elections resulted in uncertainty , inaction , and confusion in the war against militants .
With power consolidated , the military has made swift , effective moves against the TTP and other forces .
Second , the terrorist bombings in Mumbai , India , on Nov. 26 , 2008 , halted fighting against terrorists in Pakistan as well .
The civilian government " soft - pedaled " after allegations that Pakistani intelligence figures helped in the India plot emerged .
The mistrust between the civilian government ( considered to be too pro-American ) and the military establishment ( led by Gen. Ashfaq Kiyani ) heightened , delaying action against militants in Waziristan .
This allowed the Taliban and al Qaeda to perpetrate a reign of terror that almost completely eroded the writ of the government .
It also led to an uptick in suicide attacks on civilians and the security apparatus in Pakistan .
But now , Pakistan is fighting in Waziristan again .
Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas , the Army ’s spokesperson , says taking the areas back from the militants is crucial to signal to " all and sundry that we would not tolerate any challenge to the state . "
In another hilly town claimed by the TTP and al Qaeda , Laddah , he said that you cannot allow a bunch of criminals to bully the state .
When the soldiers pushed the militants back , they found dozens of Arabic books , magazines , and teachers ’ manuals on warfare and bomb - building .
These documents and others left at the seminaries in Sararogha and Laddah suggest not just the presence of Arab fighters but the convergence of al Qaeda and local militant groups .
Several hand - written notebooks explain how al Qaeda ideology binds followers of various shades of Islam together .
One diary , belonging to someone named Shehzad Akmal — a member of the Sunni Deobandi strand of Islam and a native of the Arabian Sea metropolis of Karachi , Pakistan — describes his journey from the southern coast to the tiny mountainous town in Waziristan , from 2002 to the present .
It took him to Kashmir , where militants have battled Indian forces since 1989 , then to Lahore , where he twice attended the grand congregation of peaceful Muslim preachers in 2004 .
Another diary appears to belong to a fighter with the Tehrik ul - Mujahideen .
He details the evolution of his anti-India outfit , naming places and people and dates .
The TM , one learns , is a Wahabbi organization that draws its ideological inspiration from the Saudi Arabian version of Islam .
The fact that the two authors belong to different branches of Islam and mention several Arab names as their contacts indicates that al Qaeda has galvanized Muslims across the spectrum .
They put behind their ideological differences to join al Qaeda for its stated cause : Fighting the infidels led by America .
One of the pages of another notebook contains some interesting questions .
What will the fate of our jihad against America be if Pakistan remains the same ?
How do we best fight the American - Jewish conspiracy against the Muslim umma ?
This trove of materials , which also explain the configurations of suicide jackets and improvised explosive devices , underscores how these al Qaeda techniques of insurgency have traveled from Saudi Arabia through Iraq to Afghanistan and Pakistan .
A careful consideration of the campaign — based on interviews with displaced persons as well as journalists from the region — also explains how the TTP and al Qaeda took control in the first place .
Swiftly and systemically , militants led by Baitullah Mehsud and now by his successor Hakimullah Mehsud pushed out the entire local civilian administration , murdered suspected government " collaborators , " and then simply set up shop .
The Sararogha high school building , now damaged by artillery fire , served as Baitullah Mehsud ’s " court , " where he met his regional commanders and pronounced punishments on opponents and dissidents .
A journalist threatened by the TTP who now lives quietly in Peshawar corroborated some of the horror stories collected by the Army and government officials .
The U.S. - led ISAF troops in Afghanistan and Pakistani troops in Pakistan chased al Qaeda operatives on both sides of the Durand Line , the thousand - mile border between Pakistan and Afghanistan .
This military concentration makes it unsurprising that the Taliban and al Qaeda have murdered more than 800 pro-government tribal elders and intelligence officials in the region in the past four years .
The Islamist groups witch - hunt for collaborators , and then execute ( often by beheading ) the " spies . "
This practice has reached particularly alarming levels in Waziristan since 2008 as a result of the paranoia created by the drone strikes and other targeted killings by U.S. forces .
Since the Army offensive , these remote and deserted towns and villages seem in control .
But the real challenge lies in retaining and consolidating that control and creating an environment that would allow the return of the civilian government officials and the tens of thousands of internal refugees who fled the bloody standoff .
Viewed against the scale of threat posed by the consolidating pan-Islamist forces , the Pakistani Army seems to be stuck in the Waziristan region for the medium to long term .
But its presence here has certainly changed the dynamics of the militancy in the no - go tribal areas .
The state is finally showing its teeth to an unholy alliance of local and foreign , al Qaeda - inspired and al Qaeda - sponsored non-state actors .
The message this time around seems to be loud and clear :
No matter what it takes and no matter for how long , such lawless behavior will not be tolerated .
AN 11 - year - old girl has become a mother after going into labour during her wedding to her teenage boyfriend .
Kordeza Zhelyazkova was still wearing her wedding dress and tiara when she arrived at hospital and gave birth to little Violeta .
The schoolgirl , of Sliven , Bulgaria , fell pregnant within just two weeks of her 11th birthday .
She gave birth last week with 19 - year - old husband Jeliazko Dimitrov at her side ,
" I 'm not going to play with toys any more - I have a new toy now , " Kordeza told Britain 's News of the World newspaper .
" She is so beautiful , I love her .
Violeta is the child and I must grow up .
I am not going back to school - I am a mother now . "
Kordeza met Jeliazko in the playground of her gypsy school when he rescued her from bullies .
Their daughter was conceived within a week .
Kordeza admitted : " I have n't had sex education classes and I did n't know how to get pregnant .
I 'd never had a boyfriend and I 'd never heard of condoms .
" I did n't know I was pregnant until my grandmother saw I had put on weight .
I just thought I 'd eaten too many burgers . "
The pair had a traditional Roma wedding - but now Jeliazko is facing up to six years behind bars for having sex with a minor .
" I 'm scared .
I want to look after my wife and child .
Instead I may be going to prison , " he said .
" I made a mistake but I am not going to apologise for that because now I have beautiful Violeta . "

Yes , a Democrat from Michigan who is attempting to upset the apple cart with his STUPID amendment on abortion .
Again , this dude must think women are dumb or SOMETHIN ' .
Well , Mr. Stupak , we are not .
It 's the sleepers who win the leagues .
Just for fun , see if you can pull up , electronically or on paper , a draft from last year , and then find out which teams finished in the top three , at least in the regular season .
Look at their drafts from about the sixth round and later , and you 're bound to be impressed .
In about 90 percent of cases -- the remaining 10 percent being teams that just happened to strike it big in the free - agent sweepstakes -- you 'll see picks that you now can't believe would have been taken then .
And it'll become obvious why that owner had a great season .
Use it as motivation to get you pumped up to prepare for those middle and late rounds and pay close attention during them .
Use it to learn about players such as Glen Coffee and James Davis , Earl Bennett and Laurent Robinson .
Use it to find this year 's Aaron Rodgers , Derrick Ward , Steve Slaton , DeSean Jackson or Owen Daniels .
Of course , those are also the rounds in which you do n't really know about a player .
You do n't know about his playing time , or his true upside , or how consistent he 'll be , or whether he 'll carry over a hot training camp / preseason into the regular season .
You just do n't know .
But that 's what makes these players sleepers ; you 're finding diamonds in the rough whom other people would gloss over .
If you find the right ones , you can win your league .
On the flip side , if you botch the early rounds , you can lose your league .
That 's tougher to do than finding sleepers because there is so much proven talent to pick from .
But it can be done , and our experts pass along the players who have " red flags " by them , be it because of nagging injuries ( Terrell Owens ) , or age ( Kurt Warner , LaDainian Tomlinson ) , or simply being overrated ( Kellen Winslow ) .
We 're not necessarily saying we think these guys will tank ; they just wo n't provide the production you expect from their draft spots .
With that , I introduce to you Sleepers & Busts 2.0 .
Our first version , while a popular offering , had become outdated , so here 's a fresh batch of our sleepers and busts at each position , and a handful of explanations to go along with 'em .
Enjoy . -- Brendan Roberts
Sleepers
The round in parentheses is the round that expert would take that player in an ESPN standard draft league .
Because we advocate waiting ' til the last round to select your kicker , it was not necessary to include a round with them .
Sleeper explanations
These are ranked in order of when you can expect to get them , earliest to latest .
Quarterback
Carson Palmer , Bengals ( from Christopher Harris ) :
Now let 's be clear here :
Just because I 've had Palmer tagged as a sleeper all summer does n't mean I think he 's automatically a starter in shallow fantasy leagues .
He comes with a significant risk of injury , both because of the recent past and because his offensive line is subpar .
But this is a guy who was a top - three fantasy quarterback just a few years ago , and he does have some excellent receiving weapons .
The Bengals will probably grind things out a bit more than we remember from back in the day because their defense looks pretty good .
But Palmer has upside as your No. 2 quarterback .
Brett Favre , Vikings ( from Eric Karabell ) :
You do n't have to like him or how he handled things this summer to draft him late .
Before hurting his arm last season , Favre was among the leaders in passing yards , and 10 of his 22 interceptions came in the final six games .
He was hurt !
In theory , he 's healthy now , and he's on a strong team .
He does n't need to be a wild gunslinger , but I expect 20 - plus touchdowns and a real drop in mistakes .
He 's a solid backup in fantasy .
Joe Flacco , Ravens ( from AJ Mass ) :
The way he 's using Ray Rice as a receiver out of the backfield this preseason , with tons of dump - offs over the middle , has been opening up things downfield for the no-longer - retired Derrick Mason .
True , the preseason games " do n't count , " but they do matter .
When a quarterback goes 23 - for - 28 in less than three quarters against the Panthers , you have to take notice .
Running back
Kevin Smith has big - time upside , but because he 's a Lion ... Matthew Emmons / US Presswire
Kevin Smith , Lions ( from AJ Mass ) :
He 's not a " sexy pick , " but I bet if his name were Kevlar O'Keefe or Cutback Suarez , he'd be in everybody 's top five .
I think Smith has the talent to rush for 1,500 - plus yards this season , especially with an improved offensive line and more balanced game plan in Detroit .
Heck , I might even take him as early as Round 2 , just to ensure I do n't miss out .
Larry Johnson , Chiefs ( from Dave Hunter ) : I 'm a sucker for LJ , and I 'll be the first to admit it , but I really believe the guy has something left in the tank .
I believe in him enough that I 'm willing to draft him in the sixth round despite an unclear situation for him in Kansas City .
LJ is young enough that if given a chance to carry most of the load , he 'll produce .
Felix Jones , RB ( from Ken Daube ) : Does anyone remember that the Cowboys invested a first - round ( 22nd overall ) pick in the 2008 NFL draft on this former Arkansas running back ?
Jerry Jones sure does .
With Terrell Owens gone , there are additional touches to be had , and it should surprise nobody if Jones , who averaged 8.9 yards per carry last season , is given those opportunities .
James Davis , Browns ( from Tristan H. Cockcroft ) :
This pick is as much disparaging Jamal Lewis as it is praising Davis for his preseason play .
As in , I 'm firmly convinced now that the Browns must consider Davis at the bare minimum as a part of a backfield rotation .
All the rookie has done thus far is average 7.8 yards per carry and catch seven passes , while his veteran competition has averaged 2.6 yards per carry with five catches ( the catches are actually unexpected from Lewis , who is generally mediocre in that area ) .
Lewis is also 30 years old , and an old 30 at that , with 2,399 career carries on his legs .
Even if he had the job to himself , how likely is it that he would last an entire season as a starter ?
Davis wo n't cost you a dime -- he 's barely draft - worthy in ESPN standard leagues -- but he 's the kind of player I 'd be happy with as my final nonkicker .
Simply put , he 's a lottery ticket who by year 's end could conceivably have elevated his status to weekly No. 2 / flex play .
He has that kind of upside .
Glen Coffee , 49ers ( from Keith Lipscomb ) :
He 's just one Frank Gore injury away from being a factor , and I love how hard this guy runs .
He would put up solid numbers if given the opportunity .
Of course , playing more than one - third of your games against NFC
West opponents is n't a bad thing , either .
Mike Bell , Saints ( from Stephania Bell ) :
And not just because we share the same last name .
With Reggie Bush likely to be utilized differently this season by the Saints , in part because of his injury history , Pierre Thomas is likely to see plenty of action in the team 's backfield , and his value is widely known .
But Thomas is recovering from a sprained MCL , and although he 's expected back in Week 1 , it exposed the need for another tailback who could also do some damage around the goal line .
Enter Mike Bell , who has performed well in the preseason and is expected to be part of a three - back rotation .
Consider him a deep sleeper who could provide intermittent value from a flex spot .
Wide receiver
Eddie Royal , Broncos ( from Stephania Bell ) : Fantasy owners already know Royal will have value , but the key here is just how much value he 'll have .
Royal began training camp as the No. 2 receiver but might find himself at No. 1 to begin the regular season if Brandon Marshall can't get his hip or his attitude ready .
Also , Broncos No. 3 receiver Jabar Gaffney , who was comfortable in new coach Josh McDaniels ' offense from their Patriots days , was expected to steal some targets from the starting duo , but now has a broken thumb and wo n't be returning anytime soon .
Royal should get plenty of opportunities right from the get - go .
Devin Hester , Bears ( from Matthew Berry ) :
He 's speedy , he now has a good quarterback throwing him the ball , and from what I hear , he has become a good route runner .
He led the Bears in targets and receiving yards in 2008 , and once you get past the elite guys , all you 're doing with your third and fourth WR picks is looking for upside anyway .
This guy fits the bill .
Chris Henry , Bengals ( from Dave Hunter ) : I 'm not a Henry fan because of his past off - field antics , but smart fantasy owners know how to sacrifice their personal dislike for a player to get statistical results .
Henry has looked fantastic so far in preseason games , showing soft hands , great leaping ability and excellent speed .
Laveranues Coles likely will win the No. 2 slot for the Bengals opposite Chad Ochocinco , but Henry will get plenty of looks this season in the team 's pass - heavy offense .
If I 'm looking for a late - round WR sleeper with upside , Henry is my guy .
Steve Smith , Giants ( from James Quintong ) : Eli Manning does n't have a go - to receiver just yet , but of all the current options , I think Smith could emerge as the most dependable guy of the group .
He can fill a lot of different roles within the Giants ' receiving game and did have a catch in every game last season .
Sure , he might not be a home run threat like some of the others on the roster , but if he can get himself open early and often , he 'll pile up his share of stats , and at a bargain price .
Earl Bennett , Bears ( from Eric Karabell ) : Clearly Devin Hester has quite a following in drafts ; he 's being selected ahead of Derrick Mason , Steve Breaston , Lance Moore and other wide receivers who have played the position for years and have been productive .
Hester has n't .
New Bears quarterback Jay Cutler must throw to someone , and he has familiarity with Bennett , whom he threw to at Vanderbilt .
Bennett is not a definite fantasy starter , but there 's upside in him in what should be a better passing offense , and one that is wide - open in terms of targets at this point .
Laurent Robinson , Rams ( from Christopher Harris ) :
A few interesting receiving options have emerged as the exhibition season winds down .
Robinson , Kenny Britt and Hakeem Nicks all look like interesting deep sleepers to me , guys to store deep on your bench to see what happens .
I gave my primary WR sleeper pick to Robinson because the other guys are rookies .
Robinson is a burner on the outside who figures to get single coverage provided Donnie Avery stays healthy .
I have to admit , I expected the Rams to go with someone like Keenan Burton as their No. 2 receiver because Robinson 's skill set overlaps a bit with Avery's .
Still , there could be some big touchdown plays as long as Robinson is a starter .
Brandon Stokley , Broncos ( from Ken Daube ) : I am falling in love with Stokley all over again .
He might not be as quick as he once was , but he 's a level - headed veteran with above - average speed , and he fits very well into the new offensive system being installed in Denver .
Stokley has been practicing almost exclusively as the slot receiver , which is the position that helped make Wes Welker a fantasy star in McDaniels ' offense in New England .
The experienced Stokley has 80 - catch upside this season yet is being drafted in few leagues .
Do n't make that mistake .
Tight end
Greg Olsen , Bears ( from Eric Karabell ) : Jay Cutler lacks the same type of top - shelf receiving weapons he had in Denver , but the Bears do have a young , emerging tight end who could use a strong - armed quarterback to find him downfield .
Cutler loved throwing to the occasionally healthy Tony Scheffler , and Olsen has exciting skills .
Kevin Boss :
Who else can Eli Manning throw to ?
Howard Smith / US Presswire
Kevin Boss , Giants ( from Tristan H. Cockcroft ) : I 'm thinking of donning my Giants jersey and heading out to the team 's training camp site to audition , because , gee , who else is going to catch passes for this team ?
That 's primarily the reason Boss makes for a fine fallback tight end should you ignore the position in the early rounds , as he 's actually a veteran of this bunch , comparatively speaking .
More importantly , he 's one of the team 's few trusted red zone options in the passing game , with six touchdowns in 2008 on 19 red zone targets , the latter number placing him third in the league among tight ends .
The Giants can't live and die with Brandon Jacobs as their only red zone threat .
They need others , such as Boss , so do n't be surprised if he sneaks in eight to 10 scores .
Visanthe Shiancoe , Vikings ( from James Quintong ) : Shiancoe finished fifth in fantasy scoring last year behind the " big four " of Tony Gonzalez , Jason Witten , Dallas Clark and Antonio Gates , but he 's nowhere near them in the rankings .
I would have written off last season as a bit of a fluke , but now that the Vikings have Brett Favre , there 's hope for Shiancoe .
Favre has operated well with tight ends in his career , and he got a reasonably good rookie campaign from Dustin Keller last year .
Favre should help vault Shiancoe back into the top 10 again this year .
Brent Celek , Eagles ( from Ken Daube ) :
In the 10 games he started in '08 ( including the playoffs ) because of L.J. Smith 's miscellaneous issues , Celek caught 38 passes for 347 yards and four scores .
Smith has moved on to Baltimore , and prorating Celek 's performance in those starts over a full season would yield 91 fantasy points , good enough for sixth - best last season .
Kicker
David Akers , Eagles ( from Matthew Berry ) : How did I arrive at this ?
Because I closed my eyes , pointed at a list , and Akers was the guy my finger was on when I opened 'em .
I hate kickers .
Defense / Special teams
New York Jets ( from AJ Mass ) :
You do n't have to rush to grab the Jets , as most drafters will be too busy grabbing the Steelers , Vikings , Titans and Giants .
However , with the influx of all those former Ravens ( including head coach Rex Ryan ) to a team that actually had more sacks than " mighty Baltimore " last season , we expect big things .
Not to mention , you also get Leon Washington 's kick - return skills for the price of admission .
San Diego Chargers ( from Shawn Cwalinski ) : Just because you wait to take a defense does not mean you must settle .
The Chargers had the top fantasy defense in 2007 .
Last season the unit lost its best cover guy ( Antonio Cromartie ) and its best pass - rusher ( Shawne Merriman ) , which helps explain its subpar effort .
Well , Cromartie and Merriman are now healthy again , and the Chargers also added four defensive players in the draft , including first - round pick Larry English .
Add in one of the easiest schedules for a team defense this season and you get a top - five defense without having to use a true midround pick .
Dallas Cowboys ( from Keith Lipscomb ) :
For a team that led the NFL in sacks last season , its lack of interceptions ( 8 ) really stood out to me .
Since 1969 , only three of the 245 teams to record 45 or more sacks in a season had single - digit picks .
Those 245 teams averaged 18.5 interceptions , so I expect the Boys to force many more picks with all that pressure they 're putting on opposing quarterbacks .
Busts
For busts , we have put ADP ( live draft results in ESPN standard leagues ) in parentheses to give you an idea of when that player might be taken .
Bust explanations
Ranked in order of when they 're expected to be taken , earliest to latest .
Quarterback
Aaron Rodgers , Packers ( from Ken Daube ) : OK , let 's get this out of the way so all the cheeseheads can start hating me right now : I think Rodgers will finish in the top 10 at quarterback , but not in the top five , which is right around where he is being drafted now .
He 's a great quarterback , but his 2008 stats were greatly influenced by how poor the Packers ' running game was to start the season .
He just wo n't be a good value .
Kurt Warner , Cardinals ( from Christopher Harris ) :
It 's not that I hate Warner , it 's just that I worry he 's due for an injury ; last year was his first 16 - game campaign since 2001 .
He does n't get sacked a ton ( 26 last season , tied for 15th in the NFL ) , but he gets crushed after his release .
If you take him early , you run the risk of getting nothing out of the pick .
Of course , you also give yourself a chance for the No. 1 passer in fantasy , because the Cardinals will definitely throw .
But given where you have to take him , I 'd rather take another rusher or receiver and get my signal - caller later .
More on Kurt Warner , Cardinals ( from Keith Lipscomb ) : Warner is coming off his first full season of games played since 2001 -- and let 's not forget he played four additional games in the playoffs -- is still recovering from hip surgery , and he turned 38 in June .
I think he 'll still be great when he's on the field , but since he has never played a full NFL schedule two seasons in a row , I 'm concerned about his durability .
Ben Roethlisberger , Steelers ( from Eric Karabell ) :
Few quarterbacks can lead a team to a Super Bowl victory like he can , but be careful about relying on him for fantasy supremacy .
Roethlisberger dropped to 17 touchdown passes last season but did he really drop to that number ?
The fact is he has thrown 17 or 18 touchdown passes in four of his five seasons ; clearly that 32 - touchdown 2007 campaign is the outlier .
Expect 17 or 18 touchdowns this season .
Matt Cassel , Chiefs ( from Stephania Bell ) :
He 'll be good again -- just not this season .
Despite having arguably the best offensive line in the league around him , Cassel took the most sacks of any signal - caller last year ( 47 ) .
Despite having a reliable receiver such as Randy Moss , Cassel struggled to complete passes in the red zone .
And guess what , the Chiefs ' offensive line is not quite the equivalent of the Patriots ' , there 's no Randy Moss , and , by the way , there 's not even a Tony Gonzalez ( the Chiefs ' leading receiver for each of the past five seasons ) .
And Cassel is already battling a knee injury .
New head coach , new surroundings , new teammates consider it a rebuilding year for the Chiefs and build your fantasy team around someone else .
Running back
Michael Turner , Falcons ( from Ken Daube ) : I devoted a whole 32 Questions article to my distaste for Turner , but in a nutshell , there were just seven games last season in which Turner averaged 4.0 yards per carry or better .
Five of the teams he did that against -- Detroit , Green Bay , Kansas City , Oakland and St. Louis -- are n't found on the Falcons ' 2009 schedule .
Each of those five teams finished 26th or worse in terms of rushing yardage allowed per game .
That leads me to wonder if Turner 's remarkable 2008 was less talent and more schedule .
LaDainian Tomlinson , Chargers ( from Tristan H. Cockcroft ) : Understand that this pick is relative to draft value , because Tomlinson is currently our No. 7 running back ( and might be picked higher in many leagues ) , but I see no way he 'll earn you a profit or even break even at that spot .
He 's now 30 years old with a lot of mileage on his legs ( 2,657 carries ) , which are two big red flags .
Another flag :
He has lost 80 - plus fantasy points of value in each of the past two seasons .
Not that I 'd avoid Tomlinson outright , but there 's no chance I 'd take him in the first round of my drafts .
At least two of our experts feel Brandon Jacobs has too much risk to be a No. 1 fantasy back .

Brandon Jacobs , Giants ( from AJ Mass ) : I like Jacobs , but not as a No. 1 back , which is where he 's being drafted in many leagues ( Average Draft Results : 10th running back off the board , 15th player overall ) right now .
He 's an injury waiting to happen -- thankfully , X - rays on his forearm were negative after he got banged up against the Jets this past weekend -- and I think the Giants wo n't hesitate to put more of the load on Ahmad Bradshaw and Danny Ware as the season moves on .
More on Brandon Jacobs , Giants ( from Shawn Cwalinski ) : Jacobs is a unique back , and a great talent .
But he also has missed eight games over the past two seasons and has n't managed 220 carries or rushed for 1,100 yards in a single season .
Jacobs also has only 40 receptions in his four - year career , including only six catches last season .
Factor in Jacobs ' tough playoff schedule -- Philadelphia , at Washington , Carolina , at Minnesota -- and you have a player who looks like a pretty big risk for a second - round pick .
Ronnie Brown , Dolphins ( from Keith Lipscomb ) : Sure , he scored 10 touchdowns last season -- five more than his previous career high -- but he rushed for more than 70 yards in a game just three times .
If I can't get better consistency from a back being taken in the late third or early fourth round , then I 'd rather take one with high upside , something Brown does n't have .
Thomas Jones , Jets ( from James Quintong ) : I do n't think anyone is expecting Jones to repeat the 15 touchdowns he scored last season , but I wonder how much he 'll drop off , especially with Leon Washington poised to get a lot more looks in the offense .
Jones has n't looked all that sharp in the preseason , while Washington has played well , which could lead to some sort of a passing of the torch in the Jets ' backfield .
For now , I 'm not too concerned about Shonn Greene 's presence , but he 's a guy who could steal a few more touches from Jones as well , possibly at the goal line .
Wide receiver
Terrell Owens , Bills ( from Tristan H. Cockcroft ) :
Another big name you might be shocked to see on my " busts " list .
It 's not that I would n't welcome T.O. to my roster , but when he 's regarded as a No. 1 fantasy receiver by my league mates , it 's too steep a price .
Owens will be working with arguably the least talented quarterback of his career ( Trent Edwards ) , he 's now 35 years old and bound to decline sometime soon , and he 'll play a lot of cold - weather games .
In his career in games of 60 - degree temperatures or below , he has averaged 70.6 receiving yards and 0.71 touchdowns .
When the temperature is over 60 , those numbers are 81.2 and 0.81 .
Owens also has been hobbled by a nagging toe injury , and the turf - toe whispers could n't ring louder in my ears .
Not that there 's official word that 's what he has , but even the threat of it has me valuing him conservatively .
Antonio Bryant , Bucs ( from James Quintong ) :
Last year 's numbers , especially during the fantasy playoff weeks , were ridiculous , but I 'm still not buying .
The uncertainty at quarterback gives me pause , and outside of last season , there has n't been much consistency in Bryant 's game throughout his career .
That 's not going to help whoever takes over under center since that signal - caller needs at least one reliable target to get him comfortable .
I just do n't think Bryant is that guy .
Laveranues Coles , Bengals ( from Eric Karabell ) : Chris
Henry is healthy , focused and , well , not in trouble , and he 's poised to vault past Coles and Chad Ochocinco to become the Bengals ' top wide receiver .
Certainly Henry is the most dangerous playmaker they have .
Ochocinco will get his 60 catches , but Coles is having trouble acclimating himself to his new team .
He could be stuck with No. 3 WR duties this year , which means he likely wo n't produce like a No. 3 wide receiver for fantasy purposes .
Tight end
Tony Gonzalez , Falcons ( from Christopher Harris ) :
The Falcons have me spooked with this talk about Gonzo becoming more of a blocker than he has ever been .
I 'm sure to some extent that 's overstated , but the only way he 's worth a fifth - round pick is if he 's basically a wide receiver .
That 's sounding less and less like it 'll be the case .
Gonzalez is still probably my No. 1 fantasy tight end , but I 'm all for waiting on the position .
For where I 'd have to grab Gonzalez to get him , I 'd rather get a guy at a different position .
Owen Daniels , Texans ( from Stephania Bell ) :
He scored only two touchdowns last year -- and they came in the same game against Detroit !
The Texans do n't even play the Lions this year , and scores will be harder to come by .
I do n't know about you , but I want my tight ends in the end zone .
He 'll be too pricey for a starting tight end who will face consistently tough defenses in 2009 .
We ’ve lately been having a discussion in this country about freedom , and an old friend from “ across the pond ” had a few thoughts on the matter .
I exercised some freedom today .
At about midday , I took one of the PA ’s from my office to the bookies as she wanted to lay a bet on the Football ( yeah yeah , soccer ) and had never been in a betting shop before .
Learning how to place a bet is almost a rite of passage
in the UK .
Bookies are very intimidating if you do n’t have a clue how it all works and , apart from Grand National day , no - one is there to help .
You either know it or you do n’t .
Hence I went along to explain the magic of accumulators and doubles from three .
Whilst in there , I had a little punt on a horse race and ended up losing a fiver – such is life .
I ’m no expert on the US but friends who have spent time across the pond suggest that laying a bet in most states of the US is slightly more complex than popping across the road .
Conversely , I expect a visitor to the UK from the US would find it very odd that the only way to get a gun in the UK is either jump through hoops with the Government to ( maybe ) get a shotgun license or else head off to the black market .
Ah freedom and your different flavours .
As a result , it always worries me when you hear someone banging on about protecting your freedom as no- one can define what freedom means universally .
I ’m glad I ’ve got the freedom to waste my hard earned money on a broken down nag in the 12.50 at Kempton .
I do n’t have the freedom to own a gun but , to be honest , I do n’t want to .
I ’m glad I ’ve got the freedom to choose to get private healthcare if I want to pay for it .
Christ , I work for a company that provides private healthcare insurance .
But I ’m also glad that , whenever I need it , I have whatever healthcare I need free at the point of delivery .
Yeah , no - one makes any money out of the NHS , which I suppose means the private sectors freedom to profit is reduced , but it gives the population of the UK the freedom not to worry about how much it will cost to fall ill .
Whenever you hear someone saying they are protecting freedom I feel it ’s appropriate to put your hand up and politely ask whose freedom they are protecting .

Anti-Abortion Strategy in the Age of Obama
| Printer Friendly
Democrats for Life posters at the 2006 March for Life .
It did n’t turn out like they had planned .
Two decades of political investment by the antiabortion movement and the Religious Right did not result in the overturning of Roe v. Wade .
Even conservative Chief Justice John Roberts acknowledged during his confirmation hearing , “ Roe v. Wade is the settled law of the land . ”
Then the rising prospects of the Democratic Party , and the historic election of the prochoice president Barack Obama and a Democratic Congress , seemed to have secured Roe for the foreseeable future .
But due to the success of the notion of “ abortion reduction , ” the general approach driving the politics of the antiabortion movement for at least two decades , all has not been lost . [ 1 ]
A broad strategy to reduce the number of abortions performed in the United States has been pursued by most of the movement , although there are disagreements about how to do it , notably over violence and other criminal acts .
The tactics employed fall under three broad categories : erecting legal obstacles to abortion at the state level such as mandatory waiting periods ; preventing the use of public funds for the provision of abortion care at all levels of government ; and political , legal , and extralegal interference with obtaining and providing abortion care , which includes harassment of patients and clinic staff , violence and threats of violence .
A goal of the last tactic is to get doctors to abandon the practice and discourage new doctors from including abortion as part of standard ob / gyn practice .
“ We have opportunities before us which if properly exploited , ” declared militant strategist Mark Crutcher , of Life Dynamics in 1992 , “ could result in an America where abortion may be perfectly legal , but no one can get one . ” [ 2 ]
In the mid-90s , the mainstream of the anti-abortion movement found itself in crisis in the wake of a high profile assassination of doctors and clinic staff in Florida , Massachusetts and Canada ; an escalation of death threats , bomb and anthrax threats as well as actual bombings and arsons .
Movement leaders were beset by an unflattering media circus in the wake of the incendiary claims of some that the murder of abortion providers was “ justifiable homicide . ” [ 3 ]
What ’s more , many proponents of anti-abortion violence shared the anti-government ideology and revolutionary rhetoric of the Christian Patriot and militia movement of the era .
They saw legal abortion as violence waged against the people by an increasingly secular and tyrannical government . [ 4 ]
Then , as now , there was a prochoice Democratic president , and the end of legal abortion was nowhere on the horizon .
In the wake of the 2009 assassination of prominent abortion provider Dr. George Tiller by a veteran of both the Patriot movement and militant antiabortion activism , and a dramatic escalation in militant antiabortion activism and violent rhetoric , the movement finds itself in an analogous situation today [ 5 ]
As in the 1990s , steady efforts to reduce access to abortion provides a viable , incremental , way forward for the movement as it copes with the climate as well as actual violence promoted by their co-belligerents in the war on abortion .
But there is also an important difference .
Battleground Democratic Party
The anti-abortion movement could not have anticipated that elements of the prochoice Democratic Party would promote policy in their direction just at the moment of the Democrats ’ political ascendance .
Although there had been rumblings and debate , [ 6 ] the first real indication of this move was during the election campaign of 2006 , when the centrist , business - funded think tank Third Way advised Democratic candidates to try to neutralize the issue by saying , “ We must reduce the number of abortions while protecting personal liberties . ” [ 7 ]
They claimed to want to appeal to anti-abortion Roman Catholics and conservative evangelicals as part of the party ’s various “ faith outreach ” efforts .
However this approach to finding common ground required turning a blind eye to the reality that access to abortion care in the U.S. is receding , and that their approach mainstreams a fundamental concept of anti-abortion strategy and related terminology .
They did this by recasting contraception and sex education as if their primary purpose was to achieve the goal of reducing the number of abortions .
Further , this approach to common groundism accompanied by an effort to “ dial down ” the rancor of the so - called culture , led the Democratic Party and its presidential candidate to seek if not a reduction in the number of abortions , a reduction in the “ need ” for abortion through public policy that supports women so that they are less likely to become pregnant , or so they enjoy support if they do become pregnant . [ 8 ]
This notion of “ abortion reduction ” and its close variants were at the heart of a number of Congressional legislative proposals in 2009 , none of which gained much support .
The bill most favored by Democratic advocates of “ common ground ” on abortion , “ Preventing Unintended Pregnancies , Reducing the Need for Abortion and Supporting Parents Act , ” ( best known as the Ryan - DeLauro bill ) was introduced with much fanfare and enjoyed the support of leading prochoice organizations , and some prolife groups and individuals – but it attracted not a single significant prolife advocacy group or any major prolife religious leaders or organizations .
As if to underscore the lack of political viability of this approach , prolife Congressman Tim Ryan , the Ohio Democrat , says he was “ booted ” from the advisory board of Democrats for Life for taking the lead with the prochoice Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut in sponsoring the bill . [ 9 ]
What ’s more , with some minor exceptions , the large Roman Catholic wing of the anti-abortion movement would not sign on because , while some conservative Protestant evangelicals view contraception as an acceptable way of preventing unwanted pregnancies and thus abortion , few Roman Catholic leaders take that view .
Douglas Johnson of the heavily Catholic National Right to Life Committee , for example , has repeatedly called the president ’s efforts at finding common ground on abortion a “ scam . ” [ 10 ]
If , as seems likely , given the 2009 legislative standoff , there will be little in the way of change in abortion policy coming out of Washington any time soon , the public policy action for the anti-abortion movement will be in the states , where it has most been for two decades .
What ’s more , the issue of “ conscience clause ” exemptions from acknowledgment , let alone provision of abortion in reproductive health care , will continue to be vigorously pursued by the anti-abortion movement both in federal policy and in the states .
This will likely remain a serious fissure in “ common ground ” conversation in the current and likely ongoing efforts to reform the health care system in the U.S. Indeed , at this writing , anti-abortion advocates are seeking to expand the opportunities for health care providers to opt out of providing , and even health insurers from covering , abortion care .
What ’s Past Is Prologue
The standoff over the Ryan - DeLauro must have been a disappointment for advocates of the “ common ground ” abortion reduction agenda that emerged in 2009 , sponsored jointly by Third Way and the liberal think tank Faith in Public Life , an offshoot of the Democratic Party oriented Center for American Progress .
Their paper was titled : Come Let Us Reason Together : A Governing Agenda to End the Culture Wars ( CLURT ) .
Ostensibly moderate evangelicals David Gushee , formerly of Southern Baptist Seminary ; Reverend Jim Wallis of Sojourners , and Ron Sider of Evangelicals for Social Action played important roles in the development of the manifesto .
CLURT highlighted sexuality education ( with an emphasis on abstinence ) and access to contraception , in addition to economic supports for women and improved adoption options as areas of “ common ground ” on abortion .
All these elements , though , were missing from its landmark predecessor , the anti-abortion , bipartisan but Republican - oriented manifesto from the 1990s , The America We Seek : A Statement of Pro-Life Principle and Concern , of which Gushee was the principal author . [ 11 ]
( See sidebar . )
This was the mainstream antiabortion leaders ’s effort to salvage the movement ’s focus and credibility , partly in response to the public backlash against the assassination of doctors and other violence .
CLURT represented a certain hybrid of traditional progressive approaches and elements of the 1990s anti-abortion agenda – but its signature approach was the idea ( and borrowing the language ) of abortion reduction as a policy goal on which both sides could supposedly find common ground . [ 12 ]
But CLURT avoided discussing issues of access , and barriers to abortion care , key areas where the anti-abortion movement has gained ground since the 1990s through its state and local - level incremental political strategy of forcing waiting periods and the like on those seeking abortions .
" Public policy has its limits , " David Gushee declared at the January 15th press conference announcing CLURT , which was hosted by Faith in Public Life and Third Way .
" We call for abortion reduction .
I support this because I believe that one of the things that must not be done to human beings is to abort them ; and yet those facing crisis pregnancies need help to create the conditions in which they can sustain and protect the lives for which they are now responsible . " [ 13 ]
Rachel Laser of Third Way summarized the point on behalf of the group : Reducing abortions through addressing the root causes of abortion .
The policies in our shared agenda prevent unintended pregnancies and support pregnant women and new families ; they do not ban or even restrict legal access to abortion in any way .
They include but are not limited to comprehensive sex education , increased access to contraception for low - income women , expanded health care coverage for pregnant women and children , and support for pregnant and parenting students , and for adoption . [ 14 ]
[ Emphasis in the original ]
The CLURT authors had , as shown above , blurred the careful wording of the 2008 Democratic Party platform position on abortion that rejected language emphasizing reducing the number of abortions in favor of emphasizing the right to choose and reducing the need for abortion .
The platform also called for greater support for women who seek to carry their pregnancies to term and for better adoption options .
The White House Office of Faith Based and Neighborhood Partnerships ( OFBNP ) embraced this general thinking in its mission statement posted on the White House web site : “ It will be one voice among several in the administration that will look at how we support women and children , address teenage pregnancy , and reduce the need for abortion . ”
Gloria Feldt , a past president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America , warned that the anti-abortion , abortion - reduction agenda was being further enshrined by the courts .
This won attention from Wendy Wright of Concerned Women for America , ( formerly a militant leader in Operation Rescue ) who misleadingly ( but perhaps understandably so ) , claimed that the Office of Faith Based and Neighborhood Partnerships “ is now tasked with reducing the number of abortions – something that pro-life groups have very good experience in accomplishing . ”
She then restated a key element of the abortion reduction agenda , “ Pregnancy resource centers and regulations on abortion have a terrific track record in helping women choose alternatives to abortion .
Funding abortion or abortion providers is one of the worst things that could be done . ” [ 15 ]
Meanwhile , Gloria Feldt , a past president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America , warned that the abortion - reduction agenda was being further enshrined by the federal courts .
“ A cascade of more than 30 post - Roe Supreme Court decisions — starting with 1980 ’s Harris v. McRae ( upholding the Hyde Amendment ’s prohibition on Medicaid abortion coverage ) through Planned Parenthood v. Casey ( allowing legislatures to restrict abortion in any way that does not create an “ undue burden ” ) — laid a smooth path for 2007 ’s Gonzales v. Carhart decision , which upheld the first ever federal abortion ban ( misnamed the Partial Birth Abortion Act ) .
The Roberts Court reversed its often - reaffirmed precedent that women ’s health is paramount in abortion law , and it used anti-abortion code language to signal that it will likely allow states and Congress to limit women ’s reproductive rights further . ” [ 16 ]
Roman Catholics and “ Common Ground ”
The spectacle of about 70 Catholic Bishops denouncing the decision of Notre Dame to invite president Obama to speak –solely because he is prochoice – may be a bellwether .
While Gushee and some prolife evangelicals can accept targeting federal funds for improved family planning and sexuality education on the prevention side of pregnancy – key parts of the common ground strategy – few Roman Catholic leaders will ever go along .
The U.S Conference of Catholic Bishops , ( USCCB ) has opposed legislative efforts to enhance access to contraception even though it is well established as the most reliable way to prevent unintended pregnancies .
Deirdre McQuade , assistant director of policy and communications at the “ pro-life secretariat , ” of the Bishops ’ Conference told U.S. News and World Report : “ The phrase ‘ reducing the need for abortion ’ is not a common - ground phrase .
We would say that there is no need for abortion , that abortions are signs that we have not met the needs of women .
There is no authentic need for abortion . ” [ 17 ]
Pushing the divide even wider , ever larger numbers of Catholic Bishops are taking aggressive stances against prochoice politicians , refusing communion , publicly declaring their stances on abortion , stem cell research and LGTB civil rights as not only at odds with Catholic teaching , but “ anti-Catholic . ”
The most recent elected official to receive such treatment was Rep. Patrick Kennedy ( D - RI ) son of the late Sen .
Ted Kennedy .
But the spectacle of about 70 Catholic Bishops [ 18 ] denouncing the decision of Notre Dame to invite president Obama to speak last year – solely because he is prochoice – may be a bellwether .
Several American Cardinals and a third of the American Bishops are due to retire in the next few years , providing the opportunity for Pope Benedict XVI to set an even more profoundly “ theologically orthodox ” direction for the American church for a generation . [ 19 ]
Religious Supremacism , or You Can’t Be Prochoice and Religious David Gushee himself later aired doubts about the entire Democratic common ground project . [ 20 ]
What ’s more , he indicated to journalist Sarah Posner , he has not abandoned the long - term goal of criminalization , stating that “ the principles articulated [ in The America We Seek ] still reflect my own views . ” [ 21 ]
Integral to the approach of a wide swath of the movement is their embrace of religious supremacism .
This aspect of ideological anti-abortionism , which is even held by such supposed moderates as Gushee , may pose an unbridgeable chasm in ever finding any actual common ground .
This is evident in Gushee ’s subtle , but ominous , warning on the op - ed page of USA Today soon after President Obama took office .
The occasion was Obama ’s expected lifting of the Bush - era executive order barring federal funding of international family planning groups that support abortion and embryonic stem cell research . [ 22 ]
“ I do confess , ” Gushee declared , “ that my desire to retain good relationships with the Obama team has tempted me to give what was asked in return for the big payoff of a serious abortion - reduction initiative that I could wholeheartedly support . ”
Gushee wrote that he does not want to sacrifice principles in order to ensure access to power and he found himself struggling with what he saw as the reality that his side might lose on other aspects of abortion policy “ for a long time to come . ”
He is worried that taxpayer funds might be used to pay for abortion services in violation of the “ sacred beliefs ” of his movement ’s members .
He is also worried that tax - exemption or taxpayer subsidies for religious institutions and anti-abortion health professionals could be jeopardized if they are “ required as a condition of accreditation , or employment , or contact with federal dollars , to actively facilitate or perform deeds that their conscience forbids them from doing . ”
“ And if we lose there , ” he dramatically concluded , “ then the entire relationship between religious faith and American society will move into a period of profound crisis . ”
[ Emphasis added ]
Gushee has neatly expressed , here , the religious supremacism that remains a distinguishing feature of the anti-abortion movement .
We can hear it in their refusal to acknowledge that the vast majority of Christians , Jews and others – as well as clear majorities of Americans , see abortion as a moral choice . [ 23 ]
Their unambiguous implication is that anyone who is prochoice cannot be religious . [ 24 ]
We increasingly hear such expressions not only from well known leaders of the Religious Right , but from ostensibly moderate and liberal Roman Catholic and evangelical abortion opponents .
Two liberal Roman Catholic advocates for abortion reduction gave us a high profile and exceptionally clear example in a 2009 op - ed in The Cleveland Plain Dealer .
“ Secular progressives who view access to abortion as a fundamental right ” are , in their formulation , pitted against “ religious Americans who believe it is a profound threat to the sanctity of life ... ” [ 25 ]
Underscoring the stark distortion of such views is the fact that most of the major institutions of mainline Protestantism and the major bodies of Judaism , among others , are officially prochoice and are members of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice ( RCRC ) .
The conflation of anti-abortionism with religion itself , and the prochoice view as inherently nonreligious , or “ secular , ” sets the stage for a one - sided conflict that goes far beyond matters of incivility , or “ rancor . ”
This situation has had consequences far beyond the issue at hand .
As we have reported in The Public Eye , for example , there has been a quarter century of organized assault on the prochoice mainline Protestant churches . [ 26 ]
Rightwing outside interests , working with conservative dissident factions , have used abortion and homosexuality as wedge issues to keep prochoice , progressive Protestant denominations in turmoil and headed for schism .
This has widened the opening for conservative Catholicism and evangelicalism to increasingly displace them at the center of American culture .
These efforts have been led , in part , by some of the same neoconservative Catholic leaders behind The America We Seek . [ 27 ]
Public Financing of Abortion Another stumbling block for the common ground alliance is the anti-abortion movement ’s opposition to public funding of organizations with expertise in birth control and sexuality education but that also provide abortions , even if the funded project has nothing to do with abortion .
As journalist Adele Stan has detailed in The Public Eye , a wide swath of the anti-abortion movement , Catholic and non-Catholic , is ratcheting up its longtime campaign against Planned Parenthood by seeking to thwart public sector grants and contracts at all levels , no matter what the grants and contracts are for . [ 28 ]
This revived coalition was sparked by the opening of a new clinic in Aurora , Illinois after a bitter battle .
But the war of attrition has also had successes .
In Orange County , California a $ 300,000 health and sexuality education grant to the local Planned Parenthood was cancelled by a unanimous vote of the Board of Supervisors .
County Supervisor John Moorlach told The Los Angeles Times , “ I personally have a problem with government funding of an organization that provides abortion services . ” [ 29 ]
The looming intertwined issue of public financing of abortion and services deemed to be related to abortion is not new and dates back to the 1970s and the Hyde Amendment , which barred Medicaid and other federal funding of abortion in 1976 .
In fact , you could call Hyde the first volley in the abortion reduction strategy .
Before the Hyde Amendment , about a third of all abortions performed in the United States were for poor women on Medicaid .
" No other medical procedure was singled out for exclusion , " the National Network of Abortion Funds ( NNAF ) reported .
" Today , 33 states have followed suit , prohibiting state Medicaid funding as well . "
All but one of these states ( South Dakota ) follows the Hyde exceptions of rape , incest , or life endangerment .
The report details the disproportionate burdens placed on disadvantaged women , and observes that “ women of color disproportionately depend on such coverage , making abortion funding a matter of racial justice as well as economic justice and women ’s rights . ” [ 30 ]
But the federal restrictions did not stop there .
Over the years , Congress has also legislated against access to abortion services for women in the military and Peace Corps , disabled women , residents of the District of Columbia , federal prisoners , and women covered by the Indian Health Service .
Indeed , it could be fairly argued that except for the legal right to an abortion , federal policies constitute the greatest abortion reduction program of all .
" Prior to 1996 , " states the NNAF report , " legal immigrants and U.S. citizens were equally eligible for Medicaid . "
But the 1996 welfare reform law signed by President Clinton required a five - year waiting period before most new legal immigrants could even apply .
Less than half of the states fill in the five year gap with their own funds , and nine states permanently deny Medicaid coverage to noncitizen residents .
As of this writing , House Democrats passed a health care reform bill that would extend the principles of the Hyde Amendment to proposed overhaul of the health care system , and further block federal subsidies for private health insurance that covers abortion care .
While President Obama reportedly opposed the move , he told Katie Couric on the CBS Evening News in July that there is a “ tradition ” in Washington “ of not financing abortions as part of government funded health care . ” [ 31 ]
Obama ’s approach to common ground on abortion in the health care debate has been advanced under the rubric of seeking to keep the legislation “ neutral ” on abortion .
But but anti-abortion legislators in both parties argue that some funds might go to subsidize abortions covered under private insurance .
A spokesman for the USCCB told The New York Times , “ The concerns are kind of intractable . ” [ 32 ]
Prochoice leaders point out that without the subsidies , private insurers , which already cover abortions , might no longer do so .
Obama and others , perhaps gulled by their efforts to find common ground , were taken by surprise that Hyde operating as the default principle guiding public programs does not go far enough for the USCCB and many antiabortion Democrats who support universal health care .
All appeared willing to sacrifice it over arguably minor issues of the commingling of private and public funds that might touch on abortion .
Defenders of abortion rights might rightly worry that “ conscience clauses " could also be said to have a venerable history .
The original conscience clause legislation passed in 1973 in the wake of Roe " states that public officials may not require individuals or entities who receive certain public funds to perform abortion or sterilization procedures or to make facilities or personnel available for the performance of such procedures if such performance “ would be contrary to [ the individual or entity ’s ] religious beliefs or moral convictions . ” [ 33 ]
This provision has allowed even major medical facilities such as Roman Catholic hospitals to refuse to deal with abortions without jeopardizing their ability to receive public grants and contracts or affect their tax exempt status .
A new rule promulgated late in the Bush administration expanded and particularized the exemptions , stating that health workers may even refuse to provide information or advice regarding abortion .
The Obama administration has rescinded the Bush rule , but says it plans to leave some kind “ reasonable ” exemptions in place .
What we see now is a far ranging effort on the part of anti-abortion forces to use conscience clauses as a wedge , pitting religious supremacist notions of religious freedom against the civil , human , and even religious rights of others .
What ’s missing ?
Anti-abortion leaders know that state - level barriers to access have reduced the number of abortions , and that any advance in abortion coverage in the current health care reform debate or improved access in any way would be a reversal of their fortunes .
Abortion services are unavailable in 87 % of the counties in the United States , according to a study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute . [ 34 ]
Prochoice leaders recognize the situation as well .
NARAL reports that “ more than 500 anti-choice measures have been enacted in the states since 1995 ” and that in effect these measures , all legal under Casey , are “ essentially rolling back this fundamental right for many women . "
Such laws are known as TRAP laws ( Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers ) .
These include , among others , abortion bans after 12 weeks , counseling with an antiabortion slant , mandatory delays , insurance prohibitions for abortion , and allowing health care providers such as hospitals to refuse to provide medical services and referrals .
In 2009 , improved access was nowhere on the national political or legislative agenda in Washington , apparently so that fighting over abortion would not derail health care reform .
Even some prochoice groups and legislators went along with this .
The key piece of prochoice legislation is the Freedom of Choice Act , ( FOCA ) which has been introduced in every Congress since 1989 .
FOCA would codify Roe v. Wade , and eliminate the legal barriers to access .
That is why the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and leading antiabortion groups waged a vigorous preemptive lobbying campaign before the new Congress was seated in 2009 .
All year ( and as recently as December 2nd ) the conservative weekly Human Events issued screeching fundraising letters signed by Mike Huckabee warning about “ this EVIL law ” ( sic ) , which he described as “ the most radical piece of pro-abortion legislation ever proposed . ”
In fact , the bill was not even introduced in the 111th Congress – even though President Obama had previously said he would sign it if it reached his desk .
But the reality of the Washington moment does not alter anyone ’s understanding of the stakes .
Matt Bowman of the Alliance Defense Fund , ( the leading legal strategy group of the Religious Right ) said : “ FOCA will strike down other laws , state and federal , that reduce abortions , ” he declared , “ and will force states to facilitate abortions ....
125,000 children that were not killed this year because we have these laws , and 125,000 children ( added to the existing 1.3 million abortions ) who will be killed in 2009 and every year after if FOCA is passed .
FOCA is indeed a staggering expansion of abortion , both in principle and in actual lives lost . ” [ 35 ]
The Feminist Majority Foundation ’s annual survey on clinic violence found that in 2008 , " one in five clinics experienced severe violence . "
A 2009 Washington
Post story on post - Casey abortion reduction policy battles in the states underscored the effectiveness of the TRAP laws .
The article focuses on Mississippi as an example of “ one of the most restrictive states in the country and a model for antiabortion forces elsewhere . ”
Women seeking abortions “ must go twice to the clinic , at least 24 hours apart . ”
This can be significant in terms of travel time and costs since Mississippi , which used to have six clinics , now has only one .
The Chicago - based Americans United for Life , a key anti-abortion legal strategy center , takes credit for “ helping state after state become more pro-life every year . ”
“ The greater goal , even in legislation , is to influence the culture , ” said Terri Herring , head of Mississippi ’s Pro-Life America Network .
“ This is a major culture war that is n’t going away . ” [ 36 ]
All this is occurring in a hostile and sometimes violent environment for abortion providers .
The Feminist Majority Foundation ’s annual survey on clinic violence found that in 2008 , “ one in five clinics experienced severe violence .
The most common severe forms of violence reported in 2008 include blockades , facility invasions , and stalking .
They list a host of harassments faced by patients and staff in 2008 from death threats and bomb threats to vandalism , home picketing , and break - ins .
Unsurprisingly , the Feminist Majority Foundation also reports that the number of abortion providers has dramatically declined : from 739 in 2005 to 683 in 2008 . [ 37 ]
In short : Barriers to access are up ; the number of abortion providers is down ; and the only legislative remedy is stalled in Congress with its future uncertain .
Conclusion
As a practical matter , militants like Mark Crutcher and advocates of incrementalism via policies that advance abortion reduction do not disagree on ends so much as means .
But it should be noted that Crutcher and his ilk are not going to “ dial down ” their rhetoric or their activities just because some people would prefer that they do so .
“ Obviously , we cannot look for common ground with these people ; ” Crutcher declared in 2006 , “ without giving the impression that even we believe their position has at least some moral legitimacy .
It would be no different than if representatives of the Jewish people would have agreed to sit down and look for common ground with the Nazis while the ovens at Auschwitz were burning day and night .
The Nazis would have loved it because it would have given moral credibility to their position .
” “ When we agree to look for ways to reduce the “ need for abortion , ” he continued , ( making the same point at the spokesperson for the Catholic Bishops quoted above , ) “ by definition we are conceding that such a need exists .
After all , rational people do n’t go looking for something unless they believe it actually exists .
In other words , when we engage in common ground discussions we reinforce one of the abortion lobby ’s fundamental arguments . ” [ 38 ]
The strategy of the antiabortion movement , which like any other movement is never homogeneous , has nevertheless changed little since the 1990s when abortion reduction became , in all of its variants , a major thrust of the movement .
Political realism on the part of both militants and pragmatists , the reality of the steady decline in the number of abortion providers , and the increase in state level obstacles make Mark Crutcher ’s aphorism of the 1990s as true today as it was in 1992 .

The America We Seek and the Origins of Abortion Reduction
The general approach crystallized over several months in early 1996 when 45 antiabortion and religious right leaders , organized by the neoconservative Ethics and Public Policy Center , formally adopted abortion reduction as a series of related tactics short of criminalization . [ 39 ]
Their manifesto , The America We Seek : A Statement of Pro-Life Principle and Concern was published in the flagship journal of Roman Catholic neoconservatism , First Things .
The writers were inspired by the 1992 Supreme Court decision in Casey v. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania , which ratified the state level laws seeking to discourage abortion by making the procedure more difficult to obtain . [ 40 ]
“ Now , as pro-life leaders and scholars , ” they declared , “ we want to propose a program of action … ”
And the core of that program was abortion reduction via the erection of barriers to abortion access “ in all 50 states ” while also creating incentives for women to carry unplanned pregnancies to term .
While they understood that the legal obstacles upheld in the Casey decision “ do not afford any direct legal protection to the unborn child , ” they stated that “ experience has shown that such regulations — genuine informed consent , waiting periods , parental notification — reduce abortions in a locality , especially when coupled with positive efforts to promote alternatives to abortion and service to women in crisis . ”
[ Emphasis added ]
Under the gun to distance themselves from the anti-abortion violence of the era , anti-abortion leaders had found a way to hold to a credible political strategy that conveyed a sufficient urgency .
Nevertheless , they struggled with the emotional and political disconnect between the demagogic , if heartfelt , “ bloody shirt ” type rhetoric ( i.e. : abortion is “ murder ” or a “ holocaust ” ) and the moderate , incremental policy ideas of abortion reduction .
They declared , for example , that abortion “ has killed tens of millions of unborn children , ” but that they were nevertheless committed to abortion reduction and providing “ the infrastructure for “ alternatives ” to abortion via a national network of 3,000 “ Crisis Pregnancy Centers . ”
More consistent with their sense of moral urgency , was their referencing bills then being considered in Congress that would involve “ criminal sanctions ” for abortion providers , and demanded that Congress “ recognize the unborn child as a human person entitled to the protection of the Constitution . ”
The America they seek is one whose politics and public policy advances reduce abortions while seeking to build political clout sufficient to criminalize abortion forever .
But they recognized that while criminalization was unlikely in their lifetimes , they were not then , and are not now , without options .
But of course , the tension remains , and the state level campaigns aimed at constitutional declarations of fetal personhood and thus challenges to the constitutionality of Roe , are ongoing .
The authors of The America We Seek were a bipartisan group of significant leaders led by host George Weigel of the Ethics and Public Policy Center ( the official biographer of Pope John Paul II ) and included Roman Catholic legal scholars Robert P. George of Princeton and Mary Ann Glendon of Harvard ( whom George W. Bush would appoint as Ambassador to the Vatican ) , Father Frank Pavone of Priests for Life ; Clarke D. Forsythe of Americans United for Life ; James Dobson of Focus on the Family ; Ralph Reed of the then - powerful Christian Coalition , Beverly LaHaye of Concerned Women for America ; William Kristol , former Chief of Staff to Vice President Dan Quayle ; Phillip E. Johnson founder of the theocratic think tank of the “ intelligent design ” theory , Discovery Institute ; Jean Bethke Elshtain , a political philosopher at the University of Chicago , and currently a cochair of the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life ; and former Gov. Robert P. Casey , ( D - PA ) .
Three of this group later played pivotal roles in the development of Third Way ’s Come Let Us Reason Together document outlining an abortion reduction plan for the Democrats : David Gushee , then of Southern Baptist Seminary ; Reverend Jim Wallis of Sojourners ; and Ron Sider of Evangelicals for Social Action .
Today in tiny Frazee , Minn. , Tyler Shipman will do what lots of 18 - year - olds love to do .
He 'll test out his prized possession , a fully restored 1986 yellow - and - black Pontiac Fiero .
He 'll likely wish he were in the driver 's seat , but the plan is for his dad , Jay , to have that honor .
This simple drive will be a cause for celebration for people from Frazee to Iraq .
Tyler , " a total Fiero - head " and senior at Frazee High School , began experiencing severe back pain last summer .
In early October , he was diagnosed with Synovial Sarcoma , a rare and aggressive form of cancer that primarily affects young adults .
After receiving two rounds of chemotherapy in Fargo , N.D. , Tyler is home now , on hospice , with his parents , Jay and Daneele , and siblings , 10 - year - old brother Carter , and 8 - year - old sister Cassidy .
He also has a 21 - year - old half - sister , Tiffany .
After receiving the diagnosis , Tyler panicked about burdening them with his car - restoration project .
On Oct. 29 , he posted a plea on the popular Pennock 's Fiero Forum website , under the heading " Got cancer now and looking for help . "
" Hey guys , I have an 86 Fiero GT that I 've been slowly fixing up ... and I 'm just trying to find some way to get it restored before I pass .
I love this car . "
The first person to respond was far from Frazee , population 1,300 .
He was Sgt. Andrew Weigle , of Pennsylvania , serving in Iraq with an assault helicopter battalion .
" Dude , I am sorry to hear about your situation .
And I would have the same feeling about my Fiero ... I am going to have some time off when I get back home from this place in January .
I MIGHT be able to convince the wife for a road trip to help you out for a weekend ... make a list of parts you need . "
Others jumped in , with money , parts and prayers .
" I am an auto mechanic and own a Fiero , so I know my way around cars , " wrote one .
" I have a nice Alpine CDA - 9851 unit ( MP3 , Motorized Tilt Face and whatnot ) to put in ... , " wrote another .
" I hope and pray for the best for you dude , " wrote a third .
A plan took shape .
Fiero - heads in Minnesota , California , Florida and Texas would collect all the necessary parts , then gather in Frazee , 10 miles east of Detroit Lakes , from Friday to today and restore Tyler 's car to mint condition .
One of them was Chris Kliewer of Inver Grove Heights , who arrived Friday .
Kliewer , 31 , works in I.T. for 3M .
Tyler 's story ( www.tylerstoy.com) touched him deeply .
" I saw all these people willing to reach out and no one really knew how to do that , " Kliewer said .
He volunteered to handle Paypal transactions , which are now close to $ 1,500 .
Kliewer also started making calls to local businesses .
The Detroit Lakes Tires Plus offered to install performance brakes .
Local motels slashed their prices .
Dave and Karen Gray , owner of Frazee Auto Body and Glass , covered the cost of painting the formerly white car yellow with black accents .
Tyler felt good enough recently to come to the shop and pick out the paint chips himself , Karen said .
" We 're parents , too , " Karen said .
" If something like this were to happen to one of our children , we would find comfort in the well - wishes of people we did n't know well .
It hits home and it hits pretty hard . "
The car now sports new interior panels , a keyless entry , new leather seats , tinted windows and a rare original trunk gasket .
" Somebody got their hands on the last two [ gaskets ] and is donating one , " Kliewer said .
A " Fiero guy " from Iowa is bringing up two newly built headlight motors for reliability down the road , he added .
The " reveal " is scheduled for 9:30 this morning at the Frazee High School garage .
Mother Daneele , 38 , said the effort has been " mind - boggling .
None of these guys has ever met Tyler , except for online .
As many bad things as you hear about the Internet , it 's also a really great way of having a bigger community than just what you live in physically . "
I write words about stuff and things .
You should read it .

KANSAS CITY ( Reuters ) -
The rapid adoption by U.S. farmers of genetically engineered corn , soybeans and cotton has promoted increased use of pesticides , an epidemic of herbicide - resistant weeds and more chemical residues in foods , according to a report issued Tuesday by health and environmental protection groups .
The groups said research showed that herbicide use grew by 383 million pounds from 1996 to 2008 , with 46 percent of the total increase occurring in 2007 and 2008 .
The report was released by nonprofits The Organic Center ( TOC ) , the Union for Concerned Scientists ( UCS ) and the Center for Food Safety ( CFS ) .
The groups said that while herbicide use has climbed , insecticide use has dropped because of biotech crops .
They said adoption of genetically engineered corn and cotton that carry traits resistant to insects has led to a reduction in insecticide use by 64 million pounds since 1996 .
Still , that leaves a net overall increase on U.S. farm fields of 318 million pounds of pesticides , which includes insecticides and herbicides , over the first 13 years of commercial use .
The rise in herbicide use comes as U.S. farmers increasingly adopt corn , soy and cotton that have been engineered with traits that allow them to tolerate dousings of weed killer .
The most popular of these are known as “ Roundup Ready ” for their ability to sustain treatments with Roundup herbicide and are developed and marketed by world seed industry leader Monsanto Co .
Monsanto rolled out the first biotech crop , Roundup Ready soybeans , in 1996 .
Monsanto officials declined to comment on the report .
But the Biotechnology Industry Organization , of which Monsanto is a member , said the popularity of herbicide - resistant crops showed their value outweighs any associated detriments .
“ Herbicide resistance crops are incredibly popular with farmers .
They help them manage their weed problems in ways traditional crops don’t , ” said Mike Wach , BIO managing director of science and regulatory affairs .
“ If a farmer feels a crop is causing them more trouble than it is worth they will stop using it , ” Wach said .
“ Farmers are continuing to adopt these crops because they provide benefits , not liabilities and problems . ”
BIO officials pointed to a report issued earlier this year by PG Economics Ltd that said the volume of herbicides used in biotech soybean crops globally decreased by 161 million pounds , or 4.6 percent , from 1996 to 2007 .
The report by the environmental groups states that a key problem resulting from the increase in herbicide use is the emergence of “ super weeds , ” which are difficult to kill because they have become resistant to the herbicides .
“ With glyphosate - resistant weeds now infesting millions of acres , farmers face rising costs coupled with sometimes major yield losses , and the environmental impact of weed management systems will surely rise , ” said Charles Benbrook , chief scientist of The Organic Center .
The groups additionally criticized the agricultural biotechnology industry for claiming that higher costs for genetically engineered seeds are justified by multiple benefits to farmers , including decreased spending on pesticides .
The group said biotech corn seed prices in 2010 could be almost three times the cost of conventional seed , while new enhanced biotech soybean seed for 2010 could be 42 percent more than the original biotech version .
“ This report confirms what we ’ve been saying for years , ” said Bill Freese , science policy analyst for the Center for Food Safety .
“ The most common type of genetically engineered crops promotes increased use of pesticides , an epidemic of resistant weeds , and more chemical residues in our foods .
This may be profitable for the biotech / pesticide companies , but it ’s bad news for farmers , human health and the environment . ”
DUBAI ( Reuters ) - The “ Dubai vision , ” which has suffered a crushing blow from the freewheeling Gulf emirate ’s sudden debt crisis , is the creation of one man who failed to apply the rules of open governance .
Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al - Maktoum ( C ) , Ruler of Dubai and United Arab Emirates ' Vice President , attends the opening ceremony of Metro Dubai September 9 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Dubai Ruler Media Office / Handout
The city state ’s rapid growth revolved around the ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al - Maktoum , who outlined his ideas in a book , “ My Vision , ” where he suggested other Arab countries could replicate Dubai ’s success .
Now the model -- always controversial among Gulf Arabs since it involved building shining cities in the desert at breakneck speed through the import of foreign residents , finance and labor -- is on the ropes .
Questions will surface over what went wrong .
This week Dubai said it wanted to delay payment on billions of dollars of its total $ 80 billion debt , sending global markets plummeting as investors feared defaults could hit the global economy just as it was recovering from the financial crisis .
“ Where next for the ruling family in Dubai ? ” said British historian Christopher Davidson .
“ The massive loss of legitimacy that the ruler is now facing , the massive loss of legitimacy that his son and crown prince face after lying to the World Economic Forum last week -- where do these guys go from here ? ”
Sheikh Mohammed , whose face and words grace posters all over town , told the forum this month that the worst had passed for Dubai which was well - placed to pursue its development plans .
The news that investment vehicle Dubai World could not pay a $ 3.5 billion bond was released just before the Muslim Eid al - Adha holiday and UAE national day on December 2 .
Local media have almost entirely avoided comment on the debacle .
“ Dubai could not be more transparent and open about the challenges it is facing due to the global economic downturn as it has been , ” the English - language Gulf News said .
The Arabic daily al - Khaleej praised the UAE ’s investment climate .
There is uncertainty about what assets are owned personally by the ruling family , directly by the government or simply sponsored either by the ruler or the government .
ENVY OF THE REGION
Dubai was the envy of other Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar , who sought to ape some of Dubai ’s ideas , such as business free zones , financial centers , advanced infrastructure and welcoming Western capital and expertise .
Aside from its more eye - catching projects seen by many as white elephants , such as palm - shaped man-made islands and the world ’s tallest tower , Dubai developed health services , universities , sports facilities and model urban communities .
Ayman Ali , a London - based Arabic press commentator , said the Dubai model , based on Hong Kong and Singapore , forgot it was dealing with a country and not a corporation in becoming a place where many in the Arab world dreamed of living .
“ In the beginning it was aimed at getting rid of bureaucracy and red tape .
It worked fine but if you are building a country you should n’t go on running it like a company , ” he said .
Dubai ran to catch up with business transparency practices in Singapore and Hong Kong , and never even pretended to expand political participation beyond a small group around the ruler .
In an online interview this year that epitomized the progressive image Dubai has tried to present , Sheikh Mohammed rejected the suggestion he was a “ Superman ” who ran the freewheeling emirate alone .
“ The ‘ Superman ’ phenomenon you are talking about does not exist in our organizations and institutions , ” he told the questioner -- before going on to discuss how his poetry and horse - racing fit into his 24 - hour - a - day schedule .
Despite its financial troubles , many still regard Dubai as a pioneer among its neighbors .
“ There was a lack of transparency , yes , but Dubai did something whose model was full liberalism .
They made mistakes and lacked a lot of things but they are in transition , ” said Dubai - based Ibrahim Khayat , a Lebanese strategic business analyst .
“ Singapore has corruption too . ”
Martin Hvidt , a Danish Middle East Studies professor who focuses on Gulf economies , said the concentration of power in the hands of Sheikh Mohammed and a few advisors meant Dubai could take quick action to rectify mistakes .
“ It ’s too early to write Dubai ’s obituary , ” he said .

BEIJING , Nov 18 ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama gave his sternest warning yet about the need to contain rising U.S. deficits , saying on Wednesday that if government debt were to pile up too much , it could lead to a double - dip recession .
With the U.S. unemployment rate at 10.2 percent , Obama told Fox News his administration faces a delicate balance of trying to boost the economy and spur job creation while putting the economy on a path toward long - term deficit reduction .
His administration was considering ways to accelerate economic growth , with tax measures among the options to give companies incentives to hire , Obama said in the interview with Fox conducted in Beijing during his nine - day trip to Asia .
“ It is important though to recognize if we keep on adding to the debt , even in the midst of this recovery , that at some point , people could lose confidence in the U.S. economy in a way that could actually lead to a double - dip recession , ” he said .
Fox News , which released a transcript of the interview , showed that comment by Obama on Wednesday morning and said the full discussion would be broadcast later in the day .

Not this Thatcher ....
A misconstrued text message announcing the passing of a beloved pet has sparked a flurry of diplomatic activity in Canada .
Transport Minister John Baird sent a message reading : " Thatcher has died " .
Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper was soon informed that 84 - year - old former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had passed away .
But it was actually Mr Baird 's beloved cat , named after his political heroine , who had died .
Alive and healthy
The confusion spread around a gala event in Toronto , where some 1,700 luminaries were gathered at a black tie event .
.... but a Thatcher very much like this one
Calls to puzzled officials in both 10 Downing Street and Buckingham Palace followed .
Embarrassed aide Dimitri Soudas had reportedly already started preparing an official statement mourning the passing of the Iron Lady .
He was told that Baroness Thatcher - who just a few days ago attended a Remembrance Day service at London 's Westminster Abbey - was alive and healthy .
" If the cat was n't dead , I 'd have killed it by now , " Mr Soudas is reported to have said of the 16 - year - old grey tabby .

MEXICO CITY 
The man in the hospital bed complained of muscle aches and a fever so high he was sweating into his sheets .
Two other patients , also confirmed to be infected with the swine flu virus , shared a special room with him , cut off from the general population .
“ What bothers me is that they treat us as if we had done something wrong , ” said the man , Néstor Vázquez , 58 , peering out from behind his covers last week .
Nearly six months have passed since Mexico , with the help of laboratories in the United States and Canada , discovered the presence of a mysterious influenza virus , an unknown strain that caused a spike in the number of flu cases at a time of year when they are usually in decline .
Alarmed by the highly contagious new bug , whose lethality was then uncertain , the government closed schools and other public facilities , sent soldiers into the streets to hand out masks and urged Mexicans to cover their mouths if they sneezed or coughed and to forgo handshakes and , especially , kisses on the cheek .
Mexico has had 245 deaths as of this week , helping make up the more than 4,100 deaths around the globe reported to the World Health Organization .
But that is a relatively small number given the widespread contagion .
For now , health experts remain most concerned with stopping the spread and watching for the possibility of the virus ’s mutating into a more lethal strain .
When Google unveiled its open source Chrome OS on Thursday , many commentators were quick to dismiss the new operating system as unimpressive and underwhelming .
Citing everything from the browser interface that represents the entirety of the user experience to its limited hardware support and inability to install apps or play PC games , early critics have slammed Google 's cloud - based OS for being exactly what it is intended to be : lean , fast , and simple .
To my eye , all this criticism appears to miss the point of Chrome OS -- and indeed , the point of most of Google 's services .
Of course , this is nothing new for Google .
Simplicity By Design
At the launch of the company 's eponymous search engine in 1998 , Google stood out from the pack of increasingly cluttered search portals with which it competed .
In a time when leading Internet companies sought to become destinations by loading up their home pages with news , weather , entertainment links , shopping deals , and anything else they could think of , Google took a different tack by presenting a clean , white page with little more than a search field under the site 's name .
I distinctly recall several colleagues scoffing at the simplicity of Google 's home page at the time .
Where were the news articles ?
The stock tickers ?
The pictures of celebrities ?
Why would anyone want a home page consisting of nothing but a search engine ?
Yet Google 's pundit - defying search tool quickly became the home page of choice for millions of users worldwide .
Over time , Google rolled out additional services , including a few built to deliver the very services its home page lacked .
But with every new service it launched , Google retained its characteristic simplicity , putting information -- not splashy design -- at the foreground .
Chrome OS is an obvious extension of Google 's design simplicity , and it's no great surprise that many observers are unimpressed by the sight of it .
It 's little more than a Web browser .
On first glimpse , it 's nearly identical to the Chrome browser that 's currently available for Windows PCs .
And that 's exactly what Google is going for .
The central principle behind Chrome OS is that the browser is the focal point for most computing tasks .
So Google has put it front and center in Chrome , reducing the rest of the operating system down to a minimal Linux kernel that drives only the most essential hardware components for a Web- centric user .
Life in the Cloud
Google has designed Chrome OS as a platform for people who use computers primarily online , and the company is betting that many folks will happily trade their desktop apps for alternatives in the cloud .
Naturally , this wo n't appeal to all users .
I 'd even say it wo n't appeal to most users , at least initially .
But multiple lines of evidence suggest that cloud services are the computing model for the future - - a fact that even desktop - dominant Microsoft has embraced , as it prepares to roll out its Office Live services as a companion to its longstanding desktop suite ( a companion that many savvy users will undoubtedly use in lieu of the desktop suite ) .
What lines of evidence am I talking about ?
Enterprise adoption , device - agnostic work habits , and nearly constant wireless connectivity .
Cloud computing is now a standard business practice worldwide .
For a start , two million companies ( ranging from small mom-and - pop operations to large enterprises like Genentech and Motorola - - use Google Apps for e-mail , document editing , collaboration , scheduling , and intranet hosting .
CRM tools like Salesforce.com are rapidly replacing desktop and client - server application suites for sales teams of all sizes .
Hosting providers like Rackspace are attracting major companies such as Sears , Volvo , and KFC with the promise of cheap , rock - solid server management and storage in the cloud .
Perusing the list of companies that rely on just these few examples pokes a gaping hole in the ill - considered argument that cloud computing is either too flaky or too unsecured for serious business .
At the same time , knowledge workers now operate in a device - agnostic work environment that has old - school desktop PCs working alongside laptops , netbooks , and cell phones on a daily basis .
RIM 's BlackBerry , which has been the leading standard in U.S. smartphones for business since the beginning of this century , has proven beyond all doubt that small mobile devices can do mission - critical work with minimal specs and software .
The launch of the iPhone demonstrated that , armed with a decent Web browser , phones can do more than most of us ever imagined we'd want them to .
Add to this mix the proliferation of netbooks , and you have a world in which millions of users can not only work from anywhere , but also need to keep important data synced between two , three , or even four machines at any given time .
And the best tools for keeping all that data synced , such as SugarSync and Dropbox , are based in the cloud .
Wi-Fi is not ubiquitous , but it 's darned widespread and still rapidly spreading .
Wireless broadband ain't cheap , but it 's getting cheaper all the time .
When I travel , I find myself almost constantly connected to the Web .
With my existing netbook ( which does n't have a 3G card ) , I typically get a wireless connection at the airport , on the plane , in my hotel room , at conference centers , and at any cafes I stop at along the way .
Wireless networks are now so common that I can seldom use lack of connectivity as an excuse to stop working .
If I had a 3G card , I 'd be able to use it in all the in - between places , too , such as taxis , trains , and park benches .
But since I do n't , I use Google Gears to keep my Gmail , Google Docs , and Google Calendar data cached to my local drive for those rare moments when I 'm not online .
Any work I do offline gets synced automatically back to the cloud the next time I connect from anywhere .
My point here is that wireless access has become so nearly constant that the cloud has become the hands - down simplest way to keep everything handy at any given time .
And when I get back to the office and my desktop PC , I can just keep working without worrying about e-mailing files to myself or plugging in USB drives .
Consider , for a moment , a tale of two countries .
Both have suffered a severe recession and lost jobs as a result  but not on the same scale .
In Country A , employment has fallen more than 5 percent , and the unemployment rate has more than doubled .
In Country B , employment has fallen only half a percent , and unemployment is only slightly higher than it was before the crisis .
Do n’t you think Country A might have something to learn from Country B ?
This story is n’t hypothetical .
Country A is the United States , where stocks are up , G.D.P. is rising , but the terrible employment situation just keeps getting worse .
Country B is Germany , which took a hit to its G.D.P. when world trade collapsed , but has been remarkably successful at avoiding mass job losses .
Germany ’s jobs miracle has n’t received much attention in this country  but it ’s real , it ’s striking , and it raises serious questions about whether the U.S. government is doing the right things to fight unemployment .
Here in America , the philosophy behind jobs policy can be summarized as “ if you grow it , they will come . ”
That is , we do n’t really have a jobs policy : we have a G.D.P. policy .
The theory is that by stimulating overall spending we can make G.D.P. grow faster , and this will induce companies to stop firing and resume hiring .
The alternative would be policies that address the job issue more directly .
We could , for example , have New - Deal - style employment programs .
Perhaps such a thing is politically impossible now  Glenn Beck would describe anything like the Works Progress Administration as a plan to recruit pro-Obama brownshirts  but we should note , for the record , that at their peak , the W.P.A. and the Civilian Conservation Corps employed millions of Americans , at relatively low cost to the budget .
( L to R ) Tanvir Hussain , Abdulla Ahmed Ali and Assad Sarwar were found guilty
Three men who plotted to blow up liquid bombs on flights from the UK to North America have been jailed for life , with minimum terms of up to 40 years .
Ringleader Abdulla Ahmed Ali , 28 , was jailed for at least 40 years .
Plot " quartermaster " Assad Sarwar , 29 , must serve at least 36 years , while Tanvir Hussain , 28 , was jailed for at least 32 years at Woolwich Crown Court .
Their aim was a terrorist outrage to " stand alongside " the 9/11 attacks on the US in history , the judge said .
Mr Justice Henriques called the plot " the most grave and wicked conspiracy ever proven within this jurisdiction " .
Home Secretary Alan Johnson said the sentences " reflected the severity of this horrendous plot to kill and maim thousands of people " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" I 'm very pleased the jury gave a sentence that was proportionate to this potential crime , " he said .
" Our police and our national security service is a national asset , they 've proven that again today . "
The trial heard that at the time of his arrest , Ahmed Ali , of Walthamstow , east London , had identified seven US and Canada - bound flights that were to be attacked within a two - and - a - half - hour period .
" I 'm satisfied that there is every likelihood that this plot would have succeeded but for the intervention of the police and the security service , " he said .
" Had this conspiracy not been interrupted , a massive loss of life would almost certainly have resulted - and if the detonation was over land , the number of victims would have been even greater still . "

Dominic Casciani , BBC home affairs reporter Judges follow Court of Appeal sentencing guidelines for terrorism offences .
But in the case of the three airline bomb plotters , Mr Justice Henriques said the " quite exceptional " nature of their " grave and wicked " plan meant he would jail them for longer than other men found guilty of conspiracy .
Abdulla Ahmed
Ali's minimum term of 40 years is the same term as that now being served by the men convicted of the failed London suicide attacks of 21 July 2005 .
They had taken the final step in their plot , but the judge said Ali 's plan was , in fact , more likely to have succeeded .
Ahmed Ali had sparred with the prosecution when he gave evidence - and during the judge 's sentencing , he angrily shook his head several times .
He wanted to die in a " blessed operation " comparable to 9/11 - but he may eventually die an old man , in a prison cell .
The judge said that the plot had " reached an advanced stage in its development " , with the men in possession of enough chemicals to produce 20 detonators .
The flights due to be targeted were from London 's Heathrow airport to San Francisco , Washington , New York , Chicago , Toronto and Montreal .
Sarwar had obtained bomb ingredients which he kept at his home and in woods in High Wycombe , Buckinghamshire .
A flat in the Walthamstow area of north - east London became the men's bomb factory , where they mixed chemicals that they planned to take onto planes in ordinary sports drinks bottles stored within hand luggage .
The plot prompted the biggest terror investigation ever mounted in the UK .
No emotion
The convicted men displayed no emotion at their sentences , although Ahmed Ali shook his head and appeared angry and frustrated at earlier sentencing remarks from the judge .
" With this plot you sought the attention of the world and now you have it , " Mr Justice Henriques told him .
" You have embraced Islamic extremism and it is that burning extremism that has motivated you throughout this conspiracy and is likely to drive you again . "
E-mails submitted as evidence in the trial had shown that " the ultimate control of this conspiracy lay in Pakistan " , the judge said .
Ahmed Ali , Sarwar and Hussain , from Leyton , east London , had been " high - level executives within this country " .
' Act of revenge '
The men's defence had been that they were planning a political stunt , including small explosions intended only to frighten people at airports .
These political demonstrations , they said , would be backed up by a documentary aimed at changing opinion on Western foreign policy .
But Mr Justice Henriques dismissed that claim , saying their intention had been " an act of revenge inspired by extremist Islamic thinking " toward the " governments of several allied forces in Iraq and Afghanistan " .
Ahmed Ali , Sarwar and Hussain , were found guilty of conspiracy to murder using explosives on aircraft .
They were also convicted of a more general conspiracy to murder offence .
A fourth man , Umar Islam , 31 , convicted of the more general conspiracy to murder charge , was also given a life sentence and will serve a minimum of 22 years in prison .
The men's arrests in August 2006 caused chaos to the global aviation industry and prompted continuing restrictions to the amount of liquids passengers can take on to aircraft .
This had meant " massive expenditure " and " huge inconvenience for the travelling public " as a direct result of the plot , the judge said .
" Tons of liquids are confiscated from the public on a daily basis at airports , " he said .
The Director of Public Prosecutions , Keir Starmer , is seeking a retrial of three other men for conspiracy to murder , after the jury failed to reach a verdict on this charge against them .
A hearing on 5 October will decide whether Ibrahim Savant , 28 , Arafat Khan , 28 , and Waheed Zaman , 25 , will face another trial .

Research Box Title
A never - before - seen view of the turbulent heart of our Milky Way galaxy is being unveiled by NASA on Nov. 10 .
This event will commemorate the 400 years since Galileo first turned his telescope to the heavens in 1609 .
In celebration of this International Year of Astronomy , NASA is releasing images of the galactic center region as seen by its Great Observatories to more than 150 planetariums , museums , nature centers , libraries , and schools across the country .
The sites will unveil a giant , 6 - foot - by - 3 - foot print of the bustling hub of our galaxy that combines a near - infrared view from the Hubble Space Telescope , an infrared view from the Spitzer Space Telescope , and an X - ray view from the Chandra X- ray Observatory into one multiwavelength picture .
Experts from all three observatories carefully assembled the final image from large mosaic photo surveys taken by each telescope .
This composite image provides one of the most detailed views ever of our galaxy 's mysterious core .
Participating institutions also will display a matched trio of Hubble , Spitzer , and Chandra images of the Milky Way 's center on a second large panel measuring 3 feet by 4 feet .
Each image shows the telescope 's different wavelength view of the galactic center region , illustrating not only the unique science each observatory conducts , but also how far astronomy has come since Galileo .
The composite image features the spectacle of stellar evolution : from vibrant regions of star birth , to young hot stars , to old cool stars , to seething remnants of stellar death called black holes .
This activity occurs against a fiery backdrop in the crowded , hostile environment of the galaxy 's core , the center of which is dominated by a supermassive black hole nearly four million times more massive than our Sun .
Permeating the region is a diffuse blue haze of X - ray light from gas that has been heated to millions of degrees by outflows from the supermassive black hole as well as by winds from massive stars and by stellar explosions .
Infrared light reveals more than a hundred thousand stars along with glowing dust clouds that create complex structures including compact globules , long filaments , and finger - like " pillars of creation , " where newborn stars are just beginning to break out of their dark , dusty cocoons .
The unveilings will take place at 152 institutions nationwide , reaching both big cities and small towns .
Each institution will conduct an unveiling celebration involving the public , schools , and local media .
The Astrophysics Division of NASA 's Science Mission Directorate supports the International Year of Astronomy Great Observatories image unveiling .
The project is a collaboration among the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , Md. , the Spitzer Science Center in Pasadena , Calif. , and the Chandra X- ray Center in Cambridge , Mass .
Recently by Gary North : On Sacrificing for an Idea
The governments of every major nation are going to default on their debts .
There are two relevant questions : ( 1 ) How ?
( 2 ) When ?
Establishments around the world all deny this .
They have gained power and wealth by means of the expansion of government .
They have justified their success by insisting that the government - business alliance is the only way to establish economic growth and economic security for the masses .
This claim rests on a more fundamental claim , namely , that an unhampered free market is destructive of economic stability and will inevitably lead to economic depression .
The Establishments are universally Keynesian .
John Maynard Keynes ’ book , The General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money , was published in 1936 .
It defended in theory what all Western governments had been doing in practice for at least five years , namely , running huge deficits .
Keynes became as close to an academic high priest as any modern scholar ever has .
He was the apostle of national government debt .
His ideas today are more influential than they were at his death in 1946 .
We live in the age of Keynes .
I can think of only one major Establishment figure who has broken with the Establishment on the question of the great default : Peter G. Peterson , who was the chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations until 2007 .
He now runs the Peter G. Peterson Foundation , which focuses on the looming bankruptcy of the U.S. government .
More than any other person of influence , he has warned of the bankruptcy of the Medicare / Social Security programs and their equivalents in the West .
Peterson a decade ago said that he had spoken with the major leaders of the West about the impossibility of funding these social programs .
They all told him the same thing : “ I will not be around at that time . ”
In short , kick the can .
VOTE NOW , PAY LATER
Politicians lie .
Voters believe .
This is the great symbiotic relationship of democratic politics .
For older Americans , a single mental image above all others illustrates this perpetual relationship .
It is their memory of the annual Sunday cartoon in the cartoon strip , “ Peanuts , ” which was the most widely read cartoon strip — and therefore the most widely read anything — in the United States for at least three decades .
The annual cartoon featured two children : the ever- mendacious Lucy , whose hand supported an upright football on the ground , who encouraged the ever - trusting Charlie Brown to run at the ball and kick it .
He always believed her .
At the last moment , she would pull the ball away , and Charlie would fly into the air , then land on his back .
What changed each year was her argument on why she would not pull the ball away , and her final remark to Charlie , as he lay flat on his back .
She thought he was stupidly naïve .
He was .
She always took advantage of him .
Her philosophy was clear : “ Never give a sucker an even break . ”
This scene is repeated every other November in the United States , when voters go to the polls .
“ This time , it will be different , ” cry the Congressional candidates .
Then , for the next two years , they pull the ball away .
The only thing to top this exercise in mendacity in the United States is the testimony to each house of Congress delivered by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System .
Not even the President ’s annual State of the Union address tops this performance .
The voters never learn .
Congress never learns .
The coin of the political realm is the promise .
Not money , not power : the promise .
Politics sometimes looks like prostitution , with money at the center .
This is an illusion .
The voters do not come to Congress demanding money .
They demand faithfulness .
Congress is to the voters what a philanderer is to a mistress .
He may shower her with presents , but the presents have meaning to her only because of the promise .
“ I plan to divorce my wife .
It ’s just a matter of working out the details . ”
She likes the presents , but she believes the promise : “ You can trust me .
We ’ll grow old together . ”
She thinks the presents are forever .
He borrows the money to buy her the presents .
When interest rates rise , she will find out just how reliable his promises have been .
This is the heart of modern democracy .
Politicians promise undying faithfulness .
Voters believe them .
The first political campaign I can remember was the 1952 Presidential election .
I recall only one event clearly .
It was a singing group at the Democrats ’ national convention .
They sang the following :
They promise you the sky .
They promise you the earth .
But what ’s a Republican promise worth ?
Then came the chorus :
Do n’t let ’em take it , Do n’t let ’em take it , Do n’t let ’em take it away !
Eisenhower was elected .
Both houses of Congress went Republican .
This had not happened since 1928 .
It would not happen again until 2000 .
They did n’t take it away .
They added more .
The great advantage of political promises is that the politicians who make them will not be in office when the bills come due .
The benefits are immediate : votes .
The costs are deferred .
The supply of promises increases .
These promises rest on assurances .
“ Treasury debt will continue to have a AAA rating . ”
“ Treasury debt is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States . ”
“ There is no alternative to the U.S. dollar as a world reserve currency . ”
“ We owe it to ourselves . ” “ Deficits do n’t matter . ”
“ Inflation is under control . ”
With the exception of Austrian School economics , every major school of economic thought believes in at least four of these assurances .
Keynesians believe all of them .
So , the supply of promises increases .
So does the magnitude of these promises .
For as long as investors buy the Treasury debt and the GSE debt ( Fannie and Freddie ) , there will be no reversal of this process .
The advent of the day of reckoning is easy to describe : ( 1 ) the upward move of Treasury interest rates , or ( 2 ) the upward move of prices in response to the Federal Reserve System ’s expansion of its balance sheet — monetary base — to hold down rates .
Then will come the wail of the aging mistress : “ But you promised ! ” Indeed , he did , but a younger mistress has come along , and she wants the presents that he had promised the first one .
When lenders start tightening up , a philanderer has to pick and choose among his mistresses .
Old ones lose .
But what of the faithful wife ?
When will she finally wise up and divorce the lying SOB ?
I am writing this report for her .
WHY DEFAULT WILL COME
You know about the unfunded off - budget liabilities of the Social Security and Medicare programs .
If you do n’t know the numbers , go here .
You know about the size of the on - budget Federal debt .
If not , go here .
You presumably know about the size of the officially estimated deficits in the on - budget account : at least $ 900 billion a year until 2019 .
If not , go here .
Voters are oblivious .
They do not care about anything beyond their next paycheck .
Investors are oblivious .
They do not care beyond the next quarterly report .
Congress is oblivious .
They do not care beyond the next election .
Am I saying that Congress has a longer - term perspective than investors ?
Yes .
But why ?
Because investors believe two things : ( 1 ) the existing price of any asset reflects the best judgment of the smartest investors ; ( 2 ) they will be smarter than all these other investors when it comes time to sell and buy gold .
The average American faces his day of reckoning on the first of every month .
Congress faces its day of reckoning in November of even - numbered years .
Investors do not believe that they , individually , will ever face a day of reckoning .
They think they are smarter than the smartest guys in the room , or else they think Ben Bernanke is , and all those other FED economists are , who will see the crisis coming next time and will take steps to evade it .
Congress also thinks that the FED ’s economists will find ways to evade the day of reckoning .
Investors and politicians are united .
They trust the ability of central banks to evade the costs of political promises .
This has been true since 1694 , when Parliament granted a monopoly over money to the Bank of England .
Parliament wanted a lender of last resort .
That was what the head of the Bank of England promised .
The political promises of every nation rest on faith in central banking .
The politicians and the investors are united in a confession of faith .
This confession of faith rests on an assumption : with fiat money , there can be a free lunch , indefinitely .
Every school of economic opinion except the Austrian School also affirms this .
There is a problem with this confession .
It is not true .
There is no such thing as a free lunch .
Fiat money is counterfeit money .
It does not create wealth .
It destroys wealth .
Congress has promised money .
It has also promised wealth .
Congress will default on at least one of these promises .
We are back to my original two questions : ( 1 ) How ?
( 2 ) When ?
Default has four major forms .
We need to consider all of them .
1. OUTRIGHT DEFAULT
This scenario assumes that the central bank refuses to buy the government ’s debt .
This has not happened since 1694 .
At some point , the government will not be able to find buyers at low interest rates .
Rates will rise .
The economy will sink into a depression .
Revenues will decline .
Expenditures will rise .
The government will not be able to pay all of its obligations .
So , it will raise taxes .
The depression will get worse .
Revenues will again fall .
Investors will know that the government is likely to default .
No credit - rating service will have the courage to downgrade the government ’s debt , but rates will rise as if they had .
The government will reach the day of reckoning .
It will default on all of its debts .
Every institution that has government debt in its portfolio will suffer a loss .
Its share price will fall .
The depression will get worse .
Insurance companies will be hit hard .
The largest banks , which swapped their toxic debt with the FED at face value in late 2008 will find that they own the most toxic debt of all .
Foreign central banks will refuse to buy any more American Treasury debt .
Technically , their portfolios fall to the extent that they held Treasury debt .
Then those governments must decide .
Should those banks be allowed to inflate to overcome these losses ?
The inverted pyramid of debt will topple .
The great default will produce the great depression .
Unemployment will rise .
Depositors will finally go to their ATMs to draw out currency .
The banks will default : no withdrawals of currency .
The division of labor will contract .
Everyone will get much poorer .
Because a default on all Treasury debt would have such widespread consequences — immediate consequences — economists have argued that this will not be allowed to happen .
The central bank will buy the debt .
But if it does , at some point it must stop buying or else create hyperinflation .
Hyperinflation has the same consequence as default and deflation : a contraction in the division of labor .
I know of only one economist who predicts an outright default : Jeffrey Rogers Hummel .
On August 3 , 2009 , he published an article on the free market site , Library of Economics and Liberty : “ Why Default on U.S. Treasuries is likely . ”
His argument is simple : the only alternative is the Zimbabwe option : hyperinflation .
He goes through the numbers .
He makes an impressive case .
He does not discuss the level of interest rates that would bring on the crisis , but at some point , the Treasury will have to offer high rates unless the FED intervenes .
He says that the welfare state is going to die , all over the world .
I think he is correct .
I am not convinced that outright default is likely — not before much higher price inflation arrives .
The strategy of the FED is the same as the strategy of Congress : kick the can .
SELECTIVE DEFAULT
Hummel admits that selective default is a possibility .
I think it is more than a possibility .
I think it is likely .
He writes :
The Zimbabwe option illustrates that other potential outcomes , however unlikely , are equally unprecedented and dramatic .
We cannot utterly rule out , for instance , the possibility that the U.S. Congress might repudiate a major portion of promised benefits rather than its debt .
If it simply abolished Medicare outright , the unfunded liability of Social Security would become tractable .
Indeed , one of the current arguments for the adoption of nationalized health care is that it can reduce Medicare costs .
But this argument is based on looking at other welfare States such as Great Britain , where government - provided health care was rationed from the outset rather than subsidized with Medicare .
Rationing can indeed drive down health - care costs , but after more than forty years of subsidized health care in the United States , how likely is it that the public will put up with severe rationing or that the politicians will attempt to impose it ?
And do n’t kid yourself ; the rationing will have to be quite severe to stave off a future fiscal crisis .
The rationing will have to be severe .
The promises will not come true .
INFLATION
There are two forms : mass ( up to 50 % per annum ) and hyper ( the sky ’s the limit ) .
Mass inflation seems more likely over the next decade .
If the world ’s central banks can coordinate the expansion of money , thereby funding the national welfare states , the public will not be able to escape .
They will pay the inflation tax .
The ways around this are limited to investing in real goods : commodities , small farms , used goods stores , small - town real estate .
Not many people will see this in time .
Of those who do , few will take action .
These escape hatches are for people who are hedging against default .
The average voter has no financial reserves .
Of the 20 % who do have reserves , 80 % will be stuck in conventional investments .
They will believe the Establishment ’s Keynesian line .
“ The government can fix it if you just hang on . ”
Inflation means the erosion of money .
It means a hidden default on the political promises .
Why hidden ?
Because the politicians will blame speculators .
They will not blame the Federal Reserve for having bankrolled their promises .
CONCLUSION
Ultimately , it is either the great depression or the Zimbabwe option .
Ludwig von Mises called this the crack - up boom .
It means the destruction of money and the collapse of the division of labor .
It would mean devastation .
I think central banks will at some point refuse to fund governments any longer .
They will bail out the largest banks instead .
Foreign politicians may force hyperinflation on their central banks , as agents of the government .
But as long as the Federal Reserve System maintains its selective independence , it will not adopt hyperinflation as a policy .
That would not be in the interest of the largest banks .
It would also not be in the interest of central bankers .
Their retirement promises would die .

Worried that $ 500,000 is too much to pay for a Melbourne house ?
The Reserve Bank is n't worried and it expects prices to climb higher still .
In a speech that amounted to a defence of Australia 's historically high house prices , Reserve Bank deputy governor Ric Battellino told a Melbourne housing conference yesterday to expect worse and to recognise that buyers were getting value for money .
Prices would climb further because the global economy was growing again and because Australia had entered '' a new upswing ' ' that would extend its record 18 years of continuous economic expansion .
House prices would be boosted by increased population growth and immigration , solid increases in household incomes and ' ' substantial competition ' ' for construction industry workers from the mining sector .
Australians had been spending more of their income on housing than ever before but had been getting bigger and better houses as a result .
“ Green Hunt will result in genocide of Adivasis ”
Times of India , November 13 , 2009
Gandhian Himanshu Kumar has been working among tribals [ adivasis ] in Bastar for more than 17 years .
Though he has rehabilitated 30 villages devastated by the Chhattisgarh government ’s anti-Naxalite campaign Salwa Judum , his ashram was demolished by the government in May this year .
Kumar spoke to Jyoti Punwani :
How did you rehabilitate the villages ?
As a Gandhian , I could not just stand by and watch when Adivasis who had fled their village because of Salwa Judum , were beaten up for having returned to their village to depose before the NHRC [ National Human Rights Commission ] .
I decided to set up camp in that village .
If the Salwa Judum forces came to burn it , they would have to burn me first .
We persuaded the villagers to come back .
They had lost everything seeds , cattle because whenever they tried to return , the Salwa Judum forces hounded them into camps and burnt their village .
We arranged for everything , helped them plough their land .
Slowly others began returning .
Peace reigned in those villages till last month when Operation Green Hunt began .
The Supreme Court has directed the government to rehabilitate the tribals .
If the government is not willing , let me do it .
I can bring peace in a week .
You withdraw your forces and provide the amenities that were stopped after Salwa Judum started : doctors , schools , aanganwadis [ child / mother care centers ] .
Will the Maoists allow these to run ?
Medical officers tell me ruefully that it ’s the CRPF [ Central Reserve Police Force ] that beat up their doctors who go into the jungle to treat patients .
They beat up teachers too .
They are furious that these people can travel safely inside the jungle , while they get blown up .
I pointed out that doctors and teachers do n’t go there with weapons like the CRPF does !
Naxalites have said they will not interfere with my rehabilitation work because I have no political ambitions .
Is a dialogue possible ?
What stops the government from talking to the Adivasis ?
You are a democratically elected government , find out what your people want .
As for the Maoists , how can the Centre tell them to stop violence without stopping it first ?
Every day , your forces demand liquor , chickens , women … they behead a child in front of his grandfather , rape Adivasi women at will …
And when the Adivasi picks up a lathi , they cry foul .
Why are the forces there in Bastar ?
The Maoists were n’t marching into Delhi .
Nor did the Adivasis plead for protection from them .
When the police , the administration , the judiciary has turned against the Adivasis , the Maoists have stood by them .
The forces are there only to hunt the tribals from their land , so that the state can hand it over to corporates .
The state has no desire for peace and is too arrogant to acknowledge its crimes .
We have tried to file 1,000 FIRs against the police ; not one has been registered .
Salwa Judum saw a 22 - fold increase in Maoist numbers .
Green
Hunt will result in genocide of Adivasis .
Those who survive will become Naxalites .
PHILADELPHIA – The 4,700 members of Transport Workers , Local 234 struck the Southeastern , Pa. Transportation Authority ( SEPTA ) at 3 a.m. on the morning of Nov. 3 over pay and pension related issues .
Commuters in the city are facing long lines of gridlocked traffic on streets all over the city , with no city buses or subways running .
The workers on the agency ’s regional rail system , which serves the suburbs , are not members of Local 234 and were not on strike .
Those trains were operating , but with delays reported of up to 45 minutes .
SEPTA carries nearly one million passengers on its city routes ( not including the suburban routes ) on a typical weekday .
The situation is expected to become more complicated today as Philadelphia ’s public school students return after a day off for faculty staff development yesterday .
Some 50,000 students normally use SEPTA to travel to and from school .
No new talks have yet been scheduled .
The union had waited until Game 5 of the World Series was completed Monday night before going on strike .
More than 8,000 passengers typically travel to the stadium using SEPTA ’s Broad Street Subway .
The union has pointed out that SEPTA has received federal stimulus funds and that ridership has increased 30 percent during the recent period .
Readers wishing to express support for the striking workers can sign an on line petition circulated by the Bread and Roses Community Fund at http://tiny.cc/supportworkers
Prediction is a big , big business these days , and even those of us who are n’t explicitly in the prediction business probably do all we can to make sense of the future .
For example :
Does your company do marketing research ?
( If it ’s a business of any size and sophistication , the answer is probably yes . )
Do you track the financial pages ?
Do you keep abreast of the latest innovations in your industry ( or any industry , for that matter ) ?
Have you factored in economic considerations when trying to decide whether or not to buy a house ?
If you have an IRA , have you factored in where you think the damned economy is going in making fund decisions ?
If you do n’t have an IRA , is it possible that your view of the market was so dire that you decided to dump all your money into savings ( or hide it under the mattress ) ?
Have you ever moved to a particular city in part because it had a better job market than another city ?
Did you make ( or are you now making , if you ’re still in school ) curriculum / major / grad school decisions based on your expectations of what the job market was / is going to be like ?
If you ’ve been lucky enough to have a choice of job offers , did you spend some time evaluating the prospects of the competing businesses ( and your prospects in them ) before accepting an offer ?
If so – and most of you probably answered yes to at least one of these questions – then that ’s all part of what I ’m calling the prediction business .
In some cases we ’re talking about companies that are directly about predicting , and in others we ’re personally making decisions based on our ability to predict – an abiilty that often hinges on data produced by companies in the prediction business .
In all cases , the more we know about the future ( or , put more precisely , the better our information on factors that will shape future events and the more accomplished our faculties for evaluating that information ) , the more likely we are to make decisions that succeed in the present and the future , and we all want that .
So , how good are we at predicting ?
How much of what we think we know is accurate , and how reliable are our techniques for predicting ?
Perhaps not as good as we ’d hope .
So Close , Yet So Far Away
Consider a recent BBC story on efforts to detect terrorists , which was forwarded along by my colleague Whythawk .
It starts out with an intriguing premise : what if you had a method that was 90 % effective at telling whether or not someone was a terrorist ?
Not bad , right ?
But then the analysis takes a nasty left turn .
You ’re in the Houses of Parliament demonstrating the device to MPs when you receive urgent information from MI5 that a potential attacker is in the building .
Security teams seal every exit and all 3,000 people inside are rounded up to be tested .
The first 30 pass .
Then , dramatically , a man in a mac fails .
Police pounce , guns point .
How sure are you that this person is a terrorist ?
A. 90 %
B. 10 %
C. 0.3 % The answer is C , about 0.3 % .
Huh ?
The article goes on to explain the math :
If 3,000 people are tested , and the test is 90 % accurate , it is also 10 % wrong .
So it will probably identify 301 terrorists – about 300 by mistake and 1 correctly .
You wo n’t know from the test which is the real terrorist .
So the chance that our man in the mac is the real thing is 1 in 301 .
My guess is that very few readers guessed C – I know I did n’t – and the fact that most of us are n’t in the terrorist hunting business is no solace .
The problem is that unless we ’re serious math types , we probably rely , at least occasionally , on techniques that are actually less effective than we think they are .
Our Pathological Need to Know
One of the hottest business books out there right now is Nassim Nicholas Taleb ’s The Black Swan .
Taleb , who is equal parts philosopher , math whiz and trading savant , wreaks havoc with the world of financial analysis , and in light of our current economic condition and the factors that helped us get here , you can imagine how a book of this nature might strike a nerve .
Taleb ’s central thesis is that a small number of unexpected events – the black swans – explains much of import that goes on in the world .
We need to understand just how much we will never understand is the line .
‘ The world we live in , ’ he likes to say , ‘ is vastly different from the world we think we live in . ’
…
When it comes to finance , collective wisdom has shown itself to be close to astrology – based on nothing .
But according to Taleb , unpredictable events – 9/11 , the dotcom bubble , the current financial implosion – are much more common than we think .
He spends a lot of time , for obvious reasons , on finance , but the sum total of Taleb ’s thesis is much broader : our need to know blinds us and leads us to rely on tools that ca n’t be trusted .
The Butterfly Effect
Toward the end of the book we discover that Taleb was a disciple of Benoit Mendelbrot , the father of fractal geometry and the man who introduced to the principle of sensitivity to initial conditions – better known as the “ butterfly effect . ”
Stated simply , this principle says that even very small changes in a system can lead to huge changes in the results , and the implications for most kinds of research and modeling are huge .
To wit , the popular assertion that a butterfly flapping its wings here today can lead to a hurricane next year in China .
Much research – did I say “ much ” ?
How about nearly all – assumes that we can control for non-relevant factors .
A variety of sampling methods ( randomization perhaps being the most popular ) are used to assure that the only difference between test groups is the factor being tested , but Mandelbrot ’s work calls that assumption into question .
We may assume that we have controlled for external factors , but we cannot demonstrate it as fact .
( I ’m mostly beating up research on humans and human systems here – research in the hard sciences is far more precise . )
It is far , far harder to predict than we might suspect , and this goes for those in the business of selling prediction , as well .
How Can We Improve Our Chances of Getting it Right ?
So , if we ca n’t know or predict anything , what can we do ?
Pack it up and go home ?
Not exactly .
I ’m not here to suggest that the task is hopeless , that it is impossible to know or predict .
A few strategies are recommended to those who ’d like to nudge their confidence levels up a bit , though .
Taleb offers some very useful advice – abd again , read the book .
In addition , here are a few more ideas to think about .
First , there ’s value in diversifying your sources .
If you rely on one tool , one model , one expert , one information source , well , that ’s like going to Vegas and putting your life savings on 32 .
We ’re not talking about predicting anymore , we ’re talking about praying for blind luck .
Second , there ’s value in diversifying the type of source .
We ’re a culture with a rage for quantification – we believe that numbers do n’t lie and that the only way to measure and evaluate is with statistics .
To be sure , stats can tell us a lot , but the problem is that the knowledge you gain is a mile wide and inch deep ( and this assumes that you ’ve managed to construct a reliable quant instrument – note the observation above about these sorts of assumptions ) .
The most effective research programs in my world ( marketing ) also rely on qualitative methods – focus groups , interviews , observation , case histories , etc .
The value to using multiple techniques is twofold .
On the up side , you get a much richer picture of the reality surrounding your research question .
On the down side – that is , if something is a little off – the more independent tools you ’re using , the better your chance of catching errors .
Finally , there ’s no substitute for a critical mind .
Never accept any claim or data point at face value and be as rigorous in your assessments of methodology as you are results .
And especially , go in fear of people who are married to one method .
All too often , as Taleb demonstrates , these people are ideologues who value the beauty and symmetry of their theories above the messiness of reality .
So we probably do n’t know as much as we think we do , but if we approach the task of learning and predicting critically , we have a lot better shot .

New York has often built great things in bad times , sometimes by accident — the Empire State Building , finished in the Depression , was started in the boom times of the nineteen - twenties — and sometimes by intention , as when John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , distracted us from our economic blues by building Rockefeller Center .
We now live in a different world , more inclined to celebrate the fact that these dismal economic times mean that the biggest projects on the drawing boards , the mega - developments of Hudson Yards on the site of the West Side Railyards and Atlantic Yards on the Brooklyn rail yard , are not happening .
Nobody thinks Bruce Ratner can afford to turn Atlantic Yards into his very own stimulus package , the way Rockefeller did with his project , and we are generally glad of it .
In fact , it has seemed to many New Yorkers as if the economic downturn has allowed us to dodge some major bullets .
It would be churlish to call our financial troubles one of the best architectural events of the year , however much they give us a Scrooge - like sense of satisfaction .

( Fortune Magazine ) --
When Irvin Rosenfeld , 56 , picks me up at the Fort Lauderdale airport , his SUV reeks of marijuana .
The vice president for sales at a local brokerage firm , Rosenfeld has been smoking 10 to 12 marijuana cigarettes a day for 38 years , he says .
That 's probably unusual in itself , but what makes Rosenfeld exceptional is that for the past 27 years , he has been copping his weed directly from the United States government .
Every 25 days Rosenfeld goes to a pharmacy and picks up a tin of 300 federally grown and rolled cigarettes that have been sent there for him by the National Institute of Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) , acting with approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .
Rosenfeld smokes the marijuana to relieve chronic pain and muscle spasms caused by a rare bone disease .
When he was 10 , doctors discovered that his skeleton was riddled with more than 200 tumors , due to a condition known as multiple congenital cartilaginous exostosis .
Despite seven operations , he still lives with scores of tumors in his bones .
Rosenfeld is one of four people in the United States whom the federal government supplies with medical marijuana .
Each is a living anomaly because , officially , the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration , NIDA , and the FDA all take the position that marijuana has " no currently accepted medical use . "
That 's the only way federal law can continue to classify marijuana , like heroin , as a " Schedule I controlled substance , " forbidden from being prescribed by doctors .
( Numerous dangerous , psychoactive , and addictive opium derivatives , by contrast , are more leniently classified as Schedule II drugs , allowing prescription use . )
Over the years the government 's position has become progressively more embattled , if not untenable .
Thirteen states now have laws that let residents use marijuana medicinally , typically to alleviate chronic pain ( particularly nerve pain caused by diabetes , AIDS , and hepatitis ) ; manage movement disorders and muscle spasticity ( especially for multiple sclerosis patients ) ; as an anti-nausea and anti-vomiting agent ( for those , say , undergoing chemotherapy ) ; and as an appetite stimulant ( yes , as in " the munchies " ) for those with wasting diseases like AIDS and cancer .
Another 15 states are weighing legislation or ballot initiatives that could turn them into medical marijuana states by next year .
The acceptance of medical marijuana has implications that extend far beyond helping those suffering from life - threatening diseases .
It is one of several factors -- including demographic changes , the financial crisis , and the widely perceived failure of the war on drugs -- reopening the country 's 40 - year - old on - again , off - again shouting match over whether marijuana should be legalized .
This article is not another polemic about why it should or should n't be .
Today , in any case , the pertinent question is whether it already has been -- at least on a local - option basis .
We 're referring to a cultural phenomenon that has been evolving for the past 15 years , topped off by a crucial policy reversal that was quietly instituted by President Barack Obama in February .
First , some necessary background .
Under President George W. Bush ( and under President Bill Clinton before him , for that matter ) , the U.S. Justice Department treated state medical marijuana laws as nullities .
Such laws were contradicted and therefore preempted by federal drug laws , the Justice Department reasoned , and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld that position in 2005 .
Accordingly , the federal government has periodically raided and prosecuted defendants who at least claimed to be complying with state medical marijuana laws , and when it did , defendants were forbidden from telling juries about the existence of those laws .
In late February , President Obama signaled a new approach .
His attorney general , Eric Holder , confirmed at a press conference that he would no longer subject individuals who were complying with state medical marijuana laws to federal drug raids and prosecutions .
This understated act -- a simple pledge not to act , really -- could have enormous consequences .
It potentially leads to exactly the same endpoint as the Twenty - First Amendment , which repealed the federal prohibition on alcoholic beverage sales .
Here 's how .
When states make a legal loophole allowing medical use of marijuana , they must grapple with the messy question of what precisely constitutes medical use .
After all , doctors regularly prescribe powerful drugs like Valium , Viagra , Prozac , and -- give us a break -- Botox to patients who are hardly at death 's door .
If a state does n't tightly limit what " medical use " means , the camel can get its nose under the tent .
That 's what happened in California .
Like most medical marijuana states , California permits doctors to " recommend " marijuana use for patients who suffer from specific serious diseases .
( Drafters of the law avoided the word " prescribe " in an attempt to sidestep conflict with federal law . )
California 's law then adds a catchall provision that lets doctors also approve marijuana use for " any other illness for which marijuana provides relief . "
In practice , doctors -- largely protected from second - guessing by confidentiality privileges -- have been free to make the final call as to which conditions those might be .
This is , after all , the norm vis -� - vis medicines .
Once a pharmaceutical has been FDA - approved for one use , doctors can lawfully prescribe it for other , so - called off - label purposes , even though the drug has not yet been certified as safe or effective for them .
Accordingly , California doctors are authorizing patients to take marijuana to relieve such ailments as anxiety , headache , premenstrual syndrome , and trouble sleeping .
" You could get it for writer 's block , " comments Allen St. Pierre , the executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws .
Some California doctors voluntarily report the breakdown of patient medical conditions for which they have approved marijuana use in the Alameda , Calif. , medical newsletter O'Shaughnessy's .
They commonly report that more than a quarter of their marijuana authorizations have been prompted by patients suffering from conditions like " anxiety " or " insomnia . "
( The most common complaint is " chronic pain . " )
As a result , in most of California 's coastal metropolitan areas , marijuana is effectively legal today .
Any resident older than 18 who gets a note from a doctor can lawfully buy the stuff , and doctors seemingly eager to write such notes , typically in exchange for a $ 200 consultation fee , advertise in newspapers and on websites .
There are an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 medical marijuana patients in the state now , and the figure is rapidly growing .
More astonishingly , there are about 700 medical marijuana dispensaries now operating in California openly distributing the drug .
These dispensaries -- called " compassionate - care clinics " by the solemn and " pot shops " by the skeptical -- are decidedly outpatient facilities , with not a few patients arriving on bicycles , roller skates , or skateboards .
( They often get discounts for doing so , because it 's greener than using a fossil - fuel - powered car . )
The dispensaries sell marijuana and its concentrated resin forms , hashish and kif , sometimes alongside a range of enticing , non-inhaled alternatives , including marijuana - imbued brownies , cookies , gelati , honeys , butters , cooking oils ( " Not So Virgin " olive oil ) , bottled cold drinks ( " enhanced " lemonade is the most popular ) , capsules , lozenges , spray - under - the - tongue tinctures , and even topically applied salves .
In Los Angeles a high - end three - store chain called the Farmacy employs a pastry chef to oversee production of all its baked goods .
Most dispensaries also sell potted plants and seeds for patients who are either thrifty or entrepreneurial .
All these establishments are engaged in what federal penal statutes still humorlessly define as narcotics trafficking .
The dispensaries ' affiliated marijuana farms and plant nurseries are sometimes of sufficient size to subject operators to mandatory - minimum five - year federal prison terms .
And this , mind you , is a situation that evolved almost entirely during the Bush administration , when the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was still routinely threatening dispensary landlords with forfeiture of their premises , periodically raiding clinics and seizing inventories , and criminally prosecuting the most brazenly abusive operators .
Luke Scarmazzo , who aired a rap video on YouTube two years ago boasting of all the money and great sex he was getting from running the California Healthcare Collective in Modesto , Calif . --
" Fuck the feds ! " was one ill - advised lyric -- was sentenced in federal court this past December to almost 22 years of imprisonment on a continuing criminal enterprise conviction .
( He has appealed . )
While the situation in California is unusual , it 's becoming less so .
There are now 15 dispensaries in Colorado , according to weedmaps.com , one of many online marijuana dispensary and physician ( " pot-doc " ) locator services .
In Oregon nearly one in four active physicians has authorized at least one of his patients to grow marijuana for medical use .
New Mexico hopes to have the nation 's first state - licensed medical marijuana farm and distributorship up and running by the time this article is published .
New Mexico's law was enacted two years ago , but state officials had n't dared implement it until Attorney General Holder blew the all clear in February .
This is the sense in which President Obama 's understated pledge not to interfere with state medical marijuana laws potentially achieves for that intoxicant what the Twenty - First Amendment accomplished for beer , wine , and booze during the Great Depression .
Repeal , remember , simply returned to the states the right to decide whether to permit alcoholic beverage sales , and , if so , when and how .
If a state permitted sales , it could also enforce minimum - age requirements , limit store hours , set zoning restrictions , and levy taxes .
If it prohibited sales , it could bask in righteousness but exercise no control over the traffic that would occur anyway .
Over time nearly every state fell in line behind the tax - and - regulate model .
( During Prohibition , federal law did contain an exception allowing alcoholic beverage sales for medical purposes .
Nevertheless the case for medical booze was never compelling , and after repeal no state chose to condition the legality of alcohol sales upon a showing of medical need . )
" I think we 're going to have exactly that kind of local option with marijuana [ that we now have with alcohol ] , " says Keith Stroup , 65 , NORML 's founder , two - time past executive director , and current legal counsel .
" Once that happens it will be like gambling . "
Initially only Nevada permitted gambling , and then it was just Nevada and New Jersey .
" But over a period of time , " Stroup says , " the morality part of the issue kind of dissipated , and there were more and more needs for new revenue , and today almost every state in the country allows legalized gambling . "
Marijuana activists thought they were close to legalization once before .
From 1973 to 1978 activists won decriminalization in 11 states .
( " Decriminalization " is a grab - bag term but usually refers to schemes under which first - time possession of small quantities of marijuana becomes a noncriminal violation , akin to a parking ticket .
Decriminalization falls short of legalization , in that sale and distribution remain serious felonies . )
In 1977 , President Jimmy Carter endorsed a federal decriminalization bill .
But the bill went nowhere , and soon the movement was all but obliterated by the return swing of the cultural pendulum , now known as the Reagan Revolution .
There would be no new state or federal marijuana reforms for the next 16 years .
" Here 's what 's different now , " asserts Ethan Nadelmann , the head of the Drug Policy Alliance , which favors marijuana legalization on a tax - and - regulate model .
" First , in the late 1970s no more than 30 % of the American public supported making marijuana legal .
Now it 's breaking 40 % . "
That jump reflects an important demographic change , Nadelmann notes .
" Back then there was a whole older generation of Americans who did n't know the difference between marijuana and heroin , " he says .
" Now that generation is mostly gone .
The people in power are baby boomers , a majority of whom actually smoked marijuana . "
The past three Presidents have all more or less admitted trying the drug , Nadelmann continues , and the current one , when asked if he inhaled , famously retorted , " I thought that was the point . "
Beyond the demographic change , there is a perception that after 40 years of blood , sweat , and tears , the war on drugs -- formally declared by President Richard Nixon in 1969 , a month before the Woodstock festival -- has failed to reduce the availability of illegal drugs , has enriched and empowered organized - crime gangs , and has subjected millions of people to arrest who pose little threat to anyone but themselves .
On top of that , we 're now mired in the worst economic environment since the Great Depression , which makes the prospect of collecting taxes on marijuana sales as alluring to contemporary politicians as beer , wine , and liquor taxes looked to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his party when they took office in 1933 , the year Prohibition was repealed .
Assuming a national consumer market for marijuana of about $ 13 billion annually , Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron has estimated that legalization could be expected to bring state and federal governments about $ 7 billion annually in additional tax revenue , while saving them $ 13.5 billion in prohibition - related law enforcement costs .
In California , where the fiscal crisis is so grave that the state has had to issue vendors more than $ 1 billion in IOUs , a Field Poll published in April showed that 56 % of the state 's population favored legalizing marijuana , prompting Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to call for an " open debate " on the question .
A legalization bill has been introduced in the state legislature , and the state board of equalization has estimated that if passed , it would bring in $ 1.4 billion in new revenue , a seemingly conservative estimate .
It 's even possible that legalization would reduce national health - care costs , by easing demand for costly pharmaceuticals .
In the most recent issue of O'Shaughnessy 's , one doctor reported that his cannabis patients had either stopped or cut back their use of " analgesics of all kinds [ including ]
Tylenol , aspirin , and opioids ; psychotherapeutic agents including anti-anxiety medications , anti-depressants , anti-panic , obsessive - compulsive , anti-psychotic , and bipolar agents ; gastrointestiminal agents including anti-spasmodics and anti-inflammatory medications ; migraine preparations ; anticonvulsants ; appetite stimulants ; immuno - modulators and immunosuppressives ; muscle relaxants ; multiple sclerosis management medications ; ophthalmic preparations ; sedative and hypnotic agents ; and Tourette 's syndrome agents . "
" Medical marijuana is God 's little joke on the [ marijuana ] prohibitionists , " says Richard Cowan , 69 , a longtime legalization activist who claims he 's smoked almost every day since 1967 .
" There is clearly a medical need , and it ranges from minor to life - saving ....
From my perspective , the dividing line between medical and nonmedical should not be decided by the police . "
Medical marijuana is clearly the crowning factor making things different this time .
Not only is it changing perceptions of the drug , but it has also given legalization advocates in California a first - ever opportunity to devise and showcase a business prototype .
They 've been afforded the chance to show a skeptical public that a safe , seemly , and responsible system for distributing marijuana is possible .
If they succeed , they 'll convince the fence sitters and lead the way to a nationwide metamorphosis .
If they fail , the backlash will be savage .
If communities cannot adequately regulate the dispensaries , they 'll descend into unsightly , youth - seducing , crime - ridden playgrounds for gang - bangers , and this flirtation with legalization will conclude the way the last one did : with a swift and merciless swing of the pendulum .
Pot 's medical history
Marijuana , whose botanical name is cannabis , has been used medicinally -- and as an intoxicant , of course -- for thousands of years in Eastern cultures .
It is believed to have been introduced to Western medicine in the early 19th century by a British doctor , W.B. O'Shaughnessy , who learned about it while stationed in India ( and for whom the medical cannabis newsletter is named ) .
Several well - known pharmaceutical companies , including Eli Lilly ( LLY , Fortune 500 ) , sold cannabis in powdered or tincture forms in the early 20th century as a painkiller , antispasmodic , sedative , and " exhilarant . "
( For this article Fortune asked Eli Lilly for historical details on its cannabis sales , but a spokeswoman responded , " Due to competing priorities , we ... are unable to facilitate your query . " )
Though cannabis remained listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia -- a standard desk reference for drugs -- until 1942 , its use in Western medicine began declining in the late 1800s , according to a history of cannabis written by Harvard psychiatrist Lester Grinspoon titled " Marijuana : The Forbidden Medicine . "
The decline , Grinspoon writes , was due in part to the rise of more stable and effective pharmaceuticals -- though many of them later proved to have grave potential side effects -- and because modern hypodermic syringes could deliver faster pain relief using opiates .
( Opiates were soluble ; cannabis was n't . )
Then , in the early 1900s , states began outlawing cannabis , which had become associated in legislators ' minds with violent crime and psychosis .
The drug was then being used in the U.S. mainly by Mexican migrant workers in the West and African Americans in the South , so apprehensions about it may have been intertwined with racial and ethnic fears .
In 1937 the federal government , over the objections of the American Medical Association , effectively outlawed cannabis .
Modern - day medical assessments of marijuana 's properties have not corroborated the outsize dangers that lawmakers had attributed to the plant .
While it is a " powerful drug , " concluded an Institute of Medicine report conducted in 1997 at the behest of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy , its " adverse effects ... are within the range of effects tolerated for other medications . "
Yes , someone who is high on marijuana should n't drive -- his motor skills and mental powers are impaired -- but that 's true of alcohol and many prescription drugs too .
The long - term risks to chronic users appear to center mainly on the generic dangers of smoking ( respiratory disease and possibly lung cancer ) and upon the " mild and short - lived " withdrawal symptoms that a minority of marijuana users experience , according to the IOM experts .
They considered marijuana less addictive than tobacco , codeine , or Valium .
Still , many doctors are squeamish about recommending marijuana to patients -- putting aside issues of legal liability .
To begin with , most pharmaceuticals consist of a single , purified chemical compound .
Such drugs are susceptible to double - blind , placebo - controlled testing , and once they are approved , doctors can prescribe known dosages .
Marijuana , in contrast , consists of the dried , ground - up flowers of a highly variable plant .
It is made up of at least 400 compounds , including more than 60 that are unique to cannabis , known as cannabinoids , several of which are believed to have therapeutic effects .
The proportions of these compounds vary greatly from plant to plant .
A plant may attract harmful molds .
Lighting a match to the mix then introduces a whole new set of variables .
Finally , smoking -- even putting aside its health risks -- is an idiosyncratic delivery system .
Everyone smokes differently , so one never knows how much of which compounds the patient is receiving .
These factors all make marijuana hard for researchers to test meaningfully and hard for doctors to prescribe confidently .
Accordingly , even those doctors who recognize the therapeutic powers of marijuana often prefer the notion of looking for one or two key active ingredients in it , isolating them , and then devising a delivery system that would not involve smoking .
And that 's been done .
In 1986 the FDA approved a synthetic version of what has long been recognized to be the main psychoactive ingredient of marijuana -- delta - 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol , or THC .
After rigorous testing , the FDA found THC to be safe and effective for the treatment of nausea , vomiting , and wasting diseases .
This lawful , Schedule II drug , trade - named Marinol , is taken orally , by capsule .
The trouble is , for many patients Marinol turns out to be inferior to good old - fashioned pot .
Smoked marijuana is much faster acting and , as a consequence , easier for patients to control in terms of dosage .
The patient inhales as much as he needs and then stops .
In contrast , with a THC pill the patient can easily ingest more than he can handle .
" Oral THC is slow in onset of action but produces more pronounced , and often unfavorable , psychoactive effects that last much longer than those experienced with smoking , " according to a 2008 report published by the American College of Physicians .
( Incidentally , the FDA - approved warnings for Marinol -- pure THC -- do not flatly forbid patients from driving under its influence .
Rather , they simply caution patients not to do so " until it is established that they are able to tolerate the drug and to perform such tasks safely . " )
Still , despite the disappointing performance of oral THC , many doctors want to continue exploring faster - acting THC delivery systems , including a skin patch or a suppository .
Meanwhile we 're still awaiting hard proof that smoking marijuana can actually cause lung cancer .
That evidence has proved surprisingly elusive , maybe in part because typical marijuana users smoke so much less than typical tobacco smokers .
In any case , marijuana users are increasingly turning to a means of inhalation that does not involve smoking known as vaporization .
With a vaporizer -- the Volcano brand is the best known -- users heat marijuana to a temperature sufficient to vaporize the cannabinoids but insufficient to spark combustion and most of its associated noxious gases .
The vapors are captured in a balloon and then inhaled .
The government 's compassionate - use program
As a teenager Irv Rosenfeld was a strong opponent of marijuana use .
He would sometimes give talks against marijuana at local schools .
" I 'd hold up bags of my prescription drugs and say , ' Be thankful you 're healthy , ' " he recounts .
He was then taking prescription muscle relaxants , sleeping pills , anti-inflammatories , and a range of addictive , debilitating , opioid painkillers , including codeine , Demerol , and Darvon .
Shortly after Rosenfeld started college at the University of Miami , he caved in to peer pressure and tried pot .
" Nothing happened , " he says .
( To this day Rosenfeld maintains that he never has been able to get high from marijuana .
In my six or so hours with him , during which he drove me from Fort Lauderdale to Miami and back , all the while chain - smoking joints , I never noticed any apparent impact on him , other than an occasional cough . )
Rosenfeld continued smoking socially when others did .
" About the 10th time , " he continues , " I was playing chess when I realized that I 'd been sitting still for 30 minutes . "
Normally he could n't do that because his muscles would begin to ache and he'd have to change position .
" I had n't taken a pill in six hours .
Just then someone handed me the joint , and it hit me .
The only thing I 'd done different was smoke pot . "
Rosenfeld ran repeated experiments , and both he and his surgeon became convinced that marijuana helped him more than his prescription drugs , with fewer side effects .
In 1971 , with the blessing of his doctors and the indulgence of sympathetic police officials , he began smoking marijuana to treat his pain .
Then , in 1976 , Rosenfeld learned of the extraordinary case of Bob Randall ( now deceased ) .
Randall , who had severe glaucoma , had been prosecuted that year for marijuana possession in the District of Columbia but won acquittal after advancing a " medical necessity " defense .
Randall 's doctors had testified that he risked going blind without marijuana to relieve the pressure within his eyeballs .
Randall then brought a civil suit against the government .
In 1978 a mind - boggling settlement was reached :
The government agreed to supply Randall with marijuana for the rest of his life .
The government had the capacity to strike such a deal because since 1968 , NIDA had been growing a small quantity of marijuana for research purposes under contract with the University of Mississippi 's pharmacy school .
FDA and NIDA officials theorized that the U.S. government could lawfully become Randall 's supplier if they observed the pretense that he was part of a clinical study to investigate a potential new drug .
A research " protocol " was drawn up , though the study design called for just one patient : Randall .
Rosenfeld drew up a similar protocol for a clinical study of himself .
With the help of supportive doctors and threatening lawyers , Rosenfeld became the second patient to pry his way into what became known as the compassionate - use investigative new drug program .
By 1991 the compassionate - use program had grown to include 13 patients .
That year , after Randall counseled AIDS advocacy groups on how to seek admission to the program , it suddenly found itself deluged with 40 new applications .
In early 1992 , seeing the unworkable direction in which matters were headed , the government shut the program down , though the 13 existing patients were grandfathered in .
Today just four are left , including Rosenfeld .
For them , federal marijuana grown at the University of Mississippi is sent to a contractor in Research Triangle Park , N.C. , where it is rolled into cigarettes on an old machine obtained from the local tobacco industry .
About every five months the contractor sends six tins of the cigarettes to the pharmacy where Rosenfeld picks them up .
Rosenfeld 's weed is hardly connoisseur quality by contemporary California dispensary standards .
The government grows its crops only sporadically , so it dries the harvested flowers and places them in cold storage .
When I visited him in June , Rosenfeld was smoking marijuana harvested nine years earlier .
Because Rosenfeld finds the government 's cigarettes too dry , he unwraps them , rehydrates the marijuana by placing it in a container with lettuce , and then re-rolls his own joints , he says .
Rosenfeld 's cigarettes are also not very potent by contemporary standards .
They contain around 3.5 % THC , which was about the average strength of dope seized in domestic street busts in 1996 , according to NIDA data .
By contrast , marijuana seized from such busts in 2007 had an average potency of about 4.8 % , while the fresh " manicured bud " available at today 's best California dispensaries boast THC content ranging from about 6 % to 22 % .
It 's as if Rosenfeld were receiving vanilla ice cream joylessly made in the Soviet Union and stored for decades , when there 's fresh Ben & Jerry 's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough for sale just around the corner .
Still , Rosenfeld 's not complaining .
The government charges him nothing , so his only costs are medical consultations and pharmacists ' fees -- about $ 50 a month .
Subpar or not , the 8.3 ounces he receives every 25 days would cost him more than $ 2,000 on the street .
The battle to legalize marijuana
After the compassionate - use program was shut down , medical marijuana activists had one last hope for changing federal policies .
Back in 1972 , NORML and other groups had sued the predecessor of the DEA to force the rescheduling of marijuana as a prescribable drug , and incredibly , two decades later , the litigation was still raging .
During 14 days of hearings in 1986 the plaintiffs had presented many anecdotal accounts of nearly miraculous experiences patients had had with marijuana .
Rosenfeld testified , as did the psychiatrist and medical historian Grinspoon , who related not only the evidence his research had unearthed but also a personal anecdote .
In 1972 , Grinspoon 's own teenage son , who had leukemia , began undergoing chemotherapy .
" He would start to vomit shortly after treatment and continue retching for up to eight hours , " as Grinspoon later described the ordeal in his book .
" He vomited in the car as we drove home , and on arriving he would lie in bed with his head over a bucket on the floor . "
Having heard that marijuana could help , Grinspoon 's wife proposed that the couple let their son try it , but Grinspoon refused because it was illegal .
His wife then defied him , secretly smoking marijuana with the teenager before one of his treatments .
This time there was no vomiting , and in fact , on the way home the child asked to stop for a submarine sandwich .
" From then on he used marijuana before every treatment , and we were all much more comfortable during the remaining year of his life , " according to Grinspoon 's account .
In 1988 the administrative law judge hearing the case ruled in NORML 's favor .
" Marijuana , in its natural form , is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man , " Judge Francis Young concluded .
Young was referring to the fact that it is almost impossible to overdose fatally on marijuana , a circumstance that distinguishes it from virtually any other drug .
" By any measure of rational analysis , " Young concluded , " marijuana can be safely used within a supervised routine of medical care . "
In one of those maddening circularities of federal administrative law , however , the DEA 's appeal from Judge Young 's ruling was heard by John C. Lawn , then administrator of the DEA itself .
Not surprisingly , in 1989 , Lawn overturned all of Young 's findings .
Lawn gave short shrift to anecdotes like Grinspoon 's and Rosenfeld's .
" These stories of individuals who treat themselves with a mind - altering drug ... must be viewed with great skepticism , " he wrote .
" Many of these individuals had been recreational users of marijuana prior to becoming ill .
These individuals ' desire for the drug to relieve their symptoms , as well as a desire to rationalize their marijuana use , removes any scientific value from their accounts . "
Lawn also stressed the absence of any controlled clinical studies proving marijuana 's safety or efficacy .
He was right ; such studies did n't exist ( at that time ) , both because of the inherent difficulties of performing them on a whole plant and the unique difficulties of performing them on an illegal plant .
To even obtain marijuana for such tests , researchers would have had to first win approval from three federal bureaucracies - the DEA , the FDA , and NIDA -- a daunting task even assuming the best of good will on everyone 's part .
As for the controlled studies showing that marijuana 's chief psychoactive ingredient -- THC , in the form of Marinol -- was safe and effective for treating certain medical conditions , Lawn saw them as simply proving conclusively that there could be no conceivable excuse for smoking marijuana .
To whatever extent THC might be helpful , patients could use Marinol .
In 1994 the federal court of appeals for the District of Columbia upheld Lawn 's decision , and the activists ' last hope for achieving reform at the federal level died .
So they turned to state government .
In 1996 a group of marijuana activists in California got enough signatures to put a legislative initiative on the ballot known as Proposition 215 .
It called for permitting medical marijuana patients or their " primary caregivers " to possess marijuana on the " recommendation or approval " of a physician .
The measure passed with a 56 % majority , and California became the first medical marijuana state .
Precisely what that meant , though , remained totally unclear .
Prop. 215 did not specify how much pot patients could possess , and it said nothing about the way patients would obtain it .
Nothing in the initiative explicitly legalized sales or distribution of any kind .
Nevertheless , a few intrepid souls opened dispensaries .
Dispensaries - A legal gray area
" In the immediate wake of passage of Prop. 215 in 1996 , " recalls Stephen DeAngelo , who would later open what is now Oakland 's largest dispensary , " local governments tended to take a hands - off attitude toward medical cannabis . "
They would n't explicitly license dispensaries to open , he says , but they also did n't instruct the police to go shut them down .
" Dispensaries were tolerated but not sanctioned . "
Even those local politicians who supported the goals of Prop. 215 were reluctant to regulate in the area , because any such effort would have had to begin with dispensary operators filling out forms providing incriminating information about themselves .
Any such documents could then have been subpoenaed by federal prosecutors and used to shut the operators down or put them in prison .
DeAngelo , now 51 , was then a longtime marijuana activist but also a businessman .
From 1990 to 2000 he founded and headed the industrial hemp company known as Ecolution .
( Hemp , from which rope and other products are made , is a non-psychoactive strain of cannabis .
Hemp products are legal in this country , but growing hemp is not . )
Excited by the medical cannabis phenomenon in California , DeAngelo moved there in 2001 , when the legal environment was still extremely gray .
He found two main types of dispensary managers operating at that time , he recalls .
" The best of them were the well - motivated activists who brought really good intentions ... but had , for the most part , no business experience whatsoever and no capital to invest .
Despite that , they managed to thrive , simply because they were the only game in town .
" This engendered a second wave of operators , who were attracted by the money , as opposed to the cause , " DeAngelo continues .
" A whole new wave of dispensaries got thrown up , which I refer to as ' thug dispensaries . '
These were operations run by people who had a background in illicit activities , whether it was selling cannabis or other drugs on the street , or trading in illegal firearms , or in the porn industry or gambling industry -- people comfortable operating in the gray zone .
Very rapidly you began to see some big problems .
Several armed robberies .
You had a spate of stories about operators being arrested .
" As a patient , " says DeAngelo -- he uses marijuana to relieve pain from a degenerative disk disease -- " I was profoundly unhappy about it .
As an activist I became concerned because these types were really hurting the public image of medical cannabis . "
In an effort to improve the Wild West atmosphere , the California legislature then passed Senate Bill 420 ( " 420 " is a slang term for pot ) , which took effect in 2004 .
This law fleshed out a bit more about the way Prop. 215 would work , requiring counties to issue identification cards to patients who sought them ( to help them in their interactions with the police ) and setting up minimum guidelines for how much marijuana patients could possess : eight ounces of dried marijuana plus either six mature plants or 12 immature plants .
( Counties could allow higher amounts . )
Though SB 420 was still silent on the issue of dispensaries , it did contain a provision that protected patients or caregivers who " associate ... in order collectively or cooperatively to cultivate marijuana for medical purposes . "
Accordingly , nearly all the dispensaries in California now claim to be patient " collectives " or " cooperatives , " protected under this provision .
At the same time another provision of SB 420 seemed to cut against the idea that dispensaries were legal -- at least as many of them were ( and still are ) being run .
It said that nothing in the law should be construed to " authorize any individual or group to cultivate or distribute marijuana for profit . "
" In my opinion , " says Bill Panzer , a criminal - defense lawyer and marijuana legalization advocate who helped draft Prop. 215 , " the vast , overwhelming majority [ of dispensaries ] are not legal , because they 're not collectives or cooperatives .
If somebody owns the store , sells marijuana , and at end of day takes the extra money and puts it in his pocket and goes home , that 's not a collective . "
The proof - of - concept challenge
DeAngelo opened the Harborside Health Center dispensary in Oakland in October 2006 as a proof - of - concept that might show the rest of the nation how such an establishment could provide top - flight patient services , adhere to the letter of the law , and interact with the surrounding community beneficially .
His clinic , across from a scenic stretch of Oakland harbor , is identified only by its address -- a large , block - letter " 1840 " painted on the fa�ade of an inconspicuous , gray - blue one - story building on Embarcadero Drive .
On the inside it 's a spacious , wood - trimmed , tastefully appointed room that blends clean , contemporary lines with sparingly employed Eastern medicinal themes : a laughing Buddha here , a dancing goddess statuette there .
The mood is broken only by the metal detector at the door and the multiple casino - style cameras embedded in the ceiling .
Oakland has a high crime rate , and precautions must be taken .
There are at least three security guards inside the facility at all times , as well as two more outside , patrolling Harborside 's 100 - car parking lot .
" Whenever a patient comes into the clinic for the first time , " explains DeAngelo , " they sign a collective cultivation agreement .
They authorize all the other patients in the collective to grow medical cannabis on their behalf .
That sets up a 100 % closed - loop distribution system that isolates my patients from any contact with the illicit market . "
But that does n't mean that every member of the collective actually knows what a hoe looks like .
" For a variety of very valid reasons , " DeAngelo continues , " most patients are unable to grow their own medicine .
We act as a clearinghouse between patients who are able to grow and patients who are n't able to grow . "
Harborside now has 30,000 patients registered in its database , and their purchases of medicine bring in about $ 20 million annually in revenue , according to DeAngelo .
" I 'd rather not discuss my specific salary , " he says .
" I can tell you if I was working in any other industry and showed the kind of financial returns that this business has shown , I 'd be paid three or four times as much as I 'm making at Harborside . "
First - time patients , upon stepping through the metal detector at Harborside , immediately undergo a thorough paperwork check .
The patient produces his doctor recommendation , the clinic verifies its authenticity with the doctor , and then the clinic also verifies the doctor 's credentials with the state medical board .
About 600 patients come to Harborside each day , according to DeAngelo , most to buy marijuana , a few to supply it .
Suppliers can bring in as much as three pounds at a time .
( Bay Area police generally allow patients to transport this much , DeAngelo says . )
The patient - grown marijuana is inspected for quality , examined for molds and fungi , and tested with a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer to determine its THC content .
At Harborside , there are eight selling stations along a long counter , each near a glass case displaying the wide array of medicines available , labeled as to strain and THC content .
" Our most popular strains are our purple strains , " says DeAngelo , " like Purple Urkle or Granddaddy Purple .
The purples tend to be heavy indicas " -- one of the two main varieties of psychoactive cannabis -- " with a very strong , relaxing effect .
They have a characteristically sweet , almost candy - like flavor .
" Another popular family of strains is the Kush family , " he continues .
" That would include OG Kush , Baba Kush , and Pure Kush .
The Kushes tend to be more sativa - dominant , " referring to the other main variety of cannabis , which is said to produce a more cerebral , " daytime appropriate " high , with less body impact .
" They have a pungent flavor as opposed to a sweet flavor . "
At Harborside , I experienced a mild personal epiphany : I realized that I never really knew before what fresh marijuana smelled like .
Though I had easily recognized , from East Coast college days 30 years back , the smell of smoked marijuana inside Rosenfeld 's SUV , I had never before smelled the sweet , herbal fragrance suffusing Harborside .
At first I incorrectly assumed it was some sort of incense being artificially introduced to mask the odor I was familiar with .
As I further inspected Harborside 's medicines , I also realized that I had never really known before what fresh , high - quality marijuana looked like .
I remembered baggies half - filled with crushed brown twigs , leaves , stems , and even seeds .
But the dispensaries sell only fresh " bud , " which looks like cute , plump , fuzzy caterpillars curled in a ball .
After my education at Harborside I went on to explore some of the other approaches that marijuana entrepreneurs and activists are experimenting with as they try to rise to the proof - of - concept challenge .
Pioneering canna - businessman Richard Lee , also in Oakland , has opened his Blue Sky Caf� dispensary as a coffee shop , taking his cue from Amsterdam .
Lee acknowledges that he runs the Blue Sky as a for - profit business , a situation that the City of Oakland authorities have at least tacitly endorsed , notwithstanding SB 420's apparent prohibition of " for profit " distribution .
In 2004 the city , seeking to avoid being overrun by dispensaries , passed municipal regulations limiting the permissible number to four .
Those regs required that dispensary operators not earn " excessive " profits , which has been understood to imply that some profit must be permissible .
Lee was granted one of the city 's four permits .
Lee has also opened an array of affiliated businesses in the immediate neighborhood of the Blue Sky , several of the few bustling businesses in Oakland 's otherwise depressed downtown .
The best - known is Oaksterdam University , which trains medical cannabis entrepreneurs to navigate the business and legal challenges .
It also teaches trades to those who seek jobs as , say , a medical cannabis cultivator or " bud - tender , " i.e. , the quasi - pharmacist sales clerk who helps customers choose their medicine .
Oaksterdam has now opened branches in Los Angeles and Sebastopol , Calif. , about an hour north of Oakland , and stages conferences in Ann Arbor .
The most open dispensaries I saw were two branches of the Farmacy chain in Los Angeles .
They are full - service herbal medicine stores under the management of registered pharmacist JoAnna LaForce , with marijuana being sold inconspicuously alongside scores of uncontroversial , legal plant products with putative healing powers .
At these stores all members of the public , of any age , are welcome to enter , and only those who ask about marijuana are required to produce paperwork .
" That way , a young mother with children can come into a store and not feel like a criminal , " LaForce explains .
For my aesthetic taste , the most inviting dispensary I toured was the immaculate Peace in Medicine facility in Sebastopol .
Here , patients enter a handsome , freshly painted house -- the former sales office for a Ford dealership -- and come to what looks like a cheery doctor 's waiting room .
After taking care of the paperwork , patients are summoned into the dispensary .
There , I mention to Robert Jacobs , 32 , Peace in Medicine 's idealistic young executive director , how enticing the fresh medicine smells .
" If it smells good , the body probably wants it , " he responds , smiling a bit and sounding like Eve in the Garden of Eden .
I then notice a journalistic hole opening up in my reporting .
Until now I had assumed that my haphazard , stale , youthful experiences with marijuana would need no refreshing in order for me to write a thorough article about medical cannabis .
Now I 'm not so sure .
Unfortunately , most dispensaries are intransigent about serving only California residents , and I am not one .
I explain my quandary to Jacobs .
Listening back upon my words as they hang in the air , I realize that it sounds as if I 've just asked him to break the law .
He very politely declines .
Taxing and regulating dispensaries
In the early days of dispensaries the California Board of Equalization , which collects state and local sales tax , refused to issue seller 's permits to dispensaries that sought them -- the necessary prelude to paying sales tax in the state .
The board viewed such establishments as certainly illegal under federal law , and possibly illegal under state law .
In October 2005 the board changed tack and began allowing dispensaries to pay sales taxes if they wanted , and in 2007 it completed the reversal by requiring them to pay sales taxes and demanding that they do so retroactively to October 2005 .
The board assured the dispensaries in a February 2007 letter that it would now issue seller 's permits even if the dispensary refused to answer portions of the standard application -- identifying the product sold , for instance , or listing suppliers -- due to " concerns about confidentiality or self - incrimination . "
Since sellers ' permits do not require establishments to identify themselves as medical marijuana dispensaries , the board has no hard records on sales taxes collected from them .
Unless there is extremely poor compliance by dispensaries , however , the numbers should be robust .
Harborside alone reported about $ 15 million in sales in 2008 , for instance , and DeAngelo estimates that the average revenue for each of California 's 700 dispensaries probably ranges from $ 3 million to $ 4 million annually .
If so , gross statewide medical cannabis sales are approaching $ 2.5 billion , generating taxes of around $ 220 million .
That does not include the state and federal income taxes that dispensaries and their employees also pay , and employee payroll taxes .
In addition some localities , like Oakland , have begun imposing their own taxes .
Each of Oakland 's four dispensaries pays the city $ 30,000 annually for its license , plus a business tax on gross sales ( over and above state or local sales tax ) .
This past July , Oakland increased that business tax 15 times over , from $ 1.20 to $ 18 for every $ 1,000 in sales .
Tellingly , the increase had been sought by the dispensary owners themselves , who well understand the importance of being seen as good citizens and becoming indispensable to the city 's revenue supply .
Has medical cannabis been a good thing for Oakland ?
" I think so , " says Ignacio De La Fuente , Oakland 's current deputy mayor and , from 1998 to 2008 , president of its city council .
" I was not one of the initial supporters , " he concedes , and he still does n't favor legalizing marijuana for recreational purposes .
" But I became educated about the medicinal value of cannabis " over the years of debate , De La Fuente explains .
" You kind of make a decision of , Is this measure worth the risk to help the people that really need it ? "
On balance he believes it was , though he urges other localities considering legalizing medical marijuana to " do their homework about how they want to regulate establishments , so they do n't become a problem or a nuisance . "
" It 's not working , " says Councilman Dennis Zine of Los Angeles , a city that began regulating its dispensaries late , and is now overrun .
" Too many of these places have become distribution places for recreational purposes under the guise of medical , " he says .
In 2007 the city set a deadline after which no new dispensaries would be permitted .
A staggering 186 establishments met the cutoff , yet another 736 filed late applications , citing a " hardship " exception , and many of those opened too .
Zine estimates that there are about 600 dispensaries in his city .
He seeks tougher regulations , plus assistance from city , state , and federal authorities to help shut down any operator whose intent is " profit - making " as opposed to " compassionate " distribution for " medical purposes . "
" I think the next five or six years are going to be incredibly exciting for this issue , " says Stroup , who founded the National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws 39 years ago .
" I honestly believe we 'll stop arresting individual smokers in almost all states and start to see the first one or two states experiment with a legalization bill . "
Although Stroup originally wanted the " R " in NORML to stand for " Repeal , " he was later talked into softening it to " Reform " by cooler , more politically savvy advisers .
Now he thinks society might finally be closing in on his original goal .
Could be .
Just watch out for those swinging pendulums .
Barack Obama seems to have failed dismally in his first sustained attempt to show he is serious about making peace between Israel and the Palestinians .
Obituaries for the hope generated by his election , peaking in his Cairo speech in June , are being written in Arabic , Hebrew , and English .
For those who never believed that even Obama could succeed where Bill Clinton failed in the final days of his presidency , this was a death foretold .
But having been unable to persuade or cajole Binyamin Netanyahu to accept a total freeze on West Bank settlements , friendly Arab states to " normalise " relations with Israel or the Palestinians to restart long - stalled peace talks without preconditions , what will he do next ?
Mahmoud Abbas 's decision to stand down as Palestinian president has sharpened concerns that the moribund peace process is now facing a terminal crisis .
Even if Abbas relents , as he yet may , Obama 's strategy is clearly in deep trouble .
The US president 's options can be roughly divided between raising or lowering the level of American ambition for tackling the world 's most intractable conflict .
Raising it means tabling a big idea , a fully fledged peace plan or setting out parameters for a settlement .
That would involve addressing the highly sensitive core issues such as final borders , the status of Jerusalem and the refugee question .
The obvious danger is that a bold move could crash in flames , risking failure and damaging Washington 's credibility .
Analysts and diplomats surveying prospects at an international conference in Warsaw this week agreed that Obama is more likely to lower his ambition – proposing interim or limited steps to be discussed when the parties return to negotiations .
Possibilities include a further Israeli handover of part of the West Bank or adding a new set of mutual obligations to George Bush 's 2003 road map .
Israel might accept such an approach : Shaul Mofaz , a former Likud defence minister , has suggested setting up a Palestinian state on 60 % of the West Bank – circumventing all the knottiest problems .
Overall , Netanyahu 's government ( the most rightwing in Israel 's history ) seems content to " manage " rather than resolve the conflict while seeking to further develop the West Bank economy – the agenda being pursued by Tony Blair , the quartet envoy .
But Palestinians would reject moves that do not end the total Israeli control over their disconnected enclaves .
And any borders agreed on a " temporary " basis could turn out to last for years .
Bitter experience suggests that Jewish settlements would meanwhile continue to grow .
Palestinians face a paralysing double division : within the West Bank , where Abbas 's position has been badly weakened by his failure to deliver on peace with Israel ; and between Fatah and the Islamists of Hamas in the Gaza Strip , where Yasser Arafat 's successor is painted as no better than a collaborator with the occupation – presiding over a " Vichy " regime in Ramallah .
Obama needs to choose between attempting to resolve the conflict in all its aspects – a so - called " comprehensive peace " involving a deal with Syria and Israeli relations with Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies – and opting again for piecemeal measures that may build confidence and add up to something more substantial over time .
The model for that is the ill - fated Oslo process , which began with such high hopes in 1993 and ended in the second intifada seven years later – and with twice as many Israelis settlers on the ground .
Talking of Oslo , Obama is due in the Norwegian capital next month to accept the Nobel peace prize he was awarded so prematurely .
The association of the venue with past failure means it may not a good idea to launch a new initiative on that occasion .
Still , deciding what to do is far more difficult than choosing where to say it .
If most elements of this picture are grimly familiar , what has changed in recent days is the sense of deepening gloom captured in a report , on the dilemmas facing Fatah , by the International Crisis Group .
" A peace process that yields results seems a distant prospect at best , " it concludes .
" The gap between the two sides , the character of Israel 's government , entrenched divisions among the Palestinians and a US diplomacy that appears more captive than master of events – these and more have deflated the hopes of an Israeli - Palestinian breakthrough to which Obama 's election had given rise . "
It is hard to fault the accuracy of that assessment .

Barnes and Noble Nook To Hit Stores December 7
Barnes and Noble ‘s popular e-reader Nook is expected to his stores in limited numbers by December 7 .
This is a week delay versus original schedule of November 30 .
The bookstore was planning to deliver the units first to customers who pre-ordered the unit before November 20 .
A single unit of Nook costs $ 259 and is to rival Amazon ‘s Kindle and Sony ’s Reader .
The new announcement came as a surprise as an earlier announcement this month said that Nook is sold out through the year 2009 with January 4 as the next possible date for customers to buy the highly anticipated holiday gift item .
The Nook is the first electronic reader to be based on the Android platform initially developed by Google .
It supports the following formats : .epub , .pdb , .pdf and .mp3 .
Its differentiating factor is the “ LendMe ” feature where some books are licensed by their publishers for sharing allowing the purchaser permission to share a book once , with one other user , for up to two weeks .
Even so , it 's clear the monetary stimulus has been much smaller than the fiscal ( budgetary ) stimulus .
Over the seven months to April this year the Reserve cut the official cash rate by 4.25 percentage points .
Roughly 3 percentage points of this was passed on to the banks ' home loan and business customers .
The Reserve 's research suggests that every sustained 1 percentage point cut in rates leads to a rise in real gross domestic product of about 0.33 percentage points in the first year , another 0.33 points in the second year and another 0.165 points in the third .
So we 're talking about a stimulus in the first year capable of producing a rise of about 1 percentage point in real GDP - which has since been trimmed by the 0.5 percentage - point rise in the official rate - compared with effects from the fiscal stimulus estimated by Treasury to be worth 1 percentage point of GDP last financial year plus 1.5 percentage points this financial year .
In incorporating the effect of the fiscal stimulus into its forecasts at budget - time , Treasury used highly conservative ( pessimistic ) '' multipliers ' ' of 0.6 for the Government 's cash payments and 0.85 for capital works spending .
( That is , a cash payment of $ 1 was assumed to add 60 c to GDP , after allowing for the proportion saved and the proportion going on imports . )
Although Treasury has stuck with these multipliers in its revised forecasts , it 's clear they significantly underestimate the effect of the fiscal stimulus .
The truth is that , for many years , fiscal stimulus has been highly unfashionable in academic circles , and actively disparaged in some .
Little wonder its local promoters were so modest in their expectations .
But why has it been so effective ?
Partly , I suspect , because it was applied so early in the downturn , giving it a chance to start working before things had unravelled .
Partly because it was applied so wholeheartedly - that is , there was so much of it .
However , a big part of the credit must surely go to the effect of the stimulus ( including the monetary stimulus ) on business and consumer confidence .
It 's when stimulus not only adds directly to spending but also cheers people up - so they become more willing to spend their own money - that it can be mightily effective .
The big recovery in consumer confidence came after we received news that real GDP grew in the March quarter , thus avoiding the ' ' two successive quarters of negative growth ' ' silliness and prompting the media to trumpet the wrong ( but nonetheless helpful ) message that we 'd avoided recession .
So the reality of the spending boost in the March quarter had a favourable effect on the psychology of businesses and consumers in subsequent quarters , thus perpetuating a virtuous circle of spending .
Sceptics worry that a Keynesian kick - start wo n't achieve ignition ; that once the government money 's been spent , the economy will sag back to where it was .
In traditional Keynesian thinking , this is avoided by very high multipliers .
In the modern world , ignition seems to be achieved by the boost to confidence - if it 's done right .
Though it was reluctant to admit it , the shape and timing of the Rudd Government 's various packages were influenced by its desire to avoid two successive quarters of contraction .
It was reluctant to admit this for fear it would be accused of playing political games .
In truth , it was a smart tactic that recognised the key role to be played by the management of confidence and expectations .
And it worked .
In the early stages the Government also sought to improve expectations by expressing its willingness to pile on as much stimulus as proved necessary .
That seems to have worked , too .
So it 's not just the diehard Keynesians whose standing is enhanced by this episode .
It 's also those economists who emphasise the central role of confidence in driving the business cycle : the leading behavioural economist Robert Shiller of Yale and the Nobel laureate George Akerlof , of the University of California , Berkeley , who has nominated Keynes as the first behavioural economist .
But , some may object , a lot of our economy 's strength has not come from Keynesian stimulus , but from our strong exports to China .
Gotcha .
Why is China importing our resources so enthusiastically despite its fall - off in exports ?
Because of the massive fiscal stimulus to its economy .
The fact is that most relevant economies ( and the ultra - orthodox International Monetary Fund ) turned to fiscal stimulus in the wake of the global financial crisis , often because , with official interest rates close to zero , it was the only form of stimulus left .
Its success is evident in China , Japan and South Korea as well as here , while most countries ' '' cash for clunkers ' ' programs have boosted new car sales .
Keynesian policies are back in favour with policy - makers , and their academic detractors have lost credibility .

Moscow would soon grow famous for operatic oligarchs and Byzantine intrigues , but Khodorkovsky never got caught in a compromising position — never snared at an Alpine resort , a Moscow casino or on a Riviera yacht .
Girls , power , even the money , seemed to hold no magic .
Where others basked in pomp , he was shy and painfully soft - spoken ; you never heard his squeaky voice , a semitone deeper than Mike Tyson ’s , at dacha parties for the foreign press , let alone on television .
He divorced young but stayed on good terms with his first wife .
Inna , his second , he met at the institute .
Khodorkovsky was never flashy — he wore jeans and turtlenecks ; the family vacationed in Finland — but he radiated the unlikely allure of a muscular technocrat .
And yet , even at the top , he seemed adrift , unsure of his role in society .
Unlike older Jewish oligarchs , men like Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky , who were often animated by old scores to settle , Khodorkovsky did not seem to consider himself an outsider .
Lacking a public persona , he came to personify , by default , the revenge of the Soviet geek .
By 2000 , Putin had entered the Kremlin .
But Khodorkovsky — his net worth reportedly $ 2.5 billion — tried on a new role .
He ’d changed , he told colleagues .
If in the past , Yukos and Menatep had exploited tax havens , stringing a daisy chain of shell companies across the offshore zones of Europe , Khodorkovsky now became an advocate for corporate governance .
The first signs of an evolution had come under Yeltsin .
In 1998 , Russia suffered a crash — the state devalued the ruble , defaulted on $ 40 billion in bonds and cut its umbilical cord to the capital markets .
Banks collapsed , the stock market tanked and the oligarchs turned desperate .
Khodorkovsky , or so he told colleagues at the time , saw the need to reform .
Companies that believed in transparency and shareholders ’ rights , he now preached , did not fear lean times ; they attracted foreign investment , and they grew .
Skeptics abounded .
It was , at the least , a timely conversion .
Even as Putin sought to curb the oligarchs , Khodorkovsky expanded his influence by new means .
He brought in American firms like McKinsey and Schlumberger , experts in making the most of oil and profits .
He also sought an insurance policy .
Nearly a decade ago , he hired APCO , the Washington lobbying firm that employs former ambassadors and Congressmen .
But in Putin ’s second year in power , Khodorkovsky opened another front , setting up a foundation to support nonprofits and human rights groups .
In the months before his arrest , he courted the administration of George W. Bush and power brokers like James Baker .
His foundation recruited Henry Kissinger and Lord Rothschild for its board .
He financed policy groups in D.C. and human rights activists at home , and to the joy of Laura Bush , he gave a million dollars to the Library of Congress .
He joined the Carlyle Group ’s Energy Advisory board , serving alongside Baker , and met — on separate occasions — with the elder Bush , Condoleezza Rice and Vice President Dick Cheney .
In Houston , Khodorkovsky dangled a 40 percent chunk of Yukos before the oilmen — the sale would have fetched billions and , possibly , ensured protection from the state .
But in 2003 , in a brazen affront , Khodorkovsky started to finance opposition political parties .
Then that fall , he completed a megamerger , the union of Yukos and Sibneft , another Russian major , to create the world ’s fourth - largest oil company .
His rise was nearly complete .
But all the while , as he told me in one exchange , he ’d seen the warning signs .
“ I knew they ’d arrest me , ” he wrote .
“ I even spoke about it . ”
In October 2003 , Khodorkovsky boarded a jet in Moscow a near - wanted man .
After a summer of saying goodbyes to friends and family abroad , he embarked on a farewell tour .
It would be a second act in his new role , an audition in the hinterland .
He went on the stump , lecturing on a newfound vocation : “ Democracy . ”
To his surprise , the gamble proved a success — eight regions , dozens of appearances , mostly young people at every stop .
He was even given the stage at a military college .
Next up was a human rights forum in a Siberian city nearby .
But before his plane could take off , the dark vans had formed a circle on the tarmac .
“ WHO FEARS A FREE Khodorkovsky ? ” asked Marina Filippovna Khodorkovskaya , the defendant ’s 75 - year - old mother .
“ Forgive me if I ’m blunt , but it ’s Putin , and all those around him who stole Yukos . ”
Marina Filippovna comes to court as often as possible .
A sturdy former engineer , she has never shied from speaking her mind .
Asked by the BBC what she would do if she met Putin , Marina Filippovna replied without pause , “ I would kill him . ”
“ It ’s not for me to say what led to all this , ” she told me , as we stood together one morning , awaiting the arrival of her son , in the dilapidated Khamovnichesky District Court in central Moscow .
She raised both hands to conjure the years of turmoil .
“ I only know this case is about politics and money .
But which is more important , only those on high ” — again she gestured , this time to the ceiling — “ know the truth . ”
The answer is unlikely to emerge in Judge Viktor Danilkin ’s courtroom , a humble affair on the third floor of a squat building perched above the Moscow River .
Each time I went to court , over the course of two weeks earlier this year , I sat a few feet from the defendant .
It was a scene to boggle Kafka ’s imagination .

Conservative peer Baroness Warsi of Dewsbury , named Britain 's most powerful Muslim woman , has been pelted with eggs during a visit to Luton .
Baroness Warsi was taking part in a walkabout in the predominantly Muslim Bury Park area of Luton when she was confronted by a group of protesters .
The male protesters accused her of not being a proper Muslim and supporting the death of Muslims in Afghanistan .
Baroness Warsi , who was hit by at least one egg , debated with the men .
The shadow minister for community cohesion and social action was then taken into a nearby shop .
' Views challenged '
Baroness Warsi told the BBC that the men were " idiots who did not represent the majority of British Muslims " .
She said these type of protesters " bring Muslims into huge disrepute " .
" I stood up to this group and said I challenge your views , " she told BBC News .
" They just were n't prepared to listen .
They shouted .
I said if you want to have this debate , listen . "
She continued her walkabout with a police escort .
One of the protesters against Baroness Warsi , Sayful Islam , told the BBC they were " against everything she stands for " .
He said : " She is not a practising Muslim .
Clearly by looking at her she does not represent Muslims . "
He said he and his fellow protesters did not throw the eggs at her .
Baroness Warsi was named as one of the most powerful women in The Power List - chosen by a panel led by Trevor Phillips , chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission .
The award was set up to celebrate high performers in business , the arts , media , voluntary and public sectors .
From Ken Morris :
What the flippin ' flapjacks is going on here ?
The pounding in my head is like a bongo on steroids and unless I gain some understanding of what looks like an ocean of crazy stew , I 'm liable to take up residence in a rubber room .
Here 's what 's got my head Linda Blairing : Sarah Palin -- who must 've said our President was " pallin ' around with terrorists " a thousand times -- gave a speech in a communist nation known for human rights abuses , forced late term abortions , child sweatshops ( thereby making products so cheaply that U.S. manufacturing cannot compete ) , and poisoned dog food .
She then criticized the President in this foreign land for implementing trade restrictions .
Does anyone remember the Dixie Chicks ?
Days ago , when I lost out on the eBay auction to have dinner with Ms. Palin , I rationalized that with the restrictions , I 'd not have been approved anyway .
So , as I wrote shortly thereafter , " In the great American tradition of never say die , " I proposed a more substantial offer for an on the record discussion .
I will donate $ 100,000 to veterans ' charities for a second dinner with Sarah Palin and four guests , this one on - the - record and taped so as to minimize misrepresentations .
In the name of fair play , my list of invitees will include a subset of Rachel Maddow , Keith Olbermann , Thom Hartmann , Oprah Winfrey , James Carville , Randi Rhodes , Arianna Huffington , Frank Rich , Mudflats ' Jeanne Devon , Jane Hamsher , and Shannyn Moore .
On her side , Sarah Palin may invite guests as well ( how about Bill Kristol and Glenn Beck ? ) .
The only additional conditions are that the dinner / event last the entire four hours and questions asked are answered and discussed civilly .
No filibustering , no third party prompts , just face - to - face honesty .
Hostility by any invitee will be cause for removal .
No discussion of children , Vogue , Katie Couric , The Enquirer , or Levi Johnston permitted .
My reasons for such an offer are honorable and important .
With the Supreme Court positioned to overturn campaign finance laws in the Citizens United vs. Federal Elections Commission case now before it , corporate contributions to federal elections will be unfettered .
In other words , Sarah Palin with the help of an unlimited dose of corporate funds might one day be President .
Already , she has what appears to be a heady stable of influential supporters : Fox News , Rupert Murdoch , Bill Kristol , Lawrence Kudlow , etcetera , etcetera , etcetera .
In other words , I take her prospects seriously .
And , as she has chosen to be a spokesperson for , as she says , " American Main Street , " it is vital that she come out from behind her handlers and speak on the record in unscripted fashion .
We deserve to be enlightened by honest insights not merely prepared comments and pre-screened questions .
Many readers did n't expect Ms. Palin to accept my offer and , so far , I 've not heard a peep from her handlers ( though I did get a few candid comments from some of her supporters and to them , yes , I do know who my parents are .
Thanks for asking . )
How to generate interest in Camp Palin ?
To that end , if it 's a question of numbers , I 'm prepared to up the ante .
I originally wanted to post a challenge to the hundreds of readers who have expressed a willingness to contribute to veterans ' charities if this meeting of the minds came about .
My thought was to match public contributions up to an additional $ 100,000 .
However , there are many logistical problems beyond my ability to address so I 'll simply double the offer and suggest to Ms. Palin that there are many people who will add to the total .
The $ 200,000 minimum might well be something substantially larger .
The only change I 'd like to make in the original proposal is to add one additional name to the list of potential attendees .
As Ms. Palin claimed in her speech that de-regulation and lower taxes would end the financial crisis , it would be useful to invite Paul Krugman .
From a recent interview with Rachel Maddow , I gather he is n't in full support of that economic analysis .
While I 've not quite matched the reported $ 300,000 China fee , with public help we might yet reach that level and Ms Palin wo n't have to travel across the world to attend .
Best of all for her , the visibility and good will should be priceless .
As I said before a win-win and tres cool .

Lab tests show that metal nanoparticles can affect DNA without actually coming into contact with it – though the results are difficult to extrapolate to the human body
Nanoparticles of metal can damage the DNA inside cells even if there is no direct contact between them , scientists have found .
The discovery provides an insight into how the particles might exert their influence inside the body and points to possible new ways to deliver medical treatments .
The preliminary work also raises questions about the safety of nanoparticles – which are a thousand times smaller than the width of a human hair and used in everything from sunscreens to electronics – though the researchers point out that the doses they used in their study were higher than anything a person might come into contact with .
They also said it was difficult to extrapolate results from their laboratory tests to the human body .
In the experiment , scientists from the University of Bristol grew a layer of cells and exposed one side to cobalt - chromium nanoparticles .
On the other side of this cellular barrier were human cells called fibroblasts .
Though the nanoparticles never crossed the cellular barrier , they managed to damage the DNA of the fibrolasts via a cascade of biological signals in the intervening cells .
" We imagined a possibility that , in some way , that material had caused a change in the top cell layer and maybe there 's some sort of signalling going on from the top cell to the middle cell to the bottom cell , " said Patrick Case of the University of Bristol , who led the work .
Case 's team found that the DNA in the fibrolasts had around 10 times as much damage , in terms of breaks in the genetic material , compared with control conditions .
DNA damage can lead to various diseases , including cancer , but Case said the changes observed in his experiments did not lead him to believe the fibrolasts were becoming cancerous .
The research team deliberately exposed the barrier cells in their experiment to a dose of nanoparticles thousands of times higher than anything that would occur naturally .
" We used high doses of them because we wanted to make sure that the dose we used would cause damage to cells if the cells were exposed .
When we measured the damage on the other side of the barrier , to our great surprise , not only did we see damage on the other side of the barrier but we saw as much damage as if we'd not had the barrier at all and had put the materials in contact with the cells underneath . "
The results were published yesterday in the journal Nature Nanotechnology .
Ashley Blom , head of orthopaedic surgery at the University of Bristol , said : " This work has raised some really interesting questions and given us insight into how barriers in the body might work .
The body has lots of different barriers – blood - brain barrier , the skin , the lining of the gut , the placenta – and it may be that this mechanism works in some of these barriers .
" The problem is when you start translating lab work into clinical work .
It never works out in the human body like it does in lab - based experiments . "
He said that the human body may contain other barriers and mechanisms that scientists still do not understand and which may counteract or enhance the mechanism found by Case .
" So I 'm cautious in extrapolating this to the human body .
But if barriers in the human body do work in this way , the first exciting thing is , can we deliver novel therapies across barriers without having to cross them ? "
This would mean that a condition that affects the brain could be treated with something that does not cross the blood - brain barrier and does not come into contact with the brain .
" There are wonderful implications for treatments using nanotechnology . "
The research also has implications for natural nanoparticles already in human bodies , which might act across membranes to trigger diseases .
" Maybe small particles like prions and viruses may utilise some of these mechanisms , " said Blom .
Il ministro dell ’Istruzione Mariastella Gelmini , intervistata oggi dalla trasmissione Radio Anch ’
Io , si è espressa in sostanziale accordo con le recenti direttive della Chiesa sull ’ insegnamento della religione , affermando che “ l’insegnamento della religione così com’è stato concepito vada salvaguardato .
Non è un’ora di catechismo , ma un ’ora di approfondimento dei contenuti e dei valori .
Farla diventare un’ora in cui si insegnano altre religioni in maniera paritetica non è corretto ” .
Sull ’eventualità che possa essere introdotto l’insegnamento religioso multiconfessionale nelle scuole , il ministro ha inoltre affermato : “ questo non avviene nei Paesi musulmani , non capisco perché noi dovremmo rinunciare a quello che non è solo religione , ma è qualcosa che ha condizionato fortemente la nostra cultura , la nostra tradizione e la nostra storia ” .
Il ministro Gelmini ha ribadito che la richiesta della Chiesa di equiparare l’ora di religione agli altri insegnamenti è legittima , aggiungendo : “ Nel nostro Paese la religione cattolica non può essere paragonata alle altre religioni .
Ha una valenza maggiore , è praticata dalla stragrande maggioranza della popolazione e ha un passato attualissimo .
Non la si può mettere sullo stesso piano delle altre religioni , che vanno comunque rispettate ” .
“ L’ora di religione ” ha aggiunto il ministro “ non ha lo status delle altre materie , perché concorre in maniera indiretta alla valutazione dello studente , non provoca discriminazione per chi non la frequenta .
Dà invece diritto a crediti come le altre materie opzionali ” .
Il ministro ha inoltre criticato l'” accanimento ” di “ questo laicismo esasperato , questo attacco alla religione che è il fondamento della nostra civiltà e del nostro paese .
Non capisco perché si debbano creare insegnanti di serie A e di serie B. L’insegnante di religione cattolica deve avere gli stessi diritti degli altri insegnanti ” .
The “ sport ” of pointing a laser pointer at a plane is not new – many people have been arrested for the stupid stunt .
Last week was a first though – someone caught pointing their laser at two planes was arrested , and sentenced to two and a half years in jail .
His first target was a United Airlines plane carrying 180 passengers .
When the beam hit the cockpit window , the pilot caught it right in the eye , causing “ flash blindness ” .
The second target was an Alaska Airlines jet , this time the pilot was able to duck below a glare shield , but did have to abort a critical turn .
There appears to be no shortage of stupidity in the world , and shining a laser pointer at a jet just reinforces that .
I ’m not even sure what is going through the mind of someone who thinks this is a fun game .
These planes are carrying a lot of people , and in many cases they are on their final approach , one of the most critical parts of the entire flight .
To me , two and a half year is on the short side – but hopefully it ’ll still send a message to anyone else who was thinking of messing around with their laser pointer .

This piece was originally posted at the Web site of Physicians for a National Health Program ( http://www.pnhp.org).
One can only feel sorrow and dismay at the bullying and hate - mongering that is taking place at health care forums around the country .
Massive job losses , the devaluation and foreclosures of people ’s homes , and precipitous declines in lifetime savings produce widespread fears of further loss .
In an era of insecurity , mainstream Democratic Party proposals for reforming the health system have played into such fears .
A health care “ reform ” that protects private insurers and massive profits for the pharmaceutical industry inevitably becomes an ugly game where ordinary people ’s interests are pitted against each other .
Witness , for example , the proposed cuts to Medicaid and Medicare to fund an initiative that subsidizes the mandated purchase of private insurance with taxpayer dollars .
Relatively little is offered to the already insured majority who are told of upcoming belt - tightening .
The near - total exclusion of single payer from the health care debate by our political leaders and the media has contributed to the present state of affairs .
Single payer is an expanded and improved Medicare for All ( “ Medicare 2.0 ” ) .
Many , perhaps most , Americans have come to believe in the false choice between universal coverage and quality health care .
Our nation needs a meaningful dialogue , including a fair hearing of the views of the 20 million constituents of the Leadership Conference on Guaranteed Health Care ( of which Physicians for a National Health Program is a founding member ) , who advocate for single - payer national health insurance .
Polls show that most of the public and their physicians favor such an approach .
There is simply no other viable solution to the problems facing us all , insured and uninsured .
With Medicare 2.0 , the already insured would benefit from radically reduced out - of - pocket costs for comprehensive insurance and expanded choice of doctors and hospitals .
Medicare 2.0 stays with you for life , independent of your employment .
The epidemic of medical [ - related ] bankruptcies would be just a bad memory .
It is unnecessary to pit the insured against the uninsured , or those with Medicare and Medicaid against those with private insurance .
Multi-payer , for - profit health insurance adds cost but not value to American health care .
Savings of $ 400 billion a year can be obtained through the conversion to a single - payer system .
With the money we are now spending ( twice as much per capita as other developed nations ) , we can provide full service “ what you need , when you need it ” health care for everyone and control costs going forward .
With the “ everybody in , nobody out ” approach of a Medicare 2.0 system , we can all get more freedom , choice and security .
Single - payer advocates have been excluded from debate not because our premises or facts are wrong but because special interests , including the private health insurance industry and the big drug companies , have been allowed to define the limits of “ politically feasible . ”
We support the right to lively and dramatic expression of all views about health care and other issues in American political life .
We share a common sense of frustration expressed by many protesters that it often seems that Washington ’s ear is tuned to special interests over public interests .
However , we strongly condemn the bullying and hateful speech that has precluded meaningful discussion at many town hall meetings .
The ugliest language suggests that the uninsured or undocumented should be allowed to “ die in the streets ” and asserts that areas with less racial and ethnic diversity are “ the real America . ”
President Obama ’s citizenship is questioned and he is likened to Hitler .
These actions have been facilitated and promoted by networks of well - funded , right - wing interest groups who have tapped into a vein of fear and discontent in a time of rapidly rising hardship and anxiety .
With this deteriorating public dialogue , we should affirm that we can get better health care by sticking together to support single payer .
We support meaningful dialogue .
We affirm the dignity of all persons and insist that health care is a universal human right .
Health care is instrumental to “ life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . ”
We continue , as ever , to insist that “ everybody in , nobody out ” is best for all of us and embodies the best of American values .

OREM --
A massive marijuana plant growing in plain sight on a busy street all summer long ?
Orem Police Sgt. Craig Martinez says there 's no doubt what the plant was : pot , obviously .
The plant flourished on the curb near 1350 West and 130 South , not far from Center Street and Interstate 15 .
It reached 7 feet tall before anyone called police to report what they saw .
" We pulled it out and destroyed it .
There 's really - you know , you can't really gather any evidence as far as there , to see a footprint or something possibly or talk to some of the businesses , but we were n't able to find out who was growing that plant , " Martinez says .
Martinez says eventually someone did call , and the plant was removed earlier this month .
He described the plant as healthy .
" I do n't know if somebody was watering this thing every day or what was going on , but it was a nice - looking marijuana plant , " he says .
He does n't think it got to be 7 feet tall because people were intentionally turning a blind eye to the pot in their midst .
" I think it was just a case of people driving by , thinking it was just a nice , big , green bush , " he says .

The hundreds of e-mails being made public after someone hacked into Phil Jones ’ Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) computer system offer a revealing peek inside the IPCC machine .
It will take some time before we know whether any illegal activity has been uncovered ( e.g. hiding or destruction of data to avoid Freedom of Information Act inquiries ) .
Some commentators even think this is the beginning of the end for the IPCC .
I doubt it .
The scientists at the center of this row are defending themselves .
Phil Jones has claimed that some of the more alarming statements in his e-mails have been taken out of context .
The semi-official response from RealClimate.org , a website whose roots can be traced to George Soros ( which I ’m sure is irrelevant ) , claims the whole episode is much ado about nothing .
At a minimum , some of these e-mails reveal an undercurrent of elitism that many of us have always claimed existed in the IPCC .
These scientists look upon us skeptics with scorn .
It is well known that the IPCC machine is made up of bureaucrats and scientists who think they know how the world should be run .
The language contained in a draft of the latest climate treaty ( meant to replace the Kyoto treaty ) involves global governance and the most authoritarian means by which people ’s energy use will be restricted and monitored by the government .
Even if this language does not survive in the treaty ’s final form , it illustrates the kind of people we are dealing with .
The IPCC folks jet around the world to all kinds of exotic locations for their UN - organized meetings where they eat the finest food .
Their gigantic carbon footprints stomp around the planet as they deride poor Brazilian farmers who convert jungle into farmland simply to survive .
Even mainstream journalists , who are usually on board with the latest environmental craze , have commented on this blatant display of hypocrisy .
It seems like those participating – possibly the best example being Al Gore — are not even aware of how it looks to the rest of us .
The elitist attitudes exist elsewhere , too .
While the skeptics ’ blogs allow those who disagree to post opinions as long as they remain civil about it , RealClimate.org routinely ignores or deletes posts that might cast doubt on their tidy worldview .
The same thing happens at Wikipedia , where a gatekeeper deletes newly posted content that departs from the IPCC party line .
A few of the CRU e-mails suggest that manipulation of climate data in order to reduce the signature of natural climate variations , and to exaggerate the supposed evidence for manmade climate change , is OK with these folks .
Apparently , the ends justify the means .
The defense posted at RealClimate.org actually reinforces my point .
Do the IPCC scientists assume that this is how all climate scientists behave ?
If it really was how the rest of us behave , why would our eyebrows be raised up to our hairlines as we read the e-mails ?
If all of this sounds incompatible with the process of scientific investigation , it should n’t .
One of the biggest misconceptions the public has about science is that research is a straightforward process of making measurements , and then seeing whether the data support hypothesis A or B .
The truth is that the interpretation of data is seldom that simple .
There are all kinds of subjective decisions that must be made along the way , and the scientist must remain vigilant that he or she is not making those decisions based upon preconceived notions .
Data are almost always dirty , with errors of various kinds .
Which data will be ignored ?
Which data will be emphasized ?
How will the data be processed to tease out the signal we think we see ?
Hopefully , the scientist is more interested in discovering how nature really works , rather than twisting the data to support some other agenda .
It took me years to develop the discipline to question every research result I got .
It is really easy to be wrong in this business , and very difficult to be right .
Skepticism really is at the core of scientific progress .
I ’m willing to admit that I could be wrong about all my views on manmade global warming .
Can the IPCC scientists admit the same thing ?
Year after year , the evidence keeps mounting that most climate research now being funded is for the purpose of supporting the IPCC ’s politics , not to find out how nature works .
The ‘ data spin ’ is increasingly difficult to ignore or to explain away as just sloppy science .
If it walks like a duck , and quacks like a duck …
Syracuse , NY --
Is it later than we think ?
That 's a central question posed by Syracuse University professor Henry Mullins in his new book , " Will Population + Technology = Armageddon ? "
The earth sciences professor - author of numerous scientific papers - writes for the general public on in studying the potential consequences of runaway population growth .
Mullins spoke about his book .
( Extended interview )
So what do we worry about , fire or ice ?
It could be either .
I think we need to worry about excessive population and technology , which promotes more excessive population .
In the book , I mention three types of technology : good , bad , and useless .
And most of it is useless .
OK .
A useless technology ?
Twittering .
I do n't Twitter .
Do you Twitter ?
No .
But celebrities Twitter .
If this becomes a best - seller , and you become a celebrity , wo n't you start Twittering to give fans constant updates on your life ?
They 'd just be disappointed .
OK .
Good technology ?
It keeps us alive longer .
It decreases infant mortality .
It feeds more people .
Those are , in most people 's minds , good technologies .
But if we move past the earth 's sustainable limit - what we call the carrying capacity - I 'm not certain they 're all that good .
Population can't just go on increasing forever .
So we might be too smart for ourselves ?
Yeah .
Bad technology ?
Death rays and stuff ?
Yeah , H - bombs , A - bombs , biological and chemical weapons - those things .
Is overpopulation the biggest danger ?
Yeah .
Every ecosystem within the overall earth system has a carrying capacity .
It can sustain just so many types of organisms .
The earth can only sustain so many human beings .
What that number is , I cannot say , nor can anybody else .
But at the rate we 're going , it looks like we 'll pass it .
... Something 's got to change .
Any signs we 're near carrying capacity ?
Yeah .
Absolutely .
Every ecosystem in the overall earth system has a carrying capacity .
It can sustain just so many types of organisms .
The earth can only sustain so many human beings .
What that number is , I cannot say , nor can anybody else .
But at the rate we 're going , it looks like we 're going to go past it .
In the book , I use the example of a farm pond .
The farmer stocks it , catches a lot of fish , and he 's happy — until it reaches its carrying capacity and the fishing does n't improve .
So he throws a lot more fish in there , and he comes back , and they 're all dead .
Because he greatly exceeded the carrying capacity of the pond .
It 's a simple analogy , but the same thing holds true to our planet .
We can't have an infinite number of people .
The growth - curve , over time , is heading in that direction .
Something has got to change .
Are there any signs that we 're hitting the threshold now of that carrying capacity ?
In some countries , we may be .
For example , the birthrate for the United States is about 2.1 children for every woman .
Any time you 're over two , you 're going to have an increase .
So we 're close to equilibrium in the United States .
But we 're also the most affluent country .
I think the worst country on that is Niger — the birthrate per woman is about six .
Someone said , when we get to the carrying - capacity , wealth will equalize everything .
But we 're a very greedy species .
We may be an affluent country , but do we want to give half of our salaries to people in Niger , so they can have the same standard of living ?
I do n't think so .
You say with too many of us , the planet will seek a solution .
That sounds scary .
That 's based on the Gaia hypothesies of James Lovelock .
...
When a system gets knocked out of equilibrium , feedback within it brings it back , or the system collapses .
I have three story lines .
We exceed the carrying capacity , the earth system adjusts , and we have an equilibrium number of people at our carrying capacity .
Everything 's fine .
Another possibility is the catastrophe — nuclear winter , or pandemics , or runaway greenhouse effect , whatever .
It causes a drastic reduction in our numbers .
We go back to pre-industrial times , when we only had a few billion people on the planet .
Worst - case scenario is extinction .
Most species before us — about 99.9 percent — are now extinct .
We 've only been here a short period of geologic time .
That 's the catastrophe category ?
I have three story lines .
We exceed carrying capacity , and the earth system adjusts , and we have an equilibrium number of people ...
Everything is fine .
Another possibility is the catastrophe story line .
Nuclear winter or pandemics or runaway greenhouse or the next ice age -- whatever -- causes a drastic reduction in our numbers .
We got back to preindustrial times , when we only had a few billion people on the planet .
The worst case scenario is extinction .
Most species before us — 99 point nine percent or whatever — are now extinct .
And we 've only been here for a very short period of geologic time .
Are you an optimist or a pessimist ?
You 're talking some heavy stuff here .
I am .
I call it the ultimate question .
I consider myself an objective guy :
The glass is half empty and half full , if that makes sense .
. .
I 'm looking at this as a scientist .
But what is the " half - full " way of looking at the possibility of a major catastrophe due to overpopulation ?
Well , let ’s say we have a pandemic like AIDS — and our medical technology can’t handle it .
Our numbers come back to the carrying capacity .
That ’s the equilibrium story line .
Life carries on at the carrying capacity level with little variation .
When it gets too high , there is negative feedback to bring it back in check .
It if gets too low , there is positive feedback to bring it up .
So that would be a " half - full " type of perspective .
Wo n't technology find a solution ?
I 've had students read the book , and to a person , they put their faith in technology .
We 're used to rapid technological advances that make our lives easier , and allow for more people to survive birth and live longer .
But in my opinion , we 're a bit arrogant .
You think we 'll live to see it ?
I suspect that if there is a correction to be made , it 's 50 to 100 years out .
But I can't predict the future .
Nobody can .
OK , what should we do ?
Many respectable scientists and engineers believe we should geo-engineer the earth on a global basis .
They would put big reflectors out in space to deflect sunlight , to reduce global warming , or fertilize the oceans to draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
To me , that 's arrogant .
Life has been on our planet for 3.8 billion years , and it's had many upheavals — plate tectonic collisions , asteroids , volcanic activity .
It has always sustained itself in one form or another .
Not the same species — but one form or another .
I think it 's arrogant for us to think that we have a moral obligation to save life as we know it .
My suggestion — it may not be realistic — is that we become a global society , and we recognize that we are heading toward exceeding our carrying capacity , and we humanely reduce our numbers .
If things get out of control , there 's just too many people .
If our numbers are small enough , we become adaptable .
My suggestion is for the United Nations to get the population scientists and the sociologists together and figure out ways to humanely reduce our numbers or level them off at the carrying capacity .
... I consider it all an open question .
It 's something we need to start thinking about now — not 100 years from now .
Why would The Klingons accept Christ ?
Christianity fits well into the Klingon culture , though first impressions may seem to be to the contrary .
Klingons are warriors , first and above all .
The Klingon 's devotion to the empire , to one 's family and to personal honor , is well established .
Along with this particular attention to honor is a strong attachment to duty , even to the point of death .
For the Klingon , death is not feared .
Remember the the Klingon proverb , " Today is a good day to die . "
Klingons are not satisfied in peace , even a " peace of the brave , " as the Palestinians and Israelis are presently engaged in discovering .
For the Klingon , peace is a catastrophe , for it leaves no opportunity to cover oneself in glorious deeds .
There is a Klingon proverb , " Pity only the warrior who has defeated all his enemies . "
So , where does this leave the Klingon who is at peace with the Federation , who is surrounded with species that will not fight , with Romulans that hide behind a neutral zone , with Cardassians who are cowed and the Dominion who are a dying people ?
Without an enemy , is it true that Klingons will fight amongst themselves and destroy the empire ?
It can not be .
Christianity is a warrior 's religion .
It offers the Klingon enemies worth fighting : Sin , Death , Satan and his legions .
And the greatest holy war of all , a jihad to thrill the heart of a true warrior , the war to dominate one 's own will .
This is a glorious fight , and one that any true warrior relishes .
" If a Klingon does not fight , he does not breathe . "
As Paul , that most Klingon of apostles told Timothy , " Fight the good fight of faith , lay hold on eternal life , whereunto thou art also called , and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses . "
( I Tim. 6.12 ) A Klingon is attracted by such language .
But there is more .
In the Revelation of Jesus Christ , written by John , it is told , " And there was war in heaven : Michael and his angels fought against the dragon ; and the dragon fought and his angels , and prevailed not ; neither was their place found any more in heaven . "
( Rev. 12.7-8 )
And Paul tells of these Jews and their warrior hearts .
" And what shall I more say ?
for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon , and Barak , and Samson , and Jephthae ; David also , and Samuel , and the prophets :
Who through faith subdued kingdoms , wrought righteousness , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions , quenched the violence of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , out of weakness were made strong , waxed valiant in fight , turned to flight the armies of the aliens .
Women received their dead raised to life again : and others were tortured , not accepting deliverance ; that they might obtain a better resurrection .
( Heb. 11.32-35 )
Look at this section from a letter written by Paul to the Ephesians and say that Christians are not warriors !
11 Put on the whole armor of God , that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil .
" For we wrestle not against flesh and blood , but against principalities , against powers , against the rulers of the darkness of this world , against spiritual wickedness in high places .
Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God , that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day , and having done all , to stand .
Stand therefore , having your loins girt about with truth , and having on the breastplate of righteousness ; and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace ; above all , taking the shield of faith , wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked .
And take the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God : " ( Eph. 6.11 - 17 )
Indeed , Klingons accept the teachings of Christ as part of a warrior tradition .
Christ brings not peace , but a sword .
And this batlh 'etlh is a sword of honor indeed !
Ka Plah !!!
Is n't Jesus the humble suffering servant ?
Is the image of Christ as the humble and suffering servant compatible with Klingon attitudes ?
More to the point , how would a Klingon warrior react to the fragile , demure , and subjugated figure of Christ hanging upon a cross ?
Ah !
Of course a Klingon would reject such a figure , presented as it has been by countless Renaissance artists and Sunday School teachers over the years .
But that is not the true picture of Christ .
Christ was a robust and strong man , capable of fashioning a whip out of cords and using it to drive the corrupt moneychangers out of the temple area , all the while overturning heavy tables .
He went fishing at a time when fishing was hard labor indeed .
But this pales in comparison to his endurance and courage at the end of his life .
After enduring the taunts of his captors , their beating him with fists , being trundled roughly from one judge to another , Christ is beaten close to death with a Roman flagellum , a whip with each leather lash weighted with a heavy piece of metal , or sometimes bone , that would rip into flesh , bruise the muscle , and then tear the flesh as it was pulled away .
After stretching him on a pole so that his skin was taut , the flagellum was used by a trained Roman guard to flay his skin from his back .
People often died from this abuse , but Christ survived .
The Roman soldiers fitted a crown of thorns roughly onto his head .
These Judean thorns were like spikes often an inch or two in length .
They placed a heavy robe on his back and taunted him with more beatings .
When they removed the crown and robe , the coagulated blood would have been pulled away and all of his wounds , especially the raw flesh of his back , would have been re-opened .
Medical experts predict , at this point , that Christ 's loss of blood should have at least put him into shock , possibly killing a normal man .
This man , Jesus , carried a heavy piece of timber to the place of crucifixion .
The blood - loss was so severe that after stumbling several times , an observer was pressed into carrying it for him part of the way .
Jesus was then pinned to this rough wooden cross , which undoubtedly opened his back wounds again .
Through each wrist , a large iron spike was hammered .
Medical experts conjecture that this was done mostly to cause unendurable pain , for the nail would surely pierce the radial nerve , causing a burning pain throughout the arm and shoulder and chest .
The Roman guards , well - trained and adept at causing maximum suffering , would put another spike through the front of both feet .
Christ was so exhausted by this ordeal that every word he spoke was torture .
To take a breath , even a shallow one , required that he lift his weight onto the nailed feet , an excruciating ordeal .
As he tired , he bought each breath with pain .
To the Klingon , this illustrates a feature of Christ 's personality that is often neglected .
The Klingon Rite of Ascension requires that the initiate walk between two rows of warriors armed with pain sticks .
This is sometimes called The Way of Blood .
It is a test of a warrior 's commitment and courage .
Christ satisfied this requirement and much , much more .
And this act was no punishment for a criminal , as the Romans intended , nor was it a rite that had only a symbolic meaning .
Christ did not run from this pain ; he welcomed it .
His sacrifice was an act of will .
In this crucifixion , Christ defeated his enemies .
And this is what makes him a suitable savior for the Klingon as well as the human and all races .
Warrior Texts from The Bible
Ephesians 6:10 - 13 The Equipping
10 Finally , my brethren , be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might .
11 Put on the whole armor of God , that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil .
12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood , but against principalities , against powers , against the rulers of the darkness of this age , against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places .
13 Therefore take up the whole armor of God , that you may be able to withstand in the evil day , and having done all , to stand
LUKE 10 19 - 20
We have Authority given to us through Christ Jesus
19 Behold , I give you the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy , and nothing shall by any means hurt you .
20
Nevertheless do not rejoice in this , that the spirits are subject to you , but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven . "
Psalm 144:1,2
Blessed be the Lord of my strength ,
which teaches my hands to war ,
and my hands to fight :
My goodness , and my fortress ;
my high tower , and my deliverer ;
my shield , and he in whom I trust ;
who subdueth my people under me .

Revelation 19:11 -16
11 Now I saw heaven opened , and behold , a white horse .
And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True , and in righteousness
He judges and makes war .
12 His eyes were like a flame of fire , and on His head were many crowns .
He had a name written that no one knew except Himself .
13 He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood , and His name is called The Word of God. 14
And the armies in heaven , clothed in fine linen , white and clean , followed Him on white horses .
15 Now out of His mouth goes a sharp sword , that with it He should strike the nations .
And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron .
He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. 16 And He has on His robe and on His thigh a name written :
KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS .

Revelation 20 Satan the enemy Bound ; the Thousand - Year Reign ; Final Judgment
1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven , having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand .
2 He laid hold of the dragon , that serpent of old , who is the Devil and Satan , and bound him for a thousand years ; 3 and he cast him into the bottomless pit , and shut him up , and set a seal on him , so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were finished .
But after these things he must be released for a little while .
The Saints Reign with Christ 1000 Years
4 And I saw thrones , and they sat on them , and judgment was committed to them .
Then I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God , who had not worshiped the beast or his image , and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands .
And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years .
5 But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished .
This is the first resurrection .
6 Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection .
Over such the second death has no power , but they shall be priests of God and of Christ , and shall reign with Him a thousand years .
Satanic Rebellion Crushed
7 Now when the thousand years have expired , Satan will be released from his prison 8 and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth , Gog and Magog , to gather them together to battle , whose number is as the sand of the sea .
9
They went up on the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city .
And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them .
10
The devil , who deceived them , was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are .
And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever .
Romans 13:11 - 14 Put on Christ
11 And do this , knowing the time , that now it is high time to awake out of sleep ; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed .
12 The night is far spent , the day is at hand .
Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness , and let us put on the armor of light .
13 Let us walk properly , as in the day , not in revelry and drunkenness , not in lewdness and lust , not in strife and envy .
14But put on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make no provision for the flesh , to fulfill its lusts

8 But God demonstrates
His own love toward us , in that while we were still sinners , Christ died for us .

Prayer of Salvation :
" Dear Jesus , I believe in You .
I believe You are the Son of God , that You died for my sins , and that You were buried and rose again as written in the Bible .
I 'm sorry for the things I 've done that hurt You .
Forgive me for all my sins .
Come into my heart , take charge of my life and make me the way You want me to be .
With Your ever present help , I renounce all my sinful practices of the past .
Cleanse my heart with Your precious blood .
Write my name in Your Book of Life .
I confess
You now as my Lord and Savior .
Fill me with Your Holy Spirit .
Thank You , Jesus !
In Jesus ' Name , Amen . "
Sunspots , which rotate around the sun 's surface , tell us a great deal about our own planet .
Scientists rely on them , for instance , to measure the sun 's rotation or to prepare long - range forecasts of the Earth 's health .
But there are some years , like this one , where it 's not possible to see sunspots clearly .
When we 're at this " solar minimum , " very few , if any , sunspots are visible from Earth .
That poses a problem for scientists in a new scientific field called " Space Weather , " which studies the interaction between the sun and the Earth 's environment .
Thanks to a serendipitous discovery by Tel Aviv University 's Prof.
Colin Price , head of TAU 's Department of Geophysics and Planetary Science , and his graduate student Yuval Reuveni , science now has a more definitive and reliable tool for measuring the sun 's rotation when sunspots are n't visible -- and even when they are .
The research , published in the Journal of Geophysical Research - Space Physics , could have important implications for understanding the interactions between the sun and the Earth .
Best of all , it 's based on observations of common , garden - variety lightning strikes here on Earth .
Waxing and waning , every 27 days
Using Very Low Frequency ( VLF ) wire antennas that resemble clotheslines , Prof .
Price and his team monitored distant lightning strikes from a field station in Israel 's Negev Desert .
Observing lightning signals from Africa , they noticed a strange phenomenon in the lightning strike data — a phenomenon that slowly appeared and disappeared every 27 days , the length of a single full rotation of the sun .
" Even though Africa is thousands of miles from Israel , lightning signals there bounce off the Earth 's ionosphere ― the envelope surrounding the Earth ― as they move from Africa to Israel , " Prof .
Price explains .
" We noticed that this bouncing was modulated by the sun , changing throughout its 27 - day cycle .
The variability of the lightning activity occurring in sync with the sun 's rotation suggested that the sun somehow regulates the lightning pattern . "
He describes it as akin to hearing music or voices from across a lake : depending on the humidity , temperature and wind , sometimes they 're crystal clear and sometimes they 're inaudible .
He discovered a similar anomaly in the lightning data due to the changes in the Earth 's ionosphere — signals waxed and waned on a 27 - day cycle .
Prof .
Price was able to show that this variability in the data was not due to changes in the lightning activity itself , but to changes in the Earth 's ionosphere , suspiciously in tandem with the sun 's rotation .
Taking the pulse of the sun
The discovery describes a phenomenon not clearly understood by scientists .
Prof .
Price , an acclaimed climate change scientist , believes it may help scientists formulate new questions about the sun 's effect on our climate .
" This is such a basic parameter and not much is known about it , " says Prof.
Price .
" We know that Earth rotates once every 24 hours , and the moon once every 27.3 days .
But we have n't been able to precisely measure the rotation rate of the sun , which is a ball of gas rather than a solid object ; 27 days is only an approximation .
Our findings provide a more accurate way of knowing the real rotation rate , and how it changes over time , " he says .
Prof .
Price cannot yet say how this finding will impact life on Earth .
" It 's an interesting field to explore , " he says , " because nothing has been done to investigate the links between changing weather patterns and the rotation of the sun .
" Short - term changes in solar activity can also impact satellite performance , navigational accuracy , the health of astronauts , and even electrical power grid failures here on Earth .
Many scientists claim that the sun 's variability is linked to changes in climate and weather patterns , so the small changes we observed every 27 days could also be related to small variations in weather patterns .
" Our data may help researchers examine short - term connections between weather , climate , and sun cycles .
With this tool , we now have a good system for measuring the pulse of the sun . "

The flash before the flood
Starting with Python 2.5 , the Python compiler ( the part that takes your source - code and translates it to Python VM code for the VM to execute ) works as follows :
Parse source code into a parse tree ( Parser / pgen.c )
Transform parse tree into an Abstract Syntax Tree ( Python / ast.c ) Transform AST into a Control Flow Graph ( Python / compile.c )
Emit bytecode based on the Control Flow Graph ( Python / compile.c )
Previously , the only place one could tap into the compilation process was to obtain the parse tree with the parser module .
But parse trees are much less convenient to use than ASTs for code transformation and generation .
This is why the addition of the _ast module in Python 2.5 was welcome - it became much simpler to play with ASTs created by Python and even modify them .
Also , the python built - in compile function can now accept an AST object in addition to source code .
Python 2.6 then took another step forward , including the higher - level ast module in its standard library .
ast is a convenient Python - written toolbox to aid working with _ast .
All in all we now have a very convenient framework for processing Python source code .
A full Python - to - AST parser is included with the standard distribution - what more could we ask ?
This makes all kinds of language transformation tasks with Python very simple .
What follows are a few examples of cool things that can be done with the new _ast and ast modules .
Manually building ASTs import ast node = ast .
Expression ( ast. BinOp ( ast .
Str( 'xy ' ) , ast .Mult ( ) , ast .
Num ( 3 ) ) ) fixed = ast.fix_missing_locations ( node ) codeobj = compile ( fixed , ' < string > ' , ' eval ' ) print eval ( codeobj )
Let 's see what is going on here .
First we manually create an AST node , using the AST node classes exported by ast .
Then the convenient fix_missing_locations function is called to patch the lineno and col_offset attributes of the node and its children .
Another useful function that can help is ast.dump .
Here 's a formatted dump of the node we 've created : Expression ( body =BinOp ( left=Str(s='xy ' ) , op=Mult ( ) , right =Num( n=3 ) ) )
The most useful single - place reference for the various AST nodes and their structure is Parser / Python.asdl in the source distribution .
Breaking compilation into pieces
Given some source code , we first parse it into an AST , and then compile this AST into a code object that can be evaluated : import ast source = ' 6 + 8 ' node = ast.parse ( source , mode= ' eval ' ) print eval ( compile ( node , ' < string > ' , mode= ' eval ' ) )
Again , ast.dump can be helpful to show the AST that was created : Expression ( body =BinOp ( left=Num ( n=6 ) , op=Add ( ) , right =Num ( n=8 ) ) )
Simple visiting and transformation of ASTs import ast class MyVisitor ( ast. NodeVisitor ) : def visit_Str ( self , node ) : print ' Found string " %s " ' % node .s class MyTransformer ( ast. NodeTransformer ) : def visit_Str ( self , node ) : return ast .
Str ( 'str : ' + node.s ) node = ast.parse ( ''' favs = [ ' berry ' , ' apple ' ] name = ' peter ' for item in favs : print ' %s likes %s ' % ( name , item ) ''' ) MyTransformer ().visit( node ) MyVisitor ( ).visit( node )
This prints : Found string " str : berry "
Found string " str : apple " Found string " str : peter " Found string " str : %s likes %s "
The visitor class implements methods that are called for relevant AST nodes ( for example visit_Str is called for Str nodes ) .
The transformer is a bit more complex .
It calls relevant methods for AST nodes and then replaces them with the returned value of the methods .
To prove that the transformed code is perfectly valid , we can just compile and execute it : node = ast.fix_missing_locations ( node ) exec compile ( node , ' < string > ' , ' exec ' )
As expected , this prints : str : str : peter likes str : berry str : str : peter likes str : apple
Reproducing Python source from AST nodes Armin Ronacher wrote a module named codegen that uses the facilities of ast to print back Python source from an AST .
Here 's how to show the source for the node we transformed in the previous example : import codegen print codegen.to_source ( node )
And the result : favs = [ ' str : berry ' , ' str : apple ' ] name = ' str : peter ' for item in favs : print ' str : %s likes %s ' % ( name , item ) Yep , looks right .
codegen is very useful for debugging or tools that transform Python code and want to save the results .
Unfortunately , the version you get from Armin 's website is n't suitable for the ast that made it into the standard library .
A slightly patched version of codegen that works with the standard 2.6 library can be downloaded here .
It 's been a long time since I played something like Demon 's Souls .
I could n't pause .
I died a lot .
It took me roughly six hours to beat the first real level of the game .
I died some more .
The game 's mood constantly made me feel uneasy and jumpy .
I kept on dying .
And yet , I continued to play it with relish because I knew from the moment I started the adventure that this action - RPG was something special .
The game , created by From Software , is a pain to learn , terrifyingly difficult , and downright eerie a lot of the time .
It 's an unforgiving adventure that will probably turn off many gamers , primarily those who are used to easier titles ; if you like games that coddle their players , this is n't for you .
But , if you are willing to put up with the insane difficulty and like to actually work at playing a game , you 'll discover that Demon 's Souls is an incredibly rare gem .
Title Demon's Souls
Developer From Software Publisher Atlus Price $ 59.99 -$ 69.99 Shop.ars Platform PS3
The game 's intro paints a pretty bleak picture : in the kingdom of Boletaria , a king obsessed with power figured out a way to channel souls .
For a while , this knowledge paid off and brought a brief age of prosperity to the land .
After a while , though , a strange fog settled around the country and cut it off from the rest of the world .
Eventually , someone broke through the barrier and informed the country 's neighbors that it had been invaded by the forces of the Old One , a powerful demon that was less - than - thrilled at the idea of someone horning in on its spiritual turf .
Naturally , countless adventurers ventured into the fog , hoping to save the kingdom , but were never heard from again .
The player - character is like the rest of the ill - fated heroes , but with one ace up their sleeve : they 've been granted aid by the mysterious Maiden in Black , who rescues them from the jaws of death .
The premise of Demon ’s Souls sounds like it ’s straight out of a tired fantasy novel , but it soon becomes apparent that this game is anything but ordinary .
From the moment you begin your one - person war against the forces of darkness occupying Boletaria , you ’ll quickly realize that the country is completely overrun by demons , dragons , soulless soldiers , skeletons , and zombies ( of course ) .
There are no NPCs to help you , no friendly characters to offer you aid or succor ; everything out in the world is howling for your blood .
In other words , it ’s just you against the monsters .
But overwhelming odds are just the start of the ass - whooping that Demon ’s Souls will hand to you many , many times .
It ’s not uncommon to die as you progress through a level .
A lot .
This is especially true when you first try to pause the game and then realize that it wo n't actually pause .
Instead , a menu will appear over the screen , but the action continues in the background at full - speed .
It requires a lot of strategy to conquer a section of each province , and the only way to figure out which strategies work is to try something , ( usually ) fail miserably , and then try something else until you stumble across a winning approach that will let you inch a little further along before you have to repeat the process .
New armor , items , and weapons can be purchased at the Nexus , a sort of safe - haven for tortured souls .
Nexus is the one place where nothing will try to kill you , and you 'll have to backtrack here constantly if you want to store your items or pick up new ones .
Purchases are made with the souls of fallen enemies that you collect .
As a result , you 'll often find yourself backtracking through a level to get to a warp point and return to Nexus in order to make a purchase before you are temporarily removed from the gene pool .
The backtracking is necessary because , when you die , you 're taken back to the beginning of the section you were in .
You also are left in your " phantom form , " which sports a reduced amount of health than your character 's physical body would .
Finally , you 'll also lose all the souls you 've managed to accumulate up to that point .
If you can fight your way back to the spot that you died and touch the bloodstain you left behind , you can regain some of the souls you lost .
If you die three times before you get to it , though , the souls are lost for good .
The only way to regain your physical form is by winning a boss battle , which is never an easy task .
In most cases , this would be maddening .
But there is never a dull moment during this constant trial - and - error gameplay .
Enemies are quite varied throughout levels : even though they look the same , they 'll use different tactics and weapons , which means that you have to adjust your play style accordingly .
While the bastard sword might be useful for crowd control on an open field , reduced numbers in tighter spaces might require something smaller and faster like an assassin 's dagger .
Characters will eventually learn how to use magic and gain new skills , which deepens the gameplay experience significantly .
Up to that point , though , players have to be extremely cautious while they creep through ruins and try not to become dinner for the next thing that goes bump in the night .
It 's often a nerve - wracking experience , checking every shadow and rounding corners as carefully as possible , hoping against hope that you wo n't be caught off - guard while you continue to inch through the world .
Part of Demon 's Souls eeriness is also due to some great production decisions .
Visually , the unease stems from each level 's epic scale and the dreary coloring , but it 's the audio that really manages to pull this off .
There 's practically no music to be heard as you go through a level , which makes every piece of background noise all the more noticeable .
Like Hitchcock believed : things become rather intimidating when music is n't popping in to regularly remind the audience that what they 're watching is n't real .
Finally , the title 's online mechanic is unlike anything you are likely to experience in another game .
The game will automatically connect to the PSN when you start it up , and players can indirectly contact each other by leaving messages throughout the world offering tips , hints , or warnings about upcoming obstacles .
Later on , you 'll gain the ability to travel into other players ' games and either help or hunt them , depending on how you 've progressed your character .
Your actions will actually affect the way the world works for others : if you choose to help other players , aiding them on a difficult quest or battle , the Character Tendency of the world will shift towards a white setting , meaning the game is easier and enemies are n't as tough .
Hunting other players down , killing them , and stealing their souls , on the other hand , shifts the world towards a black setting and makes enemies a lot tougher .
While you can put out a message asking other players for help , the events when others come into your world to hunt you down is random , so you 'll constantly be on your toes for new threats after a certain point in the game 's story .
Demon Souls is unlike any other RPG you 're likely to play .
While there are plenty of elements from other titles in the game , this title is so difficult , stylish , and incorporates enough original ideas that it manages to stand apart from — and well above — its competitors .
Unfortunately , this challenge and depth is likely to turn off a number of gamers who prefer something easier .
If you 're willing to stick with this , though , Demon Souls will provide you with one of the greatest RPG experiences on the PS3 .

Two kite surfers from West Sussex took advantage of strong winds on the south coast to realise an ambition to jump over Worthing pier .
Jake Scrace , 25 , and Lewis Crathern , 24 , had been planning Monday morning 's jump for three years but had to wait for perfect weather conditions .
They took off from Goring to the west of Worthing in gusts of wind that were more than 40 mph .
Mr Scrace described the build up to the jump as " terrifying " .
Carpenter Mr Scrace , who makes kite boards , and professional kite surfer Mr Crathern are both from Worthing .
Between them they have 16 years ' experience in the sport .
The pair said the jump was quite hazardous and should not be attempted by amateurs .
" It was probably the most terrifying thing I 've ever built up to , " said Mr Scrace .
" We were practising down the road and we were pretty confident we were going to do it but as soon as we got nearer the pier it was quite hard . "
Mr Crathern said the jump was " epic " .
" It was everything I 've lived for - amazing , " he said .
Thank you for supporting Senator Nick Xenophon 's call for an inquiry into the Church of Scientology in Australia .
The petition has just been sent to all Senators in the Australian Parliament and the the Australian Prime Minister Mr Kevin Rudd , and leader of the Opposition , Mr Malcolm Turnbull .
In Australia , freedom of belief is absolute , but actions must be lawful .
Here 's hoping that a Senate Inquiry will lead to the Church of Scientology cleaning up its act .
Thank you again .

Though a majority of Americans now favor allowing gay couples to enter into civil unions ( 57 % ) , roughly half the country ( 49 % ) considers homosexuality to be morally wrong .
This is about the same number that considers abortion to be morally wrong ( 52 % ) .
A little more than a third do not consider homosexuality to be a moral issue ( 35 % ) and 9 % say it is morally acceptable .
A third of those who believe homosexuality is morally wrong still support civil unions , compared with 82 % of those who do not say it is morally wrong .
Blacks ( 64 % ) are more likely than whites ( 48 % ) or Hispanics ( 43 % ) to say homosexuality is morally wrong .
Education also splits Americans on the question of homosexuality .
Just 40 % of those with a college education see homosexual behavior as morally wrong , while 46 % of those with some college and 55 % of those with no college say it is morally wrong .
Religion and politics especially provide sharp divisions on this question .
An overwhelming number of conservative Republicans say homosexuality is morally wrong ( 75 % ) , while just a quarter of liberal Democrats agree .
Among those who attend religious services weekly , two - thirds say homosexual behavior is morally wrong , though just 31 % of those who attend seldom or never agree .

SLR Camera Simulator
Note :
This useful Camera simulator can NOT be viewed on an iPhone or iPad because those devices do n't support the Flash Player .
Aperture The Aperture function is to regulate the amount of light admitted through the lens .
The larger the aperture opening , the more light comes through .
How the aperture is set also affects the image depth .
If the aperture is large ( low aperture value ) the light transmission will be height and the depth of focus short .
Which means that when the aperture is small ( high aperture value ) the light transmission will be small and the depth of focus far .
To see how this looks , you can click in the box " link aperture / shutter " and pull the aperture control .
Note how the background depth of focus change .
Shutter
The camera 's shutter regulates image exposure .
The longer the shutter is open , the more light get through .
When shooting , it is important to find the right balance between the shutter and aperture value .
A short shutter mostly requires a lower aperture value .
The shutter also affects the image motion blur if you shoot a subject on the move .
A long shutter time results in a motion blur while a short time becomes sharper as the subject will not have time to move as much .
ISO ISO is short for International Organization for Standardization and tells the camera 's light sensitivity .
In analogue cameras with film is the film 's luminous display .
A high ISO value makes the camera more light sensitive so you can shoot with quick / short shutter speeds in a dark environment .
The disadvantage of a high ISO value is that the picture is more grainy .
Light meter Most SLR cameras has a built - in light meter .
The light meter shows how the image exposure values are set .
With this camera simulator you can try different aperture and shutters to affect a photos light , depth and motion blur .
Try also to change the camera 's light sensitivity by manipulating its ISO value .
A higher ISO value gives higher sensitivity to light , which allows faster shutter speeds .
The disadvantage is that the picture is more grainy .
NATO forces have mistakenly killed eight Afghan soldiers and police in an air strike during a battle while searching for two missing American soldiers in Afghanistan .
The NATO - led force said none of its troops were killed but five were wounded , along with at least 20 Afghans , in a battle that took place during a manhunt for the two soldiers who went missing on Wednesday ( local time ) .
Those killed include four Afghan soldiers , three policemen and another person believed to have been an interpreter .
" Yesterday , in a NATO air strike , seven Afghan [ soldiers and police ] were martyred in Badghis province , " Afghan Defence Ministry spokesman General Zaher Azimy said .
Lieutenant Todd Vician , a NATO spokesman , confirmed that NATO had launched air strikes during the search operation but said it was still investigating whether its strikes were responsible for friendly casualties .
The battle took place during a search and rescue operation for two soldiers from the US 82nd Airborne Division who went missing after a resupply mission .
The Taliban and provincial officials in Badghis say the two missing Americans drowned in a river .
A Taliban spokesman has said the militants recovered their bodies .
NATO says the search is still under way .
Reports of missing soldiers in Afghanistan are rare and prompt a large - scale military response .
Troops from more than 40 nations are members of the nearly 110,000 - strong NATO - led force , two - thirds of them American .

Three years ago today , November 28 , 2006 , Chris Pronger made his much - anticipated return to Edmonton .
Months earlier Pronger had been transformed around these parts from überhero to übervillain faster than you can say " Raleigh North Carolina " .
There were a number of strong parallels between Pronger 's return then and last night 's visit by Dany Heatley and the San Jose Sharks , including a boatload of hype , the Oilers ' blowing of a two goal lead , allowing a very late tying goal , and losing in extra time .
Then , as now , the Bettman point for taking the game beyond 60 minutes was scant reward indeed to a bitter defeat .
Tasted like a Loss both times , for sure and talk of " moral victory " rang hollow .
Anaheim dominated Edmonton as that game wore on , with both sides showing harbingers of very different futures : the Ducks would win the Stanley Cup while the Oilers would crash and burn down the standings .
Too early to call that a similarity , so let 's just say that neither of those things are beyond the realm of possibility with the 2009 - 10 Sharks and Oilers , respectively .
Another startling similarity from a personal perspective was that both times a free ticket to the hotly - anticipated " grudge match " dropped into my lap on the afternoon of the game .
Both times I wished and it came true .
Not claiming cause - and - effect , but it 's true .
At the time I sent my take of the situation , and of the game itself , to my hockey draft buddies in separate pre-game and post - game " notes " .
They 're still kind of interesting in the retrospective of the present .
Read on after the break :
... from the point of view of the prongee(s ) .
You 'll never guess what happened .
The phone just rang with a ticket to tonight 's game on it !
Yabba dabba !!
I 'm going to the most anticipated game of the season between two of the hottest teams in the league .
Oh yeah , it 's also The Chris Pronger Game .
People around here have long been foaming at the mouth to boo , fuelled by a media with a long history of turning on former Oilers .
Forget about the sports page , the front page of today 's Journal has a huge photo of Pronger and the headline : " Fans set to break out the boos : Return to Edmonton eagerly awaited as anger over controversial trade lingers " , and the editorial cartoon says " Welcome back Pronger " featuring a large Oilers logo with a noose in place of the oil drop .
I was frankly sickened by that ; what are we , some sort of lynch mob ?
Make no mistake , I think Pronger made several errors in judgement while he was here .
The decision to sign the five - year deal here and / or the subsequent events that led to the sudden departure being the first , and his handling of the situation last spring another .
That said , it 's not all black and white ; he deserves credit for the 20 % of his contract he did fulfil , and his play in the playoffs was hardly suggestive of a guy who could n't wait to get out of Dodge .
That was no Shayne Corson / Keith Tkachuk disappearing act he pulled once the real paycheques stopped flowing .
While he may be a little shy of personal integrity , his professionalism cannot be questioned .
And not just in the mercenary sense .
So I will probably neither cheer nor boo tonight -- or maybe both , I wo n't know until I 'm inside the building .
For sure I expect Pronger to play his usual composed game , the boos will roll off him like acid off a Duck 's back , and I sincerely hope Edmonton fans can show some class and not be too silly about all this .
Lost in the noise is the fact that it will be Scott Niedermayer 's 1000th NHL game tonight .
With Niedermayer and Pronger Anaheim boasts the best pair of defencemen near their prime since maybe Lidstrom and Konstantinov , or Chelios and Steve Smith .
Or Niedermayer - Stevens , or Pronger - MacInnis , come to think of it .
All I know is that when either guy is out on the ice their team is rarely in trouble , and the other team frequently is .
For sure they will be tested tonight by a speedy Oiler team that surely will bring its " A " game .
Ought to be a scintillating game .
Having drafted Pronger as an 18 - year old in [ our " keeper league " hockey pool ] and had him on my team his entire career , my own perspective on him is a little longer - term than the single year he spent here .
As an Oiler fan , I found my peace a couple of weeks ago when watching an Oilers - Blues game featuring Eric Brewer on one side and Ladislav Smid and Joffrey Lupul * * on the other .
Forget about Pronger , that 's not a bad trade at all .
And I think forgetting about Pronger is about the best thing Oiler fans can do .
He 's gone , let 's move on and support the guys who do want to play here .
[ Historical footnote : I turned on Lupul a little later that season .
I do n't think I was the only one . ]

Reconsidering Pronger
... in light of Tuesday night 's showdown .
I 've attended quite a few of these ' homecoming ' games over the years -- Gretzky of course ( the only time I 've seen the building full for the pre-game skate ) , Coffey ( after a bitter holdout and trade ) , Moog ( first game of the Stanley Cup Final , * against * Fuhr ) , Messier ( first star performance ) ... all of them interesting to a great degree .
Of the ones billed as ' The Return of Chucky ' I would rate the intensity and vitriol in the building for this one as somewhat lower than for either Mike ( Take the Bonus Money and Run ) Comrie or , especially , Jimmy Carson , whose various crimes included walking out on a contract during the season , being an American wuss , and most egregiously , not living up to the hype of being the guy who Wayne Gretzky was ' traded ' for .
Sure people booed , there were lots of signs , but it just did n't feel like people really had their hearts in it .
We 've seen it before , all too many times .
A few chants , mostly ' Pronger sucks ! ' or ' You sold out ! ' or ' Let 's Go Oilers !
( Pronger sucks ! ) '
I really felt like the crowd was going through the motions to a large extent , doing ' what was expected ' .
I myself never made a sound , but you can bet I watched Pronger 's every move .
Could hardly have had a better seat , row 23 on the players ' bench side , top of the face - off circle in Anaheim 's right defensive zone , Pronger 's territory .
Just as I expected , the big man came out and played a clinical , dispassionate game , showing no sign of jitters .
First touch tipped a dangerous shot over the glass , then handled the puck four more times on that shift making a good safe play every time , then four more times the second shift , and on he went .
I tried to count the number of times he handled the puck -- counting boos should be easy I figured -- but soon lost track .
It was easier to count his mistakes ... in fact I counted exactly zero times when Pronger had decent possession of the puck that the next player to touch it was an Oiler in the same zone .
Of course hockey is a game of flow where there is no reliable way to record solid plays -- this is n't baseball where you can quantify that the shortstop has handled 143 chances without an error -- but on this night Pronger probably handled the puck more than any other player , and was officially charged with 0 of the game 's 47 giveaways .
He 'd gain control , take his time , find the open man and hit the breakout pass bang !
bang !
bang !
automatic as Joe Montana connecting on six - yard outs .
On the rare occasions that the Oilers pressured him hard , he would quicken his pace , fire a harder pass that was tougher to handle but in a worst case would clear the zone .
In the offensive zone Pronger distributed the puck efficiently , occasionally sifting low wrist shots into traffic , which resulted in two of Roloson 's better saves ( a shot that got through , another that was deflected by a mountain with soft hands named Dustin Penner ) , and one he could n't stop , a hard pass to Selanne 's tape for an easy deflection , closing the gap to 2 - 1 .
I can honestly say the Ducks were never in trouble when Pronger was out there , only once did Stoll get half a step on him and with a giant stride and a deft pokecheck , the puck was harmlessly in the corner .
He had a quiet , efficient night , 1 takeaway , 1 blocked shot , 1 shot on goal , 1 assist , +1 .
No negative stats at all .
It was a masterful performance by a master of the position .
The combination of size , range , hands , vision , low panic point , underrated skating skills , and absolute command of the ice is every coach 's dream .
Time and again he reminded this Oilers fan what he brought us last year , and what we are so clearly missing now .
The Ducks as a whole were scary good .
After Selanne 's goal they took over the second half of the game and hemmed the Oilers in almost constantly .
They won the huge majority of the battles as they seemed to have more speed , skill , stamina , and especially size : Shane O'Brien , 6 '2 , 228 ; Sean O'Donnell , 6'3 , 231 ; Dustin Penner , 6 '4 , 243 ; George Parros , 6 '5 , 232 ; Chris Pronger , 6 '6 , 220 .
On the rare occasions they got over their own blueline , the Oilers had trouble making it to centre for the shoot - in .
The Oil did have the lead , but it was one of the more blatant displays of Hang On Harvey hockey that I have seen in a while .
Jason Smith was heroic with 11 blocked shots , but he could n't block Chris Kunitz 's quick backhand in the dying seconds that sent the game to OT , where it seemed inevitable that the Ducks would score again to win .
Which they did , courtesy Ryan Getzlaf ( 6'3 , 211 ) , one of an impressive cast of young hotshots .
Selanne , Scott Niedermayer and Pronger are all on their way to the Hall , while J.-S. Giguere , Andy MacDonald , Todd Marchant , Sami Paulson , Rob Niedermayer , Corey Perry , Getzlaf , Penner , Kunitz , O'Donnell et al make a strong supporting cast .
This club is for real .
The good news from the Oilers ' perspective centred on Ladislav Smid , one of four commodities they received in the Pronger deal ( along with Joffrey Palindrome and a couple of choice draft picks ) .
On this night the 20 - year old rookie played 30:03 , more than Pronger , more than Niedermayer , more than anybody .
This guy is a natural , he has a great feel for the flow of play , where to find the open ice when pressured , how best to get himself out of trouble long enough to make the safe pass .
He too handled the puck a ton , had just 2 of the Oilers 33 turnovers and 4 of their 11 takeaways .
He 's no Pronger -- he scores a point a month , not a point a game -- but I think the offence will come to some extent , and he 's already one of the most composed and reliable Oilers .
The ironic thing about all of this is that when people explain the reason for their outrage at Pronger , they always cite him signing a five - year deal and bailing after one .
Whereas if he'd have done what Mike Peca did , just played out the last year of his existing contract and moved on , the Oilers would have gotten absolutely nothing in return for him ... no Smid , no Lupul , no picks .
And people would 've been fine with that .
Strange , is n't it ?
Obechi
From the creators of the wonderful Boomshine , Obechi is a simple but challenging way for you to squander the rest of your Monday afternoon .
A devout Muslim woman forced by her husband to eat pork , wear short skirts and drink alcohol slashed his neck with a kitchen knife as he slept , according to a statement she gave to US police .
Rabia Sarwar , 37 , a native of Pakistan , pleaded not guilty to attempted murder and was freed on 25,000 dollars ( £ 15,000 ) bail .
She told police in a written statement that she was emotionally abused by her husband , Seikh Naseem , and forced to violate her religious beliefs .
" He made me do so many things that are against Islam , " she wrote in a statement to police .
" I did all that just to make him happy but inside me there was a war , " she continued .
Mr Naseem suffered cuts to his neck , cheek and hand early on Wednesday before fighting Sarwar off and dialling police from his home in the New York City borough of Staten Island , authorities said .
" I did my best to cut his throat , " Rabia Sarwar wrote .
" But the next moment he jumped on me and grabbed me . "
Sarwar 's lawyer , Joe Licitra , said she had previously been treated for depression .
Her husband told the New York Post that Sarwar was having a hard time adjusting to American culture .
" There was no gun pointed to her head to do these things , " Mr Licitra told the Post .
Sarwar 's statement to police paints a picture of a frustrated , confused woman angry that her husband of five months was not what he appeared to be during their brief courtship .
After they were married , she discovered he had previously dated mostly " white " women , had been married before and liked to go out to drink , she wrote .
He was not religious , though he claimed to be a devout Muslim , and he often yelled and cursed her family , she said .
And one of his favourite writers was Salman Rushdie , author of The Satanic Verses , which caused violent protests by Muslims in several countries because the book was perceived as an irreverent depiction of the prophet Mohammed .
" He hates Pakistan and he hates Pakistanis then why did he marry a Pakistani girl ? " she wrote .
They fought about her leaving , and he threatened to hurt her family , saying they would have to pay him 30,000 dollars ( £ 18,000 ) or he would sue them and leave them penniless and homeless , she wrote .
Her family is in Pakistan .
She lay in bed that evening thinking her only way out was to kill him , she wrote .
Police said they had never visited the house on any domestic dispute calls , they said .
Sarwar also pleaded not guilty Thursday to second - degree assault and criminal possession of a weapon .
Her next court date is on Monday .

Public prosecutors in Italy have urged a court in Milan to jail 26 Americans for the kidnapping of a terrorism suspect in a 2003 CIA operation .
The Italian lawyers are seeking sentences of between 10 and 13 years for the US agents .
They also want 13 years for the former head of Italy ’s secret service , Nicolo Pollari .
The trial is the most high profile case in Europe to challenge the extra-judicial transfers also known as ‘ renditions .
It centres on the abduction of the Muslim Cleric Abu Omar , who was snatched off the streets of Milan in 2003 and secretly flown to Egypt for interrogation .
He says he was tortured and held until 2007 without charge .
The US has refused to extradite any of the Americans .
None of them are at the trial .
The last Bush administration admitted using Rendition as part of its so called ‘ War on Terror . ’
It was n't meant to go this way .
For months we had been told that the efforts to ban the construction of minarets in Switzerland were doomed .
The last surveys suggested around 34 % of the Swiss population would vote for this shocking initiative .
Last Friday , in a meeting organised in Lausanne , more than 800 students , professors and citizens were in no doubt that the referendum would see the motion rejected , and instead were focused on how to turn this silly initiative into a more positive future .
Today that confidence was shattered , as 57 % of the Swiss population did as the Union Démocratique du Centre ( UDC ) had urged them to – a worrying sign that this populist party may be closest to the people 's fears and expectations .
For the first time since 1893 an initiative that singles out one community , with a clear discriminatory essence , has been approved in Switzerland .
One can hope that the ban will be rejected at the European level , but that makes the result no less alarming .
What is happening in Switzerland , the land of my birth ?
There are only four minarets in Switzerland , so why is it that it is there that this initiative has been launched ?
My country , like many in Europe , is facing a national reaction to the new visibility of European Muslims .
The minarets are but a pretext – the UDC wanted first to launch a campaign against the traditional Islamic methods of slaughtering animals but were afraid of testing the sensitivity of Swiss Jews , and instead turned their sights on the minaret as a suitable symbol .
Every European country has its specific symbols or topics through which European Muslims are targeted .
In France it is the headscarf or burka ; in Germany , mosques ; in Britain , violence ; cartoons in Denmark ; homosexuality in the Netherlands – and so on .
It is important to look beyond these symbols and understand what is really happening in Europe in general and in Switzerland in particular : while European countries and citizens are going through a real and deep identity crisis , the new visibility of Muslims is problematic – and it is scary .
At the very moment Europeans find themselves asking , in a globalising , migratory world , " What are our roots ? " , " Who are we ? " , " What will our future look like ? " , they see around them new citizens , new skin colours , new symbols to which they are unaccustomed .
Over the last two decades Islam has become connected to so many controversial debates – violence , extremism , freedom of speech , gender discrimination , forced marriage , to name a few – it is difficult for ordinary citizens to embrace this new Muslim presence as a positive factor .
There is a great deal of fear and a palpable mistrust .
Who are they ?
What do they want ?
And the questions are charged with further suspicion as the idea of Islam being an expansionist religion is intoned .
Do these people want to Islamise our country ?
The campaign against the minarets was fuelled by just these anxieties and allegations .
Voters were drawn to the cause by a manipulative appeal to popular fears and emotions .
Posters featured a woman wearing a burka with the minarets drawn as weapons on a colonised Swiss flag .
The claim was made that Islam is fundamentally incompatible with Swiss values .
( The UDC has in the past demanded my citizenship be revoked because I was defending Islamic values too openly . )
Its media strategy was simple but effective .
Provoke controversy wherever it can be inflamed .
Spread a sense of victimhood among the Swiss people : we are under siege , the Muslims are silently colonising us and we are losing our very roots and culture .
This strategy worked .
The Swiss majority are sending a clear message to their Muslim fellow citizens : we do not trust you and the best Muslim for us is the Muslim we cannot see .
Who is to be blamed ?
I have been repeating for years to Muslim people that they have to be positively visible , active and proactive within their respective western societies .
In Switzerland , over the past few months , Muslims have striven to remain hidden in order to avoid a clash .
It would have been more useful to create new alliances with all these Swiss organisations and political parties that were clearly against the initiative .
Swiss Muslims have their share of responsibility but one must add that the political parties , in Europe as in Switzerland have become cowed , and shy from any courageous policies towards religious and cultural pluralism .
It is as if the populists set the tone and the rest follow .
They fail to assert that Islam is by now a Swiss and a European religion and that Muslim citizens are largely " integrated " .
That we face common challenges , such as unemployment , poverty and violence – challenges we must face together .
We cannot blame the populists alone – it is a wider failure , a lack of courage , a terrible and narrow - minded lack of trust in their new Muslim citizens .
Tariq Ramadan , a Swiss citizen , is professor of contemporary Islamic studies at Oxford University .
His most recent book is What I Believe
IN THIS age of environmental anxiety , it is tempting to believe that the root of the Earth ’s troubles is actually very simple : too many people .
All our other problems would melt away , if only the population were reduced .
Intuitive – but wrong .
When populations go into decline , economies follow .
And a healthy economy is required to solve our myriad environmental challenges ( see Population : Europe ’s problems will grow as it shrinks ) .
There is a middle way : “ demographic sustainability ” .
This is all about creating both environmental and economic sustainability with a falling , ageing population .
It involves fine - tuning fertility to keep populations level or in slow decline .
Critically , it also means basing success on stability …
For the past month , the keepers of Bryant Park have employed a system of electronic sensors to count the number of people using the park ’s public rest rooms .
In September , they ’re going to test the system at a couple of the park ’s entrances , with the goal of refining their park - traffic assessments , which they rely upon to measure the health of the park and the success of the various programs they ’ve introduced to lure people there .
This would seem to represent a threat to Danny Gordon , whose job it has been , for the past five years , to count , by hand , the daily number of lunchtime visitors .
But Gordon has an advantage , which one hopes no machine could nullify , and that is his ability to tell the difference between a man and a woman .
In those rare instances when he can ’t , he just guesses .
“ Sometimes I ’ll make it a man , sometimes I ’ll make it a woman , ” he said one recent muggy afternoon .
“ And , if I realize afterward that I was wrong , I ’ll change the next person . ”
He counts with two clickers : one in his right hand for the men , one in his left for the women .
As he clicks his way through the lunchtime crowds , arms out , wrists bobbing , he looks a little like a skier planting his poles .
Recently , Gordon has found that , on most weekdays , there are more women in the park than men .
This is how his boss , Dan Biederman , would like it to be .
Biederman , the longtime president of the Bryant Park Corporation , was a protégé of the urban sociologist William ( Holly )
Whyte , whose theories about the dynamics of public space included the idea that the presence of women indicates civic health .
“ Women pick up on visual cues of disorder better than men do , ” Biederman said the other day .
“ They ’re your purest customers .
And , if women do n’t see other women , they tend to leave . ”
Biederman visits the park several times a day and sometimes goes undercover .
( Look out for a fit , middle - aged gentleman in a pin-striped suit , reading “ The Red Badge of Courage . ” )
He has discerned that women notice homeless people more than men do , object more to crumbs on picnic tables , and are more sensitive to foul odors , such as that of urine , which signals that there are no clean , functional bathrooms nearby .
Twenty years ago , Bryant Park was an infamous shambles .
Few women — or men — would go near it .
Now it ’s a handsome place , with flower beds , pétanque games , a lending library , a carousel , thousands of portable chairs , theatrical performances , and many other inducements .
And so the women come .
Presumably , a female preponderance not only emboldens more women but also entices more men .
“ There ’s great girl - watching , ” Biederman acknowledged .
Danny Gordon , the head - counter , can attest to this .
Last August , as he clicked his way through the park , a young woman from Trinidad asked him what he was doing , and he explained .
“ Do I count ? ” she asked .
“ You ’re so pretty , you count twice , ” he told her .
Nine months later , they were married .
Gordon is forty - four and lives in Fairview , New Jersey .
He often roller - skates to work , via the George Washington Bridge .
The counting , which is one of his many duties , takes about an hour .
He starts at the park ’s southeast corner at around 1 P.M. , dividing the park into strips and working them east to west and then back .
He ’ll designate a tree or a certain person — “ ‘ black shirt , ’ ‘red hair , ’ ‘ green glasses , ’ or , before I got married , ‘ hot mama ’ ” — as a boundary for each strip .
“ It ’s really easy to drift , ” he said .
The open lawn in the middle of the park was disgorging hundreds of people who ’d come to see an opera performance .
“ I ’ll get the moving traffic first , ” he said .
He worked fast , and had no problem clicking and talking at the same time .
He ’d tried earlier to estimate the size of the crowd on the lawn , and now he went out on the grass to count the number of chairs left behind .
It soon became clear that his method was not entirely scientific , although it may be unscientific in the same way every day .
When he was done counting , he looked at the clickers and said , “ These are jive - turkey numbers . ”
There had been a couple of anomalies : the opera crowd , a late start .
He did a little math on a piece of paper .
Still , the tally — 3,370 — was typical , as was the breakdown : fifty - three per cent female .
“ Go to any public space in the world , ” Biederman had said .
“ If it ’s skewing overwhelmingly male , get out as soon as possible . ”
It was a nice afternoon , therefore , to linger . ♦
“ [ The adjustable rate bank note issued Aug. 4 , 2004 is ’ hereby canceled , voided , nullified , set aside and is of no further force and effect . . . the lender and its successors are barred , prohibited and foreclosed from attempting , in any manner , directly or indirectly , to enforce any provision of ” the mortgage loan . ”
- Suffolk County Supreme Court Justice Jeffrey A. Spinner
“ We never asked for this .
I was shocked , honestly .
It ’s not like we said , ‘ Judge , please throw the loan away . ’
We just wanted them [ the bank ] to be reasonable . ” - Greg Horoski , East Patchogue
Home owner .

Here ’s a fascinating development : A Long Island judge voided the mortgage of a home - owner after the legal team for the creditor behaved in an egregious manner .
The lender lied in various dunning notices and court papers , claiming a balance due of $ 527,437.73 , including an escrow overdraft of $ 46,627.88 for advanced taxes — even though the outstanding loan balance was $ 283,992.48 as of Aug. 10 and the taxes were already paid .
Excerpt :
A Suffolk judge awarded a Long Island family their East Patchogue house , wiping the slate clean on their mortgage debt and ruling that the bank holding their home loan had acted in a manner “ so completely devoid of good faith that equity cannot be permitted to intervene on its behalf . ”
In a terse , no -holds - barred decision rendered Nov. 19 , Suffolk County Supreme Court Justice Jeffrey A. Spinner blasted the actions of IndyMac Mortgage Services , a division of OneWest Bank F.S.B. , and its representatives – and awarded the home to Diana J. Yano - Horoski and husband Greg Horoski .
The decision came after a series of state - mandated , pre-foreclosure settlement conferences between the lenders and borrowers of subprime loans .
Spinner wrote in his decision : “ It was celeritously made clear to the Court that Plaintiff had no good faith intention whatsoever of resolving this matter in any manner other than a complete and forcible devolution of title from Defendant . ”
The lending institution , represented at a hearing on Sept. 22 by Karen Dickinson , regional manager of loss mitigation for IndyMac , asserted Yano - Horoski owed a debt in excess of $ 525,000 – and “ freely concedes ” that the property was worth “ no more than ” $ 275,000 , Spinner wrote . ”
Glad to see the screws being turned on weasels like this . . .

China should step up to the plate as the leader of a new global economic order , and the US should n’t fear the establishment of a global currency because it would help the economy , billionaire investor George Soros says .
In a recent interview with the Financial Times , Soros said that China has n’t been pulling its weight in reorganizing the global economy after last year ’s economic collapse , and the way to convince China to lead is to allow it to “ own ” the reorganization of the global financial system that is underway .

“ You really need to bring China into the creation of a new world order , a financial world order , ” Soros told FT .
“ They are kind of reluctant members of the IMF .
They play along , but they do n’t make much of a contribution because it ’s not their institution . …
They have to own it the same way as , let ’s say , the United States owns the Washington consensus , the current order , and I think this would be a more stable one where you would have co-ordinated policies .
I think the makings of it are already there because the G20 , in agreeing to peer reviews , effectively is moving in that direction . ”
Peer reviews are a mechanism by which members of the G20 club of economic powers can review other members ’ economic performance and warn those members of dangers to their economies .
Soros also advocated for the creation of at least a limited global currency , which he says would help reduce the imbalances in the global economic structure and would actually benefit the United States , whose dollar currently acts as a de facto global currency .
Soros said the IMF ’s Special Drawing Rights — a kind of currency that IMF member countries can use to transfer money between countries — could be the backbone of a new global currency .
“ I believe that basically the system is broken and needs to be reconstituted , ” Soros said .
“ We cannot afford to have the kind of chronic and mounting imbalances in international finance .
So , you need a new currency system and actually the Special Drawing Rights do give you the makings of a system and I think it ’s ill - considered on the part of the United States to resist the wider use of Special Drawing Rights .
They could be very , very useful now when you have a global shortfall of demand .
You could actually internationally create currency through special drawing rights , and we ’ve done it . ”

Special Drawing Rights , or SDRs , were created in 1969 as a way of supplementing countries ’ currency reserves .
Their value is determined by a formula based on the values of the US dollar , the British pound , the Japanese yen and the Euro .
Recently , the IMF has been using SDRs to help out countries struggling under the weight of the global recession .
As Soros noted , China itself has advocated creating a global reserve currency from the IMF ’s drawing rights .
European leaders such as British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy have also called for an expanded role for the IMF in the emerging global economy .
Soros said that while the US received “ great benefits ” from having the US dollar as the default global currency , that time is now past because the US “ abused ” its currency ’s power to create an imbalanced global trade system

“ We have abused it and I do n’t think we can continue abusing it anyhow , ” Soros said .
“ So it is not necessarily in our interests to have the dollar as the sole world currency because as the world economy grows , it needs an additional currency and , if the dollar is that additional currency , it means that the US has to have chronic current account deficit .
And that is not appropriate .
I think it ’s in our interests as well to reform the system . ”
Some critics of the global financial system have argued that SDRs are the thin end of the wedge to the creation of a world government , arguing that institutions like the IMF and the G20 undermine the sovereignty of nations by taking control of economic policy out of the hands of national leaders .
Soros ’ comments are unlikely to assuage those concerns .
No name — but a soldier brave , he fell .
We shall find her , without a name ;
This picture , sometime , will tell whence he came .

The soldier ’s body was found near the center of Gettysburg with no identification — no regimental numbers on his cap , no corps badge on his jacket , no letters , no diary .
Nothing save for an ambrotype ( an early type of photograph popular in the late 1850s and 1860s ) of three small children clutched in his hand .
Within a few days the ambrotype came into the possession of Benjamin Schriver , a tavern keeper in the small town of Graeffenburg , about 13 miles west of Gettysburg .
The details of how Schriver came into possession of the ambrotype have been lost to history .
But the rest of the story survives , a story in which this photograph of three small children was used for both good and wicked purposes .
First , the good .
Four men on their way to Gettysburg were forced to stop at Schriver ’s Tavern when their wagon broke down .
They heard the tale of the fallen soldier and saw the photograph of the children .
One of them , Dr. J. Francis Bourns , a Philadelphia physician on his way to tend to the wounded from the battlefield , was intrigued .
He convinced Schriver to give him the photograph so that he might attempt to locate the dead man ’s family .
Perhaps he was touched by the poignancy of the photograph — three children , all under the age of ten , now without a father .
As a life - long bachelor he might have yearned for a wife or family of his own .
On the other hand , perhaps he saw it as an opportunity for financial gain .
Dr. Bourns returned to Philadelphia with the ambrotype .
He had it copied by several photographers , producing hundreds of inexpensive duplicates in the carte de visite format .
The carte de visite photograph , roughly the size of an index card , could be printed in multiple copies , allowing for much quicker mass production of a single photographic image than ever before .
Because there was no way of printing photographs in a newspaper , Bourns knew that he might need dozens if not hundreds of cartes de visite to put the image of the three children before the eyes of someone who knew them .
But the story had to be circulated as well , so the photographs were supplemented by a series of newspaper articles , the most prominent of which appeared in The Philadelphia Inquirer on Oct. 19 , 1863 , a little over three months following the discovery of the ambrotype .
It appeared under the heading , “ Whose Father Was He ? ”
After the battle of Gettysburg , a Union soldier was found in a secluded spot on the field , where , wounded , he had laid himself down to die .
In his hands , tightly clasped , was an ambrotype containing the portraits of three small children , and upon this picture his eyes , set in death , rested .
The last object upon which the dying father looked was the image of his children , and as he silently gazed upon them his soul passed away .
How touching !
how solemn !
What pen can describe the emotions of this patriot - father as he gazed upon these children , so soon to be made orphans !
Wounded and alone , the din of battle still sounding in his ears , he lies down to die .
His last thoughts and prayers are for his family .
He has finished his work on earth ; his last battle has been fought ; he has freely given his life to his country ; and now , while his life ’s blood is ebbing , he clasps in his hands the image of his children , and , commending them to the God of the fatherless , rests his last lingering look upon them .
When , after the battle , the dead were being buried , this soldier was thus found .
The ambrotype was taken from his embrace , and since been sent to this city for recognition .
Nothing else was found upon his person by which he might be identified .
His grave has been marked , however , so that if by any means this ambrotype will lead to his recognition he can be disinterred .
This picture is now in the possession of Dr. Bourns , No. 1104 Spring Garden [ Street ] , of this city , who can be called upon or addressed in reference to it .
The children , two boys and a girl , are , apparently , nine , seven and five years of age , the boys being respectively the oldest and youngest of the three .
The youngest boy is sitting in a high chair , and on each side of him are his brother and sister .
The eldest boy ’s jacket is made from the same material as his sister ’s dress .
These are the most prominent features of the group .
It is earnestly desired that all the papers in the country will draw attention to the discovery of this picture and its attendant circumstances , so that , if possible , the family of the dead hero may come into possession of it .
Of what inestimable value it will be to these children , proving , as it does , that the last thoughts of their dying father was for them , and them only .
For those of us used to seeing stories illustrated with photographs , the Philadelphia Inquirer article is fascinating .
The absent ambrotype is described : “ The children , two boys and a girl , are , apparently , nine , seven , and five years of age , the boys being respectively the oldest and youngest of the three .
The youngest boy is sitting in a high chair , and on each side of him are his brother and sister .
The eldest boy ’s jacket is made from the same material as his sister ’s dress . ”
The description asks us to think about the details , to imagine them , to pick from among many other details the relevant ones , the ones that can be used to unravel the mystery .
The use of “ the same material ” implies a mother ’s hand , or at the very least , a bolt of cloth that was purchased and then used to make clothing for both children .
It is evidence — a clue .
We are looking for the unseen wife — “ . . . we shall find her without a name ” — the woman who made the garments out of whole cloth .
Mark H. Dunkelman Collection
Here , a photograph is used to provide a unique identification .
Not in the way that might be imagined — someone looking at the ambrotype and saying , “ That ’s so - and - so . . . . ”
But by providing a piece of evidence , a context , that could be used to identify the family and the deceased husband and father .
In the traditional detective story , someone asks around :
Do you know the identity ( or the name ) of the people in this photograph ?
Here , the identification is not made on the basis of recognizing the people from a photograph .
But by first “ translating ” the photograph into words and sentences .
The ages of the children were estimated — as it turns out not far from the truth — but the telling details were their respective positions in the photograph , the fact that there were three of them , and the shirt and dress worn by the brother and sister flanking the brother in the middle were similar .
Also , family portraiture was not so commonplace .
A family had to go to a photography studio or be visited by an itinerant photographer .
The family of the fallen soldier was asked to identify the one picture that was taken .
The widow would have enough information to make an identification .
Today , we are able to seamlessly integrate words and pictures — captions and photographs — but the Humiston story allows us to see how this was done before there were means to easily put the two together in a newspaper or broadsheet .
And then , a woman in Portville , N.Y. , was shown a story about the photograph that appeared in the American Presbyterian .
She feared the worst , having not heard from her husband since the battle of Gettysburg .
She asked the town postmaster to write to Dr. Bourns on her behalf and request a copy of the ambrotype .
When she opened the letter from Philadelphia in late November of 1863 , Philinda Humiston knew her husband , Amos Humiston , the father of her three children — Franklin , Alice and Frederick — was dead .
The story of Amos Humiston has been chronicled in a book by Mark H. Dunkelman , “ Gettysburg ’s Unknown Soldier , ” [ 2 ] an attempt to recover the “ identity ” of Amos Humiston from the depredations of history .
There were two separate searches more than a century apart , an initial search to identify the fallen soldier , and then a subsequent search to discover something about the man .
There is also a series of implicit questions .
The first question is :
What is his name ?
The second question : Who is he ?
Tell me something about Amos Humiston .
And then , there is a third question : “ Who is he to us ?
What does he mean to us ? ”
( This is the first of five installments of “ Whose Father Was He ? ”
The remaining four parts will be published on consecutive days this week . )

Editor 's note : Gloria Borger is a senior political analyst for CNN , appearing regularly on CNN's " The Situation Room , " " Campbell Brown , " " AC360° " and " State of the Union With John King , " as well as during special event coverage .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Congressman Earl Blumenauer says he 's just a regular fellow " trying to get things accomplished . "
As a result , the Oregon Democrat tells me , he spends much of his time " looking for ideas that can bring people together -- simple , straightforward ideas that would help people and their families . "
And so he proposed the infamous " death panels . "
Really .
Before they were Palinized -- and turned into those nasty death panels ready to pounce on Grandma ( that " goofy stuff , " as he now calls it ) , Blumenauer had a good idea : help people prepare for the end of life .
As he wrote in The New York Times last weekend , the proposition was simple : " I found it perverse that Medicare would pay for almost any medical procedure , yet not reimburse doctors for having a thoughtful conversation to prepare patients and families for the delicate , complex and emotionally demanding decisions surrounding the end of life . "
So , when he began work on health care reform , he included a provision that would allow Medicare to cover a voluntary doctor - patient discussion ( only once every five years ) about things like living wills , power of attorney and end - of - life treatment .
Oh , the horror .
Talk radio quickly got wind of the proposal when ex-New York Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey excoriated the measure as a depraved idea that would somehow counsel people to just go ahead and die faster .
The absurd notion metastasized .
And since Congress is the great lagging indicator , the bizarre interpretation predictably headed toward the floor of the two Houses .
Republican leaders were unwilling to balk at a juicy opportunity to fan the flames -- even though the fire was fake .
They courageously took on this great cause .
Soon after , the resulting Sarah Palin Facebook post was heard ' round the world : " The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama 's ' death panel . ' ...
Such a system is downright evil . "
And none other than the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee , Chuck Grassley , was seen on YouTube telling angry constituents , " We should not have a government program that determines if you 're going to pull the plug on Grandma . "
Rep .
Blumenauer may be a liberal -- he calls himself " progressive " -- but that does n't mean he looks like a guy out to hurt your grandparents .
He rides his bike to work and back to promote his environmental agenda ; he 's joined with Republicans to fight wasteful government spending .
But his health care story has become a profoundly cautionary tale about our political discourse -- and how it has grown increasingly degraded and infected by a combination of combustive politics , a needy media food chain and a hopelessly partisan Congress .
" It 's beyond depressing , " he says . " ... I am disappointed in ways that are hard to describe . "
In some other times , Blumenauer 's idea -- which , after all , is modest in scope and not exactly earth - shattering in concept -- would have been considered for what it was : an idea to help people navigate the difficulties of serious illness and , eventually , death .
It 's a real problem ; just ask anyone who has gone through it with a family member .
Besides , it 's also an idea that , in the recent past , has been considered quite acceptable , even by those who would rail against it now .
Palin , for instance .
In April , 2008 , the then - Alaska governor issued a state proclamation declaring " Healthcare Decisions Day , " designed to " raise public awareness about the need to plan ahead for healthcare decisions related to end of life care and medical decision making whenever patients are unable to speak for themselves and encourage the specific use of advance directives to communicate these important healthcare decisions . "
Seems like Palin went rogue -- on herself .
And in passing a 2003 prescription drug bill , more than 200 House members and more than 40 GOP senators voted for an almost identical provision that applied only to terminally ill elderly patients .
I guess it seemed like a good idea at the time .
But that 's ancient history .
George W. Bush was president , and Barack Obama was an Illinois state legislator .
" I fear it 's getting worse in Washington rather than better , " Blumenauer says .
" We 're digging ourselves into a bigger hole .
...
This stuff makes me cringe . "
The book he wants to write , he adds , is called " It Does n't Have to Be This Hard . "
But for now , at least , the Blumenauer idea remains in the House bill .
Senator Rockefeller is likely to introduce his own version of the measure in the Senate .
Blumenauer first came to Congress at another polarized time -- in a special election in 1996 , after the government shutdown in which then - House Speaker Newt Gingrich and President Bill Clinton stared each other down .
That was n't an easy time , either .
But this , he says , is worse .
Gingrich himself has been cagey about this issue , preferring instead to argue that government should n't be trusted with " power . "
Blumenauer winces at the former speaker 's stance .
" I served with Newt Gingrich , " Blumenauer says .
" I did some things with him .
He 's not a crazy person . "
But Gingrich may want to be president , and that 's where we -- the media -- come in .
As Blumenauer points out in his piece , we 're the echo chamber here -- and when Palin posts a comment about a " death panel , " we headline it ( as she knows we will ) and the idea moves though the media chain with mach speed .
As much as some of us try to debunk the myth , velocity often trumps veracity .
" When stuff gets out of hand , " Blumenauer says , " it 's often hard for even the mainstream media to put a damper on it . "
Besides , the agenda is still set by the politicians .
And as each side continues its arguments over ideological purity , there will always be a fight to cover .
On the right , the quest , he says , " comes at the expense of moderate and independent conservatives . "
And on the Democratic side , " we have fractioned , too , as our numbers increase . "
The politicians who search for purity hail from districts that have been drawn for their advantage .
And so Congress remains ideologically polarized , while the public searches for the middle ground .
No wonder Congress has an abysmal 29 percent approval rating .
We need structural change , says Blumenauer , " where we allow people to really select their politicians rather than allowing politicians to select their voters . "
He suggests independent panels that would set up reasonably drawn -- as opposed to gerrymandered -- congressional districts .
Panels ?
Better be careful .
Someone could tweet that they 're dead on arrival .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger .
UPDATED :
The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Thursday passed a sweeping climate change bill co-authored by Chairman Barbara Boxer and Sen. John Kerry , D - Mass . , with none of the panel ’s seven Republicans participating in the 11 - 1 vote .
The legislation will not go directly to the Senate floor .
It will instead become a starting point for extensive negotiations among senators led by Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev . ) .
The committee approval ’s of a climate change bill was also designed to show other nations that the U.S. was serious about cutting carbon dioxide emissions .
Boxer told reporters that her panel ’s action will help the cause of drafting a global warming treaty in Copenhagen next month .
Republicans dismissed the action as “ theatrics , ” more symbol than substance leading up to the international meeting .
In the meantime in the Senate , the Boxer - Kerry bill is already being upstaged by a more moderate alternative being put together by Kerry , Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) and Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) .
Their plan would significantly expand nuclear power and domestic oil drilling .
Voting the Boxer - Kerry bill out of committee was widely viewed as a way to keep the process moving forward , rather than as a signal of what the final legislation in the Senate would look like .
Republicans on the environment committee , who opposed the bill , boycotted drafting sessions called by Boxer this week and were absent from the room Thursday .
Democratic Sen. Max Baucus of Montana , the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , was the sole Democrat to vote no .
He said he voted against the bill because it mandated a 20 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and did n’t adequately protect farmers .
The bill seeks to establish a cap - and - trade system to limit how much carbon dioxide can be emitted .
Polluters would then be forced to buy and sell the right to emit the greenhouse gas .
The bill would also create new incentives for clean - coal technology and for the expansion of nuclear power .
The Environmental Protection Agency would also be allowed to regulate carbon dioxide emissions using the Clean Air Act , if the legislation became law .
Baucus said he planned to propose an amendment on the Senate floor to reduce the emission - reduction target to 17 percent by 2020 , with a “ trigger ” to boost the cut to 20 percent if other nations agreed to cut their emissions .
The House bill passed in June set a 17 percent target by 2020 , while both bills would force emissions to fall by 80 percent by 2050 .
Still , Baucus said , he would work to see a “ meaningful , balanced ” climate bill passed by the Senate .
The committee ’s ranking Republican , Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma , briefly appeared at the committee meeting to denounce the bill .
He said Republicans on the committee were still opposed to a vote until a comprehensive economic impact analysis of the legislation was conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency .
Boxer and other committee Democrats said it was clear that Republicans were not going to participate in drafting sessions and that Democrats were forced to pass the bill .
Democrats on the committee were unable to approve any amendments because a committee rule requires two members of the minority party to participate in drafting sessions .
Boxer said she acted Thursday based on a Senate rule allowing a bill to be passed in committee by a simple majority .
Sen. Arlen Specter ( D - Penn . ) told reporters he did not think that the partisan passage of the bill would hurt the chances of passing the legislation on the Senate floor .
He stressed that the legislation will be revised by Reid before it is debated by the full Senate .
Inhofe disagreed and said in a statement that the vote by committee Democrats , which he called “ the nuclear option , ” would make it impossible to win Republican support in the full Senate .
Reid has set no timetable to take up the climate legislation , but observers expect no action until next year .
Five other Senate committees are also slated to write language for inclusion in the bill .
“ The only thing to be done was to vote it out of committee , but procedurally there are many more steps .
There ’s no doubt in my mind about the desirability of moving forward , ” Specter said .
“ In some respects , today ’s action is more the end of the beginning than the beginning of the end .
In short , today ’s action marks another step along the path , but there is much further to go , ” agreed Scott Segal , an attorney at Bracewell & Giuliani who represents energy and manufacturing interests , in a statement .
The legislation can be read here .

Trey Anastasio played at Carnegie Hall last night with the New York Philharmonic , and by all accounts I saw the show was incredible .
I really hope Trey brings this out on tour someday .
Here ’s the setlist :
Set 1 : First Tube , The Inlaw Josie Wales , Brian and Robert , Divided Sky , Water In the Sky , Pebbles and Marbles , Guyute Orchestral
Set 2 : Time Turns Elastic , Let Me Lie , You Enjoy Myself
Encore : If I Could
Here ’s the download :
Trey Anastasio with New York Philharmonic @ Carnegie Hall , 9/12/09 [ MediaFire ]
Here ’s the roundup :
From HeadCount : “ So what was it like outside ?
A raging nitrous scene .
It began well before the show and popped up again right after , continuing unabated for at least 45 minutes after the “ If I Could ” encore .
This was n’t the sort of back alley , slightly down - low nitrous scene we ’re used to .
It was completely out in the open , with hawkers walking around with 4 balloons in each , right on the corner of W 57th and 7th Ave . ”
From Hidden Track : “ The highlight of the show came near the end when Anastasio and the orchestra unveiled their version of You Enjoy Myself .
A lot of thought was put into each section of the song from Trey ’s post - tramps solo to the vocal jam to the way the trombones played the “ boy , man , god , s*** ” sequence .
The only s*** ty part of the experience was seeing multiple people pass out after ingesting nitrous outside of the iconic venue .
You can take the kidz out of the Phish lot , but you ca n’t take the Phish lot out of the kidz . ”
From the NY Times : “ The orchestra , conducted by Asher Fisch , played brilliantly throughout the evening , with the trombones dipping into deep reserves of raucousness for “ You Enjoy Myself . ”
The concert was liberally punctuated with whoops and cheers ; the final ovation for the orchestra before the encore — another Phish song , “ If I Could ” — was the loudest , wildest response I have ever heard for anything at Carnegie .
That so many of the players could remain stone - faced during the tumult is a phenomenon beyond my comprehension . ”
From Mr. Miner : “ Unreal . ”
Auditing the Fed
Congress is passing Rep. Ron Paul 's amendment that would allow the GAO to audit Fed monetary policy , with CNBC's Steve Liesman & Rick Santelli .
As the global economy lurches from plunge to rebound , key emerging markets are erecting defenses against future financial upheavals .
Brazil and Taiwan have imposed new controls on cross - border fund flows , while other Asian and Latin American countries are considering similar moves .
" Countries are worried about the capital that 's coming in , " says Simon Johnson , former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund .
Especially in Asia , emerging markets have rebounded from the global downturn more quickly than the United States , Europe or Japan .
Investors who sought safety in dollar - denominated assets one year ago now are rushing into countries such as South Korea or Brazil .
For those smaller economies , however , the huge investment flows can :
• Drive currency values to export - crushing heights .
• Inflate domestic stock and property market bubbles .
• Destabilize economies by leaving as quickly as they arrive .
" It 's almost like too much of a good thing , " says Win Thin , senior currency strategist at Brown Bros.
Harriman in New York .
Brazil last month imposed a 2 % tax on foreign capital inflows , then added a separate 1.5 % tax on American depositary receipts – foreign company shares that trade on U.S. markets – to discourage investors from switching their holdings in the domestic stock market to ADRs .
The Brazilian real is up 41 % against the dollar since March .
Taiwan earlier this month barred foreign investors from placing money in short - term time deposits , in a bid to prevent speculative " hot money " inflows .
Among other countries eyeing controls : Indonesia , Russia and Kazakhstan .
The IMF typically discourages countries from adopting such measures .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the fund 's managing director , earlier this month told reporters the Brazilian controls were unlikely to be effective .
Economists such as Harvard University 's Kenneth Rogoff say controls likely will succeed in the short term by at least slowing the pace of new investment and thus currency appreciation .
" It 's very smart what they 're doing , " he said of the Brazilians .
But investors find ways to minimize or evade controls , turning to offshore markets or derivatives .
" It 's not going to stop people investing .
It 's just a bit of friction , " says Jerome Booth , head of research for Ashmore Investment Management in London .
The shocking Guardian report into the surveillance operations run by the police National Public Order Intelligence Unit makes it clear that the right of free protest in Britain now hangs in the balance , and that the very expression of opinion and attendance at meetings is enough for an individual to be categorised as an enemy of society .
Anyone now who feels strongly about climate change or the Iraq and Afghanistan wars is now liable to be labelled a " domestic extremist " to be photographed and monitored and to be subject to automatic tracking by the number plate recognition system .
There are few stories that capture the parlous state of Britain 's democracy like this one , and I suggest none that portray the government 's institutionalised contempt for rights and its casual attitude to unfettered growth of police powers .
The outrage that will be expressed in the wake of the investigation by Paul Lewis , Rob Evans and Matthew Taylor , which is to run over the next two days , will mean nothing unless we manage to change attitudes across the board .
We now live in a society whose values and instincts have been so skewed by Labour 's corrosive rule that it is possible in one week to watch the leader of a fascist organisation promoting his cause on BBC TV – and the next to learn that legitimate protesters with mainstream views are regarded as " domestic extremists " and harried by the police using anti-terror laws when their cars pass through the field of automatic number plate recognition cameras .
We seem to have lost the ability to navigate these issues with anything resembling common sense , which no doubt suits the authorities .
They seem to desire more and more control over the individual and the expression of his or her political views .
What is so disturbing is that this blanket surveillance has grown without proper statutory basis , let alone supervision .
Laws that were designed for one thing – for instance , preventing terror and harassment – have been deployed by the police , who seem to have forgotten that it is their job to protect freedoms and rights , rather than to act as a force of repression .
The automatic number recognition camera system was built and installed without debate in parliament , without a minute of formal scrutiny and , as many of us predicted , we now find it has become a means of stalking innocent citizens .
But of course innocence is a concept that has been steadily eroded by the authorities in the last decade .
It is of vital significance that when Anton Setchell , national co-ordinator of domestic extremism operations for the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) , was asked for his reaction he said : " Everyone who has got a criminal record did not have one once . "
There you have it : everyone is a potential criminal – or domestic extremist – and so everyone becomes a legitimate target for police surveillance .
The remit becomes infinite and with the advances of technology also possible .
Police officers who should be patrolling housing estates and getting to the root of such things as Britain 's gang crisis are frivolously deployed making surveillance albums of protesters and stopping old men on their way to express their views at an anti-war demonstration .
This is not just about freedom and free expression , it is also about the lack of leadership in the police .
Rather than tackling the tough problems of law and order it seems police would prefer to intimidate and bully those who have a right to express their views , indeed a duty to do so in a properly functioning free society .
Well , you can see that it is a lot easier to shove a camera in someone 's face at a demonstration , or stop people on anti-terror laws , than to address complex threats to society – but how much damage is being done by this neglect ?
This is also a story of function creep and drift .
The policy to extend monitoring and surveillance in Britain to this suffocating degree has been developed behind closed doors by two bodies that consistently prove themselves to be the enemy of traditional rights , the Home Office and Acpo .
To all intents and purposes both operate secretly .
Because Acpo is a limited company it is not even subject to freedom of information requests .
The relationship between the two bodies and the way that policies are decided in committees that mirror each other should become the subject of intense scrutiny by parliament , which has so far shown itself to be utterly powerless in setting parameters for the surveillance of legitimate demonstration and protest .
I 'll say it again – unless public opinion moves on issues like this and politicians show some principled leadership , we will lose the qualities that define Britain as one of the world 's oldest free societies .
It would be a tragedy to allow this to happen simply through inattention .
LSD Research : An Overview
by Jessica Locke Del Greco
The purpose of this paper is to summarize the history of lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) research and to discuss the manner in which this research influenced the evolution of society .
Between the years 1947 and 1963 , CIA and Army scientists examined , tested , and in some cases refined every drug which subsequently became available on the black market during the 1960's , including marijuana , cocaine , heroin , PCP , amyl nitrate , mushrooms , DMT , barbituates , laughing gas , and speed , among others ( Lee and Shalin , xx ) .
In the course of this research , government scientists found , for example , that injections of cocaine produce free and spontaneous speech in catatonic schizophrenics within two days ( Lee & Shalin , 11 ) .
Information , such as this was virtually useless to the CIA and Army , however .
Therapy was not the goal of their investigations .
Mind control was .
The government hoped to develop a method that would allow them to create an exploitable alteration of personality in potential agents , defectors , refugees , POWs , and in an unidentified group of others ( Lee & Shalin , 10 ) .
Of the drugs that CIA and Army scientists tested , LSD - 25 seemed to have the highest potential for use in warfare and intelligence gathering .
The government studied and utilized LSD extensively from the early fifties until 1963 , when they stopped using it in favor of a stronger hallucinogen , BZ .
Around this time , psychologists who had been steadily building an impressive amount of data that supported the therapeutic efficacy of LSD , were forced to halt their research also .
Certain psychologists , such as Dr. Timothy Leary and Dr. Richard Alpert of Harvard University , refused to comply with the new LSD regulations .
They were dismissed from their posts and proceeded to educate the public about the spiritual and therapeutic effects of psychedelic drugs .
This paper will be arranged in the following manner .
First , I will describe the discovery of LSD .
Next , I will review the history of CIA and military LSD research .
Then , I will summarized the progression and repression of therapeutic LSD studies .
Finally , I will discuss the cultural impact of LSD .
In 1938 , Dr. Albert Hoffman , a Swiss chemist working for Sandoz Laboratories in Basel , was the first person to synthesize lysergic acid diethylamide .
He developed the drug accidentally during an attempt to isolate an analeptic compound in ergot , a rye fungus with many medicinal alkaloids .
LSD was the twenty fifth in a series of ergot derivatives he created while searching for the elusive circulatory stimulant .
He quickly lost interest in the drug when it failed to produce significant results in preliminary studies on laboratory animals .
( Lee & Shalin , xiv ) Hoffman did not rediscover LSD - 25 until April 16 , 1943 when he decided to conduct further studies on the compound .
In the process of synthesizing a new batch , Hoffman absorbed a small dose of LSD through his fingertips .
He described what happened next in a report he sent to one of his colleagues .
Last Friday , April 16 , 1943 , I was forced to interrupt my work at the laboratory in the middle of the afternoon and proceed home , being affected by a remarkable restlessness , combined with a slight dizziness .
At home I lay down and sank into a not unpleasant intoxicated - like condition , characterized by an extremely stimulated imagination .
In a dreamlike state , with eyes closed ( I found the daylight to be unpleasantly glaring ) , I perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures , extraordinary shapes with intense , kaleidoscopic play of colors .
After some two hours this condition fades away .
( Hoffman , 15 ) Three days after his accidental ingestion of LSD - 25 , Albert Hoffman began to research the compound in earnest .
On April 19 , 1943 he swallowed 250 micrograms .
In his book , LSDMy Problem Child , Hoffman discusses the implications of his second , more intense LSD experience .
First , to his knowledge , lysergic acid was the only known substance that could evoke such extreme psychic effects in such low doses .
Hoffman had not expected the 250 microgram dosage to inebriate him .
In fact , the possibility seemed so unlikely that Hoffman 's colleagues would not believe he had measured the dosage correctly until they had ingested similar amounts of the compound .
( Hoffman , 20 ) What seemed even more significant to Hoffman was that his memory of the experience was not in the slightest bit marred .
He was able to recall every aspect of the trip in minute detail .
Nor was Hoffman out of sorts the following morning .
Instead , he found himself in excellent physical and mental health , wondering how it was that a drug with the ability to produce such a powerful state of inebriation did not also produce a hangover .
( Hoffman , 20 ) Hoffman was optimistic about the implications of his discovery .
" I was aware that LSD , a new active compound with such properties , would have to be of use in pharmacology , in neurology , and especially in psychiatry , and that it would attract the interest of concerned specialists " ( Hoffman , 20 ) .
Hoffman was correct .
When LSD was introduced to the United States in 1949 , for example , it was well - received by the scientific community , and because of the unique properties of the drug it appealed to groups of scientists with very different goals .
Both the government , which was trying to develop mind - control techniques , and psychiatrists , who were attempting to develop more effective treatments for their patients , began testing the drug almost immediately .
Before LSD became illegal , it was tested on over 40,000 people by psychologists alone .
Since 1942 , government agents , then working for the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) , the CIA 's predecessor , had been making a concerted effort to locate a speech - inducing , personality - altering drug that could be used in interrogations .
Because LSD , which was originally brought into the U.S. by Dr. Max Rinkel , was so powerful in small doses as well as odorless and tasteless , government officials were certain that it could be useful to them , they simply had to determine how .
Perhaps as a result of their own military goals , they were concerned that LSD would be used by other nations against the citizens of the United States .
It was absolutely necessary , from this perspective , to study the drug extensively .
I must back track a little in order to fully convey the circumstances under which LSD was embraced by the CIA and the military .
When General William Donovan , chief of the OSS , assembled six prestigious scientists in the spring of 1942 to describe the covert research program that he wished for them to undertake , he was very clear about the government 's motivation for this operation .
He challenged the scientists to create a " substance that could break down the psychological defenses of enemy spies and POWs , thereby causing an uninhibited disclosure of classified information .
Such a drug would also be useful for screening OSS personnel in order to identify German sympathizers , double agents , and potential misfits " ( Lee & Shalin , 3 ) .
Donovan appointed Dr. Windfred Overhusler chairman of the research committee .
The group proceeded to test and reject various drugs including alcohol , barbituates , caffeine , peyote , and scopolamine , before marijuana was singled out as the substance that had the highest potential for inducing speech .
( Lee & Shalin , 3 - 4 ) The OSS proceeded to test marijuana on both witting on unwitting subjects , including themselves , their associates , U.S. military personnel , and American citizens .
They determined that the best method of administration was the injection of THC into a cigarette or cigar .
The effects of marijuana were described in the following OSS report .
( Marijuana ) appears to relax all inhibitions and to deaden the areas of the brain which govern an individual 's discretion and caution .
It accentuates the senses and makes manifest any strong characteristics of the individual .
Sexual inhibitions are lowered , and a sense of humor is accentuated to the point where any statement or situation can become extremely funny to the subject .
On the other hand , a person 's unpleasant characteristics may also be heightened .
It may be stated that , generally speaking , the reaction will be one of great loquacity and hilarity .
( Lee & Shalin , 4 ) Encouraged by these results , the OSS began to use marijuana on an operational basis until the drug proved to be too unreliable for their purposes .
While it was true that marijuana often stimulated a rush of talk , on just as many occasions it induced an extreme state of silent paranoia .
When the war ended , the OSS was replaced by the CIA , which was eager , along with the military , to continue the research that the OSS had begun in 1942 .
The Navy initiated Project CHATTER in 1947 , the same year that the CIA was formed .
The results of the first LSD tests were also published in 1947 by Dr. Werner Stoll , a close colleague of Dr. Albert Hoffman .
The purpose of Project CHATTER was to create a means for obtaining information from people without physical duress .
One of the drugs tested during Project CHATTER was mescaline , a derivative of peyote that induces hallucinations similar to those produced by LSD .
Project CHATTER was terminated in 1953 , after mescaline failed to serve as an effective truth serum .
( Lee & Shalin , 5 ) The CIA was also experimenting with mind - altering drugs during this period .
In 1951 , their scattered efforts were combined to form a single program called Bluebird .
Over time project Bluebird came to be called Artichoke , but the goal of the research did not change .
The CIA wished to " ' create an exploitable alteration of personality ' in selected individuals , specific targets included ' potential agents , defectors , refugees , POW's ' and a vague category of ' others ' " ( Lee & Shalin , 10 ) .
In 1951 , shortly after project Bluebird was launched , the CIA conducted an LSD pilot study to measure the effects of the compound on the subjects ' ability to suppress experimental or nonthreat secrets .
( Lee & Shalin , 13 ) Shortly after this experiment , CIA researchers designed a study to determine optimal dosage levels of LSD for interrogation .
This study included at least twelve subjects of below average intelligence .
The subjects were informed that a new drug was being tested on them and that it was not dangerous .
Even after the experiment , they were never given any further details .
The researchers concluded that 100 to 150 micrograms was an optimal dosage .
( Lee & Shalin , 14 ) After determining this dosage range , the CIA began to further investigate the potential of LSD to act as a truth serum .
They held a series of mock interrogation proceedings , and initially obtained promising results .
CIA scientists prepared a memorandum entitled " Potential New Agent for Unconventional Warfare . "
This document stated , among other things , that LSD was useful for " eliciting true and accurate statements from subjects under its influence during interrogation " ( Lee & Shalin , 14 ) .
The researchers also noted that LSD aided in the recovery of repressed memories .
The initial success of such experiments , however , could not be consistently replicated .
Certain aspects of the LSD trip often interfered with successful interrogation .
Unwitting subjects , for example , tended to become paranoid and silent as the effects of the drug set in .
Other subjects experienced delusions of grandeur , becoming convinced that they could defy the interrogators indefinitely .
Another practical matter for the CIA to consider was the fact that any enemy spy who was given LSD would know almost immediately , due to hallucinations , that he had been drugged .
Scientists were also disappointed that memories of the period of inebriation were not destroyed after the drug wore off .
Unlike the other substances that the government studied , LSD was not discarded when it failed to prove itself a reliable .
Instead the CIA and military expanded the scope of their testing , believing that such a powerful drug must have a practical application .
LSD was used on an operational basis as an aid to interrogation from the mid-1950 's until the early 1960's , but the CIA did not limit the employment of LSD to political targets .
In the early 1950's , the government became increasingly concerned that other nations , such as the USSR and China , where ergot flourished , would find a strategic use for LSD .
In light of this suspicion , the CIA project committee decided in November of 1953 that personnel in all components of the agency should be dosed with LSD to demonstrate to them the effects of the hallucinogenic drug so they would prepared if an enemy should attempt to use it against them .
Members of the agency who reacted anxiously to impromptu doses of LSD would be excluded from certain assignments .
A new program , MK - ULTRA , was formed in this year to include the more comprehensive scope of LSD research .
( Lee & Shalin , 17 ) At first the LSD tests within the CIA were executed systematically .
A typical experiment involved two agents secluding themselves in a room , ingesting the drug , and taking notes on their experiences .
This analytical approach did not last long , however .
CIA agents agreed that it was necessary for all personnel to undergo impromptu trips in order to properly prepare for the event of an enemy - administered dose of LSD .
They began to randomly spike each others drinks with lysergic acid .
No one in the agency was excluded from these impromptu trips , and their experiences ranged from mystical to disastrous .
One CIA agent stated after his surprise ingestion , " I did n't want to leave it .
I felt I would be going back to a place where I would n't be able to hold on to this kind of beauty . "
( Lee & Shalin , 30 ) Other , less fortunate agents reacted to LSD with extreme paranoid episodes .
In November of 1953 , the first LSD - related death occurred .
There is little doubt that the suicide of Dr. Frank Olson is the origin of the popular myth that people who take LSD are likely to jump from windows .
Olson was unwittingly dosed with LSD during a three - day work retreat for CIA and Army technicians in the backwoods of Maryland .
Olson , who had never ingested drugs before , was upset that he had been given LSD against his will .
He became very withdrawn and depressed under the influence of the powerful substance and remained so after its effects subsided .
When Olson returned home from the retreat he asked his boss to fire him , claiming that his behavior had ruined the LSD experiment that his colleagues had undertaken the preceding weekend .
Three weeks later , Olson jumped head first through a closed window , falling ten stories to the pavement below .
Details of the events leading up to Olson 's suicide remained confidential , primarily due to the fact that agents working under the MK - ULTRA program were preparing to launch into the next phase of LSD testing : the administration of LSD to unwitting American citizens in real - life settings and situations .
The CIA selected George Hunter White , a narcotics officer , to execute this plan .
White was chosen on the basis of his experience with marijuana .
He had organized the earlier experiments in which marijuana was tested on unwitting American citizens and was quite willing to conduct similar research with LSD .
White , funded by the CIA , rented an apartment in Greenwich Village and equipped it with two - way mirrors and surveillance cameras .
He proceeded to lure artists up to his new home and surreptitiously dose them with LSD .
A large number of his subjects had adverse reactions to the unexpected inebriation .
In 1955 , White was transferred to San Francisco , where he set - up two more of these " safe houses , " as the CIA called them .
At this time , Operation Midnight Climax was established .
The purpose of this project was to study how sexual desires could be exploited by CIA agents .
In exchange for $ 100.00 per night and a guarantee of legal immunity , drug - addicted prostitutes aided White and the CIA by picking up men from area bars and bringing them back to one of the safe houses .
White watched from behind the two - way mirror while the men were given drinks laced with LSD and seduced by the prostitutes .
The safe house experiments continued until 1963 , when the government abandoned its LSD research and began to experiment with BZ , a stronger hallucinogen .
( Lee & Shalin , 32 - 33 ) .
During this time the CIA and military also tested LSD on approximately 1500 soldiers , for example , measuring the effects of LSD on their ability to perform routine drills ( Lee & Shalin , 40 ) .
They also slipped LSD to certain world leaders , who were not identified specifically in CIA reports ( Lee & Shalin , 50 - 1 ) .
I was unable to locate any information about LSD research on government websites , but the following statement from the DEA site illustrates the dichotomy between the government 's private and public actions in relation to LSD almost as well as White himself did , arresting drug users by day and dosing American citizens by night .
According to the DEA , " America 's social upheaval in the early 1960 's dictated that a new , tougher approach to fighting drugs was warranted .
Accordingly , in 1966 a new federal enforcement unit , BDAC … was created . "
Currently the federal penalty for a first LSD transportation offense is 40 years to life in prison and a fine of two to five million dollars .
While the government was testing LSD 's military and espionage potential , a very different form of research was being carried out by psychologists in America , Canada , and various parts of Europe .
Psychologists , unaware that the CIA and military were attempting to develop a method to employ LSD as a weapon , were investigating the therapeutic potential of the new drug .
In 1999 , the most effective method ( though " effective " may be an exaggeration ) for treating alcoholics Alcoholics Anonymous .
The goal of AA and of every twelve step program is to help the client develop a sense of spirituality that will replace the use of alcohol and illicit drugs .
Typically this program requires years of hard work on the part of the subject and the therapist , but twelve - step spirituality does appear to successfully cure alcoholics and drug addicts who are thoroughly dedicated to the cause of sobriety .
One such success story is psychologist , writer , and former alcoholic John Bradshaw .
In his book , Healing the Shame That Binds
You , which was assigned reading for a counseling class I took at UNH in 1998 , Bradshaw describes the two years of agony that culminated in the completion one of the twelve steps that led him to sobriety .
Captain Al Hubbard , a former OSS spy , was acting in accordance with the theory that spirituality can induce sobriety when he began to administer LSD to hard - core alcoholics in the early 1950's .
His private experiments were so successful that he established LSD treatment centers at three major hospitals in Canada .
He also convinced other researchers , such as Dr. Humphrey Osmond , to exploit the spiritual aspects of the LSD trip .
Before Hubbard introduced Osmond to the spirituality theory of sobriety , Osmond had been using LSD to induce a nightmarish experience involving delirium tremors in his patients , believing that only those alcoholics who reached " rock - bottom " could recover .
Osmond became convinced that Hubbard 's method was preferable after he performed an experiment based on the new theory at Weyburn Hospital .
Osmond administered a single high dose of LSD to 1000 hard - core alcoholics .
Fifty percent of his subjects did not drink alcohol again .
( Lee and Shalin , 50 ) Osmond continued this research for thirteen years , finally concluding that " LSD therapy can turn a large number of alcoholics into sober members of society .
Even more importantly , this can be done very quickly and therefore very economically " ( Lee and Shalin , 50 ) .
In 1957 , Osmond introduced the word " psychedelic " to the scientific community and suggested that LSD be utilized in psychotherapy .
Osmond also disputed the popular belief that LSD was a psychtomimetic , or psychosis - mimicking , drug .
( Lee & Shalin , 55 ) This brought about a major shift in perspective for psychologists who had been using LSD inebriation to study psychosis .
Drugs such as thorazine , which is still used to treat schizophrenics in the U.S. , were developed as a result of research executed in accordance with the psychtomimetic model .
Two forms of LSD therapy arose in the 1950's with the weakening of the psychometric paradigm : the Psycholytic , or mind - loosening , approach and Psychedelic therapy .
Psycholytic therapy involved low to moderate doses of LSD in combination with traditional psychotherapy .
When it was employed in repeated sessions , LSD accelerated the process of self - exploration .
It reduced psychological defenses and aided in the recovery of repressed traumatic experiences .
This form of therapy was primarily used in England , where Dr. Ronald Standison established the first LSD clinic open to the public in 1953 , inspiring the formation of similar clinics in many European countries .
( Lee and Shalin , 56 ) .
Psychedelic therapy , was more popular in the U.S. and Canada ..
It involved the administration of high doses of LSD for the purpose of creating a mystical or conversion experience .
Therapists , unknowingly acting under the watchful eyes of CIA field officers , served as guides , helping their patient assimilate his or her experience in a manner that would maximize personal growth .
Therapists often ingested small amounts of the drug before therapy sessions so they could properly empathize with their patients .
Dr. Frank Ogden , who spent 9,000 hours working with 764 patients undergoing psychedelic therapy in British Columbia , recently sent an e-mail to a friend of mine who was kind enough to forward the message to me .
Ogden , whose research is contained in the medical text The Use of LSD in Psychotherapy and Alcoholism , included the original , un-edited report of his first psychedelic experience in this e-mail .
Ogden states in the conclusion of his report , " I believe LSD has a wonderful future to help us understand the human mind .
Both the mind that is sick as well as helping the mind that is well grow in perception …
For me it was 99 % wonderful . "
Psychedelic therapy was tested on a broad selection of diagnostic categories including , but not limited to , alcoholism , juvenile delinquency , narcotics addiction , and various character neurosis .
( Shalin , 57 ) Patients continually stated that only a few LSD sessions had been more useful to them than years of psychoanalysis .
Psychedelic therapy became a fad among politicians , writers , movie stars , and other members of the economic and intellectual elite during the 1950's , with actors such as Cary Grant publicly advocating the new treatment .
The first international conference on LSD therapy was held in 1959 .
At this meeting the dichotomy between the two major schools of thought inspired a major debate between those who still worked under the psychtomimetic model for the CIA and military and those who used LSD for therapeutic purposes .
The objectivist approach , represented by the government , would eventually dominate American opinion , governing FDA policy decisions and drug control laws through the present time .
Psychologists tested LSD on approximately 40,000 patients , developing a huge data base of information which supported the efficacy of LSD in the treatment of many disorders , addictions , and various dysfunctional behaviors , but , in the end , this research amounted to nothing more than salvation for a selected group of fortunate patients and a waste of time and effort for psychologists who were searching for techniques that could be used legally to help all people live more fulfilling lives .
Many LSD researchers blamed Dr. Timothy Leary , a behavioral psychologist at Harvard , for the swift progression of policies that lead to the drug 's illegal status .
It seems highly unlikely that one man could provoke such a crackdown , but then it again , it also seems improbable that a single person could ignite the dramatic cultural revolution of the 1960's , as Leary arguably did .
Timothy Leary 's undergraduate career began rather shakily .
He attended West Point briefly , eventually dropping out because the other students ostracized him .
He then enrolled at Alabama University , but was expelled for getting caught in one of the female dorms .
After this expulsion , Leary did a short stint in the service , finally enrolling at the University of CA at Berkley , where he went on to receive his doctorate in psychology .
By 1960 , when Leary had his first psychedelic experience , he had established himself as a prominent researcher in the field of psychology .
Between 1954 and 1959 , he served as the director of clinical research and psychology at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Oakland , California .
He published extensively in scientific journals .
One well - known study that Leary conducted at the Kaiser Foundation measured the progress of patients in psychotherapy against that of patients who were on a waiting list for therapy during a nine month period .
The psychological community was quite shocked by the results , which indicated that the improvement ratios of the two groups were virtually identical .
( Stevens , 20 ) .
Leary also wrote a widely acclaimed text book about the interpretation of psychological tests .
He developed a personality test himself called " The Leary , " which the CIA and other organizations used to test prospective employees .
( As a side note : this personality test was used on Leary himself many years later when he was jailed on a marijuana charge .
He , of course , found this highly amusing . )
These accomplishments eventually lead Leary to an appointment at Harvard , where , inspired by an article in Life magazine and a personal experience with psilocybin mushrooms , Leary established a psilocybin research project in 1960 with the approval of the department chairman .
Timothy Leary and his colleague Richard Alpert began by investigating the emotional and creative effects of psilocybin .
Emotion and creativity are difficult to quantify , however , and Leary and Alpert eventually turned to more practical forms of psilocybin research .
In his famous Concord prison study , Leary administered psilocybin to 32 inmates in a maximum security prison in Concord , Massachusetts .
He helped the prisoners assimilate their experiences in such a manner that only 25 % of his subjects ever returned to jail again .
Compare this to the typical recidivism rate of 80 % at that time and in 1999 .
Psilocybin appeared to reform criminals more effectively than any method that had ever been used or has been used since .
( Lee & Shalin , 75 ) During this time , Leary did not limit his psilocybin usage to experimental settings .
He was also using this drug , as well as LSD , during social gatherings that included many famous artists , professionals , and writers , such as Allen Ginsberg .
In fact , it was Ginsberg who originally shaped Leary 's belief that psychedelics could be used for mass social reform , insisting that the use of LSD should not be limited to the elite .
As early as December of 1960 , Ginsberg proclaimed to Leary , " We 're going to teach people to stop hating … Start a peace and love movement " ( Lee & Shalin , 76 ) .
The beat poet felt that Leary was ideally suited to head a psychedelic campaign designed to disseminate as much information as possible .
Leary embraced this task wholeheartedly , " believing that it was time ( after the shallow and nostalgic fifties ) for far - out visions , knowing that America had run out of philosophy , that a new empirical , tangible metaphysics was desperately needed ; knowing in our hearts that the old mechanical myths had died at Hiroshima , that the past was over , and that politics could not fill the spiritual vacuum … Politics , religion , economics , social structure , are based on shared states of consciousness .
The cause of social conflict is usually neurological .
The cure is biochemical " ( Lee & Shalin , 78 - 9 ) .
Leary , buoyed by this belief , convinced that the graceful evolution of the human species lay in the ability and freedom of each individual to intelligently manipulate his or her own nervous system and state of consciousness , proceeded to dedicate the remainder of his life to the cause .
( Leary , iv ) In 1962 , Timothy Leary published an article in the Journal of Atomic Sciences suggesting that the government prepare for a possible chemical attack from enemies .
He recommended that they put LSD in city water supplies for the purpose of introducing American citizens to the nature of psychedelic inebriation .
Government officials , who had already considered the possibility of water contamination by enemies and had subsequently determined that chlorine neutralized lysergic acid , denounced Leary .
In March of 1962 , Leary 's colleagues at Harvard confronted him during a faculty meeting , expressing their concern about the liberal manner in which he distributed psychedelics .
A published account of this meeting lead to an investigation by the FDA , which determined that Leary was no longer permitted to administer psychedelics unless a medical doctor was present .
By the end of that year Leary 's research projects were officially terminated .
Shortly after , Leary 's colleague , Richard Alpert , was fired for giving LSD to an undergraduate .
Three days later , Leary was also dismissed from the University on the grounds that he had failed to attend an honors program committee meeting .
The media frenzy that followed sparked the growth of the psychedelic underground .
( Lee & Shalin , 88 ) Until his death in 1996 , at age 75 Leary used various forms of media to educate the masses about the drug he thought of as the liberator of humankind .
He used pamphlets , books , music , television , films , lecture circuits , and the Internet .
All of Leary 's post - Harvard writings , whether philosophical , scientific , or sociological were carefully geared toward the intellect and interests of the average American , written in a language that anyone could understand .
For Example , Leary 's book Info - Psychology : a Manual on the Use of the Human Nervous System According to the Instructions of the Manufacturers , written in 1976 and originally called exo-psychology , describes DNA and Leary 's model of human behavior and evolution in terms of a tarot deck .
He , of course , took a great deal of flack from his former colleagues for employing such a ridiculous metaphor .
His response : " The illustrative metaphors are not important .
What is crucial to humanity 's graceful mutation is the understanding and personal application of Einsteinian , neuro - genetic , quantum - physical perspectives of who we are and whom we choose to become " ( Leary , X ) .
In the words of Jay Stevens , " The psychedelic experience might be as difficult to describe as the taste of ice - cream , but it had still attracted an enthusiastic and dangerous bunch of salesmen .
First and foremost was Dr. Timothy Leary … Whether the psychedelic movement would have happened without Timothy Leary is a matter of debate , but there can be no question that he defined its public style " ( Stevens , xv ) .
In 1962 , the same year that Alpert and Leary were expelled from Harvard University , Congress enacted a law that made it virtually impossible for any person or organization , with the exceptions of the CIA and military , to obtain LSD for research purposes .
In 1965 , Congress passed the Drug Abuse Control Amendments under which the illicit manufacture and sale of LSD became a misdemeanor .
In 1966 , Senator Robert Kennedy , whose wife had successfully undergone LSD therapy , lead a congressional probe into the organization and coordination of federal drug research and regulatory programs .
After this probe , Kennedy concluded that regulatory agencies were thwarting potentially valuable research .
The FDA ignored Kennedy 's pleas for them to review the scientific reports pertaining to LSD .
This data included approximately 1,000 clinical papers relating to 40,000 patients .
Favorable results were reported when LSD was used to treat severely resistant psychiatric conditions , such as frigidity and other sexual aberrations .
A dramatic decrease in autistic symptoms was observed in severely withdrawn children following the administration of LSD .
The drug was also found to ease the physical and psychological distress of terminal cancer patients …
And chronic alcoholics continued to benefit from psychedelic therapy …
The rate of recovery or significant improvement was often higher than with traditional methods .
Furthermore , its risks were slim compared to the dangers of other commonly used and officially sanctioned procedures such as electroshock , lobotomy , and the so - called anti-psychotic drugs .
( Lee & Shalin , 89 ) In 1968 , the sale of LSD became a felony .
In 1970 , " psychedelics were placed in the Schedule I category - a classification reserved for drugs of abuse that have no medical value " ( Lee & Shalin , 93 ) By this time , the CIA had created a backlog of more than twenty - six thousand new compounds to be screened for offensive use .
I will conclude this paper by briefly stating my opinions about LSD research .
I think that the CIA and military were quite justified in studying this drug , however I feel that their methods were often sloppy and unethical and I do not personally sympathize with their goal .
I was quite amazed to learn of the therapeutic efficacy of LSD and I think it is unfortunate that the current political climate would most likely not allow for the reconsideration of this psychiatric data .
Finally , I think that it is impossible to place a moral value judgment on LSD .
People who think it is a destructive drug have a large amount of evidence to support this claim .
People who think it can be used constructively do also .

Novell announced today the official release of openSUSE 11.2 , the latest version of the company 's open source Linux distribution .
The new version , which has been under development for almost a year , brings updated software a handful of noteworthy improvements .
openSUSE is one of the most popular Linux distributions .
Although it does n't match some of our other favorites in the area of usability , it offers a high level of refinement and plenty of flexibility for power users .
Version 11.2 will strengthen the distro's long - standing reputation for delivering an unbeatable KDE experience .
Its GNOME environment is strong too , and has a great selection of default applications .
The distribution is offered in several formats .
You can get a full DVD image with a multitude of packages , or you can get a Live CD image for GNOME or KDE .
I performed an installation with KDE from the DVD and also tested the GNOME Live CD .
Live CD installer
DVD installer
One of the changes in 11.2 is that KDE is now the default desktop environment in the DVD installer .
The installer previously had no default and required the user to select which desktop environment they wanted to use during the installation process .
Users can still select GNOME , but the KDE option is enabled by default .
Users and developers felt that requiring a manual decision was detrimental to usability .
They wanted to avoid confronting new users with a seemingly arbitrary and intimidating choice .
KDE was selected as the default on the basis of a poll which showed a strong preference for that desktop environment among openSUSE users .
The outcome is unsurprising because SUSE has a long history of being a KDE - centric distribution prior to being acquired by Novell .
You can learn more about openSUSE 's desktop preference saga by perusing our previous coverage of the issue .
The KDE variant of openSUSE 11.2 comes with KDE 4.3 , which was released in August .
Although KDE 4 had a rough start , it 's maturing nicely .
The latest version feels great and addresses a number of weaknesses that afflicted its predecessor .
Plasma got support for keyboard shortcuts and a number of other much - needed conveniences .
The openSUSE developers have finally adopted Firefox as the default browser for KDE in 11.2 , displacing Konqueror .
Clicking links in KDE applications will now consistently cause the URL to be loaded in Firefox .
They have done a great job of integrating Firefox with the desktop and making it a first - class KDE citizen .
Firefox 's built - in RSS handler , for example , can be used to add feeds to Akregator .
The browser itself still uses GTK + theming APIs to render its widgets , but it does use KDE file dialogs and similar accoutrements of desktop integration .
The developers chose to focus on Firefox integration because Konqueror simply does n't work properly on a number of commonly - used websites .
The GNOME environment in openSUSE 11.2 is pretty slick .
I 've always been impressed with the high quality of openSUSE 's GNOME theming , but it 's even better than usual in this release .
The new Sonar theme looks great and reflects the large amount of effort and professionalism that go into crafting openSUSE 's distinctive look and feel .
The only aesthetic weak area is the font rendering , which does n't look as good out of the box as some other distros .
I suspect that the issue relates to autohinting .
As usual , the openSUSE GNOME installation gives you great applications like Beagle and Banshee integrated tightly with the desktop right out of the box .
The developers decided to stick with Pidgin instead of adopting GNOME 's Empathy chat client .
Empathy still has a lot of rough areas and is missing a number of significant features such as text formatting .
We 'll be looking at the problems with Empathy in great depth in an upcoming article .
I ran into a few minor issues during my tests , but no serious bugs .
Like 11.1 , the new version offers a pretty weak Compiz experience .
I was never able to get Compiz working reliably with my Nvidia TwinView setup in 11.1 .
The same problem has unfortunately persisted in 11.2 .
What makes it especially puzzling is that Compiz works practically out of the box with Ubuntu on the same hardware and the same dual - monitor configuration .
In general , openSUSE lacks Ubuntu 's it - just - works factor in many cases , but makes up for it by providing more flexibility under the hood and better packaging for certain kinds of development technologies , particularly Java and Mono .
After conducting hands - on testing with openSUSE 11.2 , my opinion of the distro has gone up another notch .
It 's a minor incremental improvement , but it 's good progress in the right direction .
The distro has a lot to offer and could be the best if the developers can smooth out some of the pain points and make it play nicer out of the box .

I woke up today with the headline of yet another politically related brutal and senseless killings of innocent civilians in my home country , Philippines , particularly in Maguindanao . " Philippine politician charged for murder " is the most popular news at Yahoo 7 ( Australia ) News beating the headline on politics regarding Opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull over the Emmision Trading Scheme that is jeopardizing his leadership .
A witness claims to have seen Mayor Andal Ampatuan Jr ordering killings and personally firing at convoy of journalists and political rivals .
" He was the one who gave the instructions .
He was among those ... who killed the victims , " Justice Secretary Agnes Devanadera told reporters as she outlined the case against Ampatuan Jnr .
How would you react if you read these accounts ?
According to Devanadera " Even the private parts of the women were shot at .
It was horrible .
It was not done to just one .
It was done practically to all the women .
All the women had their zippers undone .
The pants of some were pulled down ...
We have yet to determine whether they were raped .
But it is certain that something bad was done to them . "
What a gruesome picture .
Watching Isang Bandila , a 30 - minute TV Filipino News program at SBS yesterday afternoon , I saw Ampatuan shouting and putting the blame on one of the Muslim groups , the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( MILF ) , who are responsible for kidnap - for - ransom of many foreigners in southern Philippines .
The news this morning says that the MILF denied the killings .
These brutal killings are certainly the acts of the devil that continue to feast on the lives of people seeking power , popularity , and political dynasty .
The devil comes to steal , kill and destroy ( John 10:10 ) as the Bible says .
Mind you , politics in the Philippines is just heating up .
It is six months to go before the national elections .
Demon possessed politicians are now mobilizing their goons , guns and gold ( money ) ready to unleash the sting of murderous intent causing death and suffering .
Is there hope for the Filipinos ?
Absolutely Yes !
" If my people , who are called by my name , will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways , then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land . "
( 2 Chronicles 7:14 ) May
God comfort the grieving families of the victims of this massacre and embrace them with His loving arms .
May Justice be served and all the perpetrators be penalized .
God bless the Philippines !

About these cereal boxes
( Natural News )
Have you heard the news ?
Froot Loops are a " Smart Choice " for children 's health ( even though they 're made with 40 % sugar ) , and Cocoa Krispies can boost your immunity !
( https://www.naturalnews.com/027386_Kelloggs_f...
But there 's more to this story .
NaturalNews contacted employees of Kellogg's , General Mills and Post to find out what future cereal health claims they might be floating .
And guess what ?
They sent us actual box mockups that depict the new , upcoming health claims you 'll soon be seeing on grocery store shelves !
( Not really ... this article is a parody , but I figured you already knew that ... )
Froot Loops now cures cancer !
It must be all the different colors .
They always say eat a variety of different colors of food to stay healthy , and Froot Loops provides them all !
Cap'n Crunch now gives you washboard abs .
Get it ?
Crunches ... Cheerios solves chronic stress !
( It also helps with sleep disorders by boring you to sleep ... )
Frosted Flakes for breakfast : Rise and shine !
It 's more about the bunches than the honey , believe me ... Guys will buy anything if it will snare some babes ... There 's almost no honey in Honey Smacks , by the way .
The first 3 ingredients are sugar , wheat and corn syrup ...
Hurry , somebody tell Congress !
I could n't help creating these after reading about the Cocoa Krispies " immunity " claim .
I wondered :
What sort of claims would cereal companies try next ?
From there , it just morphed into a bizarre parody of all our favorite childhood cereals .
Feel free to share this article ( and the pictures ) , and please credit Natural News with a link to this article .
Thank you !
I do n't know about you , but I grew up eating all this crap , which might be one of the reasons why I was nearly diabetic by age 30 .
But after ditching processed sugar , sodas , cow 's milk and most factory foods , I was able to reverse that condition and stay healthy to this day .
( Drinking lots of raw vegetable and fruit juices also made a huge difference . )
Frankly , I 'm surprised that I even survived my childhood , considering all the sugary cereals and MSG - laced snack chips I ate on a regular basis .
Luckily , though , I lived to tell this story -- and I hope your kids do , too .
For God 's sake do n't let your kids eat sugary breakfast cereals .
Feed 'em Kashi or granola , and watch the sugar content in those , too .
Better yet , give them some fresh fruit juice ( raw , living juice ) with some home - made whole - grain bread or something .
They may resist it at first , but twenty years later , they 'll thank you for it .
Plus , you wo n't have to pay their hospital bills for diabetes treatments .
By the way , the images in this story are pure parody .
Cereal makers are n't actually planning on making these ridiculous claims ...... or are they ?
Sega announced earlier today that a demo for the upcoming action game Bayonetta will be available for download on Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network on December 3rd .
It was also announced that the game was the eleventh game to ever receive a 10/10 score from gaming magazine Edge and the twelfth game since 1986 to receive a perfect 40/40 score from Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu .
The game was released on October 29th in Japan , and will be released in the United States on January 5th 2010 for Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 .

( Adds details , more use of renewables )
WASHINGTON , Dec 14 ( Reuters ) - U.S. energy consumption is expected to increase 14 percent by 2035 , but the nation will rely less on oil and other fossil fuels to meet its energy needs , the Energy Information Administration said on Monday in its long - term forecast .
The fossil fuel share of U.S. energy demand over the next quarter century is expected to fall from the current 84 percent to 78 percent , the EIA said .
Oil use is forecast to remain “ near ” its current level , while ethanol is expected to account for 17 percent of gasoline consumption by 2035 , the agency said .
U.S. crude oil production is expected to rise from about 5 million barrels per day to more than 6 million bpd by 2027 , due to additional offshore output and enhanced onshore oil recovery techniques , and remain at that level through 2035 .
The price of crude oil is forecast to rise to about $ 133 a barrel , in 2008 dollars , by 2035 .
The United States will rely more on solar , wind and other renewable energy sources to meet its energy needs , the EIA said .
“ Our projections show that existing policies that stress energy efficiency and alternative fuels , together with higher energy prices , curb energy consumption growth and shift the energy mix toward renewable fuels , ” EIA Administrator Richard Newell said .
The EIA noted its forecast assumed no change in current climate change policies and regulations .
However , the United States is expected to eventually adopt policies that would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions , which should increase U.S. demand for alternative energy sources even more .

Hello !
Sorry for the lack of updates recently .
Yesterday was the last day of the Blender Conference and we ’re all still recovering !
But we have n’t forgotten about you .
We have a number of posts coming up to go over some of the stuff we showed off at the Durian talk on Sunday .
But first things first .
For those of you who missed the live stream , we revealed a lot about the movie–including the ( working ) title !
BAM !
Congrats to “ D ” for guessing the title right .
You deserve a prize !
Perhaps a free DVD ?
And we also revealed the final character design for our main character– whose name , coincidentally , is Sintel as well !
BAM !
Done by the amazing David Revoy of course .
Here ’s the video I slapped together to kick off the talk : Blender Conference Intro Video from Project Durian on Vimeo .
And here ’s a quick video to introduce the work we ’ve done on the first minute of the film !
It ’s rough , but hopefully gives you a glimpse of some of the stuff we ’ve been doing .
All of this material has already been cut– but we feel this has been an excellent exercise .

As one clinic worker tells Nerve : " We 're seeing people who might not otherwise do this but for their economic condition . "

First off , only a small percentage of women qualify for the really big bucks of myth ; to qualify at all a woman must be between 21 and 30 , not have traveled ( mad cow ) , and be healthy .
Genetic disorders , depression , a family history of cancer or diabetes , and even piercings and tattoos can all be deal - breakers .
And of that population ( whose family members have , apparently , never visited a doctor ) , only those with excellent SATs are double - digit desirable .
Then , it 's a time commitment : the competitive application process is involved and prolonged , and the actual donation requires a number of appointments over several months .
And then there are the health risks .
As Nerve describes it ,
The most hazardous side effect , Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome ( OHSS ) , is a complication occasionally seen in women who take certain fertility medicines that stimulate egg production .
The symptoms of OHSS can include bloating , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , excessive weight gain , shortness of breath , and sometimes kidney or liver failure .
In addition , during the procedure , the patient is in immediate danger , as a careless doctor can puncture the donor 's bowel , bladder , or blood vessels .
And while the long - term physical effects of egg donation have not been well studied ( the practice has only existed for about twenty - five years ) , some evidence suggests an increased risk of ovarian cancer and early menopause .
Women can only produce so many eggs in their lifetime .

Which is not to say that no one should do it - many women apparently talk about the altruism of the gesture and the satisfaction of helping increasing numbers of applicants have a family , to say nothing off paying off debts - simply that porn and a cup , this is n't .
For a long time doctors have worried that the sky - high potential payments have made donors cavalier about the risks of the procedure .
Indeed , this is the rationale behind Great Britain 's policy of setting a £ 250 cap ( incidental costs and earnings lost ) on such payments .
However , the increasing demand - and the open - secret practice of couples going abroad for eggs - is causing the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority , a watchdog , to review their policy .
( None of it an issue for those of us with diabetes genes or bad math scores , of course - our eggs , like Veruca Salt , do n't make the cut . )

Editor 's note :
The original online version of this story was previously posted .
Magnets are remarkable exemplars of fairness — every north pole is invariably accompanied by a counterbalancing south pole .
Split a magnet in two , and the result is a pair of magnets , each with its own north and south .
For decades researchers have sought the exception — namely , the monopole , magnetism ’s answer to the electron , which carries electric charge .
It would be a free - floating carrier of either magnetic north or magnetic south — a yin unbound from its yang .
Two research groups — one led by Tom Fennell of the Laue - Langevin Institute in Grenoble , France , and the other by Jonathan Morris of the Helmholtz Center Berlin for Materials and Energy — have offered experimental evidence that such monopoles do in fact exist , albeit not as electronlike elementary particles .
Rather they exist as unbound components inside so - called spin ices .
These man -made materials take their name from their similarity to water ice in terms of their magnetic nature .
The French - led team experimented with holmium titanate and the Germany - based group , dysprosium titanate .
Claudio Castelnovo , a physicist at the University of Oxford on the Morris team , explains that the compounds offer a peculiar combination of order and freedom that facilitates the dissociation of the poles .
Internally , the tiny magnetic components in spin ices arrange themselves head to tail in strings , like chains of bar magnets stretching across a table in different directions .
In a very cold , clean sample , those strings form closed loops .
But then the physicists gave a little kick to the system by increasing the temperature .
The rise excited the com­ponents and introduced defects in these chains , Castelnovo explains — in the bar - magnet analogue , one of the mag­ - nets is flipped , breaking the head - to - tail continuity .
On either side of that defect , then , are two norths at one end and two souths at the other .
Those concentrations of charge can float free along the string , acting as — voilà — magnetic monopoles , which the teams conclude they saw based on the way neutrons scattered off the spin ices .
“ The beauty of spin ice is that the remaining degree of disorder in this low - tem­perature phase makes these two points independent of each other , apart from the fact that they attract each other from a magnetic point of view because one is a north and one is a south , ” Castelnovo points out .
“ But they are otherwise free to move around . ”
Of course , this method of synthesizing monopoles cannot bring a north into existence without also generating a south — the key is their dissociation .
“ They always have to come in pairs , ” Castelnovo says , “ but they do n’t have to be anywhere specifically in relation to each other . ”
But Kimball Milton , a University of Oklahoma physicist who reviewed the status of monopole searches in 2006 , is not convinced .
A genuine magnetic monopole “ implies to me it ’s a point particle , and it ’s not ” in the studies , Milton says .
“ It ’s an effective excitation that at some level looks like a monopole , but it ’s not really fundamentally a monopole . ”
He also asserts that it is “ completely wrong ” to describe , as the researchers do , the chain of magnetism within spin ices as a Dirac string , a hypothetical invisible tether with a monopole at its end that was envisioned in the 1930s by English physicist Paul Dirac .
The magnetic strings in the spin ice do not fit the Dirac definition , Kimball feels , because they are , in fact , observable and merely carry flux between two opposing so - called monopoles .
“ Real monopoles , if they existed , would be isolated , and the string would run off to infinity , ” he insists .
“ I ’m not trying to put down the experiment or the work in any way , ” says Milton , noting that the findings are important in condensed - matter physics .
But “ they ’re not important from a fundamental point of view . ”

the macabre allure of doomsday
People hate dying in a cataclysm .
But they also like the idea of living at the end of history as they know it .
Illustration by Tobias Roetsch
Maybe it ’s just me , but does it seem like a whole lot of people seem to have a death wish of some sort ?
Over the last several thousand years , they ’ve been waiting for the world to end in horrible ways and every time that we happen to survive , they just edge the date of doomsday forward whether it ’s the good , old apocalypse of the Book of Revelations , a panicked conspiracy theory about bio -weapons or a one world government , or in today ’s popular New Age doctrines , the 2012 doomsday prophecy .
Why they want the world to end is beyond me since last I checked , being alive is usually not a bad thing .
But regardless of the facts , the klaxons of our doomsday scenarios have infested the web and pop culture with tales of terror and woe about to befall us .
Now here ’s the funny thing about the rumors of our imminent demise .
Whatever plague you pick , chances are that we ’ve already dealt with it and came out very much alive .
Horrible diseases that have the potential to wipe out the human population ?
How about the Black Plague and the Spanish Flu ?
Both were devastating , one to humans in Dark Age and Medieval societies for over a millennium and the other caused a pretty comparable number of deaths in an age with sanitation , quarantines and a solid grasp of germ theory .
And yet , we and the rest of the world are still here .
Volcanic nightmares ?
How about the Toba event some 73,000 years ago which is thought to have reduced human populations to a mere 10,000 individuals ?
That was pretty scary and we ’ve been able to survive with nothing more than our brains and stone tools .
And this is not to mention all the huge natural disasters and Ice Ages we ’ve had to live with .
When we take into account the fact that we ’ve been putting up with some of the worst nature can dish out over very long periods of time and not just surviving but thriving , all those doomsday prophecies seem to be a lot less impressive .
Even less impressive is the long history of doomsayers constantly setting dates for the end of the world or the human species , their predicted doomsday never coming true and another date set with the same exact underwhelming result .
So after unsuccessfully predicting our demise for century after century , do we really think there ’s anything more to this prophecy thing than random guessing ?
From reading holy texts or occult manuals , to harebrained algorithms and computer numerology that assigns arbitrary statistical values to internet activity , it ’s all just reading the tea leaves in the grand scale of things .
Whoever tries to pick patterns out of the noise might end up with little more than slightly refined noise which yields absolutely nothing of real substance .
And the same principle applies to the 2012 craze .
First off , it ’s based on the end of the Mayan calendar which , according to the Mayans themselves , just means that someone has to start another set of calendar cycles .
Basically , 2012 marks an anniversary of creation according to Mayan mythology and temple ruins have inscriptions with mention of the year 4772 according to the Georgian calendar we use today .
Pardon the obvious question but why would Mayans be making plans for a few millennia after the end of the world ?
It ’s sort of like making dinner plans after being warned that you ’ll get hit by a runaway truck on the highway on your way to work that morning .
And let ’s not forget that all the terrifying predictions about magnetic pole reversals , celestial alignments or tectonic and volcanic activity , simply take a set of natural cycles and paint them as something bizarre and sinister .
We ’ll always have quakes , volcanism , and our planet will always be aligned with something .
There ’s nothing dangerous or spectacular about that in the very least .
And as for rampaging brown dwarfs in our solar system ?
I seriously suggest a middle school astronomy class to those who seriously advocate this notion for the reasons outlined in the link .
To be fair , there is one threat that 2012 doomsayers may be right about and that ’s massive solar flares hitting the Earth .
Still , we should note that massive solar flares wo n’t necessarily happen in 2012 , nor are they strictly a phenomenon related to any calendar or prophecy .
They ’re a constant menace from the Sun and without any serious measures to minimize the damage they could cause , we could be looking at a world without modern power grids or communication .
A truly monstrous solar flare would overwhelm our magnetosphere and cut off radio signals while it fries the sprawling systems of power lines that fuel the industrial world .
The result ?
No internet , no power , no heat , no air conditioning , no cell phones and vast swaths of damaged infrastructure to rebuild over a span of several years .
And just because it wo n’t happen in 2012 , does n’t mean that we ’re in the clear .
A huge flare could hit the Earth with only a few days warning in 2025 or 2030 .
It ’s just one of the dangers nature could throw at us and for which we can prepare by recognizing the danger , doing more solar research , and acting to reduce the potential damage a flare could do .
An art collector has found a tooth , thumb and finger of the renowned Italian scientist Galileo Galilei who died in the 17th century , Florence 's History of Science museum said .
The body parts , along with another finger and a vertebra , were cut from Galileo 's corpse by scientists and historians during a burial ceremony held 95 years after his death in 1642 .
Giovanni Targioni Tozzetti , a science historian who cut away the parts and wrote about the ceremony , " confessed he had found it hard to resist the temptation to take away the skull which had housed such extraordinary genius , " the museum said .
The newly - found relics had passed from one collector to another until they went missing in 1905 .
The remaining finger and the vertebrae have been conserved since 1737 in a mummified state in museums in Florence and Padua .
" All the organic material extracted from the corpse has therefore now been identified and is conserved in responsible hands , " the museum said in a statement .
" On the basis of considerable historical documentation , there are no doubts about the authenticity of the items . "
They will be exhibited from early 2010 , when the museum will re-open after current renovation work and will change its name to the Galileo museum .
Galileo , born in Pisa in 1564 , is considered one of the fathers of modern science due to his studies in physics , mathematics and particularly astronomy , where he led great advances in developing the telescope .
His lost fingers and tooth were bought by an unnamed collector at a recent auction , where they were being sold as unidentified artifacts contained in an 17th century wooden case , the museum said .
For 95 years after his death , ecclesiastical authorities refused to allow Galileo to be buried in consecrated ground because his findings were considered contrary to the teachings of the Catholic church .
His body now lies in Florence 's Santa Croce church , opposite the tomb of Michelangelo .

Interviews with homeless families in New York City
“ There is no safe haven from the crisis ”
By Sandy English and Ali Ismali
21 November 2009
World Socialist Web Site reporters went to the Prevention Assistance and Temporary Housing ( PATH ) office , run by the city ’s Department of Homeless Services ( DHS ) .
The office is located in a depressed neighborhood in the Bronx .
The brick and concrete building itself , surrounded by a high fence , was anything but hospitable .
Uniformed , armed officers were the only visible people to greet clients .
The entrance to the building had two baggage inspection machines .
Residents later told us that the authorities routinely confiscate cameras and cellular phones with cameras in them .
There were several families entering and exiting PATH when we arrived , and others just outside the premises feeding young children .
Many of the people there were recently homeless , and most were poorly informed about procedures and requirements for obtaining emergency shelter .
Jeannell
Jeannell , a young mother with her child , said , “ I was working at a fast food restaurant .
I got laid off Friday .
Some people there were only one day a week , that ’s at $ 7.25 an hour .
My friend got a paycheck at $ 32 .
It ’s horrible .
I was living with my aunt but the conditions of her lease would n’t allow us to stay with her , and the landlord said we had to leave .
“ This stuff going on here , ” she said , indicating the PATH office , “ is horrible .
They give you turkey and cheese to eat but you ca n’t bring in your own food .
My child is on a special diet so I have to sit outside and feed her .
“ They say they want to help people , but I got rejected for services here because I did n’t have the proper documents .
I asked them what I needed , and they said that it was n’t their job to tell me what documents I have to bring .
I had to take my child to a hotel and then bring her back again the next day .
I found out that I needed a letter telling them that I could n’t stay with my aunt because of the lease .
And then they take hours to make a call to check things out . ”
We also spoke to Charmaine , who said , “ It took me 13 hours to get registered , and I did n’t get into a room .
It ’s so terrible because if you do n’t have an eviction notice or can’t prove you ’re a victim of domestic violence , there ’s nothing [ the intake officers ] will do .
“ I fled here because I ca n’t stay in the system [ at home ] where everybody knows everybody .
I did n’t get a room .
They just made me come back to a file domestic violence complaint .
I had to get up at 5:00 AM to get here on time from where I ’m staying .
“ This needs to change .
I ’ve been looking for a job since I got here , but with the amount of time I spend just trying to get housing , I ’m not getting back in time to do much .
I worked all my life paid my taxes .
Why ca n’t you get a place to stay if you need it , if you are a citizen of the United States ?
What is the problem ? ”
Another homeless mother , Ashlyn , said she was losing $ 120 by missing a day ’s work from her job as a cashier .
She and her husband and child had to leave the temporary residence they were living in because the owner was taking drugs and became abusive .
“ It was a domestic violence issue , ” she said .
“ But the people here say I can go back .
“ I think it ’s terrible what they ’re doing here .
We stayed in a shelter for a little while and they give you small quantities of food .
One day they gave us two slices of pizza for three people .
They treat you like a bug that needs to be squashed .
My father won a Purple Heart in Vietnam for saving someone ’s life .
I was accepted at four - year university , and the people here told me that I ’d lose my benefits if I attended .
They ’ll only allow you to attend a two - year community college .
I feel that I should have been allowed to attend . ”
Rubin
We spoke to a young worker , Rubin , who had come to find housing with his wife and infant .
“ It ’s humiliating , ” he said .
“ The city kicked us out on the street .
We ca n’t go back to the projects .
We can not afford to rent or stay anywhere else .
I had to spend $ 600 on a hotel .
The only way you can come back into the system once you ’ve been refused is to have the police escort you . ”
As Rubin was speaking , a police cruiser pulled up with a family that was seeking services in the system .
“ You see , ” said Rubin .
“ This is what ’s happening .
Just like that .
I had to call the police to get a one - night pass for my family .
“ You ’re entitled to go to Brooklyn for a hearing if they refuse you a room .
But that takes 60 days .
I have been denied services four times .
After you spend a night here and you get refused service , they give you 48 hours to get your things .
Then they throw them away . ”
Rubin said that he had lost his job because of all the time he had spent trying to get his family a place to stay .
“ Any day of the week , I bet you ’ll meet 50 people here who lost their jobs because of the time they spend trying to get into the system . ”
Rubin pointed to a young mother feeding her child in a stroller .
“ Look at where they eat .
This is because we ’re not allowed to bring food into the center . ”
Commenting on the scale of the economic crisis , he said , “ There are people here from Michigan .
There is no safe haven from the crisis . ”
He complained about security guards , who seem to get a kick out of throwing denied families out of the office .
“ The security guards laugh at us while we ’re getting thrown out , ” he said .
Calling all angry wage slaves and anarchist subversives !
You ’re invited to participate in promoting an international day of action , STEAL SOMETHING FROM WORK DAY , scheduled for April 15 , 2010 .
Following in the footsteps of Steal Something Day , itself a response to Buy Nothing Day , STEAL SOMETHING FROM WORK DAY focuses attention on the motivations behind employee theft and the horizons ahead of it .
STEAL SOMETHING FROM WORK DAY is a day of action , but it ’s much more than that .
The point is not so much to urge people to steal from their workplaces — employees of all ideological stripes already steal from their bosses without need of encouragement — as to raise awareness and promote dialogue about the means and causes of workplace theft .
Imagine stickers and posters everywhere rendering the individualized action of workplace theft a topic of collective discussion .
Imagine joking references to satirical websites spawning conversations about how coworkers can steal more and better together , and why they are entitled to .
Imagine STEAL SOMETHING FROM WORK DAY .
This is an opportunity for anarchists to use the networks developed for mass mobilizations and summit protests to ignite class war on the terrain of daily life , where it matters most .
Through humor and honesty , we can bring the contradictions present in practically everyone ’s lives to the fore , forcing the issues our rulers and managers would rather brush under the rug .
One website is already up , and more are on the way , along with videos , stickers , pins , posters , and more .
For now , check these out :

Mauricio Fernandez could n’t have been happier .
Here he was , being sworn in again as mayor of one of northern Mexico ’s most exclusive communities , and he had wonderful news to share : “ Black Saldana , who apparently is the one who was asking for my head , was found dead today in Mexico City , ” he told his cheering supporters Saturday in San Pedro Garza Garcia , near Monterrey .
ADVERTISEMENT
The problem was that the barefoot , blindfolded corpse of “ Black Saldana ” — whose real first name is Hector — was n’t found for another 3 1/2 hours , according to Mexico City prosecutors .
And he would n’t be identified for two days .
Now this cartel - plagued nation , usually nonchalant about a spate of kidnappings , extortion and executions , is engrossed with this not - so - straighforward murder that links drug lords and politicians .
The mayor is facing tough questions about the killings :
How did he know his nemesis was dead before the authorities apparently did ?
Does he have associations with the cartel that may have killed the men ?
And what exactly did he mean when he said , during his acceptance speech , that he knew Saldana and his associates wanted to hurt him , and that “ by fair means or foul , we are not going to accept any kind of kidnapping … and if not , they will pay for it . ”
The mayor ’s initial answer , repeated in a series of interviews , was simple : “ Sometimes there are coincidences in life ; it ’s better to look at it this way . ”

But when pressed , Fernandez offered an intriguing explanation .
He said U.S. authorities tipped him off that somebody intercepted cartel communications and learned Saldana was planning to kill him , and he said unspecified intelligence sources told him Saldana was dead hours before the bodies were found .

Not so long ago , we all lived in a world in which we decided where to meet friends before leaving the house and we hiked to the nearest payphone if we got a flat tire .
Then we got cellphones .
Well , not everyone .
For a hardy few that choose to ignore cellphones , life is a pocketful of quarters , missed connections and a smug satisfaction of marching to a different ring tone .
For Linda Mboya , 32 , who lives in Brooklyn and works on arts and education programs at a nonprofit group , it also involves never letting sleeping dogs lie .
A friend who lives on the top floor of a house in Brooklyn has a perpetually broken apartment buzzer .
So Ms. Mboya makes noise to disturb the dogs who live on the first floor , who then bark and announce her arrival to her friend .
Independent Institute Senior Fellow Robert Higgs is interviewed here by Judge Andrew Napolitano on Fox News ’ program , “ Freedom Watch , ” regarding the utter folly of the gigantic federal spending programs first started under George W. Bush and now enormously expanded by Barack Obama and the U.S. Congress .
Prolonging the recovery amidst enormous economic confusion and new government mandates , the impact of such policies is rising unemployment and business and bank failures .

Louison Bobet on his way to winning Ventoux , 1955 Tour .
His world champion jersey was custom made by Castelli .
These days it ’s not so elusive to find .
The famous brand is readily available .
Although I have gear from other brands I do own a Castelli jacket & knee warmers .
As you know I love history and proceeded to dig up some interesting facts on the famous scorpion .
The company is 133 years old and started out in 1876 by Vittore Gianni in Milan .
It ’s extra special when many of the cycling greats at one time were loyal clients .
Alfredo Binda , five - time Giro champ , wore the gear .
In 1939 , Armando Castelli bought the Gianni company and kept the stars of cycling as satisfied customer ’s .
Notably Gino Bartali and Fausto Coppi .
Coppi employed Castelli as his personal tailor .
And he soon supplied for professional teams .
And it did n’t stop there .
Louison Bobet , Rik Van Looy and Jacques Anquetil wore the Castelli apparel .
Armando ’s son , Maurizio started his own company , in 1974 , called Castelli .
And the scorpion was born .
In 1978 , Maurizio first used lycra as the material for cycling shorts .
It was a success .
Eddy Merckx wore a Castelli skinsuit for his world hour record in Mexico .
The mid 1980s with the dye sublimation process .
Paolo Rosola ( Sammontana - Bianchi ) sporting the new look !
The breakthrough came in the mid-1980s as Maurizio pioneered the dye sublimation process which allowed sponsor ’s names and graphics to be printed on the fabric .
The sponsor 's names can now be promoted everywhere on the garment .
Virtually most professional riders ’ wore the famous scorpion at one time or another .
And when you put a Castelli on you ’re wearing cycling apparel steeped in tradition and innovation .

I felt the sting of the scorpion back in my twenties .
There was n’t much offered in Edmonton .
But , I managed to find a wool jersey stamped with the scorpion .
It transported me to the time of gritty rider ’s of the seventies & eighties sporting majestically Castelli wear .
For me the scorpion logo represented cycling .
When you think of the world 's most prolific pot smokers , certain names come to mind : Snoop , Cheech and Chong , Willie Nelson .
How about Irvin Rosenfeld ?
The 56 - year - old Fort Lauderdale stockbroker will put his name among the greats when he sets a world record tomorrow for weed consumption while lighting up his 115,000th joint .
The best part is that it 's all legal .
" Yep , provided by Uncle Sam , " Rosenfeld told NBCMiami.com .
" They grow it for me , I find that quite ironic . "
Rosenfeld 's pot has been provided by the government since 1982 , when he became a patient in the Federal Drug Administration 's Investigational New Drug Program .
Grown on a farm on the campus of the University of Mississippi , the weed is delivered to a local pharmacy where Rosenfeld gets it by the bushel .
Rosenfeld suffers from a rare bone disorder called multiple congenital cartilaginous exostoses , which causes severe pain , alleviated by a healthy dose of ganja .
He 's been getting 300 joints every 25 days for the past 27 years , and said he smokes between 10 and 12 per day .
" The first thing I do every morning is smoke two joints as I watch my business shows , " Rosenfeld said .
" Then another on my drive to work . "
Rosenfeld said he 's never gotten high on the sticky icky , and he 's allowed to smoke while operating heavy machinery .
Not getting high also means no late - night trips to Taco Bell .
" No munchies , no munchies , nothing other people get , " Rosenfeld insists .
" A lot of patients do n't get high . "
Rosenfeld is an advocate for the Feds providing medicinal marijuana , a policy ended in 1992 .
While most people who need medicinal marijuana rely on the dozen or so states that allow it , Rosenfeld and three others were grandfathered into the federal program .
He said he 's lucky to be able to get his hands on what many others can't .
" I get lots of calls from people trying to get the medicine , " he said .
" It 's sad , people need it . "
Rosenfeld said he feels great thanks to the Mary Jane , and that others could be as healthy as him if it were made legal across the board .
" I would be bedridden without it , if I would even be alive , " he said .
" I should n't have been alive and I 'm still alive , I take no other medicines , I 'm in great shape because of the cannibis .
It 's just sad because the medicine 's there . "
He said he thinks the Obama administration will help people like him who truly need the weed to feel better .
" The tide is turning , patients are finally getting the help they need , " he said .
Rosenfeld 's writing a book on his experiences as the nation 's longest - running legal pot-smoker , tenatively called " Potluck . "
He hopes to have it published in the spring .
He said his ability to smoke weed in public has made him both a hero and a villain .
" There are people I 'm sure that consider me a hero , " he said .
" A lot of people make snide little comments or talk about the balls I have to smoke in public .
They 'll ask , ' Hey man , can I have some of that ? ' "
The villain part came in 1983 , when he was busted in Orlando for possession .
The overzealous cop did n't realize his right was federally protected , but after fingerprinting and a few hours in a police station , he was let go and the charges were dropped .
Though his public pot smoking has raised some eyebrows , Rosenfeld said it 's the ingrained negative perception that gives it a bad name , regardless of the health benefits .
" There are people who have been raised to think it 's the devil 's work , they 'll always be against it , " Rosenfeld said .
" If you truly think marijuana 's as bad as you think it is , explain me . "

The couple had daily fights , the court heard An Indian woman was granted a divorce on the grounds that her husband was cruel to stop her watching soap operas .
The judge ruled that " not allowing the spouse to watch TV serials amounted to cruelty " and was grounds for divorce .
The husband has lodged an appeal .
The couple had been married for eight years and have a daughter .
They began fighting in 2005 , the court heard .
Among other complaints , the woman said her husband had insulted her , refused to have sex with her and spat at her .
The couple 's divorce came through in August , but details only emerged when the husband 's appeal was heard in the Mumbai ( Bombay ) High Court on Monday .
' Flimsy '
The original family court order was issued in the western city of Pune .
" From February 2005 , the husband started picking up quarrels with the wife almost every day on the ground that she was seeing Hindi serials on TV channels , " Judge MG Kulkarni said .
" The husband was not allowing the wife to see programmes on TV as per her choice . "
The woman , an accountant , was granted custody of the couple 's six - year - old daughter .
Her husband , a software engineer , was granted access of two hours a week .
The husband 's legal team argued there was no evidence for his wife 's allegations .
His lawyer , Amit Karkhane , told the BBC the family court order was " preposterous " .
" It 's given on very flimsy grounds , " he said .
" Such an order is detrimental to society .
It 's not good for the larger interest of society . "
On Monday , two high court judges in Mumbai told the couple to seek conciliation .
The judges said an agreement to divorce by mutual consent would be in the best interests of everyone , including their daughter .
The next hearing is due on 23 November , the Daily News and Analysis newspaper said .

Sources tell TMZ the Florida Highway Patrol is now focusing on obtaining a search warrant -- allowing them to seize medical records from the hospital that treated Tiger Woods -- in an attempt to determine if the wounds Woods sustained are consistent with a car accident or domestic violence .
We 're told authorities believe they can show probable cause a crime was committed , a necessary step in obtaining a warrant .
One big piece of evidence showing probable cause ... sources tell us Tiger 's wife , Elin Nordegren told FHP troopers she went looking for Tiger in a golf cart , came upon the accident and then used a golf club to break the window to gain entry .
That 's a very different story from what she first told Windemere cops shortly after the accident -- she never mentioned a golf cart .
Nordegren told Windemere police she had walked out of her house , saw the crash , went back inside to get a golf club and returned to the vehicle .
TMZ has reviewed 21 photos from the scene -- no sign of any golf cart .
But we just found another photo ( below ) from the scene , where you can see a golf cart in the foreground .
And there 's more ... although alcohol was not involved , Tiger was in and out of consciousness and TMZ has already reported Tiger told a friend he was taking prescription meds for pain , which could be evidence of DUI .
This , too , could constitute probable cause to obtain a warrant .
We 're told the FHP is pursuing the search warrant option after getting shut down again Sunday in an attempt to interview Tiger and Elin and eyeball Tiger 's wounds .
As we first reported , according to sources , Tiger told a friend Elin had attacked him after she confronted him with reported allegations he had cheated on her .
We 're told Tiger told the friend Elin then followed him out of the house and struck the moving vehicle with the golf club , causing him to get distracted and hit the hydrant .
If the FHP determines Elin attacked Tiger , we 're told she could be arrested for domestic violence .
Reports of UFOs skyrocketed last weekend along the east coast of the US after a NASA launched an experiment to study an unusual phenomenon called noctilucent clouds , or ‘ night shining ’ clouds .
The Charged Aerosol Release Experiment ( CARE ) was conducted by the Naval Research Laboratory and the Department of Defense Space Test Program , created artificial noctilucent cloud using the exhaust particles of the rocket ’s fourth stage at about 173 miles altitude .
It created a bright object with a fan - shaped tail , prompting calls of concern from residents in Virginia and Massachusetts to local authorities .
But this object was definitely identified .
The experiment used a Black Brant XII Sounding Rocket launched from NASA ’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia on September 19 , 2009 at 7:46 p.m. EDT ( 2346 GMT ) .
[ / caption ]
Scientists are n’t sure what causes noctilucent clouds .
Some think they ’re seeded by space dust .
Others suspect they ’re a telltale sign of global warming .
See our previous post with pictures about noctilucent clouds .
Data collected during the experiment will provide insight into the formation , evolution , and properties of noctilucent clouds , which are typically observed naturally at high latitudes .
In addition to the understanding of noctilucent clouds , scientists will use the experiment to validate and develop simulation models that predict the distribution of dust particles from rocket motors in the upper atmosphere .
Natural noctilucent clouds , also known as polar mesospheric clouds , are found in the upper atmosphere as spectacular displays that are most easily seen just after sunset .
The clouds are the highest clouds in Earth ’s atmosphere , located in the mesosphere around 50 miles altitude .
They are normally too faint to be seen with the naked eye and are visible only when illuminated by sunlight from below the horizon while the Earth ’s surface is in darkness .
A team from government agencies and universities , led by the Naval Research Laboratory , is conducting the experiment .
In addition to the Naval Research Laboratory , participants include the DoD STP , NASA , University of Michigan , Air Force Research Laboratory , Clemson University , Stanford University , University of Colorado , Penn State University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology / Haystack Observatory .

Former U.S. President Bill Clinton looks towards the audience during the Clinton Global Initiative in New York September 25 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Chip East
ISTANBUL ( Reuters ) - Former U.S. President Bill Clinton said on Monday he would have preferred to leave the White House in a coffin because he loved being commander in chief , but signaled his political life was over .
“ It ’s good that we have a ( term ) limit .
Otherwise I would have stayed until I was carried away in a coffin .
Or defeated in an election , ” Clinton said at a conference in Istanbul .
“ I loved doing the job . ”
Clinton won two terms in office , the maximum under the constitution , and served from 1993 to 2001 .
His wife Hillary Clinton is now U.S. Secretary of State under President Barack Obama after losing the Democratic primary to him in 2008 .
Clinton said he enjoyed his current position as chairman of the Clinton Global Initiative , which raises funds to address issues ranging from healthcare to poverty to climate change .
But the former president ’s surprise visit to North Korea in August to secure the release of two jailed American journalists showed he still wields considerable diplomatic clout -- and stole some of the spotlight from his wife .
“ I loved being president , but I like my current life too ... I ’ll leave the politics to my wife and to President Obama , ” he said .
It was important that Megan worked at the Perfume Counter on the second level on the East Side of the building , near the double doors , because in the morning , before the store opened , Frederick would walk in through the back room , up the powerless escalators , and see her behind the counter , her elbows on the glass display case , with the light from the rising sun falling over her .
It made him smile , that image .
And he would remember it until he was too old to remember anything at all .
He frequented her area with trivial motives , which were easily deciphered .
He stopped by to ask her questions he knew the answers to and make idle talk about the weather or to complain about working at Renald’s .
First , he was awkward around her , nervous even , but soon he became comfortable and soon she became comfortable around him .
And as the days went on she would laugh at his jokes , each day a little bit more , till she laughed so hard that she reached out her hand and touched his arm : stop you are making me laugh too hard .
It was n’t long until they went out together .
And because neither of them were managers , no one at Renald ’s objected .
They went to a movie and the gossip was they walked together for some time after .
And on that long walk he held her hand and she rested her head on his shoulder .
They were complete opposites .
He was loud and cruel and prude .
He was notorious , mostly to those who worked side by side with him , for being limited and uncompromising .
She was quiet and kind and would bend easily with the direction of the breeze ; a handful of Renald 's employees - most of them good looking boys , from nineteen to twenty - four years old - could tell you the color of her bed sheets .
Frederick knew all of this .
He knew that she did n’t match up with what he had in mind .
When he would daydream , which was often , of his future life and the woman he would share it with , he saw another face completely .
He saw a slender , brown - haired woman with a British Isles complexion .
And their fair - skinned child running down the coast away from their stone cottage , toward the dark blue sea .
Megan was tan ( half Hispanic , from her mother ’s side ) and her hair was dyed a new color every month .
She had a wide smile with perfectly white teeth and pink lips , which she often licked .
A tattoo of stars ran up her feet and around her ankle .
And all of these things worked for her , but they were not things which he allowed himself to grow attached to or even familiar with .
But still they went out , on Fridays and Saturdays and they would text each other from their respective departments on workdays and take their lunch together , walking across the parking lot to a newly opened In & Out .
They talked of everything , no subject was taboo , except maybe tomorrow and what it would bring .
And the only thing they enjoyed more than agreeing , was arguing over that which they disagreed .
For two years they did this until one picturesque desert winter with blue days , no snow , and welcomed bouts of rain .
He knew then , that it was time .
She had taken less hours at Renald ’s for the new year ; having decided to focus on her schooling , of which she was behind .
He quit the job altogether with a respectful two weeks notice and the quiet resignation of man with different plans .
He stopped seeing her in the same way .
And Frederick ’s friends would ask him repeatedly , why do n’t you see Megan anymore ?
And he would respond , rather dryly , “ She is n’t what I have in mind . ”
But she makes you happy , they would reason .
He would shrug , as if to say maybe happiness is n’t what I have in mind , then walk away .
Palm Springs , California ( CNN ) --
A California man faces a federal judge Thursday because of what he allegedly wore to his 20th high school reunion earlier this year -- a U.S. Marine uniform decorated some of the nation 's highest military medals .
Steve Burton , 39 , never served in any branch of the U.S. military , but he was seen and photographed several times wearing a Marine uniform and various medals , including the Navy Cross -- the highest medal awarded by the U.S. Navy , federal investigators said .
The U.S. attorney for central California chose Veterans Day to announce that the Palm Springs , California , bank officer has been charged with " unauthorized wearing of military medals or decorations . "
The federal misdemeanor charge carries a maximum penalty of a year in federal prison upon conviction .
Burton 's lawyer , Michael DeFrank , said his client would voluntarily surrender for his initial appearance in federal court in Riverside , California , Thursday morning .
" He has been charged , but these are only allegations , " DeFrank said .
The Marine dress blue uniform with lieutenant colonel insignia on the epaulets and a chest full of colorful ribbons may have impressed old classmates , but one person at the reunion was suspicious , according to an FBI agent 's affidavit .
Lt. Cmdr. Colleen Solanga -- a U.S. Navy supply officer -- recognized the Navy Cross and knew how rarely that honor is awarded , the sworn statement said .
She posed with Burton for a photo , which she sent to the FBI in June , the agent said .
The FBI agent said Internet research showed that Burton had blogged during August 2009 about being a Marine and receiving many commendations and awards .
His postings also discussed engaging in combat and serving in Afghanistan and Iraq , the documents said -- particularly in Falluja , a city in Iraq 's largely Sunni Arab Anbar province where Marines and militants battled for years .
Burton posted a picture of himself online standing on a beach at Coronado Island , California , wearing a Marines dress uniform , the affidavit said .
In the picture , he is wearing the rank of gunnery sergeant and is displaying medals including the Navy Cross , the Legion of Merit , the Navy and Marine Corps medal , the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart , among others .
An American flag flew on a pole on the front lawn of Burton 's Palm Springs home Wednesday .
Burton , who was off work because it was Veterans Day , would not come to the door , a man who came to the door man referred CNN to his lawyer , DeFrank .
The man said he was Burton 's partner for 18 years and retired from the U.S. Air Force .
A next - door neighbor described Burton as " quiet and nice . "
She told CNN she saw agents carry away several boxes from the home two weeks ago
A search warrant was executed at Burton 's home , said Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Akrotirianakis , who did not divulge what was found there .
Akrotirianakis also would not say where authorities believe Burton obtained the medals .
However , an Internet search showed several medals -- or possibly replicas -- for sale online , despite a law banning their advertisement or sale .
Even if a medal is a replica , wearing it still violates federal law , Akrotirianakis told CNN .
The Navy Cross is the nation 's second - highest award given for valor , second only to the Medal of Honor , authorities said .
It is generally awarded for " extreme gallantry and risk of life , beyond the call of duty , performed in combat with an enemy force , " according to the prosecutors ' statement .
The Bronze Star is awarded for " heroic and meritorious achievement or service , " while the Purple Heart is awarded " for being wounded or killed in action against an enemy of the United States . "

Enlarge By Harry Hamburg , AP House labor committee Chairman George Miller wanted the GAO to examine the federal pension plan insurer , PBGC .
WASHINGTON 
Top executives at four companies that jettisoned their employee pension plans received $ 49.5 million in retirement and severance benefits in the years before the companies filed for bankruptcy , while retirees saw their benefits cut by as much as two thirds , congressional investigators conclude in a report released Thursday .
The Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) reports that pensions at the companies , United Airlines , US Airways , Polaroid and Reliance Insurance , were underfunded by more than $ 11 billion when the companies turned them over to a government - backed insurance fund .
The report says executives at those four companies and six others that abandoned their pension plans took in a total of $ 350 million in pay and perks in the years leading up to the bankruptcies .
" If the pension is getting deeper into trouble and the executives are getting richer , there 's something wrong with that picture , " said House Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller , D - Calif .
Miller requested the report as part of an examination of the troubles facing the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. , the federal pension plan insurer .
The PBGC , which insures pension plans covering 44 million people , warned this month that it has a deficit of nearly $ 22 billion .
Miller is sponsoring one of three proposals to let struggling companies take a break from their required pension contributions while the economy improves .
He said he is considering how to craft a provision to " tie executive compensation to the status of the pension plan . "
Other legislation Miller said he is considering is a plan to freeze executive compensation if a company 's rank - and - file pension plan becomes significantly underfunded .
Restrictions on retirement pay could deter executives from joining a troubled company or encourage them to quit , said executive compensation expert Ira Kay of the Watson Wyatt consulting firm .
" Retaining and motivating executives to run their companies as best as possible is the best outcome for all participants in a pension , " Kay said .
The GAO examined compensation for executives at 10 of the largest companies that turned their pensions over to the government in the past decade .
At United , for example , CEO Glenn Tilton and two other executives got $ 7.6 million in retirement benefits from 2002 through 2006 , during which time the airline shed four pension plans covering 122,000 workers .
A retired United pilot told the GAO he gets only a third of the pension he had expected .
PBGC benefits are limited to $ 4,500 per month .
United spokeswoman Jean Medina said Tilton 's $ 4.5 million retirement trust replaced benefits he lost by leaving Chevron and " had nothing to do with a United pension plan . "
The trust was approved by the company 's board of directors and its bankruptcy creditors , she said .
Currently , the GAO says , the PBGC is a low - priority creditor and would be unlikely to get any money if a bankruptcy judge ordered executives to repay or forgo their retirement packages .

DeMint , Maddow and Honduras : Do n’t Dare Call It Treason
Recently Rachel Maddow mentioned Congressman Jim DeMint ’s planned trip to Honduras , where he intended to encourage coup leaders to defy the U.S. government .
Maddow prefaced her remarks with a long homily on how badly the U.S. government hated military coups , because they ran counter to everything the U.S. government stands for , were so abhorrent to American values that the U.S. government cut off all ties to such repugnant pariah regimes , and blah blah woof woof .
This is amazingly stupid — almost as stupid as the Congressman I saw back in the ’90s , speaking in regard to Clinton ’s Balkan wars , who said he ’d learned in school that the U.S. never went to war to obtain a square foot of territory or a dollar of treasure .
The U.S. government is opposed to coups , especially against democratically elected leaders ?
Yeah , maybe in the Bearded Spock universe .
Um , ever hear of Armas ?
Suharto ?
Mourão Filho ?
Pinochet ?
I ’m sure all those nice folks in the U.S. government cried over such coups , just like Iron Eyes Cody watching somebody litter Central Park — or rather just like Lewis Carrol ’s Walrus , weeping even as he polished off the last of the oysters .
Maddow also suggested it was “ treason ” to encourage another government to defy the policies of the United States government .
That ’s really a shame coming from her .
It ’s usually Olbermann who ’s prone to this kind of liberal mirror - imaging of right - wing know - nothingism .
And why , exactly , is it so far beyond the pale to encourage the enemies of the U.S. government ?
Those people who put Suharto and Pinochet , et al , in power — they ’re suddenly the good guys ?
In the specific case brought up by Maddow , I ’ll concede that DeMint is an advocate for the worse cause , and Obama ( at least to the extent that his administration ’s net stance is against the coup ) for the better .
But in the overwhelming majority of cases , particularly in Latin America , the U.S. government has been a consistent force for evil .
Until recently , any left - wing populist leader in Latin America who promoted land reform and undermined the position of the feudal landed oligarchy and the American corporate interests aligned with them , stood a very good chance of being overthrown by a U.S. sponsored coup — after which the landed oligarchs would be restored to full control of their former haciendas and latifundias , and labor organizers and peasant activists would be systematically tortured , murdered , and “ disappeared ” by governments hell - bent on terrifying their populations into submission .
I am overjoyed that , in recent years , almost all of Latin America has been swept by left - wing populist regimes that defy Washington .
For the first time in many decades , the region is almost entirely free of American control .
That ’s because , thank God , the U.S. government is bogged down in foreign quagmires it can’t win , and has no forces to spare for another regional war against people like Hugo Chavez .
If it were n’t for the Iraq and Afghanistan quagmires , Venezuela would have experienced a replay of Guatemala 1954 by now .
Not that Chavez is n’t a statist , mind you , or that he is n’t unsavory and authoritarian in lots of ways .
But he sure as hell is n’t as bad as the kind of landlord - general oligarchy the U.S. would replace him with .
And it ’s really nice to see an entire continent coming out from under the thumb of Empire .
It ’s the kind of thaw that invites comparisons with Eastern Europe in 1989 .
It ’s worth noting , parenthetically , that Maddow may not have received the memo .
No less an official personage than Secretary of State Hillary Clinton takes a “ nuanced ” position on the Honduran coup , a lot more nuanced than Maddow ’s remarks would suggest .
At best , Clinton can be said to have rebuked the coup with the energy of an anemic housefly .
Her flack and quasi- official mouthpiece Lanny Davis is a lobbyist for the Honduran military regime .
Davis is allied with another sometime Clinton associate , Bennett Ratcliff ; both are associated with the Covington and Burling law firm , which is on retainer by the Chiquita company ( better known under its previous name of United Fruit Company , of fond memory ) .
You can almost hear Hillary on that 3 AM phone , furiously warning Maddow to “ Ixnay on Ondurashay ! ”
In any case , we should bear in mind that Washington , DC and Wall Street are not “ our country . ”
The real America is the host organism , not the glorified corporate - state tapeworms living in our colon .
But even more importantly , our real country is the “ good guys ” — wherever they may be found .
When the bad guys in the American national security state are propping up transnational corporate rule all around the world , and killing innocent working people to make the world safe for United Fruit and ITT , I ’ll side with the “ foreigners ” against Washington every time .
Visceral Games Is Full Of Heretics And Baby Killers

Has someone been sitting on the FBI ?
6/11/01
GREG PALAST :
The CIA and Saudi Arabia , the Bushes and the Bin Ladens .
Did their connections cause America to turn a blind eye to terrorism ?
UNNAMED MAN :
There is a hidden agenda at the very highest levels of our government .
JOE TRENTO , ( AUTHOR , " SECRET HISTORY OF THE CIA " ) :
The sad thing is that thousands of Americans had to die needlessly .
PETER ELSNER :
How can it be that the former President of the US and the current President of the US have business dealings with characters that need to be investigated ?
PALAST :
In the eight weeks since the attacks , over 1,000 suspects and potential witnesses have been detained .
Yet , just days after the hijackers took off from Boston aiming for the Twin Towers , a special charter flight out of the same airport whisked 11 members of Osama Bin Laden 's family off to Saudi Arabia .
That did not concern the White House .
Their official line is that the Bin Ladens are above suspicion - apart from Osama , the black sheep , who they say hijacked the family name .
That 's fortunate for the Bush family and the Saudi royal household , whose links with the Bin Ladens could otherwise prove embarrassing .
But Newsnight has obtained evidence that the FBI was on the trail of other members of the ]
Bin Laden family for links to terrorist organisations before and after September 11th .
This document is marked " Secret " .
Case ID - 199 - Eye WF 213 589 . 199 is FBI code for case type .
9 would be murder .
65 would be espionage .
199 means national security .
WF indicates Washington field office special agents were investigating ABL - because of it's relationship with the World Assembly of Muslim Youth , WAMY - a suspected terrorist organisation .
ABL is Abdullah Bin Laden , president and treasurer of WAMY .
This is the sleepy Washington suburb of Falls Church , Virginia where almost every home displays the Stars and Stripes .
On this unremarkable street , at 3411 Silver Maple Place , we located the former home of Abdullah and another brother , Omar , also an FBI suspect .
It 's conveniently close to WAMY .
The World Assembly of Muslim Youth is in this building , in a little room in the basement at 5613 Leesburg Pike .
And here , just a couple blocks down the road at 5913 Leesburg , is where four of the hijackers that attacked New York and Washington are listed as having lived .
The US Treasury has not frozen WAMY 's assets , and when we talked to them , they insisted they are a charity .
Yet , just weeks ago , Pakistan expelled WAMY operatives .
And India claimed that WAMY was funding an organisation linked to bombings in Kashmir .
And the Philippines military has accused WAMY of funding Muslim insurgency .
The FBI did look into WAMY , but , for some reason , agents were pulled off the trail .
TRENTO :
The FBI wanted to investigate these guys .
This is not something that they did n't want to do - they wanted to , they were n't permitted to .
PALAST :
The secret file fell into the hands of national security expert , Joe Trento .
The Washington spook - tracker has been looking into the FBI 's allegations about WAMY .
TRENTO :
They 've had connections to Osama Bin Laden 's people .
They 've had connections to Muslim cultural and financial aid groups that have terrorist connections .
They fit the pattern of groups that the Saudi royal family and Saudi community of princes - the 20,000 princes - have funded who 've engaged in terrorist activity .
Now , do I know that WAMY has done anything that 's illegal ?
No , I do n't know that .
Do I know that as far back as 1996 the FBI was very concerned about this organisation ?
I do .
PALAST :
Newsnight has uncovered a long history of shadowy connections between the State Department , the CIA and the Saudis .
The former head of the American visa bureau in Jeddah is Michael Springman .
MICHAEL SPRINGMAN :
In Saudi Arabia I was repeatedly ordered by high level State Dept officials to issue visas to unqualified applicants .
These were , essentially , people who had no ties either to Saudi Arabia or to their own country .
I complained bitterly at the time there .
I returned to the US , I complained to the State Dept here , to the General Accounting Office , to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and to the Inspector General 's office .
I was met with silence .
PALAST :
By now , Bush Sr , once CIA director , was in the White House .
Springman was shocked to find this was n't visa fraud .
Rather , State and CIA were playing " the Great Game " .
SPRINGMAN :
What I was protesting was , in reality , an effort to bring recruits , rounded up by Osama Bin Laden , to the US for terrorist training by the CIA .
They would then be returned to Afghanistan to fight against the then - Soviets .
The attack on the World Trade Center in 1993 did not shake the State Department 's faith in the Saudis , nor did the attack on American barracks at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia three years later , in which 19 Americans died .
FBI agents began to feel their investigation was being obstructed .
Would you be surprised to find out that FBI agents are a bit frustrated that they can't be looking into some Saudi connections ?
MICHAEL WILDES , ( LAWYER )
I would never be surprised with that .
They 're cut off at the hip sometimes by supervisors or given shots that are being called from Washington at the highest levels .
PALAST :
I showed lawyer Michael Wildes our FBI documents .
One of the Khobar Towers bombers was represented by Wildes , who thought he had useful intelligence for the US .
He also represents a Saudi diplomat who defected to the USA with 14,000 documents which Wildes claims implicates Saudi citizens in financing terrorism and more .
Wildes met with FBI men who told him they were not permitted to read all the documents .
Nevertheless , he tried to give them to the agents .
WILDES :
" Take these with you .
We 're not going to charge for the copies .
Keep them .
Do something with them .
Get some bad guys with them . "
They refused .
PALAST :
In the hall of mirrors that is the US intelligence community , Wildes , a former US federal attorney , said the FBI field agents wanted the documents , but they were told to " see no evil . "
WILDES :
You see a difference between the rank - and - file counter - intelligence agents , who are regarded by some as the motor pool of the FBI , who drive following diplomats , and the people who are getting the shots called at the highest level of our government , who have a different agenda - it 's unconscionable .
PALAST :
State wanted to keep the pro-American Saudi royal family in control of the world 's biggest oil spigot , even at the price of turning a blind eye to any terrorist connection so long as America was safe .
In recent years , CIA operatives had other reasons for not exposing Saudi - backed suspects .
TRENTO :
If you recruited somebody who is a member of a terrorist organisation , who happens to make his way here to the US , and even though you 're not in touch with that person anymore but you have used him in the past , it would be unseemly if he were arrested by the FBI and word got back that he'd once been on the payroll of the CIA .
What we 're talking about is blow - back .
What we 're talking about is embarrassing , career - destroying blow - back for intelligence officials .
PALAST :
Does the Bush family also have to worry about political blow - back ?
The younger Bush made his first million 20 years ago with an oil company partly funded by Salem Bin Laden 's chief US representative .
Young George also received fees as director of a subsidiary of Carlyle Corporation , a little known private company which has , in just a few years of its founding , become one of Americas biggest defence contractors .
His father , Bush Senior , is also a paid advisor .
And what became embarrassing was the revelation that the Bin Ladens held a stake in Carlyle , sold just after September 11 .
ELSNER :
You have a key relationship between the Saudis and the former President of the US who happens to be the father of the current President of the US .
And you have all sorts of questions about where does policy begin and where does good business and good profits for the company , Carlyle , end ?
PALAST :
I received a phone call from a high - placed member of a US intelligence agency .
He tells me that while there 's always been constraints on investigating Saudis , under George Bush it 's gotten much worse .
After the elections , the agencies were told to " back off " investigating the Bin Ladens and Saudi royals , and that angered agents .
I 'm told that since September 11th the policy has been reversed .
FBI headquarters told us they could not comment on our findings .
A spokesman said : " There are lots of things that only the intelligence community knows and that no - one else ought to know .
In the Motorola Droid ad campaign , Verizon claims that Droid does all that the iPhone does n’t .
One such feature that the iPhone does n’t support was revealed by Google earlier this week .
Available on Android OS 2.0 , the Google Maps Navigation is a real - time turn - by - turn GPS navigation system that is available for free on the Motorola Droid handset .
However , this is not meant to be a competitive edge for the Droid , at least at this stage .
Google has announced that the company would love to offer the same service over the iPhone as well , provided the bosses at Cupertino give their nod .
This comes in the backdrop of constant squabbling between the two companies in the past few months over Apple ’s rejection of Google Voice and Latitude applications for the iPhone .
Google CEO , Eric Schmidt who had to resign from the Apple Board in the wake of these disputes , has however insisted that Google has always been a fan of iPhone and there is no rivalry between the two companies .
While it is not clear if Apple would approve a Google built GPS navigation system for the iPhone , it certainly spells doom for the other GPS navigation tools available on the iPhone today .
The GPS navigation apps are among the most expensive apps on the Apple App Store .
While the TomTom iPhone app sells for $ 100 , other navigation apps like TeleNav , AOL Mapquest are available at monthly subscription charges of $ 3 to $ 10 .
With the entry of a free Google app alternative , it is definitely curtains for the GPS Navigation app ‘ industry ’ .
Another important aspect to consider is if a free Google alternative to TomTom or TeleNav will constitute predatory pricing tactics which will force Google to put a price tag on its iPhone app .
Whatsoever be the case , it would be in iPhone users best interest that Apple approves the iPhone app as it is a killer app .
Until then do you think a free GPS navigation tool on Droid can serve as a competitive advantage to Droid over iPhone ?
Would you want to have the Google Maps Navigation System on the iPhone ?

In Malaysia 's current political climate , it is no longer possible to distinguish Islamic radicals from Islamic moderates .
Despite official boasting about the country 's diverse population and commitment to pluralism , Islam and the government have essentially merged .
For two decades , the ruling United Malays National Organisation ( UMNO ) government invested enormous public resources in building up a network of Islamic institutions .
The government 's initial intention was to deflect radical demands for an extreme version of Islamic governance .
Over time , however , the effort to out - do its critics led the UMNO to over - Islamicise the state .
The UMNO 's programme has put Sharia law , Sharia courts , and an extensive Islamic bureaucracy in place , a collective effort that has taken on a life of its own .
The number of Islamic laws instituted has quadrupled in just over 10 years .
After Iran or Saudi Arabia , Malaysia 's Sharia court system is probably the most extensive in the Muslim world , and the accompanying bureaucracy is not only big but has more bite than the national parliament .
Islamic laws in Malaysia are based on religious doctrine but codified and passed as statutes by state parliaments .
Not much debate attends their enactment , because a fear of heresy keeps most critics from questioning anything deemed Islamic .
While the UMNO still trumpets its Islamic advocacy , the party is facing difficult choices , particularly as it wishes to maintain foreign investment in an increasingly polarised environment .
For example , Minister of Home Affairs Hishamuddin Hussein recently held a press conference to support Muslims who demonstrated against the construction of a Hindu temple in their neighbourhood .
The protesters paraded a severed , bloodied cow 's head in the street , then spat and stomped on it .
This was an offence to Malaysia 's Hindus , who consider the cow a sacred animal .
Just a week earlier , a young mother by the name of Kartika was sentenced by Malaysia 's Sharia court to six lashes by cane and fined $ 1,500 after she was caught drinking beer at a hotel .
Although the sentence is still in limbo , Hussein publicised his acceptance of the punishment by inviting the official floggers to his office to demonstrate how an Islamic caning would be carried out .
They used a chair as a mock target , leaving him satisfied that Islamic caning can be appropriately used as a punishment for women .
Ironically , Hishamuddin Hussein is far from an Islamic hard - liner .
The son of Malaysia 's third prime minister and a cousin of the current prime minister , he is widely considered modern , moderate and cosmopolitan .
A true hard - liner is Nik Aziz , the chief minister of Kelantan state , who is also the spiritual leader of Malaysia 's largest Islamic party , PAS , which now controls two state governments .
However , Aziz opposed the anti-Hindu protest , even calling a group of anti-Muslim protesters in the United Kingdom more civilised in their approach .
Hence , it is no longer accurate to think of the PAS as a fundamentalist party and the UMNO as moderate .
Party strategies are leading them in unexpected directions .
The UMNO 's more radical turn is being matched by the PAS ' attempts at moderation .
The PAS is aiming for the most unlikely of voters : non-Muslims , who account for 40 per cent of Malaysia 's population and are increasingly alienated from the UMNO .
The UMNO , meanwhile , is intent on dividing the opposition coalition , of which the PAS is a member .
The coalition is currently led by former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim , and has picked up political momentum from real gains in last year 's general election .
Concerned by its losses , the UMNO has staked a claim to the defence of Islam in Malaysia .
The " cow head " protest , which was led by UMNO members , quickly fuelled racially charged manipulation of public sentiment .
The formula is simple : portray Islam as being threatened by infidels , and then have the UMNO ride to the rescue of the besieged Muslim community .
The caning of Kartika , on the other hand , is not an example of political manipulation , and for this reason is perhaps even more worrisome .
Her sentence was roundly supported by modernist Muslim intellectuals , who insisted that the punishment was justly applied and cannot be questioned because it has divine sanction .
These are not politicians , but former idealists who are happy that their goals of Islamicising the state are being realised .
Most are anti-UMNO and support the PAS .
As a result , the UMNO finds itself squeezed between an Islamic lobby that presses for greater " Talibanisation " of the country and the rising voices of international critics , who cannot be ignored , because the party needs both radical supporters and foreign investors to stay in power .
Balancing these two constituencies is becoming increasingly difficult for the UMNO .
Islamic politics has now taken on a life of its own .
But the opposition will also be forced to figure out the role of religion in Malaysia , if ever they get an opportunity to form a government .
As a young Islamic radical , Anwar Ibrahim used to ask : How does one Islamicise government ?
Now he has to figure out how one governs it .
Key Democratic allies in the US health care battle warned Sunday that a Senate bill required major changes if it was to earn their support and give President Barack Obama a crucial victory on his top domestic priority .
A knife - edge ballot Saturday saw Democrats scrape the 60 votes needed for debate to begin November 30 , but wavering senators Joe Lieberman and Ben Nelson sent a strong message that they would not back the bill as it stands .
ADVERTISEMENT
Lieberman , an independent senator from Connecticut who usually votes in line with the Democrats and did so on Saturday , opposes the creation of a government insurance program to compete with private firms , the so - called “ public option . ”
“ We have a healthcare system that has real troubles , but we have an economic system that is in real crisis , ” said Lieberman , who fears the government program would be too expensive for the cash - strapped US economy .
“ Essentially every amendment is subject to a filibuster and will take 60 votes to pass , ” he added .
“ My only resort , and every other senator — and there ’ll be others who feel exactly the way I do about the public option — if the public option is still in there , the only resort we have is to say no at the end to reporting the bill off the floor . ”
His comments appear in the following video .

“ I do n’t want to fix the problems in our healthcare system in a way that creates more of an economic crisis , ” he told NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ”
“ Essentially every amendment is subject to a filibuster and will take 60 votes to pass .
My only resort , and every other senator — and there ’ll be others who feel exactly the way I do about the public option — if the public option is still in there , the only resort we have is to say no at the end to reporting the bill off the floor . ”
America ’s
Thanksgiving holidays are set to be marked by bitter debate over the nitty - gritty of the bill , from its costs in terms of tax increases and fees to the merits or not of the “ public option . ”

Divisive issues like abortion funding could also come to the fore while some Democrats may also seek funding for pet causes in their states in return for passing what amounts to the biggest shake - up of US health care in four decades .
The leading Democrat in the Senate , Harry Reid , faced three possible defectors in addition to Lieberman , any one of whom could have deprived him the 60 votes necessary to prevent Republican parliamentary delaying tactics .
ADVERTISEMENT
Those senators — Mary Landrieu of Louisiana , Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas , and Nelson of Nebraska — have signaled a willingness to join Republicans if their proposed changes to core provisions of the bill are defeated .
Before eventually falling into party line on Saturday , Landrieu and Lincoln repeated their strong opposition to the “ public option . ”
Nelson indicated on Sunday that he could be open to persuasion on the issue , although he prefers states to be able to opt in to program rather than having to opt out .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ We could negotiate a public option of some sort that I might look at , but I do n’t want a big government , Washington - run operation , ” he told ABC ’s “ This Week ” program .
Nelson has also demanded tougher restrictions on federal money subsidizing abortions , mirroring language the House of Representatives added to its version of the bill when it approved it in a 220 - 215 squeaker November 7 .
The New York Times reported that the Obama administration was continuing to court two moderate Republican senators from Maine , Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe , in the hope of winning them over and breaking up the united Republican opposition on health care .
Debate in the Senate is expected to last at least three weeks , but Republicans hope to kill the bill or delay the battle into next year with the expectation that the 2010 midterm elections may make it harder for moderate Democrats to support it .

Senators voted 60 - 39 Saturday to formally start debate on legislation aimed at extending coverage to some 31 million Americans .
As well as the public insurance option , the Senate bill includes restrictions on dropping care for pre-existing ailments .
It is estimated to cost 848 billion dollars through 2019 but cut the sky - high US budget deficit by 130 billion dollars over the same period .
A successful final vote — expected a month away at the earliest — would force the Senate and the House of Representatives to reconcile their rival versions of the bill and vote again on whether to send it to Obama .
The United States is the world ’s richest nation but the only industrialized democracy that does not provide health care coverage to all of its citizens , about 36 million of whom are uninsured .
ADVERTISEMENT
Several US presidents since Theodore Roosevelt in the early 1900s have sought to overcome the traditional US suspicion of a wider government role in health care .
Washington spends more than double what Britain , France , and Germany do per person on health care , but lags behind other countries in life expectancy and infant mortality , according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) .
The ancestors of dinosaurs had a hipbone , the pubis , which pointed forward .
The pubis evolved to point backward in two groups of dinosaurs : ornithischians and birds .
Even though they share the same hip shape , many other features show that birds are actually saurischian dinosaurs .
The evolution of a bird - like hip in ornithischians and birds is a case of convergent evolution , in which the same structure or shape evolves more than once .
Archosaurs are a group of specialized reptiles which ruled the Earth during the Age of Dinosaurs .
The only archosaurs that survive today are crocodiles and birds .
Birds are the only group of dinosaurs that survived the extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period , 65 million years ago .
Your holiday turkey is a saurischian dinosaur , like Apatosaurus , Tyrannosaurus , and Velociraptor .
The actual term is " reeding " .
Reeds were first put on the edges of coins back in the days when coins contained precious metals such as gold or silver .
It was a common practice for crooks to shave off a tiny amount of metal all the way around the rim of a lot of coins , collect the shavings , and sell them to a metal dealer .
If they did the work carefully they could reduce the diameter of the coin very slightly , not enough to be noticed , but enough to accumulate a nice profit once they 'd shaved a large enough number of coins .
However , shaving a coin with a reeded edge would immediately be obvious and the police or mint officials would know that someone was committing fraud .
Low - denomination coins generally are made of inexpensive metals so they were never reeded , partly because the risk of shaving is quite low and reeding adds a bit to the cost of producing a coin .
When the U.S. and other countries eliminated silver and gold from their coins , the new issues were usually struck from the same dies so reeding continued to be used as a matter of tradition and backwards - compatibility .
However , as new designs and denominations were introduced reeding came to be used as a way to make coins distinctive by feel as well as appearance .
This gives mints more latitude in choosing sizes because coins can be told apart by their edges as well as their images and colors , something that 's particularly important for people who are visually impaired .
New styles of edge markings have been used to replace or augment traditional reeding .
For example , some coins have " interrupted " reeding , featuring alternating bands of smooth and reeded metal , while others have thick reeds that resemble worn - down gear teeth .
EU 2 ¢ coins even have a groove running laterally around the edge , a bit like an Oreo cookie , rather than reeds oriented vertically with respect to the coin 's faces .
1. GENERAL
The following information about the Japanese defense of Betio Island is based on a joint study made by Marine Corps , Army , and Navy intelligence personnel .
1
The fundamental points brought out by this study are presented in the Intelligence Bulletin so that they may be widely disseminated , particularly among junior officers and enlisted men of the Army .
That the Japanese organized their Betio defenses for an all - around , decisive struggle to keep United States forces from reaching the beaches is borne out by a study of the map on pages 34 and 35 .
This map , drawn to scale , is designed to show an over - all picture of the enemy defensive setup .
The insets show important areas in detail .
The Japanese beach defenses consisted of well - emplaced and well - sited weapons , various types of obstacles , and mines .
The weapons included grenades , mortars , rifles , light and heavy machine guns , 13 - mm dual - purpose machine guns , 37 - mm guns , 70 - mm infantry guns , 75 - mm mountain guns ( Model 41 ) , 75 - mm dual - purpose guns ( Model 88 ) , 80 - mm antiboat guns , 127 - mm twin - mount , dual - purpose guns , 140 - mm coast - defense guns , and 8 - inch coast - defense guns .
The obstacles included pyramid - shaped , reinforced concrete obstacles , which were placed about halfway around the island on the coral reef ; an antiboat barricade , made of coconut - palm logs : double - apron barbed wire ; a perimeter barricade , constructed chiefly of coconut - palm logs ; and antitank ditches , dug a short distance back of the perimeter barricade .
Antipersonnel and antiboat mines were laid on the fringing reef — frequently between the concrete obstacles — and on the beaches .
Several Japanese flame throwers , were found .
Appropriate fire - control equipment was installed for the coast - defense and antiaircraft batteries , including range finders , directors , and searchlights .
The weapons , as a rule , were mounted in strongly constructed emplacements made of coconut - palm logs , reinforced concrete , and revetted sand .
The Japanese employed the 13 - mm ( approximately .50 caliber ) machine gun as their basic beach - defense weapon along the entire north coast and on both sides of the eastern tip .
Along the western and southwestern coasts , the 7.7 - mm heavy machine gun was the basic weapon .
The organization for defense inshore was haphazard .
Beaten on the beaches , the Japanese fell back to bomb - proof ammunition shelters and personnel shelters inshore from the beaches , and fired from the doors of the shelters .
These were blind to attack from several directions ; they were not designed as blockhouses , and had only a few firing ports .
2. OBSTACLES
a. Reinforced Concrete Pyramids ( tetrahedrons )
Almost up to the time United States Marine forces landed on Betio , the Japanese were working rapidly to surround the island with pyramid - shaped , reinforced concrete obstacles on the fringing reef .
The process was approximately half completed at the time of landing .
Figure 1 shows how the enemy had been molding these obstacles on the beaches .
Before concrete was poured into the inverted forms , the angle irons which formed the corners and horns were driven into the ground .
The actual size of the obstacles varied .
Their bases usually were about 4 feet wide and their height was determined in accordance with the average height of the water over the reef .
The center - to - center distance between the obstacles varied from 6 to 20 feet , on different beaches .
Located about midway out on the reef , these obstructions were just high enough to break the water at high tide .
They were designed to obstruct landing boats or to canalize them into predetermined areas which could be swept by the fire of antiboat guns , ranging from 13 - mm machine guns to twin - tubed 127 - mm guns .
In addition to the reinforced concrete obstacles , the Japanese rounded out their reef defenses by using wire , barricades , mines , and fairly large piles of coral rocks , which in some areas were staggered among the pyramids and strewn about the reef .
The rocks were from 6 to 18 inches in diameter , and the piles were 4 to 6 feet high .
b. Wire
The Japanese used three types of wire obstacles : high double - apron fences , low double - apron fences , and single - apron fences .
The high double - apron wire was placed inshore of the pyramidal obstacles and below the high tide mark .
It was constructed to canalize assaulting troops into direct enfilade fire from emplaced light and heavy machine guns and into trip wire .
Immediately inshore from the beach , high double - apron wire was placed directly in front of tank ditches , and low double - apron wire was placed behind the ditches .
Low double - apron wire was placed above the high - tide mark , and was employed to canalize or obstruct assaulting troops in front of covered machine - gun emplacements .
Single - apron wire was erected in front of some portions of the log barricades .
The wire was strung from the tops of vertical logs to stakes in the sand forward of the barricade .
c. Antiboat Barricade
On the south beach of Betio , the Japanese constructed an antiboat barricade with coconut - palm logs ( see fig . 2 ) .
The barricade , which was 10 feet high , was shaped like a wide V , with one leg 700 yards long and the other 300 yards long .
The logs were secured in place with wire and soft steel fasteners , 1/2 inch in diameter .
The barricade was planned to divert landing boats to the east and west of the center of the beach , and into areas which would receive flanking fire from emplaced heavy machine guns , dual - purpose guns , and heavy antiboat guns .
d. Perimeter Barricade
The Japanese constructed a barricade of coconut logs around virtually the entire perimeter of the island ( see fig . 3 ) .
There were a few unbarricaded spaces , but these were protected by antitank ditches .
Many of the perimeter - defense emplacements , because of the nature of their construction , were in themselves good barricades .
( These are described later . )
Each coconut - log barricade followed one of three general designs : ( 1 ) Log barricade with built - in rifle or light machine - gun emplacements ( see fig .
4 ) ; ( 2 ) log barricade without built - in weapon emplacements ( see fig .
3 ) ; and ( 3 ) tree stumps laid with their bottoms facing the sea .
That portion of a barricade which did not have built - in and covered rifle or light machine - gun emplacements had , instead , open sandbagged emplacements behind the barricade for these weapons .
e. Antitank Ditches
Antitank ditches on Betio were only 5 to 7 feet deep — because the water table was about 8 to 10 feet below the surface — and were 12 to 14 feet wide .
Only one ditch was revetted — with coconut - palm logs on the opposite side of the expected tank approach .
Wire obstacles were placed on a road at points where antitank ditches formed a junction .
Covered machine - gun emplacements were sited at the ends of some antitank ditches .
Apparently antitank - gun fire was to be supplied by 37 - mm , 70 - mm , and 75 - mm guns .
On the south beach , one antitank ditch was located about 10 yards inshore from a line of coconut - palm stumps .
Machine guns emplaced under cover and 37 - mm guns emplaced without overhead protection were located inland to provide direct covering fire for the antitank ditch .
At other points along the south beach , short sections of antitank ditches took the place of barricades .
3. MINES
Four types of mines were used by the Japanese on Betio : Model 93 antivehicle mine , Model 99 armor - piercing mine ( magnetized ) , an antitank mine , and an antiboat mine .
The Model 93 was used primarily against personnel .
This mine is usually placed in patterns of diagonal rows , with the mines about 30 inches apart .
The brass plug on top of each mine is generally at ground level .
The device is activated by pressure on the plug .
The Model 99 ( magnetic ) mine was used primarily against tanks and armored cars .
The antiboat mine was found in large numbers on the south and west coasts .
It is believed that the Japanese were in the process of encircling the island with these mines at the time the United States Marines landed .
Along the south beach the mines were located between the double - apron wire and the shore .
Laid in a double lane paralleling the beach line , they were placed about 20 yards apart .
In some places the mines were covered by 2 to 3 feet of water at high tide , while in others they were dry both at high and low tide .
Only a few of the antitank mines were found .
These were buried in the sand , with their necks exposed .
4. GRENADE DISCHARGERS AND GRENADES
The Japanese used Model 89 grenade dischargers and two types of hand grenades against landing boats and personnel .
The grenade dischargers apparently were assigned by sections throughout the beach - defense system .
In addition , several sections were placed behind antitank ditches in the eastern portion of the island .
5. RIFLE AND LIGHT MACHINE - GUN EMPLACEMENTS
a. General
Light machine - gun emplacements and rifle emplacements ( or pits ) were constructed to accommodate these weapons interchangeably .
Most of the emplacements were located directly in the beach barricade .
Some of these were protected by a strong cover , while others were open .
Located close to the beach barricade were several light machine - gun emplacements made of concrete .
b. Covered Type
The covered emplacements in the beach barricade were topped with at least one layer of coconut - palm logs about 10 inches in diameter and with loose sand and coral at least 1 foot thick ( see fig .
4 ) .
Inside , these emplacements were 4 feet long , 4 feet wide , and 4 feet high .
The occupant or occupants were protected by a thick blast wall , located so close behind the emplacements that entrance was difficult ( see fig . 5 ) .
Each of these emplacements had a small firing port , 12 inches long and 6 inches wide , which permitted little more than frontal fire .
Inside , under the firing port , there was a small fire step or shelf on which a light machine gun could have been placed .
Some of the covered rifle emplacements connected at the rear with communication trenches , which were revetted with vertical logs , boards , wire drums , and corrugated sheet steel .
Some of these trenches were covered .
c. Open Type
The open emplacements in the barricade system were mere slots behind the log wall , protected on the sides by logs bracing the barricade , by sand , and by a board revetment ( see fig .
6 ) .
Only rifles and light machine guns could be fired from these emplacements .
Some of the open - type emplacements were located a few feet behind , and above the top of , the barricade .
These emplacements were constructed of sand and were revetted with corrugated sheet steel and logs .
d. Concrete - pillbox Type
Figure 7 shows a light machine - gun emplacement made of reinforced concrete and provided with three firing ports .
Most of these emplacements were built just forward of the beach barricade , and were sited so as to provide frontal fire to cover tactical wire , and flanking fire to cover the front of the barricade .
Since other emplacements in the vicinity of the concrete pillboxes provided flanking and frontal fire , the pillboxes may have been designed primarily for firing on targets of opportunity .
The tops and sides of the concrete emplacements had an average thickness of 14 inches ; they were reinforced by steel rods 1 /2 inch in diameter .
Although these emplacements were independent of the beach barricade emplacements , they were connected with the barricade by tunnels , communication trenches , and blast bays made of logs and concrete .
e. Shields for Riflemen
Figure 8 shows details of two types of shields for riflemen .
The shields , found near the main runway of the Betio airfield , are light and easy to carry ; therefore , in effect , they are mobile rifle emplacements which afford some protection .
They are only 1/8 inch thick , but are made of hardened steel .
They were painted a dull brown .
6. HEAVY MACHINE - GUN EMPLACEMENTS
a. Built into Beach Barricade
Most of these were encountered in the strongly organized and well - constructed barricade system on the west and southwest coasts .
Within this system , the heavy machine - gun emplacements were spaced at fairly regular intervals , and were separated by covered rifle and light machine - gun emplacements , which afforded local protection .
Roughly , the built - in emplacements were of two types : those with a single firing port , for frontal fire , and those with two firing ports , for flanking fire .
Both types were made of logs and sand , and were an integral part of the beach barricade .
The single - port type provided frontal fire over the reef and covered the approaches to machine - gun emplacements which were sited for flanking fire .
Most of the single - port types were well designed and constructed ( see fig . 9 ) .
The sides and top consisted of two or three layers of coconut logs and a layer or two of sandbags covered with sand and coral .
The sides were banked with sand to add protection and camouflage .
The outside width and length of these emplacements were 18 to 20 feet .
Inside , they were divided into compartments , one or more of which were used to store and protect ammunition — these were always in the rear .
Most of these emplacements were connected with bomb shelters , rifle and light machine - gun emplacements , command posts , and ammunition dumps by means of revetted communication trenches .
The two - port type of heavy machine - gun emplacement could mount two heavy machine guns ( 7.7 - mm ) and could possibly mount 13 - mm machine guns .
The firing ports in nearly all cases were sited for flanking fire along the tactical wire entanglements and boat obstacles .
In fact , the design of the emplacements prohibited frontal fire .
The top and sides consisted of two , and sometimes three , coconut logs , which were covered by two layers of sandbags and rounded off at the sides with sand and coral .
The finished structure , except for the entrance and connecting communication trenches , appeared from the top as a large sand mound within the barricade .
The outside length and width of these emplacements measured approximately 24 feet .
Inside , they were divided into compartments to give added protection to both personnel and ammunition .
The latter was kept in a separate , well - constructed room in the rear of the emplacements ( see fig . 10 ) .
A second type of twin - port heavy machine - gun emplacement ( or casemate ) was made of concrete .
Only two of these were found .
Each had two ports , for flanking fire , and each had two adjoining antiaircraft emplacements .
Although this type of emplacement apparently was designed for the use of 13 - mm machine guns , indications are that 7.7 - mm machine guns were used in the two found on Betio .
b. Outside of Beach Barricade
Open - type heavy machine - gun emplacements in the interior of the island consisted of simple circular pits dug into the ground and revetted with boards , corrugated sheet steel , and sandbags ( see fig . 11 ) .
Logs and oil - drum pedestals were used as mounts for guns .
These emplacements obviously were designed primarily for antiaircraft fire ( probably 7.7 - mm machine guns ) .
They were located at irregular intervals around the airfield and inshore of the barricades .
Apparently the Japanese did not construct any single - port , covered heavy machine - gun positions inshore of the beach barricades .
However , as the situation developed , the enemy made full use of the entrances to bomb - proof shelters as machine - gun firing positions .
7. 13-MM MACHINE -GUN EMPLACEMENTS
a. General
In defense of Betio , the Japanese employed both single - and twin - mount 13 - mm dual - purpose machine guns .
All were pedestal - mounted , and were located in open emplacements to permit antiaircraft fire , as well as fire on ground troops .
Most of these guns were sited so that frontal or flanking fire could be placed on the beach and reef .
Several were located on top of high structures , such as the magazines near the 127 - mm dual - purpose guns .
b. Single Mount
Emplacements for the single - mount gun were approximately 4 feet deep .
The gun pedestals generally projected almost to the ground level ; thus the gun itself was only 1 to 1 1/ 2 feet higher ( see fig . 12 ) .
In construction , these emplacements varied as follows :
(1) Six - sided emplacements , 10 feet in diameter , with the retaining walls consisting of a layer of horizontally placed logs , or boards and logs , or sandbags , and a sandbag parapet .
In many of these emplacements , the parapets were two or three sandbags higher than others — presumably for protection against blast and fire .
In at least one position , communication trenches led to the emplacements .
(2) Ten - foot - square emplacements , with log and sand - constructed shelters 6 1/2 feet high and 10 to 15 feet wide .
These emplacements had coconut - log retaining walls which were banked with sand .
(3) Square or six - sided emplacements , raised about 3 feet above ground level .
Walls ( 2 feet thick ) of sand and sandbags were contained by corrugated sheet iron , posts , and so forth .
The inside diameter was 10 feet ; the exterior diameter , 14 to 15 feet .
( One gun was provided with a 3/ 8 - inch - thick steel shield . )
(4) Twin , eight - sided concrete emplacements , which were part of a ground machine - gun and antiaircraft machine - gun casemate ( already described in par . 6a ) .
(5) Emplacements on top of buildings and revetments ; these were circular and simply constructed of sandbags .
c. Twin Mount
Two types of emplacements for the twin - mount guns were noted :
(1) Slightly pear - shaped emplacements , 10 feet across at the rear and slightly less at the front ; 3 feet high at the rear and sloped forward to a height of 2 feet at the front ; walls made of sandbags 3 feet thick , and further banked by soft sand .
(2) Square emplacements atop ammunition magazine ; 10 feet across on the inside ; walled by boards and banked with sandbags and loose sand to a thickness of 3 to 4 feet ; 2 feet high .
Figure 13 shows one of the three known types of pedestals for the twin - mount machine gun .
8. FIELD GUNS AND EMPLACEMENTS
The location of emplacements for the three types of field guns used by the Japanese on Betio indicates that their primary mission was antiboat defense .
Some of these guns — 75 - mm mountain gun ( Model 41 ) , 70 - mm battalion gun ( Model 92 ) , and 37 - mm rapid - fire gun ( Model 94 ) — were used as support weapons after our beachheads had been established .
Emplacements for all three guns were roughly of the same type .
The interior was arrow - shaped or , in a few cases , egg - shaped , with the entrance in the broad end and the firing port in the narrow end ( see fig . 14 ) .
The walls consisted of a single layer of logs , laid either horizontally or vertically .
In some cases they were lashed to retaining posts or were joined at the corners with steel rod fasteners .
The walls were banked outside with mounds of sand , which were 4 to 5 feet in width at the base .
Most of the emplacements were roofed with a single layer of logs , covered to a depth of 2 to 2 1 / 2 feet by loose sand .
A few emplacements had no roofs ( see fig . 15 ) .
All emplacements had an unroofed entrance passageway in the rear , 5 to 6 feet wide and 5 to 10 feet long .
In most cases the passageway was curved so that a second rear wall could protect the rear of the emplacement from blast or fire .
The firing ports of all emplacements except those on the northwest coast were sheltered from blast and small - arms flanking fire by means of log- and sand - banked wings .
These were 5 to 8 feet long and opened at an angle of about 100° .
Some emplacements on the beach were protected by low double - apron wire .
These emplacements , although obviously not designed for small - caliber weapons , in many cases were used as last - ditch positions for riflemen and machine gunners .
In a few instances , the guns were removed from the emplacements , turned around , and fired inland from the rear .
9. DUAL - PURPOSE GUN EMPLACEMENTS
a. For 75 - mm , Model 88 , AA Guns
Eight of these guns were emplaced on Betio .
Four were sited as a battery near the northwest corner of the island , and the other four were arranged in pairs , one each on the north and south coasts of the eastern tip .
Except for minor variations , all emplacements for the Model 88 were similar .
Dug to a depth of about 5 feet below the ground level , they had five sides , which were revetted with empty oil drums and with 1 - inch - thick boards secured by vertical coconut logs or by solid coconut - log walls .
Ammunition ready - boxes of varying sizes were built into one or more of the side walls .
In some cases a communication trench connected the emplacement and a nearby bomb - proof coconut - log shelter .
The revetments for all emplacements were higher on the inshore sides than on the seaward sides , permitting low - angle antiboat fire on beach approaches .
Sandbags secured the fill on top of the revetments .
The guns were mounted on spider - leg pedestal mounts .
Each group of guns was provided with fire - control equipment consisting of a range finder with a 2 - yard base and a small ( Model 1930 ) sound locator with four horns .
Searchlights ( 150 - cm and 90 - cm ) were located so as to serve both the antiaircraft and nearby coast - defense guns .
b. For 127 - mm Twin-mount Guns
These guns , designed for coastal defense as well as antiaircraft defense , were emplaced in pairs in two locations .
Their emplacements were constructed of concrete and were banked from the ground level to the brim of the concrete parapet with coral and sand .
The distance between emplacements , center - to - center , was 40 yards .
Spaced at equal intervals around the side of the parapet were 10 ready - boxes , each holding 12 rounds of ammunition .
Ammunition stores were kept in four concrete , sand - covered , bomb - proof buildings in the vicinity .
Apparently the ammunition was carried from the main storage buildings to the ready - boxes .
A fire - control position for the battery of two twin mounts was located on a sand - covered concrete structure , 30 feet square and elevated 15 feet above the ground .
A range and altitude finder and a director were mounted on this .
The electrical and communication equipment for the installation was placed inside this structure , which was protected by four 7.7 - mm machine guns placed at each of the four top corners .
Additional protection for the entire installation was provided by two twin - mount 13 - mm machine guns on top of the ammunition storage structures on the flanks .
A 150 - cm Model 1933 searchlight was located 100 yards out on each flank of the installation .
10 . COAST - DEFENSE GUNS
Japanese weapons on Betio emplaced solely for coast defense included six 80 - mm guns , four 140 - mm guns , and four 8 - inch shielded naval type guns .
a. 80 - mm Guns
These guns were found in batteries of three .
There were two such batteries , one located in the center of the west beach and the other on the eastern part of the south shore .
The latter battery had a secondary mission of covering the south reef antitank barrier with flanking fire .
The emplacements were constructed of logs and sand , and were open at the top except for palm - branch canopies provided for camouflage .
They had six sides , with a rear entrance .
Double walls , made of logs , formed the six sides .
Each log wall was laid horizontally , and was three logs , or 3 feet , high .
The space between the double walls was about 3 feet and was filled with sand .
The front side of the emplacements paralleled the beach .
Built into the two rear walls were concrete ammunition shelters , each capable of holding three ammunition boxes of 12 rounds .
Japanese standard - type bomb - proof shelters , each capable of holding 12 men , were located to the rear and to one side of each emplacement .
An observation tower , 15 feet high and constructed of logs , stood just behind , and to one side of , the central gun of each battery .
b. 140 - mm Guns
Two of these weapons were located on the northwest point , and two on the east point .
They were mounted in circular concrete pits which rested on the normal ground level .
The floor parapet and ready - boxes of each pit were made of reinforced concrete and banked with sand .
The pits , or emplacements , in each battery were about 60 yards apart .
The fire - control arrangement for each pair of guns included an observation tower , 80 feet high , which was erected on a sand - covered , bomb - proof shelter .
The latter housed a power distribution board for supplying electricity to the guns and a communication or control center for the battery .
c. 8 - inch Shielded Guns
Four of these guns were found on Betio , two on the southwest corner and two on the southeast coast .
The two guns on the southwest corner were mounted in a tandem arrangement in concrete emplacements , which were banked all around with sand and coral .
Ammunition was stored in a heavily constructed bomb - proof shelter , 75 yards from the gun position .
A narrow - gauge railroad track led from the storage shelter to an ammunition ready - room which separated the two gun positions .
Small hand - drawn cars were used on the track .
The fire - control system for this installation included a plotting room in a lower level of the upper gun emplacement , an observation tower ( 70 feet high ) , and the necessary wire and voice - tube communication between these elements and the guns .
The two guns on the southeast coast were located in circular concrete emplacements about 10 feet above the ground .
The two emplacements were about 100 yards apart .
Ammunition and powder , and the personnel to handle them , were sheltered in four magazines situated a few yards to the rear of each emplacement .
A ready ammunition - handling shack also was situated behind each emplacement .
A fire - control tower , 45 feet high , was situated behind the two guns .
11 . TANKS
The Japanese had 14 Model 2595 ( 1935 ) light tanks on Betio .
They were camouflaged in dug - in revetments , the tops of which were flush with the ground .
The camouflage generally consisted of palm leaves .
Nine of the tanks were held around the air - defense command post near the lagoon shore .
12 . COMMAND POSTS
The rifle and machine - gun positions , which formed the primary beach defense , were controlled from steel pillbox - command posts , spaced at intervals of about 300 yards around the perimeter of the island .
These pillboxes were prefabricated , six - sided , truncated pyramids with double walls made of steel ( see fig . 16 ) .
Both the outer and inner plates were 1 / 4 inch thick , and the space between them was filled with sand .
In most cases the exterior of these pillboxes was banked with sand or camouflaged with palm fronds .
Inside , these pillboxes were divided into an upper and a lower compartment .
The upper compartment was designed for an observer or commander .
It had an observation seat , a voice tube , and a hatch , which opened outwards from near the sides .
The voice tubes led down into the lower compartment , which apparently was designed to house two machine guns .
This compartment had two large ports , one on the left flank and one on the right , and a small peep sight to the front .
The large ports were equipped with bracket supports for machine guns , but apparently no machine guns were used in any of the pillbox - command posts on Betio .
One steel pillbox on the south beach was capped with 12 inches of concrete .
The largest reinforced concrete structure on the island was believed to have been the main headquarters .
It housed the terminal facilities of radio and telephone equipment , as well as administrative personnel .
The reinforced concrete was very thick .
The structure was additionally protected by a thick layer of sand on the roof , on which two 13 - mm machine guns were emplaced .
Apertures were provided in the walls of the building for the firing of small arms and light automatic weapons , but the primary purpose of the building apparently was to provide shelter for personnel and equipment .
13 . SHELTERS
The shelters found on Betio can be broadly divided into two groups : those located in barracks and headquarters areas and those located to serve beach - defense .
Those in the barracks and headquarters areas were designed to protect large groups of personnel during air or surface bombardment .
They were constructed of alternate layers of coconut logs and coral sand .
Side walls and roofs averaged 5 to 7 feet in thickness .
Ventilation shafts were provided , but there were no gun or rifle ports .
Those in the beach - defense areas were designed and used , during bombardment , as standby shelters for personnel who were waiting to man beach positions .
These shelters were smaller and not as heavily constructed as those inland .
They were located immediately adjacent to defensive positions .
Several were constructed of reinforced concrete 12 to 16 inches thick and covered with sand .
Others were constructed of logs and sand .
They varied in size and design to suit the particular needs of an area .
Like the larger structures , the beach - defense shelters were designed for protection , not as prepared defensive positions .

Moratorium on foreign debt servicing to pay for essential and basic services !
Upgrade Pagasa ’s equipment now !
October 8 , 2009 --
Now we find out that Pagasa ’s ( the Philippines ’s official weather bureau ) main computer is on screensaver mode receiving no data because the main weather radar in Baguio City is on the blink ( again ) and all the while Typhoon Pepeng / Parma continues to threaten Luzon .
We also keep hearing the refrain from Pagasa officials of the need to buy five modern ``Doppler radars '' – equipment that we should have had decades ago .
Modern weather radars are mostly pulse - Doppler radars , capable of detecting the motion of rain droplets in addition to intensity of the precipitation .
Both types of data can be analysed to determine the structure of storms and their potential to cause severe weather .
This equipment could have predicted the intensity and severity of Typhoon Ondoy [ that hit Manila on September 26 . ] .
We are also told that this Doppler radar costs US $ 100,000 a piece , or a total of 25 million pesos , for the radar that we desperately need to protect and save the lives and limbs of our people .
So , what ’s the problem !
Just buy it !
Where will the money come from ?
From our money spent on foreign debt servicing could be one place to start .
Over the five - year period from 2003 - 2007 , for example , the Philippines ' foreign debt repayments amounted to some 1000 billion pesos .
In the last five years Pagasa received only 4 billion pesos for equipment upgrades .
So do the math .
It ’s not rocket science to figure out where the money can and should come from .
A modern weather forecasting system is an essential service for the country .
The problem is not the lack of money .
The problem is the priorities of our political leaders and governments .
Apparently it ’s more important to service our dubious foreign debt than prioritise essential services , and therefore the welfare and even lives of the masa ( masses ) .
This is the horrific truth .
The problem is that the system places little or no priority on the needs of the masa – on human needs .
Partido Lakas ng Masa calls for an immediate moratorium on debt servicing so that we can buy the necessary modern weather forecasting equipment which is an essential service to save lives , as well as to prioritise the provision of other basic services for the masses .

The postmaster of the Bangor post office has been arrested and sent to prison for allegedly trying to lure three young girls into his car on Tuesday , according to a police news release .
Gregory Schlegel
, 53 , of the 500 block of Roberts Road in Bushkill Township , allegedly drove past a group of young girls several times in his black BMW , honking his horn and yelling until they stopped and then motioned for them to get into the car , police said .
The girls are 12 , 13 and 17 , and were walking about 4:10 p.m. in Downtown Bangor on South Main Street when the incident happened , police said .
.
The girls reported the incident to police , and shortly around the same time police received another complaint of the similar activity .
That report indicated Schlegel allegedly approached two other women , 28 and 34 , asking if they had drugs , police said .
Court records say Schlegel initially approached Agnes Jennings , 34 , several times in the first block of North Main Street , asking her if " she had any crack or dope . "
Jennings ' boyfriend , Ryan Flyte , called police and approached Schlegel to ask him what he wanted .
Flyte told police that after the exchange he saw Schlegel drive up to the three young girls .
After talking with the girls , records say Schlegel approached Frances Tullo , 28 , on South Main Street and Broadway and asked her for drugs .
Police said they later found Schlegel 's car behind the Bangor Post Office , in the 200 block of South First Street , and found Schlegel in his office , where they arrested him .
Police said Schlegel told them he was out checking collection boxes and approached several women looking for sex .
The 12 - year - old girl told police she had made a similar report involving Schlegel in September .
Bangor police Chief Glen Kerrigan said Tuesday 's incident was very similar in nature to the one that happened in September .
He said police do not yet know if Schlegel was the man involved in the September incident , but they are hoping to make a positive identification in the next couple of days .
Schlegel was arraigned before District Judge Joseph Barner and charged with harassment and attempting to lure a child .
He was sent to Northampton County Prison in lieu of $ 50,000 bail .
According to the United States Post Office Web site ,
.
He previously worked as the supervisor of the Palmer Township branch of the Easton Post Office and as officer - in - charge at the Nazareth Post Office .
Schlegel has previously been involved in coaching youth sports in the Nazareth area .
Court records say Schlegel was admitted to a first - time offenders ’ program in June after Colonial Regional police charged him in November 2008 with drunken driving .
The British are the only people in western Europe who want immigration controls at the national rather than the European level , despite having little confidence in the national authorities ' handling of the issue , according to a survey of eight countries .
The poll suggests the British are more anti-immigrant and xenophobic than the rest of western Europe – preferring a Fortress UK policy , blaming immigrants for unemployment , and split over whether to grant them equal social benefits .
One in five Britons , twice the European average , thought immigration was the most important issue facing the country .
Only the Italians came close to sharing that view .
While scepticism towards the benefits of immigration grew in all European countries , two out of three Britons , more than in all the other countries surveyed , thought immigration was more of a problem than an opportunity .
The survey of immigration trends by the German - Marshal Fund thinktank www.transatlantictrends.org surveyed opinion in six western European countries – Britain , France , Germany , Italy , Spain and the Netherlands – as well as the US and Canada .
While 71 % of Germans thought their government was doing a good job managing immigration , the same proportion of Britons believed the government was performing poorly .
Britons were uniquely sceptical over EU responsibility for immigration .
A majority ( 53 % ) wanted the powers kept at the national level , almost double the European average of 28 % .
Britons believed the number of immigrants in the country was almost triple the actual level ( 27 % compared with 10 % ) .
In the EU , Britain is not part of the passport - free Schengen zone , retaining national border controls , whereas continental Europeans can travel from Poland to Portugal without passport checks .
Under the Lisbon treaty , which came into force this week , the EU will embark on more common immigration and asylum policies , although Britain has negotiated the right to exclude itself .
" There is considerable support in the continental European countries polled for addressing immigration at the European Union level , " said the survey .
" A majority in all European countries except the United Kingdom favoured immigration policy decision - making at the EU level . "
Given the impact of the recession on employment in the west over the last year , the pollsters asked whether the crisis meant that immigrants were taking jobs from the native - born .
" Only in the United Kingdom did the majority ( 54 % ) agree with this statement , " the survey found .
" In all other countries polled , majorities did not think that immigrants take jobs away from the native - born ; 53 % of the Americans , 67 % of the Canadians , and 67 % of the Europeans in the sample either strongly or somewhat disagreed that immigrants cost natives their jobs .
Other studies suggest that immigrant workers themselves usually belong to the group of workers hardest hit by economic crises . "
On whether immigrants depressed wage rates , only the British and the Spanish agreed they did .
More Britons than anyone else ( 47 % against a 27 % European average ) wanted to deny legal immigrants equal social benefits ; more Britons than anyone else ( 44 % against an average 24 % ) favoured reinforcing border controls to combat illegal immigration ; and fewer Britons than anyone else ( 28 % against a 43 % European average ) supported legalising the status of illegal immigrants .
when bleeding edge science gets it wrong
Bleeding edge science is n't always right , especially when it tries to figure out free will and how we think .
Everybody talks about the cutting edge when they want to say that something is the latest and greatest thing in science or technology .
Fewer people talk about the bleeding edge , those experimental ideas and what ifs that could either unlock new potential fields of study or fail as dead ends .
General relativity was one example of a once bleeding edge theory that survived and thrived .
On the other hand , studies about free will — or rather , the lack thereof — by neuroscientist Benjamin Libet , is an example of a proposal that fared much worse …
One of the biggest problems in studying the human brain is the difficulty in proving correlation and causation in such a complex system , and this is exactly the mistake he made when researching decision making …
In 1983 , neuroscientist Benjamin Libet asked volunteers wearing scalp electrodes to flex a finger or wrist .
When they did , the movements were preceded by a dip in the signals being recorded , called the “ readiness potential ” .
Libet interpreted this RP as the brain preparing for movement .
Crucially , the RP came a few tenths of a second before the volunteers said they had decided to move .
Libet concluded that unconscious neural processes determine our actions before we are ever aware of making a decision .
Now , you might have noticed a little problem with his experiment .
Where was the control ?
How exactly does a burst of neuron activity prove that a decision was made automatically ?
Neurons fire for all sorts of reasons so to immediately assign a deep meaning to one pattern of electrical activity is a little premature at best .
After 25 years , a duo of scientists from New Zealand decided to go back and add the control to Libert ’s experiment to figure out if the RP he detected was really tied to decision - making .
… instead of letting their volunteers decide when to move , Miller and Trevena asked them to wait for an audio tone before deciding whether to tap a key .
If Libet ’s interpretation really was correct , Miller reasoned , the RP should be greater after the tone when a person chose to tap the key .
While there was an RP before volunteers made their decision to move , the signal was the same whether or not they elected to tap .
Miller concludes that the RP may merely be a sign that the brain is paying attention and does not indicate that a decision has been made .
Maybe the reasoning in the second study is a little stretched as noted by some observers and the RP really is the signal of a brain preparing for movement , but it does show that there ’s no tangible relationship between a decision and the signal .
Simply put , Libet jumped to a sweeping conclusion that was n’t supported by the data he had .
Oh well , happens to the best of us I suppose , as long as it ’s eventually caught and corrected .

SMYRNA , Ga. --
For the first time in four decades in the luxury - home business , executives at John Wieland builders are thinking the unthinkable : Maybe houses in the South do n't really need a fireplace .
They 're also wondering whether new homes require 4,700 square feet of living space .

THERE is a lot of water on Earth , but more than 97 % of it is salty and over half of the remainder is frozen at the poles or in glaciers .
Meanwhile , around a fifth of the world 's population suffers from a shortage of drinking water and that fraction is expected to grow .
One answer is desalination — but it is an expensive answer because it requires a lot of energy .
Now , though , a pair of Canadian engineers have come up with an ingenious way of using the heat of the sun to drive the process .
Such heat , in many places that have a shortage of fresh water , is one thing that is in abundant supply .
Ben Sparrow and Joshua Zoshi met at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver , while completing their MBAs .
Their company , Saltworks Technologies , has set up a test plant beside the sea in Vancouver and will open for business in November .
Existing desalination plants work in one of two ways .
Some distil seawater by heating it up to evaporate part of it .
They then condense the vapour — a process that requires electricity .
The other plants use reverse osmosis .
This employs high - pressure pumps to force the water from brine through a membrane that is impermeable to salt .
That , too , needs electricity .
Even the best reverse - osmosis plants require 3.7 kilowatt hours ( kWh ) of energy to produce 1,000 litres of drinking water .
Mr Sparrow and Mr Zoshi , by contrast , reckon they can produce that much fresh water with less than 1 kWh of electricity , and no other paid - for source of power is needed .
Their process is fuelled by concentration gradients of salinity between different vessels of brine .
These different salinities are brought about by evaporation .
The process begins by spraying seawater into a shallow , black - bottomed pond , where it absorbs heat from the atmosphere .
The resulting evaporation increases the concentration of salt in the water from its natural level of 3.5 % to as much as 20 % .
Low - pressure pumps are then used to pipe this concentrated seawater , along with three other streams of untreated seawater , into the desalting unit .
As the diagram explains , what Mr Sparrow and Mr Zoshi create by doing this is a type of electrical circuit .
Instead of electrons carrying the current , though , it is carried by electrically charged atoms called ions .
Salt is made of two ions : positively charged sodium and negatively charged chloride .
These flow in opposite directions around the circuit .
Each of the four streams of water is connected to two neighbours by what are known as ion bridges .
These are pathways made of polystyrene that has been treated so it will allow the passage of only one sort of ion—either sodium or chloride .
Sodium and chloride ions pass out of the concentrated solution to the neighbouring weak ones by diffusion though these bridges ( any chemical will diffuse from a high to a low concentration in this way ) .
The trick is that as they do so , they make the low - concentration streams of water electrically charged .
The one that is positive , because it has too much sodium , thus draws chloride ions from the stream that is to be purified .
Meanwhile , the negative , chloride - rich stream draws in sodium ions .
The result is that the fourth stream is stripped of its ions and emerges pure and fresh .
It is a simple idea that could be built equally well on a grand scale or as rooftop units the size of refrigerators .
Of course , a lot of clever engineering is involved to make it work , but the low pressure of the pumps needed ( in contradistinction to those employed in reverse osmosis ) means the brine can be transported through plastic pipes rather than steel ones .
Since brine is corrosive to steel , that is another advantage of Mr Sparrow 's and Mr Zoshi 's technology .
Moreover , the only electricity needed is the small amount required to pump the streams of water through the apparatus .
All the rest of the energy has come free , via the air , from the sun .
A few hundred members of the ultra-Orthodox community in Jerusalem gathered near the city 's Intel plant Saturday in order to protest its operation on the Sabbath .
Police awaited them on the scene .
Op - Ed Money is n’t everything Peretz Rodman Shabbat row at Intel should prompt discourse about kind of society we want Money is n’t everything
The hundreds of protestors yelled " Shabbos " near the plant 's gates .
Eyewitnesses said security guards kept them from entering Intel 's grounds while police unsuccessfully attempted to disband the group .
Officers on horseback were subsequently alerted to the scene , and police closed off all roads leading to the area .
Haredim also yelled out derogatory terms at officers , calling them " Nazis " and " Leftists " , and spat on journalists and photographers .
A few dozen took to the rooftops of nearby factories .
At a later stage in the protest some of the demonstrators sat on the road and held hands in an attempt to keep police from evacuating them by force .
A member of Jerusalem 's city council , attorney Elisha Peleg of the Likud , criticized police for blocking the city 's main roads .
" There is no justification for preventing visitors coming to Jerusalem from passing ( on these streets ) , " he said .
" The haredim are always outraged at the seculars ' harming of the status - quo , despite the fact that they are the ones disrupting life in the city . "
Earlier Jerusalem Police arrested an ultra-Orthodox teen on suspicion that he was involved in last week 's riots and damaged Intel property .
He was taken in for questioning .
The protest was a continuation of the riots that occurred last Saturday , in which 1,500 haredim arrived at the plant and attacked journalists on the scene .
The protestors threw gravel and other objects at the journalists , but did not succeed in causing injury .
When Jerusalem 's deputy mayor , Yitzhak Pindrus of the United Torah Judaism Party , arrived at the protest grounds he was forcibly removed by the protestors , who chastised him for allowing the desecration of the Sabbath .

Trained bears are popular in Russian circuses
An ice - skating bear with a touring Russian circus has killed a circus manager and seriously injured a trainer in the Kyrgyz capital , Bishkek .
Kyrgyz officials said the bear turned on the manager , 25 - year - old Dmitry Potapov , during a rehearsal .
The bear , who had skates on at the time , severely mauled another circus worker who tried to rescue the manager .
Kyrgyz police shot and killed the bear when they arrived on the scene .
It is not clear what caused the attack .
The five - year - old bear attacked Mr Potapov , dragging him across the ice and leaving him with fatal injuries .
A 29 - year - old circus employee who tried to rescue Mr Potapov was badly injured and is in a critical condition , said Kyrgyz doctor Gulnara Tashibekova .
The director of the circus arena in Bishkek said Russian circus workers dragged the two men away from the bear and closed the arena 's exits until the police arrived .
Bears on ice are common in Russian circuses .
Some are equipped with helmets and sticks and trained to play hockey .

News reports on the Fort Hood rampage say that the alleged shooter , Maj . Nidal Hasan , used an FN Herstal Five - Seven pistol – described in some reports as a " cop killer " gun .
What , exactly , makes the Five - Seven different from other handguns ?
The Five - Seven is chambered for the 5.7 x 28 mm cartridge , ammunition originally developed by FN Herstal for the FN P90 Personal Defense Weapon .
The P90 was conceived as a compact , powerful weapon that could be carried by aircraft crews , vehicle drivers and other troops who needed a weapon that was smaller than a carbine but larger than a pistol .
The P90 – like a competing personal defense weapon design , the 4.6 mm Heckler & Koch MP7 – is supposed to pack more punch than submachine guns that fire a standard pistol rounds ( 9 mm , say , or .45 ) .
And personal defense weapons are supposed to be capable of penetrating some kinds of body armor .
As it happens , the Infantry School at Fort Benning , Georgia , has been mulling the requirements for a personal defense weapon for a few years now , although it 's far from clear the Army would procure a weapon built around a new cartridge .
I 've seen a range demo of the MP7 , and it can indeed punch through a " soft " vest or a Kevlar helmet ( whether it could penetrate SAPI plates is a different matter ) .
Gun control group
The Brady Campaign says it bought and test - fired a Five - Seven , and that it successfully penetrated a police vest .
That said , it does n't seem quite accurate to call the Five - Seven a pocket - sized assault rifle .
Its barrel would give it a lower muzzle velocity than a PN90 ; likewise , it strikes me as unlikely that it would give a shooter much more accuracy and effective range than a standard pistol .
And plain - vanilla pistol round can be devastating enough :
Think of the Virginia Tech shooter , who used a Glock 9 mm and Walther .22 .
We do n't know at this point a lot of the details : Exactly what kind of ammunition the shooter used ; how many shots in total were fired ; and at what range .
That will take a lot of police work , and a lot of patience .
Still , the tragedy at Fort Hood seems likely to renew debate : Both on gun control , and on the kinds of measures to protect troops while they are on base , and unarmed .
UPDATE : Hasan bought the gun on August 1st – less than a month after he was transferred to Ft. Hood , a law enforcement official tells Newsweek 's phenomenal new Declassified blog .
" At the same time , Hasan also bought several high capacity 20 round magazines that allowed him to rapidly fire off multiple rounds during the attack without reloading , the official said .

Doctors and officials in Fallujah are appealing to the international community for an investigation into the unnatural increase in birth defects , 5 years after two major battles between the U.S. military and Sunni militia groups took place there .
The war - ravaged population center has seen an increase of up to 15 times as many chronic deformities in infants since pre-war levels , according to a report by the UK ’s Guardian .
Documented statistics for birth defects in Fallujah have only emerged in recent months , but the rate of abormalities , including early - life cancers , is high enough to cause alarm at Fallujah ’s General Hospital .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ We are seeing a very significant increase in central nervous system anomalies , ” the hospital ’s director , Dr Ayman Qais , told the Guardian .
“ Before 2003 I was seeing sporadic numbers of deformities in babies .
Now the frequency of deformities has increased dramatically . ”
“ Most are in the head and spinal cord , but there are also many deficiencies in lower limbs , ” he said .
“ There is also a very marked increase in the number of cases of less than two years with brain tumors .
This is now a focus area of multiple tumors . ”
Fallujah was the site of the only two ‘ set - piece ’ battles to take place after the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003 .
Fighter jets bombed the city and heavy artillery was used in conjunction with the controversial incendiary white phosphorus .
Samira Abdul Ghani , a pediatrician , was asked by The Guardian to keep track of all birth defects for a three - week period at Fallujah General Hospital .
In that time alone , 37 infants were born with anomalies , many of them with neural tube defects .
A neural tube defect is an opening in the spinal cord or brain that occurs very early in human development .
1 in 1,000 babies born in America suffer from neural tube defects .

Dr. Bassam Allah , head of Fallujah ’s children ’s ward , urged international agencies last week to start taking soil samples and investigating the abnormal births .
UPI reports that Basra and Najaf , cities similarly racked by heavy fighting , have also seen sharp increases in the number of birth defects .

“ Wash your hands regularly . ” “ Cover your mouth when you sneeze . ”
“ Throw away your used tissues . ”
These are some of the exhortations currently posted around London in an attempt to reduce the spread of flu .
But one day , perhaps we ’ll have public health campaigns of a different kind .
“ Be jolly : it ’s catching . ”
Or , “ Eat less : do it for your friends . ”
Why ?
Because “ traditional ” infectious diseases — those , like flu and tuberculosis , that are caused by viruses or bacteria — are not the only aspects of health that can spread from one person to another .
Taking up smoking is contagious ; so is quitting .
Obesity is contagious .
So is happiness .
At least , these are the results coming in from long - term studies of social networks — the networks of friends and families , neighbors and colleagues that we all belong to .
Such studies have found that one person ’s change in behavior ripples through his or her friends , family and acquaintances .
If one of your friends becomes happy , for example , you ’re more likely to become happy too .
If you ’re great friends with someone who becomes obese , you ’re much more likely to become obese as well .
And the effect does n’t stop there .
If your friend ’s friend becomes happy , that increases the chance your friend will become happy — and that you will too .
Conversely , if you become obese or depressed , you may inadvertently help your friends , and your friend ’s friends , to become fat or gloomy .
( Intriguingly , happiness and obesity seem to spread in different ways .
Obesity spreads most easily between friends of the same sex who are emotionally close .
Happiness spreads most readily between friends who live near each other : a happy friend on the same block makes more difference than a happy friend three miles away . )
I should say that doing long - term studies of social networks is difficult — it means interviewing and measuring thousands of people repeatedly over many years .
After all , if I want to know whether you and your friends will change weight over the next five years , I have to measure all of you now and again in five years ’ time .
Moreover , I have to keep track of how friendships come and go , of who moves house and so on .
In short , it ’s a massive task just to collect the data .
So , while there have been plenty of studies of how pairs of people , especially spouses , affect each others ’ health , there have been far fewer studies of how health reverberates through large social networks .
The results I ’m referring to here all come from the so - called “ Framingham Heart Study , ” which began in Massachusetts in 1948 and has continued to the present day .
( Up to now , the study has involved two cohorts of several thousand people each ; a third cohort has just been enrolled . )
It ’s possible , therefore , that the results I ’m talking about are specific to this group of people .
However , I think that ’s unlikely .
The details of how an attribute spreads may differ from one group to another : perhaps in some places , friends have less influence and siblings have more .
But the general result — that healthy ( or unhealthy ) behaviors , habits and outlooks are infectious — is , I think , likely to prove robust .
But then , how does something like obesity get “ caught ” ?
That ’s not clear .
One idea is that people judge their own weight by that of their friends — you think of yourself as thin if you are thinner than the people you know — and eat accordingly .
Another is that friends mirror one another ’s eating habits .
Many studies have found that people tend to eat less when they are eating with someone who is not eating much .
Also , people tend to eat more when they eat with friends rather than with strangers .
Perhaps , too , a habit of eating , say , dessert when you are with your friends makes you more likely to eat it when you are alone .
( And happiness ?
Again , it ’s not clear how it spreads , though there are plenty of ideas .
For example , since we tend to unconsciously mimic the postures and facial expressions of those around us , perhaps we begin to take on the moods of others by adopting postures consistent with those moods .
Or perhaps talking to people who are cheerful imbues us with cheerful thoughts . )
Whatever the mechanisms , the implications are profound .
Obesity , smoking and happiness all have substantial effects on health .
Obesity is associated with a host of troubles , from diabetes to many kinds of cancer .
Happiness , meanwhile , appears to improve health .
Although this idea is still controversial , several recent studies have found that happy people tend to have more robust immune systems .
For example , in one experiment volunteers were scored for happiness then had cold viruses squirted up their noses ; those who were happier were much less likely to fall sick .
( I ’m not sure I ’d be volunteering for that experiment , regardless of my emotional state — hats off to those who did . )
In another , volunteers were vaccinated against the virus that causes hepatitis B ; several months later , the happy volunteers showed a stronger response to the vaccine than the unhappy volunteers .
The discovery that the health of one person affects the health of those around them is n’t new .
Depressed mothers , for example , have a suite of unhappy effects on their children : their children are less likely to be vaccinated , less likely to do well at school and more likely to have emotional problems of their own .
Nor is it news that social lives affect health : it ’s long been known that people with more friends tend to be healthier .
But the finding that particular attributes of health — or lack of it — can ripple through social networks shows that one person ’s health can have far reaching effects .
I draw a couple of conclusions from this .
The first is that unless you are a hermit living entirely alone , your choices and wellbeing do not affect just you .
The second , and more important , conclusion is that medicine is n’t simply about improving the health of an individual here and an individual there .
It ’s about the health of the whole society .

The Zen of Comprehensive Archive Networks
It seems that there is a lot of interest in having similar archives for other languages like CPAN [ 1 ] is for Perl .
I should know ; over the years people from at least Python , Ruby , and Java communities have approached me or other core CPAN people to ask basically " How did we do it ? " .
Very recently I 've seen even more interest from some people in the Perl community wanting to actively reach out a helping hand to other communities .
This ' missive ' tries to describe my thinking and help people wanting to build their own CANs .
Since I hope this message will somehow end up reaching the other language communities I will explicitly include URLs that are ( hopefully ) obvious to Perl people .
Note that I 'm going to describe what things worked for Perl , translate appropriately for other languages .
I 'll start negatively and end with hopefully more constructive notes , however these will build on the denials .
In the following Mumble and mumble stand for any other language than Perl or a combination of languages other than Perl .
First , the negative statements .
CPAN shall not ' piggyback ' other languages .
( In other words , there shall not be a mumble / top level directory . )
Rationale : CPAN is CPAN is CPAN .
CPAN carries Perl .
This implies all kinds of different contracts , explicit and implicit .
Some people in the Mumble community will take offense to CPAN carrying Mumble .
Some people in the Perl community will take offense to CPAN carrying Mumble .
Some CPAN mirrors will take offense to suddenly having to carry also Mumble .
Some CPAN mirrors will become resource ( bandwidth , disk ) constrained after having to suddenly carry also Mumble .
/ top level directory . )
CPAN cannot ' piggyback ' other languages .
The building blocks or ' plumbing ' of CPAN ( the basic directory structure , the PAUSE ) is a reasonably good match for Perl .
I 'm not so certain that it is for all the other languages .
Now , on to the hopefully more constructive suggestions .
First and foremost -- I 'm not against other language communities having a CPAN .
I would love to have such archives .
I 'm willing to help the other language communities .
I 'm only against too straightforward " let 's just slap it on to the side of CPAN " solutions to the problem .
Other languages are not like Perl , they are different , to a smaller or larger degree .
Let 's allow them their own degree of dignity and careful thought .
Then on to the technical questions , also known as " How did you do it ? "
Well , people always ask that from me and I go speechless ...
" Errrr , ummm , I kind of pulled all this stuff together and organized it a bit , and put it on a ftp server " .
After this a brooding silence always falls ...
" And ...? " ... " And what ? " ... " That 's it ? " " That 's it . "
Components of CPAN
Well , that 's not really it , of course .
The above is how CPAN started .
How it grew is another story .
First , Larry designed Perl to grow by letting it have modules ( in other words , namespaces ) .
Then we had a couple of wise men ( like Tim Bunce ) to have the vision of good module naming guidelines .
Finally , we had Andreas König who single - handedly wrote PAUSE [ 2 ] , the module submission machinery , where Perl module authors can register , submit , and manage their submissions .
This allowed for a rapid but still controlled growth of modules .
Installing modules can be difficult , especially if that involves having to glue in C and / or external libraries .
Andreas and other people wrote both a frontend and a backend for this : the frontend is known as the CPAN ( shell ) [ 3 ] and the backend is known as the MakeMaker [ 4 ] .
The shell ( also known as CPAN. pm ) takes care of downloading the required components , and the backend creates the required Makefiles ( or equivalent build tool control files ) and then invokes the appropriate build tools .
Incidentally , naming the module installation shell identically with the archive proved to be more than a little bit confusing : people may talk of " CPAN being broken " and you will have no idea whether they are talking of a bug in the shell , their favourite CPAN mirror being down , or whether they are objecting to some design detail of CPAN in general .
Another variant of confusion is that many people think CPAN is " just " the PAUSE , in other words , just the modules submitted by authors using the PAUSE interface .
While not wrong ( the overwhelming majority of CPAN content does indeed come from PAUSE ) , this is not exactly right , either .
Firstly , CPAN does have other sources than just PAUSE : there are a couple of small sites CPAN merges into itself , and some files ( like some rarer binary distributions of Perl ) are still fetched manually ( since they change infrequently ) .
Secondly , there is the ports page that lists binary distributions for Perl , some in CPAN , most hyperlinked from elsewhere .
An essential feature for ( half ) automated installation tools is easy extraction of module dependencies .
Easy documentation extraction allows for easy online documentation browsing , which in turn makes it easier for people to decide whether they want to use a module , and when they use it , to use it better .
Since the CPAN shell is starting to show signs of its age and because it does n't have a good programmable API , a new project called CPANPLUS [ 5 ] has been started .
It will hopefully be a drop - in replacement for the old trusty CPAN shell , but also allow greater flexibility and extensibility .
Similarly , there is a replacement project for MakeMaker , Module : : Build [ 6 ] .
Note that CPAN.pm and MakeMaker come with every Perl distribution , but it is possible to write alternative module installation interfaces : ActiveState has their own interface called ppm ( Programmer 's package manager , originally known as Perl package manager ) for their ActivePerl distribution .
Because of the growth of CPAN , it finally became too arduous to know what was out there , and luckily Graham Barr 's scratch to this itch become large enough to be published as search.cpan.org [ 7 ] .
There are also alternative search engines for CPAN , Randy Kobes ' search [ 8 ] and WAIT [ 9 ] , but the search .cpan.org seems to be the most popular .
Later backPAN [ 10 ] was added by Andreas to hold all the old versions of submissions deleted by their authors ; this ties back into simple basic things that the core server (s ) must have , like good backups .
The cpan-testers is a mailing list ( started by Graham Barr and Chris Nandor ) whose subscribers download recent module uploads and try running the regression suites , and report back the success or failure to a mailing lists which gets databased , and of course back to the original author .
This has proved to be invaluable in making the modules more portable between operating system platforms and different releases and configuration of those platforms .
Also important to notice is that having regression test suites coming with the modules is essential -- how else can you know whether the code works at all ?
Last but not least , module feedback ( bug reports , enhancement requests , or praise ) for the modules can given through the RT ticketing system [ 12 ] set up by Jesse Vincent .
Mirrors
CPAN mirrors [ 13 ] , then ?
How did they come about ?
The original ones , dozen or so , were easy : I just asked the maintainers of the original ftp sites I had found the seeds of CPAN from whether they might be interested in carrying this slightly bigger amalgamated Perl archive .
Well , they foolishly agreed ...
I have to remind people once again that CPAN was conceived as a FTP archive .
Not a website .
And it still is that way .
search.cpan.org just gives a nice interface .
I 'm sorry but I 'm a dry CS engineer , not a graphic designer .
Information , not animation .
Oh , back to the CPAN mirrors .
After the original ones , we grew slowly for a while , by word of mouth in the Perl community .
However , since this was the time before the billions dollars worth fiber dug into the ground , Internet connections were still a bit dodgy and spotty .
Therefore I started doing two things : scanning ftp logs for sites that obviously were mirroring CPAN but were not registered mirrors , and sites that were good representatives for their particular top level domain , especially outside the big seven TLD .
This way I could track down where Perl was used and by asking those sites to participate to push back the load from the master site .
Later I also filled in missing countries by going for sites like the sunsites , and other vendor / public funded sites that had a good chance of having good connectivity .
Usually I could find a sympathetic soul , oftentimes a system administrator .
The status of the CPAN mirrors is monitored four times a day , from two different machines in two different continents .
A stale mirror is almost worthless , sometimes even dangerous .
Note also that as the number of mirrors grows , do n't expect to be able to check all of them at each scan : there are always some network or server problems that will stop you from getting all the status information .
Getting the full status of all the files on all the mirrors is a fantasy unless the mirrors themselves run integrity checks .
CPAN relies on a very simple trick : the CPAN master site updates a certain file once every hour , embedding a ( UTC ) timestamp in that file .
By downloading that file from a mirror and extracting the timestamp we can trivially see when did they last update .
Summary of the mirror tirade : I went for sites that liked and / or used Perl .
I have no way of knowing off - hand whether they would like Mumble .
The mirrors are donating their network and storage capacity and some amount of their administrative time for the Perl community .
If we would like to extend that in any way we would have to ask them , from all of them individually .
You can learn more about CPAN 's history from the Perl timeline [ 14 ] .
Things did n't happen overnight .
Naming
A quite important thing for both the authors and the users is that the language must get the naming scheme of its modules right , or at least reasonably close .
Perl 's / CPAN's is far from perfect , but at least it was once designed , and it has been enhanced over the years as new needs have appeared .
A good naming scheme allows hierarchical browsing , gives good hints for search engines ( a good name is effectively a string of uniquely identifying keywords ) , and coordinates community efforts .
Some sort of conflict resolution mechanism in case of competing and identically named implementations is important .
Keeping all those guidelines well documented and all these processes public is important .
One naming issue I think Perl 5 got wrong is that module namespaces are first - come - first - served , two or more different authors cannot have an identically named module .
This may lead into unintentional or intentional namespace squatting , and some overly heated exchange , none of which is not good for the community .
When designing your author / module / whatever hierarchy think scalability .
We originally got it wrong in one spot by having all authors as subdirectories in one single directory which quickly became a bottleneck .
( The solution to this was simply to ' hash ' based on the leading two characters of the user ids . )
Think also several different views to your data : by author , by module , by category , by date , by keywords , and so forth .
Do n't think only hierarchical views will be enough : you will need searching capabilities .
Licensing
Get your license policy clear from day one .
No , day minus one .
In this day and age it is very important that every piece of software gets clearly marked as to what license it carries .
Build your module packaging tools so that they suggest , maybe even demand that the author picks a license .
This way both the users of modules and distributors of software wanting to include the module do n't have to keep guessing .
Very much related to the licensing is of course commercial use : CPAN took the easy and clear policy of no commercial software of any kind , not even share / guilt / donateware would be allowed .
We felt that any other policy would be open to nitpicking , or maybe even legal challenges , and as a volunteer group we do not have time or other resources for any of that .
Keep Things Safe
That the servers hosting the archive core services should be paranoidically maintained and monitored for security goes without saying , but I 'm saying it anyway .
Should you have PGP / GPG keys and triply - written - in - blood signatures ?
Maybe .
Currently CPAN has only MD5 checksums -- but so far they have been enough .
Then again , given the recent rise in Trojan attacks against various pieces of open / free software a greater level of trust may be needed .
There are ongoing projects that enable using PGP / GPG keys for verifying the origin of the software ; but as always with PKI systems , bootstrapping the web of trust is hard , some say even not worth the trouble .
Where should you store the public keys ?
Obviously not in the same place as the module distributions themselves .
Which public key servers would you trust ?
One lightweight way to do without PKI would be simply to distribute the original checksums to enough places so that an attacker could n't feasibly modify all the copies .
But at some point you would be very probably trusting DNS , anyway .
Keep Things Open
Code quality ?
Ratings / reviews ?
Moderation / metamoderation ?
" Approved " SDKs ?
These all are hotly debated subjects and will not be addressed here since the CPAN is and will stay an open and free forum , where the authors decide what they upload .
Any further selection belongs to different fora .
Besides , adding any rating or approval processes creates bottlenecks , and bottlenecks are bad .
Be mindful of other platforms than Intel Linux and Windows .
There 's no need to alienate people of rarer tastes .
One day they will help you .
Make your archive accessible via several means .
Do n't stop at just HTTP : think FTP and rsync , too .
On the other hand , do get the basic protocols right first -- do n't jump off the deep end and try to create an all - singing all - dancing web service , or whatever is currently fashionable .
This ties back to being platform agnostic : try to package your modules so that the maximum number of people can install it .
CPAN Scriptorium
The scripts that maintain the CPAN are dreadfully simple .
They are just simple shell scripts that copy sites A , B , ... , Z to the CPAN master site at ftp. funet. fi , launched from cron .
Many of them use Ye Olde Original mirror [ 15 ] , some of them are just rsync [ 16 ] .
No magic .
I really do n't have anything to give away , no magic bags full of powerful CPAN spells .
The most complex script in the CPAN master site is the script [ 17 ] that probes the mirror sites for uptodateness -- and even that is not rocket science , just multiplexing ftp and http downloads and comparing timestamps .
Andreas has the webserver code for PAUSE available online [ 18 ] .
That code is slightly more complex than the core CPAN scripts , or the scripts supporting the PAUSE ; but even here , the code is there .
Again , no tricks up our sleeves .
Conclusions
There is no magic .
All it takes is a few people that sit down and get first something running , a rough cut .
Then iteratively enhance it .
Do n't try to create a master plan that will get everything right in one fell swoop .
The only one that will get swooped is you .
One way to summarize most of the above is the priceless KISS principle -- Keep It Simple , Stupid .
Avoid too complex setups .
Start simple .
Another important credo is : Avoid bottlenecks and interdependencies .
Decentralize .
Create and encourage alternatives .
For example , the most popular search engine of CPAN is n't actually part of CPAN proper : search.cpan.org just mirrors CPAN and from the data builds the search indices and searching / browsing interfaces .
That 's way there can be several seach engines of the same CPAN .
Similarly , currently we use CPAN.pm +
MakeMaker to install modules : but we are not committed to either , and the community is working on replacements .
Keep things loosely connected .
This allows for different people to work on their own enhancements without disturbing the other parts .
Perhaps the most demanding thing is commitment : someone must keep things running .
A slowly decaying and dusty archive is almost worse ( and certainly more sad ) than no archive at all .
Oook and out .

An organization called Farm Sanctuary delivered the turkeys to Ms. Lane and Ms. Oeh .
The group , dedicated to scooping up commercial farm animals raised in dirty , crowded conditions , began placing turkeys in friendly homes soon after its founding , in 1986 .
A growing number of other animal rights groups are now in the adoption business as well .
This holiday season , Farm Sanctuary , which tends to its animals on land in upstate New York and Northern California and has a $ 5.7 million budget , has 38 turkeys waiting to be adopted , said Tricia Barry , the sanctuary ’s communications director .
From 25 to 50 turkeys a year are placed with adoptive families , said Lorri Bauston , who helped start Farm Sanctuary and now runs her own farm shelter called Animal Acres , a 45 - minute drive from downtown Hollywood .
Ms. Bauston has five grown turkeys at the moment .
Representative Dennis J. Kucinich , the Democratic presidential candidate and vegan , showed up last week and fed them stuffed squash , cranberries and pumpkin pie .
Ms. Bauston ’s birds are all too old for adoption , but when she gets a suitable one , it will go to the actress Daryl Hannah , who is making her property in Malibu poultry - ready .
Not just anyone can adopt a turkey .
There are site visits and income reviews .
Sheds must be built , and veterinarians secured .
And then there is the deal - breaker : the family must be vegetarian .
Most of the 30 farm - animal shelters that have popped up in recent years get turkeys from law enforcement agencies , from animal welfare societies and from ranchers or processors with sick or injured birds .
Some just show up under the cover of night , their origins unknown .
Not all of them place their birds for adoption .
The turkeys adopted by the couple near Santa Cruz came from a Northwest plane that was carrying several thousand baby turkeys , called poults , from a breeder in Canada to a rancher in California this July .
The plane was delayed for hours in Las Vegas .
Many poults died , whether of the heat or suffocation , but some were saved by animal rights activists .
PORTLAND , Oregon ( Reuters ) - The United States ’ first marijuana cafe opened on Friday , posing an early test of the Obama administration ’s move to relax policing of medical use of the drug .
The Cannabis Cafe in Portland , Oregon , is the first to give certified medical marijuana users a place to get hold of the drug and smoke it -- as long as they are out of public view -- despite a federal ban .
“ This club represents personal freedom , finally , for our members , ” said Madeline Martinez , Oregon ’s executive director of NORML , a group pushing for marijuana legalization .
“ Our plans go beyond serving food and marijuana , ” said Martinez .
“ We hope to have classes , seminars , even a Cannabis Community College , based here to help people learn about growing and other uses for cannabis . ”
The cafe -- in a two - story building which formerly housed a speak - easy and adult erotic club Rumpspankers -- is technically a private club , but is open to any Oregon residents who are NORML members and hold an official medical marijuana card .
Members pay $ 25 per month to use the 100 - person capacity cafe .
They do n’t buy marijuana , but get it free over the counter from “ budtenders ” .
Open 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. , it serves food but has no liquor license .
There are about 21,000 patients registered to use marijuana for medical purposes in Oregon .
Doctors have prescribed marijuana for a host of illnesses , including Alzheimer ’s , diabetes , multiple sclerosis and Tourette ’s syndrome .
On opening day , reporters invited to the cafe could smell , but were not allowed to see , people smoking marijuana .
“ I still run a coffee shop and events venue , just like I did before we converted it to the Cannabis Cafe , but now it will be cannabis - themed , ” said Eric Solomon , the owner of the cafe , who is looking forward to holding marijuana - themed weddings , film festivals and dances in the second - floor ballroom .
NO PROSECUTION
The creation of the cafe comes almost a month after the Obama administration told federal attorneys not to prosecute patients who use marijuana for medical reasons or dispensaries in states which have legalized them .
About a dozen states , including Oregon , followed California ’s 1996 move to adopt medical marijuana laws , allowing the drug to be cultivated and sold for medical use .
A similar number have pending legislation or ballot measures planned .
Pot cafes , known as “ coffee shops ” , are popular in the Dutch city of Amsterdam , where possession of small amounts of marijuana is legal .
Portland ’s Cannabis Cafe is the first of its kind to open in the United States , according to NORML .
Growing , possessing , distributing and smoking marijuana are still illegal under U.S. federal law , which makes no distinction between medical and recreational use .
Federal and local law enforcement agencies did not return phone calls from Reuters on Friday seeking comment on the Portland cafe ’s operations .
“ To have a place that is this open about its activities , where people can come together and smoke -- I say that ’s pretty amazing . ” said Tim Pate , a longtime NORML member , at the cafe .
Some locals are hoping it might even be good for business .
“ I know some neighbors are pretty negative about this place opening up , ” said David Bell , who works at a boutique that shares space with the cafe .
“ But I ’m withholding judgment .
There ’s no precedent for it .
We do n’t know what to expect .
But it would great if it brought some customers into our store . ”
Six years ago , our own Andrew Lim predicted how mobile phones would shape the future of tech and kill off beloved gadgetry such as the humble MP3 Player .
Some of his predictions were pretty safe bets , but some were rather bold .
So , how did our predictions fare and what fresh predictions do we have for 2015 ?
The history of mobile phone technology reads a lot like the plot from Highlander :
An army of standalone devices have been killed off one by one and their powers absorbed into a single , increasingly complex gadget ; the smartphone that sits proudly in your pocket or bag .
In 2009 , we predicted that the following devices would meet a grisly end thanks to the smartphone .
Phone boxes
Back in the day , when mobile phones were the size of a tank and just as expensive , we had to call each other from smelly , claustrophobic street coffins that doubled as tramp toilets .
The modern phone box offered a variety of new services including web access , but despite trying its best to adapt to the times , smartphones have made that bright red monument to yesteryear completely obsolete , just shy of its 100th birthday .
Well , not completely .
Phone boxes still work well as prostitute advertisement boards and tourist selfie magnets .
Wristwatches
Well , a strange one , this .
Mobile phones may have helped to decrease the popularity of old fashioned wrist watches , thanks to their ability to tell the time as well as make phone calls , but now smartphones are helping to update and repopularise watches as all - new connected devices .
The likes of the Apple Watch , Samsung Gear S2 and modular smartwatch Blocks can deliver notifications to your wrist , so you do n’t have to constantly yank your phone from your pocket .
It ’s a beautiful example of a symbiotic relationship .
Guess we got that one wrong , then .
Bedside alarm clocks
It ’s unlikely that mobile phone manufacturers realised back in the day how successful the alarm clock feature would be .
Now everyone we know uses their smartphone as a wake - up device , with thousands of apps dedicated to stirring you from sleep in the least horrific way possible .
And of course physical radios are pretty much a thing of the past , as you can simply stream your favourite station on any mobile device to any Bluetooth speaker .
I believe that ’s a victory .
MP3 players
Remember when we had to lug around an MP3 Player to listen to tunes ?
I do , mostly because my first MP3 Player was the size and weight of a house brick and could carry a mighty 100 songs .
Oh , the fun of trying to work out which five or six albums out of your entire collection to burn onto it .
Apple is still pimping its iPods of course , but they ’re no longer mere MP3 players .
Now they stream video and play games and do everything a phone does except make calls , pretty much .
So we ’re counting this as another win .
Landline home phones
Everyone still has a landline connection in their homes , but it ’s basically just used for web access .
Do you know anyone under 30 who actually has a landline phone ?
If you do , stop being friends with them .
They probably wear corduroys and have enormous beards and listen to Mumford & Sons .
Compact digital cameras
Camera smartphones have now reached the point where you can shoot beautiful vistas and blow them up to A2 size and frame them on your wall .
With the likes of the Xperia Z5 packing a 23 - megapixel beast and Samsung ’s glorious 16 - megapixel snapper on the Galaxy S6 , both of which are capable of shooting up to 4 K video with image stabilisation , there ’s little need to cart around a separate camera too .
Of course , shooting video with an iPad is still the work of Satan .

Netbooks
When was the last time you saw ( or God forbid , used ) one of these miniature , crappy laptops ?
The RSI - encouraging plastic slabs were all the rage six or seven years ago , but now you can comfortably browse the web and edit documents on your phone or tablet , which is about a hundred times better .
Get in the sea , wretched netbook tech .
Handheld games consoles
Mobile gaming is super popular across iOS and Android devices , and finally catching up on Windows devices too .
However , the Nintendo 3DS is still alive and kicking , revamped in 2015 with an updated model , so the handheld games console has n’t been completely wiped out by your trusty mobile just yet .
In fact , the likes of the Xperia Play proved that mobile devices that try to emulate handheld consoles are generally about as much fun as gonorrhoea .
Still , we ca n’t see Nintendo putting out a new handheld device after the 3DS has run its course , with the Japanese giant finally ( and reluctantly ) turning its head to mobile platforms instead .
After all , why pay £ 30 for a game when you can grab one off the App Store for a couple of quid , with superb graphics and gameplay ?

Paper
Perhaps this prediction was a little bold .
Phones and mobile devices are a great way to ingest information and we ’re still pretty sure that paper newspapers and newspapers will be a rare and dying breed in a decade .
But physical books will stick around much longer and it ’s a sad world that completely replaces paper with digital screens .
Thinking
Whether it ’s using GPS to figure out where you are or instantly looking something up on your mobile ’s web browser , life is definitely a lot less effort than it used to be .
And judging by the volume of muppets we have to dodge on the street everyday , staring slack - jawed at their phone screens instead of where they ’re walking , we ’d say that mobile phones have successfully lowered the average IQ by a solid 20 - 30 points already .
So , do we have any fresh predictions for the next six years ?
Sure we do !
Here ’s what we think smartphones will make obsolete by 2021 and things that it should make obsolete but probably wo n’t .
Debit cards and cash
No , debit cards and cold , hard cash wo n’t be a thing of the past any time soon , but we expect a large portion of the population ( mostly younger people ) to ditch the debit and rely on their phones to pay for goods and services .
With fingerprint verification , it ’s a secure and convenient means of payment that allows you to leave your wallet at home .
Remote controls
Sadly few smartphones come with a built - in IR blaster , which is a massive shame because mobiles are the perfect remote control .
After all , you have them on you pretty much all the time and they can be quickly found when lost just by ringing them .
Still , as household devices become connected with built - in WiFi , we wo n’t even need an IR blaster to control everything in our house , so in th next decade or so we should see a lot less tech come bundled with their own individual remotes .
Got your own predictions of stuff that mobile phones will make obsolete ?
Let us know in the comments below .
A rainbow is an optical and meteorological phenomenon that causes a spectrum of light to appear in the sky when the Sun shines onto droplets of moisture in the Earth ’s atmosphere .
They take the form of a multicoloured arc , with red on the outer part of the arch and violet on the inner section of the arch .
Rainbow is everywhere , you can see it in many different places .
We have collected the following 30 Colourful and Peaceful Rainbow Photos .
Hope the rainbow photos can make you happy and put a smile on your face .

What a difference a win can have on a fighter , particularly one as emotionally charged as Forrest Griffin .
The jaded , world - weary version of Griffin that emerged after Anderson Silva humbled him at UFC 101 surprised many fans who were used to seeing a completely different side to the star .
He left them in no doubt that he had taken the defeat very personally and that it had left a serious dent in his self - confidence and general outlook on life .
One man who knew how to get the fighter out of his depression was UFC president Dana White .
“ When these guys lose , you gotta get back on the horse .
Especially Forrest .
Forrest is a real emotional guy , and he did n’t take that loss easily .
He was n’t Forrest after that fight , and I think it ’s better to jump right back in there and fight again rather than sit around and commiserate until you fight again , ” White told reporters ahead of his next fight some three and a half months later .
He would prove to be right .
After Griffin avenged an old loss to former champion Tito Ortiz in the main event of last weekend ’s UFC 106 event , the relief and renewed confidence gained from getting back to winning ways was plain for all to see .
How long that lasts may very well depend on how long he can maintain his winning form , but for the mean time it appears that a demon had been exorcised and the old Forrest Griffin is back .
Do n’t take my word for it though .
Watch the first interview Griffin gave after his loss to Silva at UFC 101 below , and then contrast it with a new interview , again with Dave Farra for mma30.com , on the night of his victory at UFC 106 .

Was anywhere heading for a fall so obviously as Dubai ?
Yet why did no one ever scream ?
Why did everyone just marvel ?
When I first visited the place three years ago , it was already the most dangerous speculative bubble on earth .
Breakneck building – using reputedly a quarter of the world 's cranes – was sustained on hysterical public relations and $ 80 bn of debt .
By last March the signs of impending doom were everywhere .
Property and stock market prices were falling and only the PR firms were still sustaining morale , witness a cringing ITV documentary by Piers Morgan and grovelling coverage of Sol Kerzner 's " world 's biggest " hotel launch .
Building projects worth a reported $ 300 bn were stopping work overnight .
Yet anyone who wrote a word of the impending doom was excoriated .
The Guardian was subjected to a campaign of abusive emails when I reflected on the clear parallel with Shelley 's Ozymandias and his trunkless legs of stone : " Look on my works , ye mighty , and despair . "
What had I against Dubai , they complained .
Why could I not recognise the future in Dubai 's glorious confidence and its open welcome to the world ?
The enclave 's dictator , Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al - Maktoum , told critics simply : " Shut up . "
I still have no doubt that Dubai will survive , despite its lack of oil or other natural resources .
But it will do so as a benighted settlement on the Gulf shore , in hock to neighbouring and more cautious oil - rich states , such as Abu Dhabi .
Its luxury apartments will become tenements to an ever shifting army of refugees from the torments of the Islamic world .
Its towers will stand empty , unable to afford their energy - guzzling services .
Its fantasy islands will be squatted or will rot and sink back into the sea .
Where fresh water will come from , who knows ?
But before the desert sands close over it , Dubai 's lesson should be learned .
It is the oldest in the book .
Like the credit crunch in the west , the short route to folly is the belief that what goes up need never come down and there is no such thing as bad money .
The parastatal corporation Dubai World has a staggering $ 60 bn in liabilities .
This is reputedly at risk , along with investments in a multitude of British and American companies , from ports and property to Turnberry golf course , Alton Towers and Travelodge .
The moral is , do n't believe public relations when it flies in the face of history .
Do n't believe those who say their credit is secure against nothing more solid than a villa bought off - plan by a few Hollywood celebrities .
Above all , do n't believe the financial press , which did more than anything to boost the self - delusion and architectural bombast of the Dubai authorities .
They were fooling you as well as themselves .
Tony Blair will be called to give evidence early next year Former Prime Minister Tony Blair is to be called to give evidence to the Iraq War inquiry early next year .
He will be among senior Labour figures to be publicly grilled just months ahead of an expected general election .
Mr Blair and the others may be quizzed again in more detail , but that will not happen until after the election , which must take place by June .
Inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot has said his report will be published at the end of next year , or even 2011 .
In a statement , Sir John said the first five weeks of public evidence sessions , which will begin on 24 November , will hear from senior officials and military officers .
" We will ask them to explain the main decisions and tasks , and their involvement , " he said .
" That will give us a clear understanding of how policy developed and was implemented , and what consideration was given to alternative approaches . "
' Face - to - face ' Ministers , including Mr Blair , will be called in January and early February .
It is not for us to make findings of guilt or innocence - only a court can do that
Sir John Chilcot
The parents of soldiers killed in Iraq have already warned that they intend to confront Mr Blair at the hearings .
At a pre-hearing last month , Rose Gentle , whose son Gordon was among the soldiers killed in the war , said the families wanted to be " face - to - face " with the former prime minister .
The first round of public hearings will be followed by private meetings and analysis before a further round of public sessions in mid-2010 .
" In some cases , those hearings will be used to invite witnesses to discuss issues in more detail than in earlier evidence , or to pursue further lines of inquiry , " Sir John said .
He added that the inquiry would seek first - hand accounts on the " thematic issues " that need addressing during its initial phase .
These issues would include equipment , personnel , the " key decisions taken and their rationale " , the legal basis for military action , policy and communication , said Sir John .
' Open as possible '
He said the committee would be " thorough , rigorous , fair and frank " , but added that " no - one is on trial " .
" It is not for us to make findings of guilt or innocence - only a court can do that , " he said .
" I have , however , made clear that we will not shy away in our report from making criticisms - of individuals or systems - where that is warranted . "
When he launched the inquiry he said it would be " as open as possible " with hearings televised and streamed online .
But he said some hearings would be held in private for national security reasons or to allow " more candour " .
He has said he does not expect anyone to refuse a request to give evidence .
The inquiry will cover the entire eight - year period from the build - up to the war to the withdrawal of British troops - from the summer of 2001 to the end of July 2009 .

Every now and then I get an email from a reader .
Confused , probably a newbie regarding survival and preparedness .
“ Is it that bad down there ? ” “ Why do you need a gun , if there ’s still police ? ” “ How come you have internet , if SHTF ? ”
I ’ve answered some those questions before , but yesterday after the recession post ( linked here ) I believe people will understand better .
Unfortunately it will become more and more clear as time goes by .
Please do take the time to watch the video , its worth it .
I know , its NY , one of the most spoiled cities in the world , but some of the stories are so similar .
The man that lost his job as a construction manager , a well paid job , and was now driving people around to put food on the table , that ’s something we saw spread in 2000 and I ’ve commented before .
People , I know its impossible for you to see the similarity because you did n’t live it , but it ’s there .
It ’s so familiar , the only difference is the language .
That man , the one driving people to the airport for a living , he ’s an American “ remisero ” .
Those of you that read my book or have been following my blog for a while know what that is .
Just what the man on the video describes , an improvised driver , a poor version of a taxi .
You know what ?
It does n’t take a genius to figure out it will become a more popular way to make money ( even if just a little money ) as things get worse .
One of the worse paying jobs , with the highest suicide rates , a remisero is usually the person that , in spite of his skills ( or even lacking them ) , he simply has nothing else .
Remiseros are now part of our culture , its sad to think that it may become a part of USA as well .
Want to do this in stages ?
OK , lets call this stage B ) of the crisis .
On stage A ) people ca n’t deny any more there ’s a crisis , they lose their jobs , which was a big surprise .
Then the neighbor and the brother , and the guy across the street .
More and more people lose their jobs .
But its ok , is n’t it ?
Only bums are unemployed .
Because a hard worker , with skills , experience and college graduate , that kind of people always find jobs … .
Right ?
Stage B : That ’s today .
That ’s the video .
Surprise , surprise , in spite of the skill , right attitude and fervently hunting for jobs , there ’s simply no jobs to be found !
People start digging into their savings or getting worse into debt .
It ’s a moment where people finally get it .
Things have changed .
You can now go months , even years without finding a job … so you just apply for anything , desperate to make a buck .
And for now that works …
Stage C : There ’s no more “ help wanted ” signs .
Not even crappy jobs .
Its hard even for the remisero types , there ’s so many of them now .
This is all old news for us , this was us in 2002 , 20003 .
People still get fired and it ’s worse for the +40 guys .
Educated , hard workers , with decades worth of managing experience , but they are not wanted any more , they are too expensive to have around , and why keep them around for other jobs when you can get rid of them and hire a kid in his early 20 ’s to do the same job ?
There no need for that type of guy any more .
Just one boss now , and lots of 20 year olds working on minimum wage .
That ’s the recession plan to keep business afloat .
No BS here folks , never that .
I ’ve had people as old as my father , almost getting on their knees begging for a job .
A job I did n’t have to offer because my own situation was n’t much better .
“ Your family moved to Spain .
Maybe there ’s a job there .
Anything , just anything .
Driving a truck , cleaning , I ’ll do anything at all ” .
It was sad and embarrassing to see the father of a friend to that .
A man that a year ago had an executive position in a factory .
Stage D : Crime .
All this brings the real danger , what you sure noticed worries me the most .
Crime , everywhere and in every possible way .
The bastards get more creative , more violent and why would they not .
There ’s no jobs anyway , things have changed , people are desperate and police can hardly keep up .
Its easy when there ’s a murder in town .
But when there ’s a dozen every week , there ’s not enough manpower to investigate them all .
And remember there ’s a crisis , no budget for more officers .
While some get up every morning thinking of how to make money and make a honest living , others start their day planning how to rob , how to kidnap or scam people .
Kidnappings started , something we ’ve never seen in Argentina before , armed robberies , bank robberies , asphalt pirates , pro- home invaders , taking several houses at the same time .
By now people realize quickly that the crime problem is serious .
Unlike the unemployment thing , a corpse on the sidewalk causes a much greater impression than a bunch of guys looking for a job .
Remember what happened with unemployment ?
First the neighbor , then that cousin of yours … then you ?
Same happens here .
“ Jimmy got mugged ” “ They broke into the Williams home , they raped the women and beat them all up ” “ They killed Kevin ” .
It starts getting closer and closer until you feel it too close .
Your family could be next .
You finally see the importance of caring about your security and self defense .
Its no longer something you fantasize about , watch in movies or throw theories on the internet forums .
You do it , and you comment with others what has happened to you .
Its no longer about having a molle vest that matches the digital cammo pattern of your tactical holster …
Stage E : Crime is already something you got used to .
It sucks , its stressful , and you want out , but its part of life and as we say here , every morning you know you ’re going out , but you do n’t know if you ’re coming back .
Jobs ?
The old social pyramid is no more .
Those people from stage A and B ?
Either they found a way or they did n’t .
If they did n’t they are now either poor or homeless .
That ’s the way it is .
And yet the world does not end , you know ?
Others adapted and managed , most accepted their new poor condition as the social pyramid turned into an iceberg :
A lot of people underwater and a small amount on the stop , doing well , maybe even better than before .
But that nice fat middle - class ?
No more .
Jobs , crime , and now their going for your freedom .
You see , people want things fixed .
The conditions are barely tolerable .
No one wants to be poor , no one wants to see their kids getting killed on the streets , there ’s got to be a solution , and the politicians are quick to offer it , unless you have a problem with giving up some of that freedom of yours …
No secret cameras in you bathroom or microchips under the skin .
No , none of that .
Just vote the right guy , vote the right legislators , and let them take care of things .
They need your approval , nothing more …
And one day you wake up and are ruled by a very nice man that the majority voted .
He ’s got more power than any previous president in history .
Supposedly there was no other way out of the mess , but it turns out that they are repeating the same mistakes that landed you there in the first place .
The thirst for power grows , nothing gets solved , and its hard to see light at the end of the tunnel .
What do people in Venezuela feel , when they watch on TV their president telling them that they have 3 minutes maximum to take a shower and they should use flashlights at night when getting up to go to the bathroom ?
Does it get to such a ridiculous point where even that feels normal ?
The stages are just something to organize the chain of events .
They sometimes overlapped each other , some were longer than others , but that ’s what happened here .
Unfortunately it seems USA is following a similar pattern .
There ’s differences of course , but its foolish not to see some of the similarities , blinded by pride and shame , when realizing there are indeed some similarities with a 3rd world country .

Even as Mr. Geithner , in prepared congressional testimony , claims that the economy is " recovering " , the MBA announced yet another record number of mortgage delinquencies .
At over 14 % , the number of American homeowners either in delinquency or in foreclosure was an all - time record in September , representing a ninth straight quarterly increase .
According to the AP : " The Mortgage Bankers Association 's quarterly report adds to fears that the housing market 's recovery could be thwarted by the continuing surge in home loan defaults , especially as the unemployment rate keeps rising .
Lost jobs , rather than the shady loans made during the housing boom , are now the main reason homeowners fall into default . "
Our hope is that maybe Mr. Geithner will also testify also as to what particular brand of Kool - Aid he drinks when he makes such baseless and irresponsible statements .
The biggest looming threat - heretofore considered safe Prime loans : " Prime fixed - rate loans continue to represent the largest share of foreclosures started and the biggest driver of the increase in foreclosures .
33 percent of foreclosures started in the third quarter were on prime fixed - rate and loans and those loans were 44 percent of the quarterly increase in foreclosures .
The foreclosure numbers for prime fixed - rate loans will get worse because those loans represented 54 percent of the quarterly increase in loans 90 days or more past due but not yet in foreclosure . "

God of War and Calling All Cars designer David Jaffe recently spoke out the Game Connect : Asia Pacific conference , giving his views on the recent Austrailian ratings board drama surrounding its recent censorship actions against Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 , Left 4 Dead 2 , and Aliens vs. Predator .
“ There ’s a government board and if they say it ’s too offensive , in that case there ’s no fight to fight — it is what it is , ” said Jaffe .
“ There ’s not much you can do if you ’re making games aimed at a mature audience .

On the mainstream media ’s perception of the industry and video games as a whole , a change in topic he later emphasized in his Youtube video blog , “ There ’s absolutely an inconsistency in the consciousness about video games , ” he added .
“ The reality is people still see a lot of these things as kids ’ toys .
It ’s utter BS . ”
When my partner tells those unfamiliar with Christian evangelicals about his Pentecostal upbringing , his pat description is “ everything but the snakes . ”
This glib remark does n’t begin to penetrate the depths of a fundamentalist upbringing , but it does open the door to the slew of questions that inevitably follow :
Have you ever spoken in tongues ?
( Only when it quickened my family ’s going to Shoney ’s for breakfast after church . )
Were you allowed to date ?
( Only when the girls were n’t already dating Jesus . )
This type of interrogation usually happens at a party after everyone ’s tossed back a few and the conversation turns more intimate .
After all , what is more intimate than asking someone to talk about their breakup with God ?
Not That Kind of Girl is a coming of age story that centers on the gradual fading of Carlene Bauer ’s love affair with the Lord .
Though she claims a particular type of fundamentalism , if I were to rank Bauer ’s fundamentalist upbringing on an extremity scale of 1 to 10 , I ’d likely score it smack dab in the middle .
Her non-denominational church was certainly evangelical , putting forth the belief that one must sublimate one ’s time , talents , and resources on a ubiquitous quest to , as Saint Paul instructed , die to self .
Bauer ’s childhood spiritual guides did their part to fill her with rapture anxiety by screening A Thief in the Night , and her Sunday school instructor effectively scared the children with stories of casting Satan from the foot of her bed with an exorcistic command .
But there were no faith healings , no instance of being banned from watching The Smurfs or listening to The Beatles , and no epileptic episodes of being filled with the Holy Spirit .
Those expecting the same kind of humorous yet unsettling look into the lives of America ’s evangelical youth as presented in the recent films Hell House and Jesus Camp will instead be met by a floridly written memoir filled with persistent references to indie musicians , literary luminaries , and German philosophers .
While the tale does not evoke with the same wonder and bewilderment of these documentaries , it does give an honest portrait of one young woman ’s losing battle to maintain her faith in God while living with human needs and desires .
I found myself chuckling at Bauer ’s references to the evangelical tendency toward selective amnesia and inept approximations of mainstream rock bands .
She adeptly describes these communities in ways that will immediately be picked up by the sufficiently attuned ear :
I stood with everyone else but did n’t sing , and got light - headed from all the sincerity …
Now there was no antidote to the stock phrases I had been hearing over the years that had begun to pain me whenever they were uttered …
It sounded like effeminate earnestness , even when men spoke .
It was a lingo .
People picked up the phrases and passed them around like a contagion , which meant that they were perfectly happy to use what was lying about and say what everyone else was saying .
There was no reflection on this habit , no idea that God deserved better than clichés .
Saving Herself
Bauer ’s two main struggles are with her need for perfection and with the persistent feeling of being out of place in every scene ; both are common afflictions for those who have been indoctrinated with the belief that one must fit into the sinless “ good Christian ” mold in order to be snatched up by God at the End of Days .
The result of such indoctrination is that Bauer makes impossible demands of herself .
She seeks infallibility from God , her partner , and her friends , and is disappointed to continually discover all are rife with flaw and contradiction ; that there is no “ right ” way to be a Christian or a writer ( Bauer ’s other passion ) , a sentiment that goes against her rigid upbringing .
I found myself wondering if Bauer could have maintained her childhood faith if those to whom she went for guidance had n’t been so inflexible .
Instead she turned to the Bible for answers , and as my partner once informed me , the worst way to persuade someone to maintain their Christianity is to encourage them to read the Bible — a thorough reading will only reveal more of the religion ’s inconsistencies .
To read the Bible is to discover the incongruous humanity in the religion .
To read the Bible demands one confront the fact that faith cannot be empirically gained , a slippery slope to agnosticism for evidentiary types .
Bauer presents a collection of life - changing relationships , both platonic and romantic , as she crawls at a snail ’s pace toward her departure from the fold .
People enter and exit quickly with little indication of where they came from or where they disappeared to .
There are brief mentions of a conversation with a schoolyard pal or a love interest at a party .
At first I found this disconcerting , but upon reconsideration felt this could be a literary device :
Bauer impresses on the reader just how fleeting these encounters had been for her , but the role all actions play in shaping the person we become .
Not that Kind of Girl is a lesson in the ways we drift toward self - discovery and settling into the person we are , which is different than the person we ’d imagined we would be .
It is an exploration of the undramatic and lackluster ways we shift ourselves , and are shifted by others .
At its core , Not that Kind of Girl is a love story — not the kind where Prince Charming rescues the princess , but the kind where the princess stumbles several times , falls over and over again , and eventually figures out how to save herself .
The first comment on Robert Scoble ’s Droid piece I linked to earlier today is from Thomas Marban , one of the developers of Twidroid , which is widely ( maybe even universally ) hailed as the leading Twitter client for Android .
Marban writes :
one of the main reasons why UIs are unequally inferior are not only the way you build apps ( open vs. closed hw / sw system ) and the SDK itself but also marginal to non-existing UI standards , no ready - made drag & drop UI items , variations in carrier - & device firmware , hard - & software input , screen sizes , international customizations , modded phones , rooted phones and last but not least completely different expectations among users and the linux ’ish target group itself .
in a nutshell : beautiful mess .
obviously , all these reasons eat up a huge pile of time that one could better spend with improving UX and polishing the interface .
those who started early with android development have learned and are still learning it the hard way , just like they did with win 3.1 back in the days .
That does n’t sound like someone who plans to ever ship something of the caliber of Tweetie , Birdfeed , or Twitterrific .
From what I ’ve seen of Twidroid , it ’s not even as good as Craig Hockenberry ’s original version of Twitterrific for iPhone , which was written as a jailbreak app before the iPhone officially supported third - party software .
If Android hardware diversity is already a problem for third - party developers , it ’s only going to get worse .

Tesla Motors is close to finalizing a deal to build the Model S sedan in an old NASA assembly plant in the Los Angeles suburb of Downey , the mayor said .
Tesla Motors has for months been searching for a factory in which to build the car .
Downey Mayor Mario Guerra told the Long Beach Press - Telegram the city council will meet Tuesday or Wednesday with International Realty Group , the owners of the site , to broker a memorandum of understanding to facilitate a lease with Tesla .
The deal includes 80 acres of land , some of which is owned by the city , and the city is putting together an incentives package to help lure the Silicon Valley automaker .
" We are looking at what we 'll be able to give to make the deal happen , " Guerra said .
Tesla spokeswoman Rachel Konrad said the company had no comment on the report .
Guerra 's announcement suggests Tesla is no longer considering a former Boeing factory in nearby Long Beach , but unnamed officials " close to the negotiations " told the Press - Telegram they have not heard Long Beach is out of the running .
The weekly newspaper the District also is reporting that Tesla will choose Downey .
“ We ’re very close to being able to make an official announcement , ” Guerra told the District .
“ I ’m about to call a special meeting of the city council , and we ’ll likely have an official announcement next week .
Cars ought to be rolling off the line in 2011 . ”
Tesla has long promised that the four - door , seven - passenger Model S sedan will be on the road by the end of 2011 with a price of $ 49,900 after the $ 7,500 federal tax credit on EVs .
The Department of Energy is loaning Tesla $ 464 million to build the car .

CHURURU , Venezuela —
This sleepy town on Venezuela ’s border with Colombia has been “ candela ” — or “ on fire ” — after a local soccer team was massacred .
Two weeks ago , 12 men — 10 Colombians , one Peruvian and one Venezuelan — were kidnapped from a soccer field on the main road between Tachira state capital San Cristobal and Barinas .
The bodies of 10 of the victims , most of them from the Colombian city of Bucaramanga , were discovered last week in several locations in the nearby town of El Pinal , shot through the head , execution - style .
An 11th body was discovered a few days later .
The massacre of the soccer team is n't the only reason Chururu 's residents are on edge .
Also last week , six Colombian men were discovered in graves in Barinas , killed by mechanical asphyxia .
The massacres have shaken towns on both sides of the border .
But more than that , they 've aggravated the already tense relationship between Venezuela and Colombia .
And the residents are stuck in the middle — afraid for their safety as each country blames the other .
The neighboring countries suspended relations and reduced bilateral trade earlier this year over a Colombian plan to allow U.S. troops to use its military bases .
That agreement was signed Friday in Bogota .
Venezuela regularly accuses Colombia of spying , while Colombia blames Venezuela for allowing leftist guerrillas to take refuge across its borders .
Responsibility for the soccer deaths is the latest tit - for - tat in that squabble .
Colombian Manuel Junior Cortes , 18 , the sole survivor of the massacre , described to the Colombian daily El Tiempo how the soccer team was taken from the field by force and chained together in pairs in a camp on a mountain for two weeks by a group whose leader was nicknamed " El Payaso " or " The Clown . "
They were told they would be freed , but instead were taken to a spot where they were shot several times .
Cortes said he was shot once in the neck and survived by playing dead .
He walked away from the scene and stumbled upon a farmer after three hours .
He is currently in a hospital in Caracas .
The men were playing in a local soccer league on a makeshift soccer field on the outskirts of town when an armed group appeared and asked to see the list of players , according to Wilmer Flores Trosel , director of the CICPC , the Venezuelan equivalent of the FBI .
“ They called out the players ' names , lined them up and took them to an unknown destination , " Flores said .
A resident of Chururu , who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal , said the victims made a living selling snacks and knick - knacks to travelers on buses headed for the Colombian border .
Their team was known as " Los Maniceros , " or " Peanut Sellers . "
“ You saw them all the time selling their peanuts and necklaces , ” she said , adding that she had a close relationship with one of the victims , Angel Aldemar Leon Aricapa , 18 , from Cucuta in Colombia .
She declined to comment on who might have carried out the killings .
Colombia and the vociferous Venezuelan opposition blame guerrilla groups .
They say Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez lets the groups operate with impunity in the country .
According to one account , the group that kidnapped the 12 soccer players " arrived in olive green uniforms , with clothing embossed with the face of Che Guevara . ”
The Venezuelan government , for its part , maintains that Bogota has been attempting to ignite insurrections in Venezuela ’s frontier states through its links with paramilitary groups and the Venezuelan opposition .
Ramon Carrizales , the Venezuelan vice president and defense minister , suggested the 12 victims might have links to paramilitary groups .
“ The way in which they got [ to Venezuela ] ... they had an identity as a group ... makes one think that it was part of the Colombian government ’s infiltration plan supported by internal factors , ” he said .
Tensions have continued to mount , with Venezuela arresting two Colombian citizens and accusing them of spying .
And then , on Friday , in the Venzuelan state on Tachira , 1,000 small businesses did n't open after five Colombians were arrested for distributing flyers that threatened traders if they did n't pay protection money to armed groups .
The Venezuelan government has increased police presence in Chururu , a hot and dusty transit town on the main road between Barinas state and the Colombian border .
Two roadblocks have been set up , manned by several dozen National Guard .
On Monday , two of those guardsmen were shot dead by four armed men on motorbikes .
Rumors circulated that the attack was revenge for the arrests of the Colombians , with the Venezuelan government blaming Colombian paramilitaries .
Two of the main border crossings were subsequently closed .
The Venezuelan - Colombian Chamber of Economic Integration is predicting that bilateral trade between the two countries will fall 50 percent in 2009 .
Venezuelan authorities have also been stopping cars passing across the border into Colombia and obliging them to empty their gas tanks in a bid to stem the sale of contraband gas .
Many people make a living from smuggling gas across the border .
In Chururu , the sandy patch of ground where the victims were taken now lies abandoned , its single set of goalposts knocked over .
Asked what had happened there in early October , neighbors said were away when the incident occurred or refused to comment .
“ People are scared , " said one man who asked not to be named , " they wo n’t talk about what happened here . "

So quite a while ago I wrote about avoiding the n+1 query problem with SQLObject .
I ’ve since been using Django a lot more .
In particular at my day job I ’ve been improving a Django site we ’ve inherited .
This particular site suffered from a few too many SQL queries and needed speeding up .
Some of the issues related to the classic n+1 problem .
i.e. one initial query triggering a further n queries ( where n is the number of results in the first query ) .
A liberal dose of select_related helped .
However that was only useful in the cases where a ForeignKey needed to be pre-fetched .
In the case however there was a page that was selecting a set of objects that had tags .
The tags for each object were being displayed along side a link to the main object .
Given that the initial query returned over three hundred objects , this meant the page was performing another three hundred ( plus ) queries to fetch the individual tags for each object !
Now we could cache the page and that ’s was indeed what was being done .
The trouble however was when the cache expired .
It also made things painful when developing – as I ’d typically want to disable caching whilst I ’m making changes to pages frequently .
I came up with a specific solution for this project – to perform the initial query , then a second query to fetch * all * of the other tags in one go .
The results of the second query could then be stitched into the original results , to make them available in a handy manor within the page ’s template .
I took the original idea and made it re-usable and am now releasing that code as Django Batch Select .
There are examples of how to use it over at github , but it works a bit like this :
>>> entries = Entry.objects.batch_select ( ' tags ' ) .
all ( ) >>> entry = entries [ 0 ] >>> print entry.tags_all [ < Tag : Tag object > ]
It ’s a very early release – after the result of only a few hours coding , so use with care .
It does have 100 % test code coverage at the moment and I ’m reasonable confident about it working .
Please try it out and let me know whether it works for you .
Another Gitmo Detainee Wins in Federal Court ; Score Is Detainees 31 , United States 8
Created : November 20 , 2009 16:48 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Farhi Saeed bin Mohammed , an Algerian national who was captured in Pakistan and turned over to the U.S. military after fleeing from Afghanistan , was ordered released from the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay by a U.S. District Court judge yesterday , according to the human rights group CagePrisoners .
Judge Gladys Kessler ’s written opinion is still classified .
I ’ll report back once a declassified opinion becomes available .
Mohammed is the 31st Guantanamo detainee to win his petition for habeas corpus , which challenges the government ’s right to continue to hold him without charge .
According to David Remes , a lawyer who represents about a dozen Guantanamo detainees and closely tracks these cases , federal courts have ruled that the government can continue to detain eight of the 39 prisoners whose habeas cases have been heard .
Exclusive to STR
If the United States came under the control of a totalitarian regime , would we recognize it ?
This question is of utmost importance today , when many of us harbor fears that some time in the near future ideas such as freedom , liberty , and privacy will be alien to our society .
But as we witness the regular passage of legislation designed to restrict and regulate , and the tendency of the Federal government to increase rather than decrease its power ( with a handful of exceptions ) , we are struck by the uninterrupted routine of life in the USA .
As the central government brings more and more of private society under its control , we continue to watch cable TV , shop at supermarkets overflowing with products , and eat at our favorite restaurants .
Could it be that we have already passed that dreaded threshold and missed it ?
The trouble with diagnosing our condition is that most people are unaware of what totalitarianism actually is .
Among even the most politically astute , there is little mental room for the possibility that a state in the process of becoming totalitarian might lack the most brutal and outward signs of oppressive regimes portrayed in popular culture .
Because of our rather simplistic frame of reference ' picture black and white images of National Socialist Germany or the Soviet Union 'we recognize a country as either being in the advanced stages of totalitarianism or not at all .
But just because a state maintains the structures and language of democracy and continues to have elections , for instance , that does not preclude it from being totalitarian .
In fact , North Korea has a constitution and holds regular elections with three competing political parties ' the Workers ' Party of Korea , the Korean Social Democratic Party , and the Chondoist Chongu Party ' all united under an organization called the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland .
In April 2009 , North Korea revised its constitution to include Article 8 , which reads , ' The State respects and protects the human rights of the workers , peasants and working intellectuals who have been previously freed from exploitation and oppression and have become masters of the State and society . '
Yet North Korea is recognized as being one of the most oppressive totalitarian states in the world .
Totalitarianism and authoritarianism do not necessarily go hand in hand .
Throughout human history , most governments have been authoritarian , but totalitarianism did n't appear until the 20th Century .
That is because until the birth of mass society , governments lacked the means to exercise total control over a large population .
Tribes and municipalities may have sworn fealty to an overlord or emperor , for example , but beyond collecting taxes or levying armies , the monarch took very little interest in the personal lives of his or her subjects .
Personal behavior was left to be governed by custom or religion .
Totalitarianism is therefore not specifically a system of government , but a way of organizing society by means of a powerful , centralized modern state .
It requires a mass media , education , and political culture in which the state ' that is to say a class of bureaucrats and officials governing a large geographic area ' takes over every aspect of civil society .
Totalitarianism , as succinctly defined by former Italian dictator Benito Mussolini , is ' Everything within the state , nothing outside the state , nothing against the state . '
The totalitarian mind views individuals not as citizens with their own interests , but as dependents with only one interest , and as such , it attempts to organize these masses around a particular ideology .
Any thoughts , words , or actions that do not conform to this dominant ideology are made criminal or driven underground .
In short , the state seeks total control over the people living within its jurisdiction .
Totalitarian regimes attempt to achieve this control through personality cults , by mobilizing the population into national organizations , by censoring the media , through mass surveillance , and through various levels of state ownership of commerce and the means of production .
Traditionally , though with some exceptions , governments have recognized a distinction between public and private life .
The earliest civil laws governed interactions between individuals that could result in material or physical harm .
The totalitarian state , on the other hand , seeks to extend its authority not just over the public actions of a person , but to his or her own private associations , family life , and possessions as well .
The individual interest thereby dissolves into the public interest , or in the words of radical leftist Carol Hanisch , ' the personal is political . '
Ultimately , the totalitarian goal is not just legal control over our actions , but our thoughts as well .
Finally , totalitarianism is a teleological worldview , meaning that the totalitarian mind sees all of history as unfolding toward an inevitable end ' whether it be a communist state , a world government , or some other utopia .
This end result , though never really achieved ( thus the need for a ' perpetual revolution ' ) , is held up as a justification for every possible abuse , including mass murder .
After all , opponents of the regime are simply getting in the way of historical progress .
Therefore , totalitarianism requires not only a belief in the power of the centralized state to eliminate all of humanity 's woes , but a belief in the inevitable victory of that state over private interests .
As Mussolini inferred , there is nothing the totalitarian fears more than an individual acting outside the state .
It is vitally important to understand that totalitarianism is not an exotic or abstract idea , but a reality of the contemporary world .
It is something that we do not often recognize in our society , but is nevertheless an ever - present and growing danger .
As further proof that insanity has no bounds , a Michigan Democratic candidate for governor calls for tax hikes and more welfare .
Thoroughly disgusted minds are reading State lawmaker calls for tax hikes .
A Washtenaw County legislator and Democratic candidate for governor unveiled her plan to turnaround Michigan today – a $ 6.5 billion a year tax hike .
State Rep. Alma Wheeler Smith said substantial hikes in Michigan ’s business , sales and income taxes are needed to make investments in education and welfare programs that will restore the state to prosperity .
Smith , a veteran lawmaker who plans to run for governor in 2010 , called for hikes of :
• $ 3 billion in mostly business tax increases by closing so - called loopholes .
The new revenue would allow the state to eliminate a “ business growth strangling ” 22 % surcharge on the Michigan Business Tax , she said .
• $ 1.5 billion in new revenue by expanding the state sales tax to many personal services .
The expansion would also allow the state to cut the sales tax rate from 6 % to 5.5 % , Smith said .
• Nearly $ 2 billion in higher income taxes , by implementing a graduated income tax with a new highest rate of 9.75 % ( compared to the current 4.35 % for all wage earners ) , starting at $ 60,000 a year in income for single filers .

Hadouken is the special attack that was used by Ryu , Ken , Sakura , Akuma and Gouken .
Using just the right combination – down , down - diagonal forward , forward + punch ( or ? , ? , ? , punch ) , you could create a surge of spirit energy and send it flying toward your opponent .
It was the classic power move .

The far right has never been friendly territory for Jews
It 's always a little jarring to watch the small but determined handful of befuddled Jews flirting -- for one reason or another -- with the right - wing elements that have been trying to exterminate them since Biblical times .
There were even confused Jewish fascists who supported Hitler and Mussolini ( and wound up being killed by those they supported ) .
Their political posterity in contemporary American politics is Eric Cantor ( R - VA ) , Sheldon Adelson , Mel Sembler , Scooter Libby and a motley gaggle of neo - fascist hate talk media types from Irving and William Kristol to Mark Levin , Michael Savage and Michael Medved , as well as members of the Republican Jewish Coalition
In 1981 the Ramones released their sixth album , Pleasant Dreams , which included The KKK Took My Baby Away , a song by Joey Ramone , who was Jewish and progressive , about the theft of his girlfriend by Johnny Ramone , who was non-Jewish and conservative .
I was a dj in San Francisco at the time and was , at least in the beginning , reticent about playing it .
Eventually , though , people started understanding that it was n't supporting the KKK , and it became a big hit on our station .
Something similar happened 5 years later when they released Bonzo Goes to Bitburg , commemorating Reagan 's tribute to SS troops in Germany .
It came out in the U.K. first , and Warner Bros was reluctant to even release it in America -- and waited a year !
Last night was the closing of a hugely successful play in L.A. , a musical in fact , called , which starred one of my neighbors , T.R. Knight .
If you know him at all , you probably know him in his scrubs as Dr. George O'Malley from Grey 's Anatomy , although he received spectacular reviews in the role of Leo Frank , a Jewish resident of Atlanta who was lynched by the KKK in 1915 .
Extreme right - wing Jews like Eric Cantor and Michael Savage should keep in mind the barely below - the - surface virulent anti-Semitism their " allies " in the conservative movement have always harbored .
In 1984 the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles , still a viciously right - wing and thuggish outfit , denied Frank a posthumous pardon .
I doubt too many teabaggers have joined that movement because they want to kill anyone ; give them time .
Here 's a great video of the whole Leo Frank story and how the far right works :

Did The Pirate Bay really shutter its tracker , as claimed on Tuesday ?
The Motion Picture Association does n't think so .
Hollywood 's overseas lobbying organization claims OpenBitTorrent , billed as an independent " open tracker project , " was actually established by one of The Pirate Bay 's founders .
" OpenBitTorrent is used for file sharing , and we suspect that it is the Pirate Bay tracker with a new name .
It is added by default on all of the torrent tracker files on Pirate Bay , " Hollywood attorney Monique Wadsted told Swedish media .
Wadsted , TorrentFreak notes , said the tracker 's domain was originally registered by Fredrik Neij , one of the four Pirate Bay co-founders .
On its website , OpenBitTorrent denies it 's The Pirate Bay 's tracker :
OpenBitTorrent has been mixed up as being a part of and / or a side project to The Pirate Bay .
The reason for this is that during the startup period during February through August of 2009 , we shared the same hosting company and to some extent used the same tracker cluster and IP - address space provided by DCP Networks , the same service provider as The Pirate Bay used .
OpenBitTorrent was at the time a customer of DCP Networks and Fredrik Neij , one of their employees but also one of the founders of The Pirate Bay .
The MPA has gone to court , trying to get OpenBitTorrent 's internet host , Portlane of Sweden , to stop servicing the tracker .
Hollywood 's allegations come a day after The Pirate Bay announced it was retiring the world 's largest BitTorrent tracker , and opting to serve up free movies , software , games and music via DHT and PEX technologies that allow peers to locate one another without accessing a central server .
All the while , the Swedish press speculated Tuesday that the tracker 's retirement might be related to an October decision by a court in that country requiring the The Pirate Bay to either shut down or remove all unauthorized copyright works .
The Stockholm district court said two of the site ’s four co-founders , Gottfrid Svartholm Warg and Neij , would be fined up to $ 73,000 if they failed to comply .
Pending appeal , The Pirate Bay ’s four co-founders each face a year in prison and millions in fines after their April convictions in a Stockholm court for facilitating copyright infringement .
On appeal , Svartholm Warg argued that the proposed $ 73,000 fine should be nullified if the tracker was shut down , according to Swedish media .

KUNMING , China —
The casting call went out across China earlier this year , in newspapers and online : Entertainers needed for a new theme park , no special skills required .
Applicants should be 18 - 40 years old , from any part of the country .
The only stipulation ?
To work at the Kingdom of Dwarves performers must be shorter than 4 ' 3 " .
Since the park opened this summer in the mountains outside of Kunming , about 80 little people have signed on .
Twice a day , they take to the stage to entertain smatterings of Chinese tourists by singing , dancing and performing slapstick comedy in the model of ubiquitous Chinese television variety shows .
The dwarve are not , for the most part , accomplished singers , comedians or Qi Gong masters .
The “ king ” is a 40 - year - old dwarf and the shortest performer on the payroll , a tough - looking , silent character dressed in gold silk pajamas , who cruises away on his three - wheeled motorcycle after the show .
They are on stage because they are different , and in China , being different often means being a spectacle .
“ I think this is a very unusual place , and quite funny , ” said Li Ximing , a visitor from Kunming .
Kingdom of the Dwarves .
( GlobalPost )
To many around the world , the very idea of putting people on stage to perform simply because they do n’t look like everyone else is cringe - inducing .
But even though they must dress up in frilly princess and caped warrior costumes befitting small children and dance for tourists , performers at the bizarre theme park see this place as a haven from the overwhelming discrimination they face in China at large .
“ Back home , strangers will stare at and they look down on us , ” said Yang Lichun of Beijing , who moved across the country to work at the park this summer with her fiance .
“ If we can even find jobs at home , we have to work harder than everyone else to prove ourselves . ”
This is not a protective commune founded by dwarves , as some media reports have insisted .
The performers do not live in the tiny concrete mushroom houses that serve as a backdrop for their shows , but in nearby dormitories .
It is a for - profit theme park run by a Yunnan province - based venture capital company .
The workers simply see this as dagong — the modern Chinese notion of migrant work , leaving your hometown for a job elsewhere .
Tens of millions do it for factory and construction work ; these workers came here to put on a show for tourists who want to see little people .
Disabled and different people are often shunned in China , and hiring discrimination based on physical appearance is widely accepted .
Still , parks where the amusement is people are a dicey topic , especially given a shady past rife with stories of China ’s ethnic minorities being rounded up and displayed in the mode of circus freak shows .
But to hear the workers tell it , there ’s no better place to be right now — the underlying social attitude actually made the workers want to come to the remote park , and want to stay .
Yi Shaobo , 28 , used to work in an auto parts factory in his native Wuhan , 1,200 miles east of here .
He does n’t earn a lot more at the Kingdom of Dwarves , but he prefers it .
“ I did n’t come here for the money .
I came because it made me happy , ” said Yi . “ People at the factory had to help me with my job , and I wanted to be independent . ”
Performers earn between $ 120 and $ 175 per month , depending on their role .
It ’s about as much as a factory worker earns , and more than most could make back home .
More importantly , the little people here say they have found camaraderie and respect they do n’t often get in the outside world .
Inside the Kingdom of Dwarves ( the park ’s own translation ) , because the performers are all small , nobody is judged on height .
They joke and tease about dating and about falling in love .
The gossip has it that eight little people already have met mates here .
The park , which sits about an hour away from central Kunming , is tucked away in the mountains , inside a larger venue devoted to butterflies .
The performers live there , isolated from city life — both a good and a bad thing for most .
It ’s clear the honeymoon phase wo n’t last forever , especially as tourist numbers are low so far .
Still , the performers hope for the best .
“ I ’ll work here as long as this park is open , ” said Yang .

A popular myth is that radioactive dating methods confirm the geologic time - scale and the concept of human evolution .
The methods appear so impressive that many Christians accept them as evidence that the earth is very old .
The best way to expose this myth is to study the dating of the East African KBS Tuff strata and the famous fossil KNM - ER 1470.1
Richard Leakey , son of famed palaeoanthropologists Louis and Mary Leakey , visited the fossil deposits east of Lake Rudolf ( now Lake Turkana ) in northern Kenya in 1967 .
He immediately organized an expedition to search for hominid fossils .
The most important fossil discovered there is KNM - ER 1470 .
Skull 1470 is modern in appearance , but was originally estimated by Richard Leakey to be about 2.9 million years old .
One early geologist with Richard Leakey at East Rudolf was Kay Behrensmeyer .
Seeking to unravel the geology of the area , she discovered a layer of volcanic ash or tuff that became known as the Kay Behrensmeyer Site ( the KBS Tuff ) .
If the KBS Tuff were anywhere else , no one would give it a second thought .
At East Rudolf it is of utmost importance .
First , although human fossils and artefacts ( tools ) cannot usually be dated radiometrically , the KBS Tuff can .
It contains radioactive potassium 40 , which decays to argon 40 .
Second , artefacts have been found in association with the KBS Tuff .
The assumption is that the tuff gives an estimate of the age of the stone tools .
Third , hundreds of Homo and australopithecine fossils have been found above and below the KBS Tuff .
The date of the tuff thus becomes a maximum age for fossils found above it and a minimum for fossils below it .
The first attempt to date the KBS Tuff was in 1969 , well before the discovery of skull 1470 .
Richard Leakey supplied rock samples to F.J. Fitch ( Birkbeck College , University of London ) and J.A. Miller ( Cambridge University ) — recognized authorities in potassium - argon ( K - Ar ) dating .
Fitch and Miller 's first analysis gave evolutionary dates from 212 million to 230 million years of age .
Concerning this they said , ' From these results it was clear that an extraneous argon age discrepancy was present ...'.2
How did they know ?
The associated fossils told them .
In spite of our being assured that dating methods constitute independent confirmation of evolutionary dates , associated fossils had already determined the ' acceptable ' dates .
Based on their alleged evolution , the australopithecine and other mammalian fossils found beneath the KBS Tuff had determined that the rocks should be between 2 and 5 million years old .
Dates of 212 to 230 million years old were far off .
Without the associated fossils , however , there would be no way for an evolutionary geologist to know if these were ' good ' or ' bad ' dates .
Under other circumstances , and without fossils to guide them , evolutionary geologists could have accepted these dates as ' good ' .
Fitch and Miller requested new samples .
From these they concluded from pumice lumps and feldspar crystals that the age of the KBS Tuff was 2.61 million years .
3
It was because Leakey found skull 1470 below this tuff after it had been dated at 2.61 million years and above rock dated at 3.18 million years that he estimated the skull to be 2.9 million years old .
DATING PIGS AND ELEPHANTS
In 1972 , before skull 1470 was announced , Vincent Maglio ( Princeton University ) published in Nature a chronology of the hominid - bearing sediments east of Lake Rudolf , which included the KBS Tuff .4
His work was based on lineages of two species of pig and one of elephant .
Maglio's dates were compatible with the radiometric date arrived at by Fitch and Miller , and were considered to confirm their date .
In 1974 , a third chronology of the area was published in Nature , based on palaeomagnetism .
5
The conclusion of 2.7 to 3.0 million years seemed to represent a ' bulls - eye ' for the correlation of the various dating methods .
6
By late 1974 , the KBS Tuff had been dated five different times by four different dating methods .
The alleged compatibility of the different methods would seem to be a geologist 's dream .
However , under the surface , skull 1470 with its estimated date of 2.9 million years presented the evolutionary world with an intolerable situation .
The theory of human evolution did not allow a skull so modern to be that old .
Nevertheless Richard Leakey continued to fight for this original date .
If skull 1470 was 2.9 million years old , he had discovered the oldest member of the genus Homo ; if it was n't , he had n't !
Hence , he resisted lowering the age of the skull .
Meanwhile , another study by G.H. Curtis and his associates ( University of California , Berkeley ) claimed to distinguish two tuff units .
One gave an age of 1.6 million years and the other , where skull 1470 was found , gave 1.82 million years — both considerably younger than the five previous studies had reported .
All of the above - cited articles spoke of the great difficulty in getting rock or crystal samples that were not altered , weathered , or derived from older rock .
The question arises , How does one know when one has good samples for dating ?
The answer is that ' good ' samples give dates in accord with evolutionary presuppositions .
' Bad ' samples give dates not in conformity with evolution — a classic illustration of circular reasoning .
On March 20 , 1980 , two more dating studies in Nature criticized the earlier work and claimed that the age of the KBS Tuff was 1.87 or 1.89 million years .
Then in late 1981 , Ian McDougall published his study of the KBS Tuff , giving a date of 1.88 million years .
At that point , the 10 - year controversy over the date of the KBS Tuff came to a close with agreement on the more recent date .
THE POWER OF THE PIGS
Although the dating of the KBS Tuff appeared to be settled in 1980 and 1981 by the conformity of different dating methods , the controversy was actually settled in 1975 by the pigs .
Donald Johanson tells of attending the 1975 Bishop Conference on anthropology and geology in London .
A major paper was presented by Basil Cooke ( Dalhousie University , Halifax ) , who had studied the pig sequences in southern Ethiopia , at Hadar ( Ethiopia ) , and at Olduvai Gorge ( Tanzania ) .
According to Cooke , the dating at Lake Turkana ( formerly Lake Rudolf ) was too high by about 800,000 years .
The pigs at Turkana told him so .
Johanson wrote of this conference : ' Nearly everyone but the Lake Turkana team [ Richard Leakey and his associates ] went away convinced that the KBS tuff and the skull - 1470 dates would have to be corrected .'7
Astounding about the whole affair was that the anthropologists were rejecting the same objective , scientific data they universally appeal to .
There was internal consistency within the studies , and high conformity by five different dating techniques .
The main thing the dates did not conform to was the concept of the evolution of pigs and humans .
The evolution of the pigs is said to be the clear - cut answer to the dating problems in east Africa , but the evidence is less than impressive .
In his phylogeny of the pigs ( bush - pig , forest hog , warthog , etc. ) , Basil Cooke presented family trees for three taxonomic groups .
Two of the groups have at their bases the phrase hypothetical Sus - like ancestor .
The 20 species that make up these three groups are shown in parallel lines connected only by dotted lines , indicating that there is no known relationship between any of the species .
The chart could just as well have been drawn by a creationist .
Most of the fossil - pig evidence consists of teeth .
Several species are based on the skimpiest evidence ( ' imperfectly known ' , ' rare ' , ' scarce ' ) and the various relationships are largely guesses .
The 1980 and 1981 studies on the date of the KBS Tuff contained so many criticisms of all of the earlier studies that they called into question the objectivity and validity of the dating methods themselves .
RADIOACTIVE DATING MYTH
The above account highlights two major fallacies of radioactive dating .
First , the history of the dating of the KBS Tuff reveals that no matter how careful a scientist is in selecting his rock samples and in performing his laboratory work , if he gets the wrong date for his rocks he is open to the charge of using contaminated material and defective methodology .
The charges need not be proved .
The literature suggests that even if radiometric dating were valid in concept ( which it is not ) , the practical matter of selecting rock samples that can be proved pure and uncontaminated requires an omniscience beyond humans .
The radioactive dating methods are a classic example of self - deception and circular reasoning .
It is another of the myths of evolution .
Second , what normally happens in a fossil discovery is that the fossils are discovered first .
Then attempts are made to date the rock strata in which they are found .
Under these conditions , a palaeoanthropologist has a degree of control over the results .
He is free to reject dates that do not fit the evolution scenario of the fossils .
He is not even required to publish those ' obviously anomalous ' dates .
The result is a very sanguine and misleading picture of the conformity of the human fossil record with the concept of human evolution .
It is entirely possible that if skull 1470 had never been found , the KBS Tuff would still be dated at 2.61 million years .
We would continue to be told that it was a ' secure date ' based on the precision of radiometric dating and the ' independent ' confirmation of other dating techniques that acted as controls .
It was the shocking discovery of the morphologically modern skull 1470 , located well below the KBS Tuff , that precipitated the 10 - year controversy .
In the 10 - year controversy over the dating of one of the most important human fossils ever discovered , the pigs won .
The pigs won over the elephants .
The pigs won over potassium - argon dating .
The pigs won over argon40 / argon39 dating .
The pigs won over fission - track dating .
They won over palaeomagnetism .
The pigs took it all .
But in reality , it was n't the pigs that won .
It was evolution that won .
In the dating game , evolution always wins .

Imagine going blind , and having your sight restored using your own tooth – or putting on a helmet that allows other people to read your thoughts .
It may sound like the most unlikely of science fiction , but these things are actually possible thanks to the many astounding scientific discoveries made in the past year or so .
From medical miracles to properties of quantum mechanics that theoretically put teleportation within reach , these breakthroughs have the potential to transform our world as we know it .
Man Sees Through Eye( Tooth )
Blind for a decade , Englishman Martin Jones is finally able to see again – through a piece of tooth implanted in his eye .
Appropriately , the tooth used was a canine , otherwise known as an ‘ eyetooth ’ .
Doctors took a piece of Jones ’ own living tooth , placed a man -made lens into its core and implanted it under his eyelid where tissue grew over it .
A flap of skin excised from inside the patient ’s mouth was placed over the tooth in Jones ’ eye where it acquired its own blood supply .
A hole cut in the new cornea allows light to pass through .
The procedure has restored sight to over 600 people worldwide .
Spray - On Solar Panels
Solar panels are typically inflexible and brittle , limiting the versatility of their application .
But what if you could just spray solar cells onto any surface and collect energy from the sun ?
The technology is currently being produced at the University of Texas , where researchers are using nanoparticle “ inks ” full of tiny photovoltaics made from copper indium gallium selenide ( CIGS ) .
These particles are 10,000 times thinner than a strand of human hair .
Currently , the photovoltaic ink only converts 1 % of the sunlight that reaches it into electricity , but the researchers expect to increase the production and have the technology on the market within three to five years .
Taking Steps Toward Teleportation
From The Fly to Star Trek , teleportation has been a common theme in science fiction for decades – but scientists have actually come closer to making it a reality .
A research team at Australian National University have developed a new way to generate quantum entanglement in beams of light using only two parts , linking them together so that when something affects one , it affects the other – regardless of the physical distance between them .
Team leader Jiri Janousek says that their method could be used for teleportation as well , but it ’ll probably be another 50 years before the technology could be used outside laboratories .
Lost World of Wonders in Volcanic Crater
Researchers discovered an entire lost world of never - before - seen species when they ventured into the incredibly remote , nearly inaccessible crater of the Mount Bosavi volcano in Papua New Guinea earlier this year .
In fact , the crater is so remote , it has never before been touched by human influence .
The researchers found it remarkably easy to approach the wildlife found within , which showed no fear of the team .
A fanged frog , a possum that releases a skunk - like odor when frightened , and a giant wooly rat were among the species discovered .
Solar Panel Shingles
For homeowners that can afford them , the biggest reason not to install rooftop solar panels is often aesthetics : they ’re just plain ugly .
But , unobtrusive solar panels that blend in nearly effortlessly with the architecture of a home are now within reach .
Dow Solar recently announced a new generation of building - integrated photovoltaic ( BIPV ) roof shingles , and SRS Energy has created powerful solar panels that look just like standard clay roof tiles .
Telepathy Helmet
It ’s a nightmare for any conspiracy theorist : a telepathy helmet that can be placed on your head so that other people can read your thoughts .
But , this technology is n’t just the stuff of Hollywood films – it ’s actually being developed for the U.S. military by a team of scientists from three American universities .
The goal of the project is n’t to spy on citizens , however .
It will be used to read and transmit soldier ’s thoughts to each other so that the need for vocal communication is eliminated .
Have no fear , say the scientists involved in the project : the person wearing the helmet must put forth a deliberate effort to communicate their thoughts .
T- Rex ’s Tiny Ancestor
The Tyrannosaurus Rex is well known as the king of all dinosaurs , a towering menace of a predator that terrorized everything in its path .
But this gigantic dino actually evolved from a pint - size predecessor that measured just 8 feet long .
A recent report in the journal Science says that Raptorex kriegsteini , which existed 60 million years before the T - Rex , had nearly identical physical features aside from its much smaller size .
Insanely Tiny Laser Beam
Until recently , it was simply impossible to make lasers any smaller than they already are .
A beam of light has to bounce around in a chamber in order to focus , and the chamber has to be of a certain size to allow the light to travel .
But now , researchers have discovered that lasers could be smaller if they depended on a rapidly vibrating electron situated on top of a minuscule piece of metal instead of a wave of bouncing light .
Using this idea , a team at Norfolk State University built the world ’s tiniest laser – 1000 times smaller than the width of a hair – on a bead of gold just 44 nanometers across .
Treasure Trove of Bizarre Blind Species Found
Of all the amazing variety of flora and fauna that exist on this planet , we ’ve only discovered 2 % .
Scientists estimate that there ’s another 98 million species of plants and animals that we have yet to identify .
Scientists who discovered 850 new bizarre and amazing creatures in underground caves and bodies of water barely made a dent in that figure , but what they found is awe - inspiring indeed .
Many of the species are blind and lack pigment , since sight and color are unnecessary in the environments in which they live .
Powerful X - Rays Made from Sticky Tape
Sticky tape is good for more than just wrapping gifts : it can actually produce X - rays .
The tape emits a faint luminescence when peeled away from its holder – a phenomenon called triboluminescence .
A group of researchers at UCLA investigated a claim made by Soviet researchers in the 1950s that unrolling sticky tape also results in the release of X - rays , and found it to be valid , producing pictures of their own finger bones .
It 's quite amazing that the bias in favor of college continues to survive against mounting evidence that it is a bad investment for many young people and their parents .
At the top of intelligence scale , most would - be college students would clearly be better off avoiding college in favor of joining a start up , founding their own company or simply pursuing intellectual pursuits outside of the traditional four - year college .
At the bottom of the intelligence scale , the would - be students would be far better learning a trade without accumulating tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt .
Even middling students would probably be better off seeking a profession that is not irrationally closed off to those without a college degree .
" In this environment , opportunity cost trumps tradition .
For many undergraduates and parents , the cost of going to college is now far greater than the supposed benefits , " a new story on Minyanville reports .
More from Minyanville :
“ College costs -- along with living and medical costs -- are rising , and salaries are going down right now , ” Managing Director of Formula Capital and Wall Street Journal columnist James Altucher said .
“ College graduates do n’t have the same benefits as they did 30 years ago . ”
Parents should beware of their child ’s intentions .
Many students want to spend their parents ’ money -- it ’s their last chance to go all out ...
“ If a student wants to go back to school in their 20s , when they ’ve made some money , traveled , and matured a bit , then go ahead , ” Altucher said .
“ But a parent should n’t have to spend $ 50,000 a year for their kid to go to frat parties all day long . ”
After hearing Jim Engle of Sierra Madre talk about the headaches he and his wife endured on a round trip from Burbank to Detroit on American Airlines in the summer , you might be surprised to hear that the country ’s airlines continue to get great marks in customer service .
Engle and his wife suffered through several delays , an unscheduled stop in Ontario and airline staff who , he said , were curt and unhelpful .
“ And I do n’t have enough time to tell you about the extra charges for baggage and food and water , which ran out before half the plane was served , ” he complained .
Despite the experience of Engle and other passengers , the latest report from the U.S. Department of Transportation shows that complaints against airlines dropped nearly 12 % in September compared with the same period last year and 32 % from August 2009 .

Even when the overall drop in passenger traffic is factored in , the complaint rate against the airlines is down to 0.88 complaints per 100,000 passenger flights this September from 0.99 complaints in September 2008 .
Engle and other airline critics believe the reason for the drop in complaints does not reflect improved airline services but rather a growing frustration by passengers who are so fed up that they do n’t file complaints .
After all , Engle did n’t file a complaint with American or the Department of Transportation .
“ They ’re miserable and they are resigned that nothing is going to change , ” said Kate Hanni , founder of FlyersRights.org , a website that has been pushing Congress to adopt a passengers ’ bill of rights .

Hanni , who has become a vocal airline critic since she and her family were stuck on a plane for nine hours on a tarmac in Austin , Texas , in 2006 , said her organization ’s complaint hotline -- ( 877 ) 359-3776 -- continues to get a steady stream of angry calls from frustrated airline passengers .
The complaints reported to the Department of Transportation come directly from airline passengers who either call the complaint line -- ( 202 ) 366-2220 -- write to the agency or file a complaint online at airconsumer.ost.dot.gov .
Airlines are required to report mishandled baggage , delayed flights , incidents involving pets , tarmac delays and other specific problems .
But they are not required to report general grievances about service , such as dirty seats , rude staff and excessive fees .

Hanni and other critics say it simply may appear that the airlines are doing a better job because of the deep drop in passenger traffic .
The Department of Transportation also reported improved on - time performances for the nation ’s largest airlines in September , when the on - time rate was 86.2 % , compared with 84.9 % in September 2008 and 79.7 % in August 2009 .
Airline experts say carriers have an easier time keeping flights on schedule because many have eliminated flights and grounded planes because of dropping demand .
More - cooperative weather patterns this year also have kept airlines on schedule .
U.S. airlines also lost or mishandled less luggage : 3.01 bags per 1,000 passengers in September , compared with a rate of 3.86 in September 2008 and a rate of 4.04 in August 2009 , according to the department report .

American Airlines spokesman Tim Smith acknowledged that improved weather and declining passenger traffic have helped airlines reduce flight delays , lost - luggage reports and other problems .
But he attributed the overall drop in complaints at American to improved service .
He said American ’s internal data show that the number of passenger complaints has dropped 20 % to 30 % over last year .
He points to a new airline effort to deploy customer service workers throughout the terminals to help passengers solve glitches with luggage and flight schedules .
As for Engle ’s nightmare trip to Detroit , Smith said the airline gets more complaints than compliments because people with a gripe are more vocal .
Still , he said , American continues to strive to resolve every complaint .

“ We are not satisfied if the customers are not satisfied , ” he said .
The key component of the passengers ’ bill of rights supported by Hanni and other airline critics is a guideline for returning passengers to the terminal when a plane is delayed on the tarmac for more than three hours .
Tarmac delays are a major headache , but lately air travelers seem increasingly angry about the fees that airlines charge to check luggage and get a snack , a pillow or a drink .
Now an airline consulting firm has proposed another “ passenger bill of rights ” to protect travelers from hidden , excessive and unfair airline fees .

Airline Information , a Miami firm that organizes airline conferences and consults for the industry , has created an eight - point bill of rights for airline passengers who are the target of such a la carte fees .
Among the mandates of the bill :
* All fees must be transparent .
* Customers have a right to know the total cost of a flight , plus extra fees , before paying the fare .

* Customers have a right to a refund if they do n’t get the purchased a la carte services that were promised .
The bill of rights have been debated among airline representatives at conferences in Huntington Beach and London in the last three months .
Roger Williams , managing partner of Airline Information , said his company proposed the bill of rights because it was clear that such fees are a permanent part of the industry .
Unless the airlines manage the extra fees in a responsible manner , Williams said he fears that the federal government may impose regulations on such fees .

“ We are trying to stay ahead of the curve , ” he said .
So far , no airlines have endorsed the airline fees bill of rights .
But Williams said he hoped to get many airlines to agree to the guidelines by the end of the year .

One thing about doing a two hour show that heavily covers both the financial crisis and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is that you notice on a daily basis the shocking juxtaposition between the lucky Wall Streeters and the unlucky soldiers .
We all know at this point that our banking system is being used as an unregulated bonus - seeking mechanism for bankers , now underwritten by taxpayers with $ 23.7 trillion worth of national wealth .
Bankers lent pretend money to home buyers to award themselves actual money in bonuses -- making home prices balloon and , in the process , bankrupting America 's treasury , currency , the states , and many of its citizens .
To simply let the housing market rapidly correct itself ( or more likely over - correct ) would result in massive societal disruption , possible violence and unnecessary suffering .
So while we slowly attempt to close the taxpayer - funded bank casinos and try to restore the basic rules of investment and lending in our economy , we have difficult decisions to make .
Unfortunately , our only choice for a less jarring social transition so far has been to artificially adjust the real prices of our homes via government guarantees to banks ( for bad mortgages and losing gambling bets ) -- or relatively arbitrary handouts to home buyers .
What did these people do to deserve the handout ?
How do you feel about a Wall Street Banker who has been renting an apartment here in New York and this year combined the bonus money he made on bundling new taxpayer - sponsored Fannie Mae CDS with a first - time home buyers tax credit gift from the taxpayers to buy the penthouse in his building ?
Meanwhile , we have already been at war for 8 years with no end in sight .
World War II was 5 years .
We are fighting these wars with the fewest number of soldiers in modern U.S. History .
To avoid incorporating a politically unpopular draft , we deploy the same soldiers five or six times with comparatively minuscule breaks in between .
However , the dire state of the economy has been a boon to military recruitment , but I am not sure if we will ever see the Wall Street bank scammers claim their rightful credit for that .
So instead of using these bad - ( Wall Street ) to - arbitrary ( first time home buyers ) ways to pump money into rescuing our housing market , let 's give it to those who are truly deserving of handouts : our servicemen and women .
I propose that we immediately enact the following :
Give every single man and woman that is fighting for us a housing credit of $ 50,000 , with the caveat that the credit must be used by someone within two years .
Make it so that the credits are completely fungible , meaning that if the veteran does n't wish to buy a house , he or she can sell the credit to someone who does -- and keep the money .
If the reselling of gift cards on Ebay is any indication , I am sure there will be a thriving market where soldiers could probably get pretty close to 90 cents on the dollar for their credit .
Considering the roughly 2 million veterans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan so far , this would give a much needed $ 100 billion boost to the housing market .
Just as a template for comparison , Goldman Sachs ( albeit it doing " God 's work " ) and the other complicit banks like JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley will pay $ 29.4 billion in personal bonuses this year .
In reporting on this financial crisis , I have been most surprised by the blatant disregard that our politicians and even some journalists have shown for the most fundamental American notion of fairness .
I do n't think handing taxpayer trillions to some of the least worthy individuals is something that our country will stand for , regardless of what the current incumbents think .
If we must resort to handouts to save our country , let 's at least put them in the hands of the most deserving .
THQ has unleashed a hot new trailer for Darksiders upon the world and it looks pretty damn good .
It seems that this game has been consistently looking bigger and better as time goes on , and one can only assume that 's a good thing .
With Mark Hamill joining the voice cast , a rather unique story , and plenty of mindless violence featuring impossibly proportioned meatheads with ludicrously huge swords , this should be a great game to kick off the new year with .
We shall of course have to wait for the final product to be sure of that , but I 've got my fingers crossed for a hot one .
In a notoriously expensive city , people will do anything to get a break on housing costs .
They might hide a relative , change their name or suggest they earn less than they really do .
But six women went too far and were arrested in a particularly imaginative scheme for seeking the government ’s help with rent payments , officials said on Tuesday .
The women have been charged with submitting fraudulent documents  including forged police reports and court orders  to portray themselves as victims of domestic violence in an apparent attempt to jump to the front of a long waiting list for government subsidized apartments , said Rose Gill Hearn , the commissioner of the city ’s Department of Investigation .
Since she took her position in 2002 , Ms. Gill Hearn has seen hundreds of housing fraud cases a year “ of different permutations , ” she said .
“ But this is the first time that D.O.I. has investigated and uncovered individuals who are engaging in housing fraud by posing as victims of domestic violence . ”
I was too nice in ascribing merely a trillion dollar deficit bequeathed to Obama , as a reader reminds me :
According to the treasury department 's Bureau of Public Debt , the federal deficit went from $ 5,728,195,796,181.57 on January 22 , 2001 to $ 10,626,877,048,913.08 on January 20 , 2009 .
Bear in mind that the allegedly fiscally conservative Republican Party ran this government for six of those eight years .
Roughly two trillion of that debt was added after Democrats took over Congress in 2007 .
Adding $ 5 trillion in debt in eight years is unprecedented in US history outside the Second World War .
But that 's what Bush and Rove and the GOP did .
And now they lecture everyone else about fiscal responsibility .
Here 's my litmus test for the Tea Party right : when they hold up effigies of Bush and Cheney as socialists , I 'll take them seriously .
Until then , they 're more partisan than principled .

AT&T has issued a press release today announcing that MMS will become active for iPhone users on September 25 .
We 've been working for the past several months to prepare our systems and network to ensure the best possible experience with MMS when it launches - and that launch date is : September 25 for iPhone 3G and 3GS customers .
MMS will be enabled through a software update on that day .
AT&T points to the need for the company to build out its network infrastructure to handle the demands of heavy MMS messaging volumes as the primary reason for the delay in launching the service compared to carriers in other countries that have offered MMS since the launch of iPhone OS 3.0 in June .
As announced in June , MMS messaging will be included at no additional cost to users with an iPhone text messaging plan .
There has been much speculation on the availability of MMS from AT&T , some with dubious origins .
Next week 's Apple media event had been the subject of some speculation as a possible venue for AT&T to launch MMS , which was first promised at Apple 's Worldwide Developer Conference in June , though today 's news has put all such rumors to bed .

EA : Pandemic Not Closing , But Consolidating
" Pandemic Studios and its franchises will be relocated to the EALA facility in nearby Playa Vista , " explained the company .
" This move has resulted in a reduction in the work force at Pandemic ... That said , the Pandemic brand and franchises will continue to live on .
A core team of Pandemic developers will move to EALA and continue development on Pandemic games with a focus on quality , cost management and schedule integrity . "
The consolidation is part of Electronic Arts ' recently revealed cost reduction plan , which aims to save the company roughly $ 100 million through " the closure of several facilities and a headcount reduction of approximately 1,500 positions . "
EA acquired Pandemic alongside Mass Effect developer BioWare for $ 860 million back in 2007 .
The fate of Pandemic 's two unannounced projects remains unclear , with the studio's long - coming World War II stealth - action game The Saboteur due on December 8 .

RIP ClarisWorks , " the best - loved application for the Mac " , 1991 - 2007 .
A Brief History of ClarisWorks
As seen by Bob Hearn
This page is now also available in French , thanks to Stéphane Ascoët .
There seems to be a lot of confusion surrounding the relationship of the various programs named AppleWorks and ClarisWorks .
This is not helped by the fact that Apple renamed ClarisWorks to AppleWorks a couple of years ago .
In fact , there have been three completely different programs known as AppleWorks .
This history is not about the first one , which was a text - based program for the Apple II .
People also seem to confuse Claris the company and ClarisWorks the program .
In fact , Claris was around long before ClarisWorks , as explained below .
GS
Our main programming effort at StyleWare became an integrated application for the II GS , to be called GSWorks .
This would have word processing , graphics , spreadsheet , etc .
This turned out to be a very difficult undertaking - the II GS was not really a powerful enough machine to support its color graphical UI , and GSWorks was a very large and complicated program .
The Macintosh was an 8
Mhz machine with a 1 - bit display ; the II GS was a 2.8 MHz machine with a 2 - or 4 - bit display .
Furthermore , at that time application software for the II GS had to be written in assembly language .
To help tackle this project we added a few more programmers ( including the notoriously bathrobe - clad Ian Mitchell ) .
Naturally Claris was interested in this forthcoming AppleWorks - like program for the II GS .
In 1988 , Claris bought StyleWare , moved the development team to its offices in Santa Clara , and rechristened GSWorks as AppleWorks GS .
( I was already living in the SF bay area by then : I 'd moved out in 1987 to be with my fiancé , Liz Harding , who was in grad school at Berkeley . )
By late 1988 , AppleWorks GS was ready to ship .
Well , ready or not , it was shipped2 .
The plan at this point had been to reorganize the StyleWare team around a project to write an integrated application for the Macintosh .
This would compete against Microsoft Works - a daunting prospect , even in 1988 .
Apparently Claris decided it was too daunting ; after we finished AppleWorks GS , the plan was changed .
The StyleWare programmers were distributed throughout the other Mac projects .
Scott Holdaway wound up on the MacWrite II team ; I was on the MacDraw II team3 .
In spite of the change of plans , Claris was in many ways a great place to be .
It had inherited some Apple culture , which appealed to me , and there was a strong sense that we were creating the best , cleanest software out there .
Years later I realized that this feeling had led to a certain blindness to the pace at which the rest of the industry was moving .
In its effort to produce slick , bug - free software , Claris was neglecting the hard reality that sheer number of features sells , independent of elegance of design .
Some products , such as MacWrite Pro , were delayed so long by stringent quality assurance requirements that they lost their effectiveness in the market .
Eventually , in April 1989 , Scott Holdaway and I decided that our jobs were not what we'd had in mind when we joined Claris : we wanted to write new software , not maintain old software .
So , we left Claris to form our own company , Spartacus Software , which would create the Mac integrated application .
Almost everyone at Claris told us we were crazy : how could two programmers on their own compete against Microsoft ?
The one exception was Yogen Dalal , VP of Engineering .
He thought we had a good chance .
Claris gave us some equipment in return for the right of first refusal if we wound up selling our company .
( This turned out to be a great deal for Claris . ) Spartacus ' " seed capital " amounted to about $ 10,000 .
I remember picking up our computers from the Apple store like it was yesterday .
It was incredibly exciting .
The two of us were about to take on Microsoft , and we knew we could do it !
Bob and Scott hard at work
All " integrated software " to date was effectively several separate programs , loosely stitched together .
For multiple reasons we had to do better than this .
First , to do something new and interesting .
Second , two programmers cannot write a competitive stand - alone word processor , spreadsheet , graphics program , and database program in a year or so .
Third , application size was a big deal in those days : Microsoft Works was a big program ; we wanted to do better .
We came up with a frame - based approach .
Most of the functionality particular to the various application types was packaged up into " frames " : word processing frames , graphics frames , etc .
These frames were then used as building blocks to make documents of the appropriate types , in a unified programming framework .
E.g. , a word processing document was essentially a bunch of text frames , one per page , linked together .
( Doing this neatly was a big challenge - many subsequent efforts at building a component - based architecture ( e.g. OpenDoc ) have failed to take into account the top - level user interface requirements . )
The result was that not only was most of the code shared across the document types , but the application was also truly integrated - the frames could be embedded in each other .
E.g. , you could plop a spreadsheet frame right into your word processing document .
Text objects in a graphics document had a full - featured word processing engine behind them .
The database form editor used the built - in graphics environment .
Etc .
One related cool thing we had was a " shared graphical context " mechanism : sometimes , stuff would wind up being displayed in multiple frames at once .
E.g. , maybe you 're dragging an object across a page break in a document with multiple pages ( like this ) .
We developed a general architecture for displaying actions live in multiple contexts .
Of course , a lot of this kind of stuff is old hat today , but it was new and exciting in 1989 .
Some creative programming was required to do these things efficiently on the hardware of the time .
There were some cool features that did n't make it into the shipping product .
For example , originally spreadsheet formulas were much more powerful : you could relate , e.g. , graphical object positions and document properties to spreadsheet cells .
So you could have the result of a calculation move objects around graphically , or vice - versa .
( Further work in this direction led to a novel constraint - based programming paradigm called MOOSE , which I may resurrect some day ... )
Our work was interrupted in October by the Loma Prieta earthquake .
This was the magnitude 7.1 quake that interrupted the world series .
Having lived in the bay area for a few years , I 'd been through several quakes , but nothing had prepared me for this one .
I was sure the house was going to collapse .
Of course , it did n't .
By around November , we had made great progress - all the document types were more or less functional .
Scott had done most of the word processing code , I 'd done graphics and most of the overall framework , and everything else we'd both had a hand in .
There was a lot of work left to be done , but we figured it was time to start shopping the program around .
We did n't want to be unemployed forever .
We had wanted all along to take the program back to Claris , and finish it with our friends from StyleWare .
We gave the Claris execs a demo , and they were impressed .
Around about then Claris decided that it really did make sense to be in the Mac integrated market after all .
They would buy either us , or a competing effort called SmartWorks .
They preferred our program .
But when it came time to talk numbers , things did n't work out .
Claris said " we 'll give you X " ; we 'd had in mind more like 6X .
Maybe we were greedy - X was n't bad for less than a year of work .
But we had written it , it was ours , and we thought it was worth a lot more .
And of course , Claris had first rights of refusal ( meaning they had the right to match any other offer ) - they had nothing to lose by letting us shop it elsewhere .
Then one day we got a call from Kyle Mashima , who had been a marketing executive at Claris when we worked there .
He knew about us , and had left Claris to join a venture capital firm .
He arranged a demo for Guy Kawasaki ( former Apple evangelist , former president of ACIUS4 ) .
Guy came over to our house , we gave a demo , and he loved it .
He said , " Why do n't you guys move into my office in Palo Alto .
I 'll move into my wife 's office , across the hall . "
Seriously !
This was way cool .
Everybody knew who Guy Kawasaki was .
We 'd read in the Mercury News a couple of months earlier that he had left ACIUS ; there was rampant speculation on where he'd go next .
We 'd joked that we should get him to be the president of Spartacus .
That was now a distinct possibility .
However , there were other options to consider ; Kyle had agreed to act as our agent in offering our program to various companies .
The next couple of months were a whirlwind of demos and crunch development .
We did indeed move into Guy 's office , rent free - literally , he moved out , across the hall .
( He left up his Porsche posters to help keep us motivated . )
At the same time we were looking for buyers , we were scoping out the possible structures for our own company that would actually produce and market our program , with Guy as president and Kyle as VP of marketing .
This was an exciting time , a complete turnaround from the recent depths of despair .
We were living every Mac hacker 's dream .
It would have been a great adventure to start the company with Guy and Kyle , but in the end , the competitive offers we started getting made Claris sit up and take notice .
Claris wound up offering us everything we 'd wanted , and more ; it was impossible to refuse .
This was our chance to rejoin the StyleWare crew , and have the Claris stamp of quality on our work .
( Guy and Kyle were n't left out in the cold - they received an agent 's fee .
Guy now runs Garage Technology Ventures , and Kyle is now VP of strategic development at Adobe . )
I 'll always wonder how it would have turned out had we taken the other course .
In July 1990 , we sold our program to Claris .
At this point things were going great , but there were still a few speedbumps on the road to a successful shipping product .
As mentioned above , Claris never went public .
Right after Claris bought Spartacus , Apple decided to keep Claris as a permanent subsidiary .
This was not in line with the expectations of the executive staff at Claris .
Shortly after we arrived , Claris ' president resigned .
Over the next year , most of the executive staff also left .
The general turmoil complicated all activities at Claris .
We were joined by StyleWare programmers Tom Hoke and Scott Lindsey in our effort to finish the product , now code - named " Terminator " ( because that 's what we were going to do to Microsoft Works ) .
Mate Gross , who had been a tester for AppleWorks GS , headed up the Terminator test team .
On the marketing side , Bob Lisbonne joined as product manager .
ClarisWorks would not have become the product it did without the hard work of these and many other talented people at Claris .
The actual product name had yet to be chosen .
In line with MacWrite , MacDraw , etc. , we wanted our program to be called MacWorks .
But that name belonged to a program that let Lisas emulate Macs .
( The Lisa was the ancestor of the Macintosh . )
Also , Claris wanted to get away from the " Mac " names , because producing Windows versions of their products was a future possibility .
For a while " FireWorks " was the leading candidate , but that name was owned by someone who had some fire station - management software ; he was unwilling to part with the name5 .
" Revolution " was also an option .
In the end " ClarisWorks " was chosen , more by default than anything else .
I 'll skip most of the details of the next year and a half , which is how long it took to finish ClarisWorks after we sold it to Claris .
This was far longer than we had planned .
Some of this was due to adding features , some to Claris ' stringent quality assurance , and some simply to misestimation of the amount of work required .
Suffice it to say that we worked long and hard .
Towards the end of this period it became critical that we ship a product soon .
We were n't the only ones trying to shoot down Microsoft Works .
There were also SmartWorks ( the program Claris did n't buy ) and BeagleWorks .
SmartWorks had been bought by Symantec ( who had also been very interested in Spartacus ) , and relabeled as GreatWorks .
BeagleWorks was another integrated product , put out by Beagle Bros .
All three were due out at around the same time , to take advantage of Apple 's newly - introduced lower - cost Macintosh models .
These were the Mac Classic , the Mac LC , and the Mac IIsi .
All were less expensive than the existing Mac II line , and targeted at education , which was also a big part of our target market .
These machines shipped in configurations with only a megabyte of RAM ; achieving acceptable performance on these models was a major technical requirement for ClarisWorks .
Finally , ClarisWorks 1.0 was certified golden master in October , 1991 , and began shipping to the public .
Initial reviews were positive , and sales began to take off .
Liz and I celebrated with a trip to Hawaii , where I was thrilled to see ClarisWorks on the shelves in the computer stores .
ClarisWorks quickly surpassed Microsoft Works in sales and popularity .
Early in 1992 , Microsoft shipped a new version of Microsoft Works , with the claim " Best - Selling Integrated Application for the Macintosh " on the cover of the box .
Claris Legal forced them to remove this inaccurate text .
( Microsoft initially objected that Claris ' sales numbers were based on copies of ClarisWorks bundled with Macs , but in fact retail sales were also better than Microsoft's , in number and in revenue . )
For once , Microsoft had been beaten in the marketplace , in a category in which it had been dominant .
By this time , development on ClarisWorks 2.0 was well under way ...
In due course we finished ClarisWorks 2.0 .
Sales were still strong , and ClarisWorks was winning lots of awards .
At least according to one Claris marketing presentation I saw , ClarisWorks was outselling Microsoft Office ( presumably by units , not revenue ) .
For a couple of years , ClarisWorks was a $ 100 million product .
Now it was time to think about 3.0 , but by this time the down side of moving to Portland began to manifest itself .
Claris management had continued to turn over , and Scott and I no longer had any close ties with the latest management team .
By isolating ourselves , we had freed ourselves from a lot of the daily hassles we'd had in Santa Clara ; this let us focus on programming .
But in reality , losing contact was too high a price to pay , both for the development team as a whole , and for Scott and me personally .
We had a hard time negotiating the contract for ClarisWorks 3.0 .
Development on 3.0 did not go particularly smoothly .
Claris needed a new version on the market before all the features were ready , and shipped a version with a small number of feature upgrades as 3.0 , against Scott 's and my wishes .
The feature set we had agreed to eventually shipped as ClarisWorks 4.0 .
By the time ClarisWorks 4.0 shipped , Claris ' vision of the future of the product was too different from mine for me to continue working on it .
One thing required was integration with OpenDoc , which necessitated a massive restructuring of the program .
OpenDoc was designed to tackle a lot of the same problems that ClarisWorks tackled , and each project had its own ideas and metaphors for component integration and interface architecture .
The two directions were not particularly compatible .
I left after 4.0 to pursue other interests ; Scott and the rest of the development team stayed on .
Before ClarisWorks 5.0 was finished , the rift between Claris and the remaining development team grew too wide .
Scott Holdaway , Tom Hoke , Scott Lindsey , Bruce Hammond , and Carl Grice left Claris , and formed what would later become Gobe Software .
These were the core engineers , the ones who had been on the project the longest .
Several newer engineers remained .
Three in particular were responsible for OpenDoc integration .
At Apple WWDC '96 , they demoed a version of ClarisWorks with OpenDoc support .
Apple was particularly eager to demonstrate to developers that a flagship product was supporting the new component technology - ergo , everyone else should too .
Not surprisingly ( to me , anyway ) , the following week the three engineers were recruited by Microsoft .
Result : no OpenDoc support in ClarisWorks 5.0 .
That maneuver is just one typical example of the way Microsoft stifles competition .
Ironically , in this case it hit a product conceived in defiance of the Microsoft way .
Meanwhile , the guys at Gobe ( whom I had since joined ) were working on Gobe Productive .
This product was the next logical step beyond ClarisWorks , with a more open architecture , but written for the Be operating system ( BeOS ) .
There is an interesting back - story here .
When Gobe was founded , in late 1996 , speculation was widespread that Apple would buy Be , and BeOS would become the basis of the next Mac OS .
Thus , Gobe would have a leg up on development for the new platform .
However , Apple surprised everyone by buying NeXT instead of Be. NeXTStep became the basis for Mac OS X , and the writing was then on the wall for Be , although most of us refused to read it .
BeOS did not survive in the marketplace ; thus , neither did Gobe .
At times over the past few years , there have been rumors and speculation that Apple was working with / had reacquired Gobe and / or the original ClarisWorks team , to produce a new Mac version of AppleWorks based on Gobe Productive .
Apple and Gobe did indeed discuss possibilities at various points in Gobe 's history ; however , I am not at liberty to go into details .
Apple did not in the end acquire Gobe as such , but three of its founders , Scott Holdaway , Scott Lindsey , and Carl Grice , did rejoin Apple as employees when Gobe failed .
They wo n't tell me what they are up to ( even off the record ! ) , but whatever it is , it does not involve the Gobe Productive codebase .
Nor , I am reasonably sure , does it involve the ClarisWorks / AppleWorks codebase .
As for myself , I went back to grad school , to study artificial intelligence at the MIT AI lab .
( Ironically , although I dragged the team to Oregon , and I was always the most die - hard Apple enthusiast of the bunch , I 'm now the one who 's left Oregon , and Apple .
I miss them both ! )
I 'm depressed at the lack of progress AppleWorks has made over the past few years ( although I still use it on a daily basis ) , and I wish I had found a way to keep it moving forward .
I also wish there were an alternative , that had the simplicity and tight integration we spent so much effort crafting into ClarisWorks .
I can think of nothing I 'd rather do than help create a modern version of ClarisWorks - except finish my thesis !
Here 's hoping others can carry the torch forward .
ClarisWorks User Stories
Please especially let me know if you remember some important part of ClarisWorks history I 've forgotten to mention , or misremembered .
Notes
Those who are excessively nosy or observant might have noticed that the ClarisWorks file creator ID is BOBO .
Why BOBO ?
This is actually related to TopDraw .
When Jeff and I sat down to spec out TopDraw , we played around a lot with MacDraw .
One excessively silly creation ( aided by my wife , Liz ) was " My Dog Bo-bo " .
Alas , Bo-bo has been lost in the depths of time , but he lives on in every ClarisWorks file .
2 For more about the history of AppleWorks GS , see Gareth Jones ' Life and Times of AppleWorks GS .
3 During this period , a new hire joined the graphics group : Pierre Omidyar .
He would later go on to found eBay .
Pierre and I frequently bounced software design issues off of each other ; I think those discussions were useful to me later when designing ClarisWorks .
4 ACIUS was the other company ( besides Claris ) created by Apple in an effort to divest itself of application software .
The idea was to convince 3rd party developers that Apple was not competing with them .
In this case a relational database program , known as Silver Surfer , became 4D .
ACIUS sells 4D to this day .
It was a running joke at ACIUS to refer to Claris as BCIUS : Bill Campbell Inherits Used Software .
( Bill Campbell was the president of Claris . )
5 He must have sold the name eventually - now , of course , Fireworks is a web graphics program , by Macromedia .

Open of lock file " / HITS /.lck " failed .
I recently came across the work of Steven Bratman , a medical doctor whose studies and experiences make him a highly regarded expert in alternative medicine .
Of particular interest to me is a book that he wrote called Health Food Junkies : Orthorexia Nervosa : Overcoming the Obsession with Healthful Eating .
I would like to thank Dr. Bratman for graciously giving me permission to share the following article that he wrote on this topic with our guests .
- Ben Kim , D.C .
Orthorexia Nervosa : The Health Food Eating Disorder
by Steven Bratman , M.D .
Because I am a physician who practices alternative medicine , patients who come to me often begin the conversation by asking whether they can be cured through diet .
" Regular medical doctors do n't know anything about nutrition , " they say , believing this will build rapport with me .
I feel obligated to nod wisely .
I agree that conventional medicine has traditionally paid too little attention to the effects of diet .
However , I am no longer the true believer in nutritional medicine I used to be .
My attitude has grown cautious where once it was enthusiastic and even evangelical .
I have lost two beliefs that once encouraged me , and that are still widely accepted by others who promote dietary methods of healing .
One of these is an assumption that there exists a comprehensive and consistent theory of healing diseases through nutrition .
The other is a faith that dietary therapy is a uniformly wholesome , side effect free intervention .
My attitude has not always been so lukewarm .
Twenty years ago I was a wholehearted , impassioned advocate of healing through food .
My optimism was unbounded as I set forth to cure myself and everyone else .
This was long before I became an alternative physician .
In those days , I was a cook and organic farmer at a large commune in upstate New York .
My experiences there formed the foundation of my early interest in alternative medicine , and continue to give me insight into the ideals , dreams and contradictions that underlie the natural health movement .
All communes attract idealists .
Ours attracted food idealists .
As a staff cook I was required to prepare several separate meals at once to satisfy the insistent and conflicting demands of the members .
The main entree was always vegetarian .
However , a small but vocal group insisted on an optional serving of meat .
Since many vegetarians would not eat from pots and pans contaminated by fleshly vibrations , this meat had to be cooked in a separate kitchen .
The cooks also had to satisfy the Lacto - ovo - vegetarians , or Vegans , who eschewed all milk and egg products .
The rights of the non-garlic , non-onion , Hindu - influenced crowd could not be neglected either .
They believed onion - family foods provoked sexual desire .
For the raw foodists ( and young children ) we always laid out trays of sliced raw vegetables .
However , a visitor once tried to convince me that chopping a vegetable would destroy its etheric field .
I chased him out of the kitchen with a huge Chinese cleaver .
The macrobiotic adherents clamored for cooked vegetables , free , of course , from " deadly nightshade " plants such as tomatoes , potatoes , bell peppers and eggplants .
Some also insisted on eating fruits and vegetables only when they were in season , while other communalists intemperately demanded oranges in January .
Besides these opinions on which food to serve , there were as many opinions on the manner in which it should be prepared .
Most everyone agreed that nothing could be boiled in aluminum , except the gourmet cooks , who insisted that only aluminum would spread the heat satisfactorily .
By consensus , we always steamed vegetables in the minimum amount of water to avoid throwing away precious vitamins .
Certain enthusiasts would even hover around the kitchen and volunteer to drink the darkish liquids left behind .
About washing vegetables , however , controversy swirled .
Some commune members firmly believed that vital substances clinging just under the skins must be preserved at all costs .
Others felt that a host of evil pollutants adhered to the same surfaces that needed to be vigorously scrubbed away .
One visitor explained that the best policy was to dip all vegetables in bleach , and gave such a convincing argument for her belief that we would have adopted the principle at once were it not for a fortuitous bleach shortage .
I used to fantasize writing a universal cookbook for eating theorists .
Each food would come complete with a citation from one system or authority claiming it the most divine edible ever created , and another , from an opposing view , damning it as the worst pestilence one human being ever fed to another .
This would not be difficult .
For example , a famous naturopathic concept proclaims that raw fruits and vegetables are the ideal foods .
Some proponents of this school exclaim periodically " the greatest enemy of man is the cooking stove ! "
However , another popular theory bans raw foods as unhealthy , and attributes to their consumption such illnesses as MS , rheumatoid arthritis and cancer .
I am referring to macrobiotics .
This influential system of alternative dietary principles insists that all vegetables should be cooked ; fruits should not be eaten at all .
Similar discrepancies abound in alternative dietary medicine .
The following rules may be found in one or another food theory :
Spicy food is bad .
Cayenne peppers are health promoting .
Fasting on oranges is healthy .
Citrus fruits are too acidic .
Fruits are the ideal food .
Fruit causes candida .
Milk is good only for young cows .
Pasteurized milk is even worse .
Boiled milk " is the food of the gods . "
Fermented foods , such as sauerkraut , are essentially rotten .
Fermented foods aid digestion .
Sweets are bad .
Honey is nature 's most perfect food .
Vinegar is a poison .
Apple cider vinegar cures most illnesses .
Proteins should not be combined with starches .
Aduki beans and brown rice should always be cooked together .
The discovery that nutritional medicine was so chaotic troubled me .
Yet I could always hope that a universal theory of nutrition might eventually be found .
What disturbed me more was observing the extremism that so frequently develops among those who propound dietary cures .
I remember a macrobiotic seminar at the commune , led by Mr. L. of the Kushi institute .
An audience of at least thirty - five listened with rapt attention as Mr. L. lectured on the evils of milk .
It slows the digestion , he explained , clogs the metabolism , plugs the arteries , dampens the digestive fire , and causes mucous , respiratory diseases and cancer .
At that time , a member of the commune by the name of John lived in a small room upstairs from the seminar hall .
He was a " recovering " alcoholic who rather frequently failed to abstain .
Although only in his fifties , John 's face showed the marks of a lifetime of alcohol abuse .
But he had been on the wagon for nearly six months when he tiptoed through the class .
John was a shy and private man who would never voluntarily have so exposed himself .
But upon returning from the kitchen with a beverage he discovered that there was no way he could reach his room without crossing through the crowded seminar .
The leader noticed him immediately .
Pointing to the glass of milk in John 's hand , Mr. L. boomed , " Do n't you realize what that stuff is doing to your body , sir !
Class , look at him !
He is a testament to the health destroying properties of milk .
Study the puffy skin of his face .
Note the bags under his eyes .
Look at the stiffness of his walk .
Milk , class , milk has done this to him ! "
Bewildered , John looked at his glass , then up at the condemning faces , then back to the milk again .
His lower lip quivered .
" But , " he whimpered , " but , this is only milk , is n't it ? "
In the alcoholics anonymous meetings with which John was familiar , milk was practically mother 's milk , synonymous with rectitude and purity .
" I mean , " he continued , to the unforgiving students , " I mean , it is n't whiskey , is it ? "
By focusing on diet singlemindedly and ignoring all other aspects of life , alternative practitioners like Dr. L. come to practice a form of medicine that lacks a holistic perspective on life .
This is ironic , of course , since holism is one of the strongest ideals of alternative medicine , and its most ubiquitous catchphrase ( next to " natural " ) .
It would be more holistic to take time to understand the whole person before making dietary recommendations , and occasionally temper those recommendations with an acknowledgment of other elements in that person 's life .
But too often patient and alternative practitioner work together to create an exaggerated focus on food .
Many of the most unbalanced people I have ever met are those have devoted themselves to healthy eating .
In fact , I believe many of them have contracted a novel eating disorder , for which I have coined the name " orthorexia nervosa . "
The term uses " ortho , " in its meaning as straight , correct and true , to modify " anorexia nervosa . "
Orthorexia nervosa refers to a fixation on eating proper food .
Orthorexia begins innocently enough , as a desire to overcome chronic illness or to improve general health .
But because it requires considerable willpower to adopt a diet which differs radically from the food habits of childhood and the surrounding culture , few accomplish the change gracefully .
Most must resort to an iron self - discipline bolstered by a hefty sense of superiority over those who eat junk food .
Over time , what they eat , how much , and the consequences of dietary indiscretion come to occupy a greater and greater proportion of the orthorexic 's day .
The act of eating pure food begins to carry pseudo - spiritual connotations .
As orthorexia progresses , a day filled with sprouts , umeboshi plums and amaranth biscuits comes to feel as holy as one spent serving the poor and homeless .
When an orthorexic slips up , ( which , depending on the pertinent theory , may involve anything from devouring a single raisin in violation of the law to consuming a gallon of Haagen Daz ice cream and a supreme pizza ) , he experiences a fall from grace , and must take on numerous acts of penitence .
These usually involve ever stricter diets and fasts .
Over time , this " kitchen spirituality " begins to override other sources of meaning .
An orthorexic will be plunged into gloom by eating a hot dog , even if his team has just won the world series .
Conversely , he can redeem any disappointment by extra efforts at dietary purity .
Orthorexia eventually reaches a point where the sufferer spends most of his time planning , purchasing and eating meals .
The orthorexic 's inner life becomes dominated by efforts to resist temptation , self - condemnation for lapses , self - praise for success at complying with the self - chosen regime , and feelings of superiority over others less pure in their dietary habits .
It is this transference of all life 's value into the act of eating which makes orthorexia a true disorder .
In this essential characteristic , orthorexia bears many similarities to the two named eating disorders : anorexia and bulemia .
Whereas the bulimic and anorexic focus on the quantity of food , the orthorexic fixates on its quality .
All three give to food a vastly excessive place in the scheme of life .
It often surprises me how blissfully unaware proponents of nutritional medicine remain of the propensity for their technique to create an obsession .
Indeed , popular books on natural medicine seem to actively promote orthorexia in their enthusiasm for sweeping dietary changes .
No doubt , this is a compensation for the diet - averse stance of modern medicine .
However , when healthy eating becomes a disease in its own right , it is arguably worse than the health problems which began the cycle of fixation .
As often happens , my sensitivity to the problem of orthorexia comes through personal experience .
I myself passed through a phase of extreme dietary purity when I lived at the commune .
In those days , when I was n't cooking I managed the organic farm .
This gave me constant access to fresh , high - quality produce .
Eventually , I became such a snob that I disdained to eat any vegetable that had been plucked from the ground more than fifteen minutes ago .
I was a total vegetarian , chewed each mouthful of food fifty times , always ate in a quiet place ( which meant alone ) , and left my stomach partially empty at the end of each meal .
After a year or so of this self imposed regime , I felt light , clear headed , energetic , strong and self - righteous .
I regarded the wretched , debauched souls about me downing their chocolate chip cookies and fries as mere animals reduced to satisfying gustatory lusts .
But I was n't complacent in my virtue .
Feeling an obligation to enlighten my weaker brethren , I continuously lectured friends and family on the evils of refined , processed food and the dangers of pesticides and artificial fertilizers .
For two years I pursued wellness through healthy eating , as outlined by naturopathic tradition and emphasized with little change in the health food literature of today .
Gradually , however , I began to sense that something was wrong .
The need to obtain food free of meat , fat and artificial chemicals put nearly all social forms of eating out of reach .
Furthermore , intrusive thoughts of sprouts came between me and good conversation .
Perhaps most dismaying of all , I began to sense that the poetry of my life had diminished .
All I could think about was food .
But even when I became aware that my scrabbling in the dirt after raw vegetables and wild plants had become an obsession , I found it terribly difficult to free myself .
I had been seduced by righteous eating .
The problem of my life 's meaning had been transferred inexorably to food , and I could not reclaim it .
I was eventually saved from the doom of eternal health food addiction through three fortuitous events .
The first occurred when my guru in eating , a lacto - ovo - vegetarian headed on his way toward Fruitarianism , suddenly abandoned his quest .
He explained that he had received a sudden revelation .
" It came to me last night in a dream , " he said .
" Rather than eat my sprouts alone , it would be better for me to share a pizza with some friends . "
I looked at him dubiously , but did not completely disregard his message .
The second event occurred when an elderly gentleman ( whom I had been visiting as a volunteer home - health aide ) offered me a piece of Kraft Swiss cheese .
Normally , I would n't have considered accepting .
I did not eat cheese , much less pasteurized , processed and artificially flavored cheese .
Worse still , I happened to be sick with a head cold that day .
According to my belief system at that time , if I fasted on juice I would be over the cold in a day .
However , if I allowed great lumps of indigestible dairy products to adhere to my innards I would no doubt remain sick for a week -- if I did not go on to develop pneumonia .
But , Mr. Davis was earnest and persistent in his expression of gratitude , and would have taken as a personal rebuke my refusal of the cheese .
Shaking with trepidation , I chewed the dread processed product .
To my great surprise , it seemed to have a healing effect .
My cold symptoms disappeared within an hour .
It was as if my acceptance of his gratitude healed me .
Nonetheless , even after this miracle I could not let go .
I actually quit visiting Davis to avoid further defiling myself .
This was a shameful moment , a sign that I was drowning .
The life - ring which finally drew me out was tossed by a Benedictine monk named Brother David Stendal - Rast .
I had met him at a seminar he gave on the subject of gratitude .
Afterwards , I volunteered to drive him home , for the covert purpose of getting to know him better .
( This may be called " opportunistic volunteerism . " )
On the way to his monastery , although secretly sick of it , I bragged a bit about my oral self - discipline , hoping to impress the monk .
I thought that he would respect me for never filling my stomach more than by half , and so on .
David 's actions over the subsequent days were a marvelous example of teaching through action .
The drive was long .
In the late afternoon , we stopped for lunch at one of those out of place Chinese restaurants -- the kind that flourish in small towns where it seems no one of remotely oriental ancestry has ever lived .
As expected , all the waiters were Caucasian , but the food was unexpectedly good .
The sauces were fragrant and tasty , the vegetables fresh , and the eggrolls crisp .
We were both pleasantly surprised .
After I had eaten the small portion which sufficed to fill my stomach halfway , Brother David casually mentioned his belief that it was an offense against God to leave food uneaten on the table .
This was particularly the case when such a great restaurant had so clearly been placed in our path as a special grace .
David was a slim man and a monk , so I found it hardly credible that he followed this precept generally .
But he continued to eat so much that I felt good manners , if not actual spiritual guidance , required me to imitate his example .
I filled my belly for the first time in a year .
Then , he upped the ante .
" I always think that ice cream goes well with Chinese food , do n't you ? " he asked , blandly .
Ignoring my incoherent reply , Brother David directed us to a Friendly 's Ice Cream Parlor , and purchased me a triple scoop cone .
David led me on a two mile walk through the unexceptional town as we ate our ice cream , edifying me with spiritual stories and , in every way , keeping my mind from dwelling on the offense against Health Food I had just committed .
Later that evening , Brother David ate an immense dinner in the monastery dining room , all the while urging me to have more of one dish or another .
I understood the point .
But what mattered more was the fact that this man , for whom I had the greatest respect , was giving me permission to break my Health Food vows .
It proved a liberating stroke .
Yet , it was more than a month later that I finally decided to make a decisive break .
I was filled with feverish anticipation .
Hordes of long suppressed gluttonous desires , their legitimacy restored , clamored to receive their due .
On the twenty minute drive into town , I planned and re-planned my junk food menu .
Within ten minutes of arriving , I had eaten three tacos , a medium pizza , and a large milkshake .
I brought the ice cream sandwich and banana split home , for I was too stuffed to violate my former vows further .
My stomach was stretched to my knees .
The next morning I felt guilty and defiled .
Only the memory of Brother David kept me from embarking on a five day fast .
( I only fasted two days . )
It took me at least two more years to attain the ability to follow a middle way in eating easily , without rigid calculation or wild swings .
Anyone who has ever suffered from anorexia or bulimia will recognize classic patterns in this story : the cyclic extremes , the obsession , the separation from others .
These are all symptoms of an eating disorder .
Having experienced them so vividly in myself twenty years ago , I cannot overlook their presence in others .
For this reason , as a practicing alternative physician I often feel conflicted .
I almost always recommend dietary improvements to my patients .
How could I not ?
A low fat , semi-vegetarian diet is potent preventive medicine for nearly all major illnesses , and more focused dietary interventions can often dramatically improve specific health problems .
But I do not feel entirely innocent when I make dietary suggestions .
Like drug therapy , I have come to regard dietary modification as a treatment with serious potential side effects .
Consider Andrea , a patient of mine who once suffered from chronic asthma .
When she first came to see me , she depended on several medications to stay alive , but with my help she managed to free herself from all drugs .
The method we used involved identifying foods to which Andrea was sensitive and removing them from the diet .
Milk was the first to go , then wheat , soy and corn .
After eliminating those four foods the asthma symptoms decreased so much Andrea was able to cut out one medication .
But she was n't satisfied .
Diligent effort identified other allergens : eggs , avocado , tomatoes , barley , rye , chicken , beef , turkey , salmon and tuna .
These too Andrea eliminated , and was soon able to drop another drug entirely .
Next went broccoli , lettuce , apples , buckwheat and trout , and the rest of her medications .
Unfortunately , after about three months of feeling well Andrea began to discover that there were now other foods to which she was sensitive .
Oranges , peaches , celery and rice did n't suit her , nor potatoes , turkey or amaranth biscuits .
The only foods she could definitely tolerate were lamb and ( strangely ) white sugar .
Since she could n't actually live on those foods alone , Andrea was forced to adopt a complex rotation diet , alternating grains on a meal by meal basis , with an occasional complete abstention to allow her to " clear . "
She did the same for vegetables , with somewhat more ease since there was a greater variety to choose from .
Last week , Andrea came in for a follow - up visit , and described the present state of her life to me .
Wherever she goes , Andrea carries a supply of her own particular foods .
She does n't go many places .
Most of the time she stays at home and thinks carefully about what to eat next , because if she slips up the consequences continue for weeks .
The asthma does n't come back , but she develops headaches , nausea and strange moods .
She must continuously exert her will against cravings for foods as licentious as tomatoes and and bread .
Andrea is happy with the treatment I 've given her , and has referred many of her friends to see me .
Yet , I feel ill when I see her name on my schedule .
The first rule of medicine is " above all , do no harm . "
Have I helped Andrea by freeing her from drugs , only to draw her into the bondage of diet ?
My conscience is n't clear .
If it was cancer she had been cured of , or multiple sclerosis , I suppose the development of an obsession would n't be too high a price for physical health .
However , all Andrea had was asthma .
I have asthma too .
When she took her four medications , she had a life .
Now , all she has is a menu .
Andrea might have been better off had she never heard of dietary medicine .
I am generally lifted out of such melancholy reflections by some substantial success .
After Andrea , I saw Bob in follow - up , a man whose rheumatoid arthritis was thrown into full remission by one simple intervention : adding foods high in trace minerals to his diet .
Before he met me , he took prednisone , gold shots and high doses of anti-inflammatories .
Now he has gone a full year without a problem .
Seeing him encourages me not to give up entirely on making dietary recommendations .
But my enthusiasm will remain tempered .
Like all other medical interventions -- like all other solutions to difficult problems -- dietary medicine dwells in a grey zone of unclarity and imperfection .
It 's neither a simple , ideal treatment , as some of its proponents believe , nor the complete waste of time conventional medicine has too long presumed it to be .
Diet is an ambiguous and powerful tool , too unclear and emotionally charged for comfort , too powerful to be ignored .
Times are tough , but you have to wonder what this guy was thinking .
Stewart David Nozette , 52 , who was involved in the recent discovery of water on the Moon by the Chandrayaan - 1 spacecraft has been arrested for espionage for allegedly trying to sell details of US missile detection satellites in exchange for cash .
Nozette was attempting to sell classified information to a person who he believed was an Israeli intelligence officer .
Nozette is a fairly prominent scientist who helped conceive the 1994 Clementine mission to the Moon , and currently is a co-investigator on Chandrayaan - 1 , the Indian Moon mission , and on an instrument aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter .
According to a 16th October FBI affidavit , Nozette was contacted last month by an undercover officer posing as an agent working for the Israeli Intelligence Agency .
Nozette agreed to accept money in exchange for his past access to top secret documents .
As former government physicist , allegedly Nozette worked for almost every military shop in the US government including the Air Force ’s Phillips Laboratory , the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , the Naval Research Laboratory , and the Defense Advanced Research Project ’s Administration ( DARPA ) .
He also served on president George H. W. Bush ’s space council and worked with NASA .
This is n’t the first time Nozette has been in trouble with the government .
According to press reports , a small non-profit Nozette ran came under investigation by NASA in 2006 for misusing funds to pay for utilities , three mortgages a tennis club membership .
But this time the charges are more serious .
According to the Nature Blog , Nozette has worked for with Israeli contacts previously .
The FBI affidavit says that between 1998 and 2008 , an Israeli aerospace company “ wholly owned by the Government of the State of Israel ” paid Nozette some $ 225,000 .
“ I thought I was working for you already , ” Nozette told the agent in a transcript reproduced in the affidavit .
“ I mean that ’s what I always thought , the [ foreign company ] was just a front . ”
In September and October , Nozette allegedly provided details of a “ prototype overhead collection system ” to the FBI agent in exchange for cash payments of $ 2,000 and $ 9,000 dollars .
He will appear later today in United States District court for the District of Columbia to face a single charge of attempted espionage .

Long overdue Enum goodness in .NET 4
Posted by Reed on Monday , October 26 , 2009 · 12 Comments
The more I investigate the changes in Version 4 of the .NET framework , the more I find little tweaks that just reduce the pain of day to day programming .
For example , the System .
Enum class is getting some extra methods that finally make day to day programming a bit simpler .
The first important addition to System .
Enum is the addition of Enum .
TryParse <T >.
This has some great advantages over the .NET 3.5 and earlier parsing of enum values , including the ability to have error checking without throwing exceptions and to have type safety which avoids boxing and casting .
This just is nice – even the MSDN samples just look more clean and elegant .
Consider the original Enum .
Parse sample :
try { Colors colorValue = ( Colors ) Enum .
Parse ( typeof ( Colors ) , colorString , true ) ; } catch ( ArgumentException e ) { //
Handle errors }
In order for this to work correctly , we need to wrap the entire thing in a try / catch block to handle the potential exception , we have to cast our results from System .
Object back to “ Colors ” , and we have to specify the type explicitly ( typeof ( Colors ) ) in the call .
Not very friendly .
In .NET 4 , we can simplify this dramatically :
Colors colorValue ; if (! Enum .
TryParse( colorString , true , out colorValue ) ) { //
Handle error }
Not only is this safer ( you ’re now getting compile - time checking that it ’s the correct type of Enum ) , you do n’t have to use exception handling for a simple case like this .
In addition , you ’re avoiding boxing the result into an object and casting it back ( unboxing it ) to a Colors type .
Very nice addition !
The second addition to Enum is just as exciting – Enum .
HasFlag .
Dealing with flag enum values has always been problematic , and a source of confusion for many people .
In .NET 3.5 , if you want to check for the existence of a flag , it was odd to say the least .
For example , say we have the following flags enum :
[ Flags ] enum TestFlags { One = 1 , Two = 2 , Four = 4 , Eight = 8 , Sixteen = 16 }
In .NET 3.5 , to check for the existence of a flag , you had to write :
bool has OneFlag = ( variable & TestFlags .
One ) == TestFlags .
One ;
Definitely not short to type , and quite confusing for many beginning programmers .
Many people ( including myself ) have tried to create extension methods to ease this , the best probably being Jon Skeet ’s Unconstrained Melody , which adds a HasAny ( ) extension method for enum .
However , this approach required IL rewriting , and was impossible to accomplish in C# directly .
Version 4 of the .NET Framework finally addresses this very common scenario with the addition of Enum .
HasFlag .
This lets us simplify the above line to :
bool has OneFlag = variable .HasFlag( TestFlags .
One ) ;
This is much easier to understand , less confusing to type , and very nice overall .
Here ’s a short program demonstrating both of these new methods :
[ Flags ] enum TestFlags { One = 1 , Two = 2 , Four = 4 , Eight = 8 , Sixteen = 16 } class Program { static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { TestFlags variable ; Enum .
TryParse ( " Eight , sixteen " , true , out variable ) ; Console.WriteLine( variable ) ; Console.WriteLine(variable.HasFlag(TestFlags .
Two ) ) ; Console.WriteLine(variable.HasFlag(TestFlags .
Eight ) ) ; Console.WriteLine(variable.HasFlag(TestFlags .
Sixteen ) ) ; Console.ReadKey ( ) ; } }
When run , this outputs :
Eight , Sixteen False True True
Very nice additions !
Many online social products , and more continue to , avoid a formal timestamp format ...
2009-10-10 23:14:17 and Thu , October 29 , 2004 12:14:19 PM
... opting for more user friendly , " warm and fuzzy , " human - readable styles ... 9 days ago and 5 years ago .
As a result , the time has come for the jQuery CuteTime plugin .
CuteTime goes beyond similar tools and lets you easily : convert timestamps to ' cuter ' language - styled forms ( e.g. yesterday , 2 hours ago , last year , in the future ! ) , customize the time scales and output formatting , and dynamically update the displayed CuteTime (s ) upon request and / or automatically .
This latest update brings CuteTime into compliance with HTML5 and more !
I am happy to announce the latest version of the CuteTime jQuery plugin .
CuteTime provides the ability to easily …
convert timestamps to ‘ cuter ’ language - styled forms ( e.g. yesterday , 2 hours ago , last year , in the future ! ) ,
customize the time scales and output formatting , and
dynamically update the displayed CuteTime (s ) upon request and / or automatically .
There was some excellent feedback from many of you following the initial release of CuteTime .
And much of that feedback has been incorporated into this release .
Changes to Version 1.0.5 …
updated the ‘ cutetime ’ attribute to use HTML 5 compliant ‘ data - timestamp ’ custom attribute
updates to settings are now non-constructive
added translations .
txt to the bundle to store all contributed translations of the cuteness translations ( special thanks to Vincent Rolfs for providing the first translation , German )
minified version now compiled using YUI Compressor
CuteTime is a customizable jQuery plugin that automatically converts timestamps to formats much cuter .
Also has the ability to dynamically re-update and / or automatically update timestamps on a controlled interval .
If used by Selector , replaces the text of the provided object with a cuteTime .
If used as a function , returns a string containing a cuteTime version of the provided timestamp .
Implementation
$ ('.timestamp').cuteTime ( ) ; $ ( '.timestamp').cuteTime ({ /* OPTIONS * / } ) ; cutetime_object = $ ( '.timestamp').cuteTime ( ) ; cutetime_object.update_cuteness ( ) ; $.cuteTime ( '2009/10/12 22:11:19 ' ) ;

Let ’s see .
I think the very first thing I heard about the H1N1 vaccine availability was “ mid-October . ”
Oh , but there are problems .
We ’re going to need to push that back .
We ask that you please bear with us .
Until sometime this weekend , or perhaps even this morning , my sons ’ school ’s web site said November 9 .
Now , it has been “ postponed due to a delay in receiving the vaccine .
At this time a future date has not been set .
More information will be posted as it becomes available . ”
Some of this would have been a problem no matter how it was distributed and communicated .
There have been some interesting challenges in vaccine production , as this article details .
I think the political component here — an administration overly concerned with its image and not reality on the ground — is maddening , though .
Tevi Troy posts at Critical Condition today ( emphasis mine ) :
According to the article , the government was aware in September that the vaccine amounts they were promising would not be available , yet it is only recently , in the face of obvious shortages and people being turned away from clinics , that they have lowered their estimates from 40 million available doses to 28 million .
This was only one of a number of reduced estimates dating back to late July , when the government was predicting having 160 million available doses by this time .
The problem here is not just the vaccine shortfall , although we clearly need more vaccine supply , and soon , to deal with the H1N1 flu strain .
The problem is that government credibility is one of the most valuable and necessary commodities in a crisis ; loss of that credibility could lead to greater problems down the road .
I ’m getting really excited about turning as much of my family ’s health care as possible over to the federal government , are n’t you ?

Today marks the launch of Amazon RDS - the Amazon Relational Database Service .
Amazon RDS is a web service that makes it easy to set up , operate , and scale a relational database in the cloud .
Amazon RDS handles all the " muck " of relational database management freeing up its users to focus on their applications and business .
Fine Tuning Data Management
At Amazon we have a long history of fine tuning our data management solutions to make sure that our systems can be reliable and cost - effective as we continue to scale .
Almost from the beginning of operating the Amazon ecommerce platform it was clear that its scalability , reliability , performance , and cost - effectiveness were all dependent on the way that data was managed .
In the first years of Amazon.com the site was architected like a traditional two - tier web system : a collection of application servers connected to a backend of databases .
Many of the old - timer Amazonians recall how hard it was to scale the site and keep it reliable , as all of that work was rooted in scaling the centralized database servers .
Looking back they jokingly talk about " duct tape and WD - 40 engineering . "
With the move years ago from the two tier system to a fine grained , decentralized , service oriented architecture this changed dramatically .
In the Amazon services architecture , each service is responsible for its own data management , which means that each service team can pick exactly those solutions that are ideally suited for the particular application they are implementing .
It allows them to tailor the data management system such that they get maximum reliability and guaranteed performance at the right cost as the system scales up .
Early on already the distinction was made between key - values storage systems and structured data management .
Key - Value storage systems play a very important role in the Amazon architecture and this has ultimately led to the creation of the Amazon Simple Storage Service ( Amazon S3 ) .
Amazon S3 addresses the need for a highly scalable and reliable Key - Value data storage system while shielding customers from all the complexities such as geo-replication , capacity planning , and performance management at high scale .
Structured data management systems are traditionally served by relational databases but these sophisticated systems have their limitations , especially when it comes to scale and reliability .
Often they also require tremendous expertise to operate efficiently and reliably especially when scaling up .
Of course , a significant portion of the structured data world does not require RDBMS features such as complex transactions and relations , and can be served by a simpler , much more agile system .
Such a simple structured storage system for example does not require the use of a rigid schema and can allow attributes and indexes to be adapted on the fly .
This system has led to the creation of Amazon SimpleDB where its customers get the benefits of such a simple scalable structured storage system without having to worry about replication , backups , buffer cache optimizations , databases resizing , etc
There are a several applications and services that do need the feature richness of an RDBMS .
Until now they were served through the use of the Relational Database AMIs that are available for Amazon EC2 .
These AMIs can be launched to create a compute instance with database technologies such as Vertica , Oracle , DB2 , SQL Server , Sybase , and PostgreSQL .
These RDBMS are best used in concert with the Amazon Elastic Block Store ( EBS ) to create a scalable and reliable storage volume that can be used for persisting the databases .
As I mentioned earlier , running your own database system efficiently and reliably requires expertise and dedication of resources .
Quite a few of our AWS customers are running relational databases , either because they require the specific relational functionality or because they are using software packages that have been designed with RDBMS as the database solution .
These customers typically spend a significant amount of time in database management .
Indeed , for many of these customers database management is yet another form of " muck " : the tremendous amount of work they have to do that does n't differentiate them and prevents that from focusing more on delivering value with their product .
For these customers who require a relational database but do not have a need to exert complete administrative control over their database server , there is now another option : the Amazon Relational Database Service ( Amazon RDS ) .
Amazon Relational Database Service
Amazon RDS provides a MySQL 5.1 relational database in the cloud .
It provides cost - efficient and resizable capacity , while managing time - consuming database administration tasks for customers .
The service takes much of the hassle out of setting up and managing relational databases , such as backups and code patching , freeing up its users to focus on their applications and business
Amazon RDS provides the full capabilities of a MySQL Database , which means that libraries , applications and tools that have been designed for use with MySQL can be used without modification .
This makes it very simple for customers to start using Amazon RDS .
As with all AWS services Amazon RDS is a scalable resource ; its storage , processing power and memory usage can be adjusted on demand and the customer only pays for those resources that have been used .
Amazon RDS is a very important addition to our offering of database solutions as it addresses a significant stumbling block for many of our customers ; the management of relational databases .
Amazon RDS makes this much simpler which will free up resources at our customers to focus on contributions that really matter to their customers .
AWS customers now have three database solutions available :
Amazon RDS for when the application requires a relational database but you want to reduce the time you spend on database management , Amazon RDS automates common administrative tasks to reduce your complexity and total cost of ownership .
Amazon RDS allows you to manage your database compute and storage resources with a simple API call , and only pay for the infrastructure resources they actually consume .

Amazon EC2 - Relational Database AMIs for when the application require the use of a particular relational database and / or when the customer wants to exert complete administrative control over their database .
An Amazon EC2 instance can be used to run a database , and the data can be stored within an Amazon Elastic Block Store ( Amazon EBS ) volume .
Amazon EBS is a fast and reliable persistent storage feature of Amazon EC2 .
Available AMIs include IBM DB2 , Microsoft SQL Server , MySQL , Oracle , PostgreSQL , Sybase , and Vertica .

Amazon SimpleDB for applications that do not require a relational model , and that principally demand index and query capabilities .
Amazon SimpleDB eliminates the administrative overhead of running a highly - available production database , and is unbound by the strict requirements of a RDBMS .
With Amazon SimpleDB , you store and query data items via simple web services requests , and Amazon Simple DB does the rest .
In addition to handling infrastructure provisioning , software installation and maintenance , Amazon Simple DB automatically indexes your data , creates geo-redundant replicas of the data to ensure high availability , and performs database tuning on customers ' behalf .
Amazon SimpleDB also provides no - touch scaling .
There is no need to anticipate and respond to changes in request load or database utilization ; the service simply responds to traffic as it comes and goes , charging only for the resources consumed .

In a bleakly beautiful island landscape , some strange new sights are emerging .
In the turbulent waters off the shores of Orkney , in the far north of Scotland , an array of bizarre machines is being deployed in a drive to harness the power of the sea .
The European Marine Energy Centre at Stromness is playing host to nearly a dozen experimental devices designed to capture the energy of the tides and the waves .
It is too early to tell if any of them will work on a large scale or ever succeed commercially .
But during lucky breaks in Orkney 's fearsome winter weather , I got the chance to see two of the devices in action .
There is the " Oyster " , a giant flap twice the height of a double - decker bus which swings back and forth with the waves .
There is huge potential - absolutely huge amounts of energy out there
Neil Kermode
European Marine Energy Centre Every time the flap moves , the action compresses hydraulic pumps which force water through a pipe to the shore where it drives a generator .
As we approach through a heavy swell , the bright yellow top of the flap rears up above the surface of the sea before being plunged back down by the next wave .
The machine is the work of the Scottish firm Aquamarine Power .
Operations manager Frances Tierney , on board with us , says that its first few weeks have proved it can work .
" It was quite nerve - wracking installing it but we 're really pleased with how the Oyster has performed so far . "
The company 's hope is to set up " farms " of Oysters , with 2MW of electricity being generated for every three machines , according to company officials .
' Huge potential ' Matthias Haag , Aquamarine 's chief operating officer , told me that , in theory , 1,500 Oysters could yield one gigawatt ( 1GW ) of electricity - about the output of a typical fossil fuel power station .
" Our studies have identified sites where the waves mean we could generate 5GW of electricity - it 's got huge potential . "
Another approach is to harness the power of the tides .
Between Orkney and the Scottish mainland , the Pentland Firth sees high - speed currents surging from the Atlantic to the North Sea and back again .
These can reach more than eight knots - nearly 10 miles per hour - and the flows last six hours in each direction .
In a notoriously fast - flowing channel known as the Fall of Warness , the Irish firm OpenHydro has deployed an enormous undersea turbine - a fan with a diameter of 6 m .
The Oyster wave power machine swings back and forth with the waves
Fitted between black stilts , this huge device sits near the sea-bed right in the path of the currents .
As the waters surge , the massive blades start spinning and drive a generating system fitted within the machine 's frame .
The electricity is then piped ashore .
During our visit , the turbine is lifted out of the sea so we can film it .
Rising slowly from the choppy grey waters , it looks like something from a Bond film .
Operations manager Sue Barr tells me that this is the company 's fourth version of the turbine .
The plan is for a 10 m - diameter device which could generate 1MW of power .
" We 're great fans of all forms of renewable energy but tidal is the only one that 's predictable .
We predict it with the sun and the moon - that 's a very persuasive argument for investment . "
Winners and losers
Other marine schemes involve systems of underwater propellers to spin in the tides or giant " snakes " whose joints move with the waves and generate power .
There is no doubting the ambition .
But this is a watery , green equivalent to the start of the steam age : lots of clever ideas but the inevitability that there will be winners and losers .
The technologies are in their infancy , the costs at this stage are very high and still unknown are the practical implications of deploying hundreds or thousands of machines at sea .
There are many ideas for capturing the power of tides and waves
And unresolved are the costly and controversial challenges of having to run new cables into the National Grid and then onto major population centres .
Neil Kermode of the European Marine Energy Centre is keen to be realistic about the prospects and not to hype expectations .
State funding , relatively meagre until now , is being increased and private funds are being raised too .
" We 're at the stage of needing to see which of these technologies works and whether they can be scaled up .
That requires steady investment .
" Look what the Danes did with wind : investments year after year paid off and now they earn billions in exports .
" There is huge potential - absolutely huge amounts of energy out there - in fact we do n't know how much but it is epic . "
Mr Kermode 's concern is that funding remains consistent so that the different systems can be developed - and given a chance to prove themselves - in the UK .
" There is an absolute risk that we could fail to develop the technology that gets the energy out of the sea .
" If we 're not careful we could end up buying this technology from overseas later on , which would be silly . "
With its island heritage and experience of North Sea oil and gas , Britain should be ideally placed to pioneer marine energy .
As we leave in the dark of mid-afternoon , a storm drives rain across the runway .
I think of the waves pounding the brave new machines out at sea .
Are they the first foot - soldiers of an impending energy revolution or costly forays into the deep that may never really succeed ?
The next few years will tell .

The Obama administration will not seek to arrest medical marijuana users and suppliers as long as they conform to state laws , under new policy guidelines to be sent to prosecutors .
US Justice Department officials said prosecutors would be told it was not a good use of their time to arrest people who used or provided marijuana for medical purposes such as pain relief .
The new policy is a significant departure from the Bush administration , which insisted it would continue to enforce government anti-pot laws .
Fourteen states allow some use of marijuana for medical purposes .

National Assembly
08.11.2009 18:49
Iceland 's National Assembly , planned for 14 November , is a unique attempt to capture the wisdom of the crowd .
This is probably the first time that a statistically representative sample of a whole nation is not only surveyed by mail or telephone , but actually brought together for a whole day of discussions .
1,200 Icelanders from the age 18 and up , chosen randomly from the National Registry , will be invited to the Assembly in Reykjavik , along with 300 specially invited representatives
of organisations and institutions in Iceland .
They will be asked to name the values , Icelandic society should be based upon , as well as their vision for Iceland 's future and possible ways of action to rebuild the country 's economy and society .
The results will be freely available to anyone who wants to take part in the rebuilding effort .
The National Assembly is a grassroots initiative , organised by a non-partisan group of people who call themselves the Anthill .
All preparations for the Assembly are done by volunteers and the project is mostly financed through multiple donations of companies and individuals .
A father of two was kicked to death by three teenagers in Cambridgeshire for asking for a light and " not saying goodbye " , a jury has heard .
Piotr Bielicki , 25 , was walking home in Peterborough when the men attacked him , Cambridge Crown Court heard .
Erikas Cicienas , now 20 , Ricardas Kozevnikovas , 19 , and Augustinas Baltrunas , 19 , all of Peterborough , deny murder .
More than 60 injuries were found on Mr Bielicki's body , the court heard .
Prosecutor Nigel Godsmark said the attack , on 13 September last year , was " savage " , " casual " and " mindless " .
Imprint of shoe Mr Bielicki's alleged attackers , who were then aged 18 and 19 , kicked him so hard in the stomach that blood vessels broke , he added .
One stamped on his head and left an imprint of a shoe before the group took his mobile phone and left him on the ground , the court heard .
Mr Godsmark said all three had denied knowledge of the attack when questioned by detectives .
But Mr Baltrunas had told friends how Mr Bielicki had been set upon after asking for a light and " not saying goodbye " .
Fibres matching the victim's clothes had been found on Mr Baltrunas 's clothing and blood matching Mr Bielicki's had been found on shoes worn by Mr Cicienas and Mr Kozevnikovas , said Mr Godsmark .
Mr Cicienas had also taken the SIM card from Mr Bielicki's mobile , transferred it to his phone , then made a call to his girlfriend , the court heard .
Captured on CCTV
The three men had been sitting on a bench drinking beer when Mr Bielicki walked by at about 2100 BST .
" He was attacked , punched and kicked and left lying on the ground close to the bench and the beer cans from which these three defendants had been drinking , " said Mr Godsmark .
The three men were filmed by CCTV cameras as they made their way around Peterborough after the attack , and Mr Kozevnikovas was seen to kick a homeless man in the head after he asked for change , Mr Godsmark said .
The court heard Mr Bielicki had moved from his native Poland - where he had studied business management - in 2005 to look for work .
The trial continues .

I had come to the workshop to get a better understanding of the historical events behind this autumn ’s comedy , The Men Who Stare at Goats , which is based on a true story about the US military .
The film is inspired by the events laid out in journalist Jon Ronson ’s extensively researched book by the same name about a group of soldiers , who allegedly called themselves ‘ The Jedi ’ , and who were trained to be able to fight wars in esoteric and “ non-violent ” ways .
According to the book , their methods and objectives included learning to live off nuts , learning to be invisible , deterring the enemy with ‘ sparkly eyes ’ , walking through walls and , ultimately , killing goats by staring at them .
At least two veteran soldiers claim to have accomplished this sophisticated final stage of the training .
Winter is just around the corner , and you know what that means : scarf season !
Yes , one of the best parts of winter ’s arrival is my favorite style basic : scarves .
They ’re easy to throw on and a definite staple for fall .
Problem is , scarves cost money , so being the economically responsible person I am , I decided to whip up not one but TWO scarves from one shirt , and best of all , they ’re FREE !
So do you know what time it is ?
That ’s right - get your scissors out , girls : it ’s DIY time !
I ’m going to show you how to make a fringed scarf AND a tube scarf from one t- shirt , all for $ 0 dollars .
Eat your heart out , American Apparel .
What You Need :
1 . An oversized , old , and / or unwanted t- shirt
2 . A marker ( or something to make marks with )
3. Scissors
How to Make the Fringe Scarf
Step 1 :
Take the shirt of your choosing and turn it so the side you want to be visible is on the inside .
If you want to hide the decal or whatever , make sure the decal is on the outside and vice versa .
However , I just want to make a note that if you use a shirt with a design on it , the design colors will probably become visible one way or another because the fringe will flip sometimes .
So If you want a solid colored fringe scarf , use a shirt with no design on it .
Step 2 :
Measure out about 10 or so inches and make a mark in the center of the shirt .
Then make a mark on each side of the shirt about one inch above the bottom of each shirt sleeve .
Connect all three dots in an arch - like shape ( see above ) .
Step 3 :
Cut off the shirt sleeves .
( This makes it easier to cut out the scarf shape . )
Step 4 :
Cut along the arched line you drew earlier and pull apart .
( Make sure you cut both layers ! )
Put the bottom half aside ( we will use it later ) .
Step 5 :
Make a mark under the center of the neck hole and then measure about an inch away from both ends of the neck hole and make two other marks .
After you make the marks , connect them by drawing another arch .
( Do n’t stress , it does n’t have to be perfect , it ’s going to be round no matter what . )
Step 6 :
Cut along the arch line you drew and pull apart .
Step 7 :
Starting at the center , cut a straight line until you get to about half an inch away from the top of the fabric .
( Make sure you are cutting both the bottom and the top layers . )
Then measure about 2 centimeters to the left or right and cut another line .
Repeat this until you get the whole piece of fabric looking like the above picture .
Voila ! Scarf 1 Complete !
It should look something like this :
My scarf has lots of colors because the inside of the shirt I used had red and blue designs on the shirt .
I really like it – it ’s very Parisian .
However , if you want your fringe scarf to be one solid color , try and find a shirt with no design on either side in the color of your choosing , or get creative and experiment with shirts with different patterns .
How to Make the Tube Scarf :
Step 1 :
Take the remnants of the bottom half of the shirt .
( The part I told you to put aside . )
Draw a straight line across , then cut along the line .
Step 2 :
Pull apart the two fabrics .
Yay , scarf 2 is completed !
It should look something like this :
Or you can wrap it twice around your neck like this :
There you have it – two scarves from one t- shirt !
And just to give you some perspective , did you know that American Apparel ’s circle scarf , costs a whopping $ 37 dollars ?!
Meanwhile Urban Outfitter ’s similarlystyledfringescarves range from 30 - 40 dollars .
I love my AA and UO as much as the next girl , but $ 30 + dollars for a scarf ?
I think I ’ll pass - especially when you can make the exact same thing in 5 minutes and for free !
Honestly , this DIY is so easy , and versatile , I do n’t know why you would n’t want to do try it out .
You can experiment with so many patterns and designs – I get excited just thinking about the possibilities .
Your Thoughts ?
What do you guys think ?
Did you like this tutorial ?
Are you gonna be rocking your DIY scarves proudly ?

A Kurdish opposition activist convicted of carrying weapons and working against national security has been executed in western Iran , local media have said .
Kordestan province judiciary chief Ali Akbar Gharoussi told the semi-official Fars news agency that Ehsan Fatahian had been hanged in Sanandaj prison .
Human rights groups said Mr Fatahian no evidence was given at his trial proving he had engaged in armed operations .
Officials said he had admitted to being a member of the Marxist group Komalah .
They accused Komalah of waging a low - level insurgency for decades in Iran 's northern Kurdish regions , which border Iraq .
The International Campaign for Human Rights for Iran had earlier appealed to the Iranian government to halt the execution of Mr Fatahian , who was originally sentenced to 10 years in jail for conspiring against national security by being a member of Komalah .
Subsequently , the charge of " mohareb " , or enmity against God , had been added to his indictment , and his sentence changed to execution , the rights group said in a statement .

The chair of the TTC is looking to introduce a motion that would extend the high school student discount to all university and college students as well .
Last week , students from the Canadian Federation of Students launched the Fair Student Fares campaign calling on the Toronto Transit Commission to protect students from pending fare increases .
On Monday , TTC Chair Adam Giambrone announced that Tuesday , a motion will be considered to extend the high school student discount to public college and university students .
This would bring the cost of a metropass down to $ 91.25 , which is about $ 18 cheaper than the current adult fare .
The TTC is voting on the motion on Tuesday at 1 p.m. at City Hall .
There are more than 150,000 college and university students in Toronto .

India 's obsession with gold is well known around the world .
To most Western commentators , this obsession seems irrational , and Indian people seem like incurable gold bugs .
However , on closer examination , gold ownership in India is neither excessive nor irrational .
In fact , when religious , cultural , and historical perspectives are considered , India 's appetite for gold seems rather matter of fact indeed .
Nonetheless , it is not lost on any Indian worth his or her salt that gold is the asset that best protects wealth and freedom .
When my father , a pediatric surgeon , wanted to buy land to construct his clinic and supplement his meager government income , he purchased the land by mortgaging my mother 's jewelry .
Similarly , millions of people in India have capitalized their businesses or farms , or secured their basic necessities after severe business reversals , by pledging their gold jewelry .
As we shall see below , were it not for gold , the average Indian 's lot through history could 've been a lot worse .
India 's Per Capita Gold Holdings
India 's private gold ownership is difficult to determine accurately .
However , several websites , such as Gold Eagle , estimate the total private gold holdings to be about 15,000 metric tons .
Compared to that figure , the Indian government owns a negligible 360 metric tons of gold .
Given that total gold mined in history is about 160,000 metric tons , India 's stake then amounts to 9.6 percent of the world 's total gold stock .
In contrast , India accounts for just over 17 percent of the world 's population .
Therefore , India 's large gold ownership is just a function of its large population , and its per capita gold ownership is well below average .
However , there can be no doubting Indians ' desire to own this metal .
Demand from India consumes some 20 – 25 percent of the world 's annual gold output .
Religious and Cultural Reasons For Gold Ownership
Much of this desire to acquire gold dates back to the Bronze Age Indus Valley civilization , in which people wore gold jewelry almost 4,000 years ago .
Gold has a rich tradition in the Hindu epics , the Ramayana and the Mahabharata .
It was associated with the pomp and splendor of the gods and kings who appear in these mythological stories .
The Ramayana , the earlier of the two epics , can be traced back to around 900 BC , so gold had risen above all other commodities to be associated with power , prestige , and wealth even back then .
Let me narrate a short story to illustrate how deeply gold and wealth are ingrained into the Hindu culture .
The world 's richest temple , at Tirupati , was built in honor of Sri Venkateswara , an incarnation of Lord Vishnu .
Legend has it that Venkateswara , who was born poor , sought the hand of Princess Padmavati , the incarnate of Vishnu 's celestial consort , Lakshmi .
Her father decreed that Venkateswara could marry Padmavati only if he possessed wealth comparable to the king himself .
Venkateswara sought a loan of gold and jewels from Lord Kubera , the Hindu god of wealth .
To help Venkateswara repay this loan symbolically , Hindu devotees donate money at Tirupati to this day .
This is but one of many thousands of stories from Hindu mythology that involve gods , kings , and wealth .
Generations of Indians reared on these stories have come to associate gold with mythical qualities .
Historical Usage of Gold
Silver coins were widely used in India during the reign of the Mauryas circa 250 BC .
The first gold coins were issued widely during the Gupta dynasty around 250 AD .
Interestingly , this period was also known as the Golden Age .
On the face of it , every emperor issues coins to accentuate the significance of his rule .
However , there was a more practical reason for Indians to use gold as money .
India , over the past 4 millennia , was a collection of many thousands of kingdoms and fiefdoms .
Every once in a while , a ruler such as Emperor Chandragupta Maurya appeared on the scene and was able to consolidate a majority of India .
However , no sooner did such an able emperor pass away than his empire disintegrated .
" Millions of people in India have capitalized their businesses or farms , or secured their basic necessities after severe business reversals , by pledging their gold jewelry . "
Even with the big empires , there was always plenty of fighting , and border territories constantly changed hands .
Millions of Indians could , in their lifetimes , expect to be the subjects of several different rulers and kingdoms .
Gold , being of high value , could easily be hidden during times of strife , enabling ordinary citizens to avoid being looted by marauding armies .
Further , a gold coin issued by one king could serve as money under any other king as long as the weight and purity of the issued coin could be assessed .
Therefore , gold was the preferred medium of exchange and store of wealth .
The history of dowry in India is almost as old as the Hindu religion itself .
Dowry , before the negative connotations of today , was a gift from the bride 's family to a newly married couple .
It was to compensate the groom for the additional expenses he would incur taking care of his stay - at - home bride and eventually their family . [ 1 ]
Although different commodities were used to pay dowry , gold was the preferred option simply because it was easily safeguarded and widely accepted .
The practice of giving gold and jewels as dowry continues to this day .
Another offshoot of the rich tradition of gold in the Hindu religion explains why Indians mark every auspicious and festive occasion with the purchase of a token amount of gold .
Parents with daughters begin accumulating gold in small quantities yearly on these occasions , in anticipation of their daughters ' weddings .
Other Contemporary Reasons for Gold Ownership
The above historical and cultural reasons explain the long - entrenched practice among Indians of acquiring gold .
This practice continued into contemporary times despite India having a unified currency since 1857 , when the British acquired complete control of the country .
This was primarily because of the continued struggles for the average Indian , first under imperial Britain and then under socialist India .
Since India 's independence , the country has followed a socialist economic policy , with the government running constant deficits to fund its five - year plans .
Needless to say , these plans have proved very inefficient , resulting in plenty of wastage and constantly increasing prices .
India 's disastrous 1962 war with China severely depleted India 's foreign reserves and removed the backing for the rupee .
To prevent a massive flight out of the rupee , the government established the Gold Control Act in 1962 , forbidding private ownership of gold bullion and mandating the conversion of all private gold bullion into gold jewelry .
This prevented the rise of an alternate currency if the rupee should flounder .
" Marginal tax rates hit a scarcely believable 95 percent and the rupee 's value declined steadily . "
As with all government intrusions , this law had unintended consequences .
Because licenses were required to hold gold bullion , many goldsmiths not connected to the establishment lost their livelihoods overnight .
The prohibition also gave rise to gold smuggling and a huge black market in gold , which no doubt claimed many lives and livelihoods .
Further , in 1969 , the Indian government under Indira Gandhi nationalized the banks and mandated licenses for almost everything .
This was the beginning of the " License Raj " in India , which instituted rampant corruption in all levels of the bureaucracy .
Since the state controlled all the banks , loans were made to special sectors just to buy votes .
The 1970s were an even more tumultuous period politically in India .
A state of emergency was declared from 1975 to 1977 , giving almost dictatorial powers to Indira Gandhi .
When democracy was restored in 1977 , Ms. Gandhi was ousted by Morarji Desai .
However , the common man still could n't catch a break , as marginal tax rates hit a scarcely believable 95 percent and the rupee 's value declined steadily .
In light of these circumstances , gold was the average Indian 's best friend .
Due to a ban on gold , the value of gold in relation to other commodities and the rupee soared .
The high marginal tax rate gave rise to a huge black market .
Citizens needed a way to hide and protect their assets from the taxman , and gold was one of the two asset classes that proved effective for doing so ( the other being real estate ) .
One last reason why extensive gold holdings are prudent in today 's context is the paltry level of insurance provided to bank deposits .
A fractional reserve banking system is inherently insolvent and needs government insurance to prevent a run on deposits .
In India , the amount covered under deposit insurance is just Rs100,000 , which is only $ 2,170 .
In contrast , federal deposit insurance in the United States was recently increased from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 .
To put things in perspective , Rs100,000 is about 5 months rent for a decent , three - bedroom apartment in Bangalore , whereas $ 250,000 US is four or five year 's worth of living expenses for a couple in Chicago , including a mortgage or rent .
In other words , Rs100,000 is an insignificant sum of money .
Realizing that the banking system is shaky , because of the low level of insurance and the fractional - reserve system , many savvy consumers hedge by holding a portion of their savings in gold .
Moreover , millions of people in rural India completely bypass the banking system because they do n't understand it and prefer to hold their savings in gold .
When in need of money in a crunch , they pledge their gold with a local money lender in return for currency .
In summation , India 's ancient and deep religious traditions , combined with a plethora of historical , cultural , and practical reasons , have fostered an unflinching desire to acquire gold as a means of protecting one 's wealth .
In this light , one can hardly dismiss this desire as irrational .
Given what 's in store for the world at large when the inevitable currency crisis occurs , citizens from other countries could do worse than to take a leaf out of India 's history with gold .

The Flu Case
Friday , Nov 20th , 2009
Unconfirmed reports are coming in that thousands of people in what appears to be a rural area under quarantine in the western Ukraine have been killed by vaccines .
A Ukrainian woman who crossed into neighbouring Poland told people there that she had driven into the Ukraine to meet a friend but was stopped about 60 km from the border and told that parts of the Western Ukraine were closed at a distance of about 100 kilometers from the border with Poland .
These people allegedly told her that there were thousands of dead people lying on the streets inside those closed off areas .
Also , there are mass graves filled with bodies covered with lime .
The woman said the people had died as a result of vaccinations .
The vaccines allegedly came from France .
This report cannot be independently verified .
The woman has reported what others have told her leaving room for the story to be distorted if there is any basis in fact at all .
The woman did not see these things with her own eyes .
Life in the town of Drohobych in the Western Ukraine appears to be continuing as normal , say eyewitness reports from there .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The Ukrainian government has recently clamped down on the media , shutting down bloggers , and there are no reports so far in the mainstream or alternaitve media that confirm this story .
Rural parts of Western Ukraine are difficult to access .
The Ukrainian government has said that it has put parts of Western Ukraine under quarantine as a result of an outbreak of pandemic .
Also , the government has announced its intention to carry out mass vaccinations under the instructions of WHO to counter the “ pandemic ” .
Reports have come in of pneunomic plague following unusual aircraft activity .
Doctors are reported to have been told that they cannot write down pneumonic plague as a cause of death and must write down swine flu .
This is an email from a source in Poland :

my parents , a healer , who had a client from Ukraine – woman , who allegedly
ran away from Ukraine yesterday .
What she says is very scary .
She tried to drive into Ukraine to meet her friend .
About 60 km from the border she was stopped by people .
They warned her
that some parts of Western Ukraine are closed , around 100 - 10 km from the border .
Those people allegedly were crying that there are thousands of dead victims
lying on the streets , and nobody wants to touch them .
Also , that there are some mass graves filled with bodies , which were disinfected
with lime ( calcium ) .
Thousands people died not from the disease but from the
vaccines .
I tried to verify this info , my cousin called friends in Drohobycz ( also Western
Ukraine ) – there is nothng abnormal there .
So it could be a provocation or
to run false stories .
Of course there is a chance that only small part of the region is affected , maybe
they tried there untested vaccine and these are the results .
Nevertheless , there is complete media blackout about it except some comments
in my blog which for already 2 weeks confirm the fact of “ thousands of victims ” .

First impressions can be a real bitch .
It not just that you do n’t always have time to prepare for them , and it ’s not the fact that the repercussions of a bad first impression can last a very long time .
What really sucks is that if you do n’t make a good first impression , you missed out the only opportunity you ’ll ever have to tell your new acquaintance – no words necessary – who you are and what you ’re all about .
What a loss !
It came and went , just like that !
Snap , whoosh !
The only thing you can do is prepare yourself to make positive first impressions so that you ’ll do so reflexively , without needing any preparation .
What makes a good first impression ?
There are a few major things you want to convey when meeting new people .
1 . Who are you ?
It can take a long time to get to know someone well , and that ’s good ; you want to have depth .
Being able to explain who you are to someone – possibly from across the room , or maybe with just a few words exchanged – is important , though , because you want to make others curious enough to find out more .
Think of it like a movie trailer : you want to give a juicy enough overview without spilling the major plot points and storylines .
Take a look at this trailer for The Watchmen real quick and you ’ll see what I mean .
This trailer uses very little dialogue to tell a story .
It ’s not the story of the movie , but instead a tale the relates what kind of movie it is .
The brooding music builds suspense while the dramatic special effects say that this is a movie with a lot of bright lights and action .
The nature of the visuals and drama of the pauses and camera panning indicate that this is not your parent ’s super hero movie , despite all the costumed people running around .
It ’s very clear to anyone who watches this trailer what The Watchmen is all about , even though we know nothing about the characters , their stories , what the conflict is or anything else that makes the movie special .
If you can make your first impression like a good trailer for who you are , you ’re on the right track .
2 . What do you do ?
One of the first questions that most people ask at parties in Los Angeles is ‘ what do you do ? ’
I ’ve gotten so accustomed to this that I am constantly bringing it up in places where what you do professionally is n’t quite so important ( or at least not the first thing on everyone ’s conversational agenda ) .
I find myself back - tracking quite a bit to avoid a social faux pas .
“ Good to meet you !
What do you dooooo…ing here ?
What are you doing here ?
In Buenos Aires ?
Ahem . ”
If you play your cards right , you can eliminate the need for other people to ask this question by giving off a certain professional vibe ; again , the point is to make them want to know more , but to paint a clear enough outline that they know the broad picture .
This can involve more talking than just showing who you are , but your posture , your poise , how you dress and your facial expressions can also play an extremely important role in an accurate first impression .
Take a look at this intro from the TV show Dexter for some inspiration .
Here ’s a normal guy , going about his regular morning routine , but every action is laced with menace .
From Michael C. Hall ’s facial expressions ( he ’s the guy who plays Dexter in the show ) to the close - cropped shots of his breakfast being cooked and devoured , you know that he is probably a serial killer , despite the fact that he does all the same things everyone else does .
It ’s incredibly menacing without being literally threatening at all .
There ’s some whimsy in there too , which is also a big part of the Dexter character in the show .
It ’s the WAY he does these normal things it that make an impact , and the same goes for you .
When you go about your day you ’ll doing all the same things that everyone else does , but how you do these standard things is what makes you stand out .
3 . What do you stand for ?
It can be incredibly difficult to express your views , especially controversial ones , to people around you without either labeling yourself as an extremist of some sort or earning the ire of the very people you ’re trying to make a good impression with .
The best way to make sure your thoughts are heard , but to also not put up your new - acquaintance ’s defenses , is to be subtle but pointed in your support .
Take a look at this award - winning PSA for an idea of what I mean .
How would you feel if you had to get other people ’s permission to marry the person you love ?
This is a clear message of support for the legalization of gay marriage – a super - controversial issue – but it does n’t demonize anyone , play upon any stereotypes or make any efforts to shock the audience into paying attention .
Instead , it ’s well - produced and written , the actors play roles that mimic the intended audience , and the message is presented in a logical and clever way .
You should try to do the same with anything you feel strongly about .
This will allow you to stay true to yourself without needlessly antagonizing everyone who does n’t believe the same as you ( and maybe even some of the people who do ! ) .
And If You Fail …
A good first impression is something to aim for , though they wo n’t always go as planned .
When this is the case , all you can do is pick yourself up , dust yourself off and prepare to make the best second , third , fourth and fifth impressions possible .
Update : November 25 , 2016
I ’ve often told people that I ’m glad I did n’t encounter things like neurolinguistic programming or the pickup community when I was younger , because these sorts of things would likely have appealed to me , and I would have overlooked their toxic approach to relationships in favor of feeling like I ’d cracked the code .
That code - cracking would have been even more satisfying , I think , because I did n’t grow up naturally predisposed toward socializing ( not well , anyway ) .
I started to figure things out in high school — a moment that aligned perfectly with the first time I became passionate about something , actually .
I discovered journalism , and realized that if I worked hard at it , I did better .
This sounds obvious , but I ’d always done well in school without really trying , and as such had the fear that so many academically talented kids have , of trying at something , and failing , and thereby showing themselves to be useless .
That fear of no longer being patted on the head by authority and failing to live up to your reputation as ‘ smart kid ’ is crippling for some , and a lot of people I grew up with never seemed to escape that propensity .
All that is to say that I ’ve remained fascinated with how all these things fit together , but I also recognize that you ca n’t hack everything .
This post was an early attempt to explain that , I think ; showing how you can ‘ gamify ’ the social process to a certain degree , but that it ’s much better to understand those underpinnings , rather than simply manipulating them by rote .
NEW YORK — Back from another trip to Europe , this time Germany , where the same dismay as in France prevails over the U.S. health care debate .
Europeans do n’t get why Americans do n’t agree that universal health coverage is a fundamental contract to which the citizens of any developed society have a right .
I do n’t get it either .
Or rather I do , but I do n’t think the debate is about health .
There can be no doubt that U.S. health care is expensive and wasteful .
Tens of millions of people are uninsured by a system that devours a far bigger slice of national output — and that ’s the sum of all Americans ’ collective energies — than in any other wealthy society .
People die of worry , too .
Emergency rooms were not created to be primary care providers .
Whatever may be right , something is rotten in American medicine .
It should be fixed .
But fixing it requires the acknowledgment that , when it comes to health , we ’re all in this together .
Pooling the risk between everybody is the most efficient way to forge a healthier society .
Europeans have no problem with this moral commitment .
But Americans hear “ pooled risk ” and think , “ Hey , somebody ’s freeloading on my hard work . ”
Essay by RWE Executive On Green Technology , Germany Is the Envy of the World
Danish statistician Bjørn Lomborg argued in SPIEGEL last week that efforts to halt global warming should be postponed .
Fritz Vahrenholt , head of the renewable energy operations at German energy company RWE , disagrees .
Never before has there been a better chance for a global climate deal , he says .
I spoke with thousands of voters at town - hall meetings this summer .
What I gathered from them is that it's not just the proposed overhaul of health care that has them upset .
Many also expressed a sense of betrayal .
In spite of their hope for change , it still appears that the government in Washington is run for its own benefit and the benefit of special interests — not for the benefit of the American people .
The folks I met with also do n't trust politicians in Washington to address mounting long - term challenges to our economy .
It 's ...
I always celebrate when a new Terry Pratchett novel hits the stands — doubly so now that health problems are slowing him down from his normal superhuman output to a merely impressive one .
But I confess I was a little less excited to learn that the newest Pratchett Discworld book , Unseen Academicals , was about football ( AKA soccer ) .
I 'm not a sports fan .
I was n't a hockey fan when I lived in Canada .
I was n't a baseball fan when I lived in the US .
I 'm not a footie fan now that I live in the UK .
But I gave it a whirl : this is Terry Pratchett , after all .
I 'd read his grocery lists .
A word about Pratchett for the uninitiated .
Terry Pratchett is an incredibly funny , warmly human British fantasy ( mostly ) novelist .
He writes at an impossible rate .
Most of his books are part of a sprawling , infinitely varied fantasy series called Discworld , about a flat , disc - shaped planet that is carried on the backs of four gigantic elephants who tramp in slow circles around the back of a vast , interstellar turtle called A'Tuin .
On Discworld , everything happens .
There are imperial battles and barbarians ; witches and trolls and dwarves in the hills ; animist spirits on lost continents ; and there is a vast and wonderful and terrible city called Ankh - Morpork .
Ankh - Morpork is presided over by a tyrant called Lord Vetinari , who is quite progressive as tyrants go .
For one thing , he 's let the trolls , vampires , medusae , dwarves , werewolves , zombies , and assorted other nonhumans into the city .
For another , he 's organized the thieves into a guild to whom one can pay an annual license and be guaranteed a life free from official thieving ( freelance thieves are dealt with most firmly by the guild ) .
You can read the Discworld books in almost any order .
Some of them run in little trilogies that follow the same characters , but even if you picked up the second or third volume of these , you 'd probably get along OK — Pratchett is quite good at getting newcomers to Discworld up to speed on its basics .
Back to Unseen Academicals .
Here 's the setup : the wizards of Unseen University have discovered that a key grant from a former Archchancellor requires them to keep a football team that plays regular matches .
It 's been decades since the last UU team was fielded , and they 're in imminent danger of losing a substantial source of funding .
Meanwhile , football itself — as played on the streets of Ankh - Morpork — is a vicious game that is more riot than sport , and the wizards of UU have no intention of getting involved in that mess .
So they cook up a plan to reform football — and to field a team of their own , coached by Nutt , a mysterious ( and erudite ) goblin who has been heretofore employed as a candle - dribbler ( no self - respecting wizard wants to do magic by the light of a pristine , unmarked candle ) in the cellars of UU .
That 's the setup .
Here 's the payoff : it 's brilliant .
The novelist 's best trick is to make you care about stuff you do n't care about .
It 's what Fever Pitch does .
And it's what Unseen Academicals does , too .
Pratchett shows us how sport is part of the emotional life of a city , and how its significance resonates across generations , across regional parochialism , across social strata , uniting us behind something that transcends the mere game .
What 's more , Pratchett shows us how fragile a thing this is , how vulnerable it is to greed and thuggishness and venality , and how those who defend the game do so for the best reasons imaginable .
As Pratchett says , " The thing about football is , it 's not about football . "
I would n't call this the best Discworld novel ever ( I think my vote for that honor would go to Monstrous Regiment , which , incidentally , can be read without having read any of the other Pratchett novels ) .
But it 's in the top five .
A word of warning : it 's also one of the most inside - baseball ( you should forgive the expression ) of the Discworld books , requiring a fair bit of familiarity with the previous books in the series to be fully appreciated .
It 's a real gift from Pratchett to his fans , in other words , and I , for one , am grateful for it .

Labour let in migrants ' to engineer multicultural UK '
Huge increases in immigration over the past decade were a deliberate attempt to engineer a more multicultural Britain , a former Government adviser said yesterday .
Andrew Neather , a speechwriter who worked in Downing Street for Tony Blair and in the Home Office for Jack Straw and David Blunkett , said Labour 's relaxation of controls was a plan to ' open up the UK to mass migration ' .
As well as bringing in hundreds of thousands to plug labour market gaps , there was also a ' driving political purpose ' behind immigration policy , he claimed .
Official policy : Huge increases in immigration over the past decade were 'a deliberate attempt to engineer a more multicultural Britain '
Ministers hoped to change the country radically and ' rub the Right 's nose in diversity ' .
But Mr Neather said senior Labour figures were reluctant to discuss the policy , fearing it would alienate its ' core working - class vote ' .
On Question Time , Mr Straw was repeatedly quizzed about whether Labour 's immigration policies had left the door open for the BNP .
Writing in the Evening Standard , Mr Neather revealed the ' major shift ' in immigration policy came after the publication of a policy paper from the Performance and Innovation Unit , a Downing Street think tank based in the Cabinet Office .
The published version promoted the labour - market case for immigration but Mr Neather said unpublished versions contained additional reasons .
' Earlier drafts I saw also included a driving political purpose : that mass immigration was the way that the Government was going to make the UK truly multicultural .
' I remember coming away from some discussions with the clear sense that the policy was intended - even if this was n't its main purpose - to rub the Right 's nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date . '
The ' deliberate policy ' , from late 2000 until ' at least February last year ' , when the new points - based system was introduced , was to open up the UK to mass migration , he said .
Mr Neather defended the policy , saying mass immigration has ' enriched ' Britain and made London a more attractive and cosmopolitan place .
Sir Andrew Green , chairman of the Migrationwatch think tank , said : ' Now at least the truth is out , and it 's dynamite .
Many have long suspected that mass immigration under Labour was not just a cock - up but a conspiracy .
They were right .
' This Government has admitted three million immigrants for cynical political reasons concealed by dodgy economic camouflage . '
The chairmen of the cross-party Group for Balanced Migration , MPs Frank Field and Nicholas Soames , said : ' We welcome this statement which the whole country knows to be true .
' It is the first beam of truth that has officially been shone on the immigration issue in Britain . '
Yesterday , the House passed the Matthew Shepard Act as part of the ( $ 680 billion ! )
Defense Department spending bill .
In a 281 - 146 vote , some 131 Republicans and 15 Democrats opposed the measure .
But as one Republican in particular explains , he voted against it not because he does n’t want American troops to have the equipment and supplies they need to fight seventeen wars at once , but because he does n’t want the gays to have laws that protect them .
His name is John Boehner , and he ’s the Republican Minority Leader .
“ Radical social policy ” is what Ohio ’s Rep .
Boehner calls the hate crimes legislation , faulting Democrats for attaching LGBT protections to a military issue .
It ’s the only way they could get it through , Boehner claims , snidely .
And maybe he ’s right .
( We like to think not . )
But Boehner ’s “ OMG this is an abuse of power ” shtick is so tired , because it ’s just another round of he - said - she - said in an arena where Democrats and Republicans alike attach “ pet ” measures to larger legislation .
Rather than help give our brothers and sisters , sons and daughters , and fathers and mothers the money they need to stay safe and fight wars overseas , he ’d prefer to let queers be attacked as usual .
This is partisan politics at its worst .
5 : Tianhe -1
563 teraflops
A new entrant into the Top500 list , China 's fastest computer proved capable of more than 500 trillion operations per second .
Put another way , a simple calculator 's power is typically about 10 flops .
Tianhe , which means " river in the sky " , is housed at the National Super Computer Center , Tianjin , and is more than four times faster than the previous top computer in the country .
The computer combines 6144 Intel processors with 5120 graphics processing units made by AMD , normally found in computer graphics cards .

4 : Jugene
825 teraflops
At one time the second fastest computer in the world , Jugene at Jülich Supercomputing Centre , Germany , is based on IBM's Blue Gene / P design , which uses many small , low - power chips .
Individual processors in this design have a maximum speed of 850 megahertz , slower than the average home computer .
But 292,000 chips working together make it the fastest machine in Europe .
This image was taken during an upgrade earlier this year that should allow Jugene to break the 1 - petaflop barrier .

3. Kraken
831 teraflops
Kraken , based at the National Institute for Computational Sciences , funded by the US National Science Federation and located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory , Tennessee , has 100,000 dual - core Opteron processors made by AMD , typically used in servers and high - end workstations .
Kraken is the fastest computer in the world owned and operated by an academic institution – the University of Tennessee .
In October the foundation awarded the university a further $ 10 million to build a new computer , Nautilus , to analyse Kraken 's output .

2. Roadrunner
1042 teraflops , or 1.042 petaflops .
Until this month , this machine was the world 's fastest , and had been since June 2008 .
Roadrunner was the first computer to ever break the 1 petaflop barrier – 1,000,000,000,000,000 calculations per second .
Roadrunner resides at Los Alamos National Laboratory , New Mexico .
The computer has an unusual design that combines dual - core processors made by AMD , of a type found in many consumer machines , with the nine - core Cell processor at the heart of Sony 's PlayStation 3 games console .

1. Jaguar
1.8 petaflops
Nearly 70 per cent faster than Roadrunner , the US Department of Energy 's Jaguar , housed with Kraken at Oak Ridge National Lab , is the newly crowned fastest machine in the world .
Oak Ridge houses more computing power than anywhere else on the planet .
Unveiled last year , Jaguar 's 181,000 cores only started work this year .
Unusually for a world - beating US government - funded machine , this is a civilian computer .
The Department of Energy has previously built its fastest machines , such as Roadrunner , to model nuclear explosions .
Much of Jaguar 's work is focused on modelling climate change and energy generation , with other basic science such as studies of the structure of water also getting a look - in .

Before Gordon Brown , the only prime minister of the past 60 years to have found himself constantly vilified was John Major .
If two similar episodes are enough to constitute a trend , the manhunt is a new development in British politics .
There are similarities between the two cases .
For the hounding to begin , the prime minister of the day has to have suffered a severe policy or political setback sufficient to call his or her leadership qualities into question .
Mr Major 's agony started in September 1992 immediately after Britain was expelled from the Exchange Rate Mechanism , a system linking together European currencies that was a precursor to monetary union .
In Mr Brown 's case the seismic event was his failure to call an election soon after taking office when he might have won .
As Robert Browning wrote in the " Lost Leader " , " never glad confident morning again " .
That Mr Major had been the victor in a general election against the odds a few months earlier made no difference .
The house newspaper of the Conservative Party , The Daily Telegraph , said the expulsion from the currency system was a defeat " almost as complete as it is possible , in peacetime , to conceive " .
It did n't help that Mr Major had been the architect of the policy two years earlier as Chancellor of the Exchequer .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It is also a requirement of the chase that the dogs must have consumed some raw meat .
Mr Major 's Cabinet colleague , David Mellor , was brought down in the same month as the exchange rate disaster with tales of extra-marital activities .
Norman Lamont , Mr Major 's Chancellor of the Exchequer whom he had kept in post after Britain 's expulsion from the Exchange Rate Mechanism , was the next to go as a result of a press campaign .
Then soon afterwards Michael Mates , junior minister at the Northern Ireland Office , had to step down following revelations of dealings with a fugitive financier , Asil Nadir .
At first glance Mr Brown has offered less sustenance to the press hounds .
He had to sack Damian McBride from his private office after it was discovered that Mr McBride had been discussing the possibility of disseminating rumours about the private lives of Conservative Party politicians .
But instead of a series of forced resignations , the exploitation of the parliamentary expenses system by Cabinet colleagues and MPs of his own party as well as the Opposition has had the same effect .
For the press had the satisfying experience of ripping away the cover-up .
But there is one more requirement that has to be met before the harassment can begin .
The personal qualities of the prime minister must be such that they render him or her vulnerable .
In Mr Major 's case it was what was perceived as an absence of political ideas .
Nigel Lawson , who had been Mrs Thatcher 's Chancellor of the Exchequer before Mr Major , said he " never detected any political beliefs in Major .
Beliefs were not important to him .
Politics , not ideas , were his game " .
Charles Moore , the editor of The Daily Telegraph at the time , wrote that , " I think he has no actual views at all " .
And as to the crucial subject of Europe , Mr Major 's biographer , Anthony Seldon , commented that Major lacked a gut instinct on Europe , for or against .
" He shared none of the powerful apprehensions of the sceptics not the strong positive instincts of his colleagues Kenneth Clarke , Michael Heseltine and Douglas Hurd . "
What makes Mr Brown vulnerable is similar .
The charge is that he is a ditherer .
To which can be added the reputation for dishonesty that taints the entire Labour front bench , derived as it is from an addiction to spinning stories for the media and over - claiming achievements .
The path that Mr Major walked from his election victory in 1992 to defeat at the hands of Tony Blair in 1997 was lonely and painful .
From early 1994 there circulated reports that Cabinet ministers were privately disparaging him .
Mr Lamont openly described Mr Major 's leadership as weak and hopeless .
On the backbenches sat 70 former ministers , 60 of whom were critical .
In March 1994 , for the first time since 1963 , a backbench member of the PM's own party called openly for his resignation .
Lord McAlpine , the former party treasurer , described Mr Major as " the stupidest prime minister we have ever had – a bitter , nasty man " .
Stories began to circulate about him being lonely and isolated from trusted lieutenants , and his health and sanity were questioned .
Mr Brown is marching along the same , grim road to oblivion .

Imagine , if you please , a kettle .
The empirically - minded may wish to actually fetch one and 3/4 fill it with water .
Examine the water in this imaginary ( or actual , for the science geeks ) kettle .
It ’s pretty much stationary .
Now turn the kettle on and watch very carefully .
You will quite quickly notice that the system becomes less predictable , less stable , more active and wilder , as the heat in the system increases .
If you increase the temperature far enough , your system will change radically and comprehensively ( all the water will change state and leave the system through the cracks ) leaving you with a barren , parched shell of what was once a nice cup of tea in potentia .
This is the image you should have in your mind when you hear an Environment Agency spokesmen using words like “ unprecedented ” .
The Second , Law , of Thermo , Dynamics .
The flooding in Cumbria is not quite Hurricane Katrina , but then we ’re not in a hurricane belt .
For Britain , even a Britain recently flooded a number of times in different areas , this has been a pretty wet week .
Most specifically over a foot of actual rain fell on the Lake District and south - western Scotland [ 1 ] over the last 24 hours alone .
That leads to water table rises of 15 feet in places , four washed out bridges , 200 people rescued , by the RNLI , from their houses and possibly ( tragically ) a dead police officer .
The Lake District is one of Britain ’s wettest , alongside Snowdonia .
The Met Office believe yesterday was the wettest day on record in that proverbially soggy county , and that , ladies and gentlemen , is climate change .
Let ’s get this clear before we start : climate and weather are not synonyms .
The latter is a subset of the former .
Secondly ; global warming does n’t mean Scotland will turn into Barbados , for all Mitch Benn ’s hopes .
What global warming means is that if you take the relatively closed system of our planet and its atmosphere , the overall amount of heat entering the system is increasing .
Also , the industrialisation of Europe effectively put the lid on the climate kettle , and we ’ve kept insulating it from underneath ever since .
These things are not even remotely contentious .
They ’re just what happened .
The second law of Thermodynamics tells us that as the level of heat in a system rises , so does entropy in that system .
What the physicists do n’t tell you is that “ entropy ” , more or less , means the bubbles in the kettle .
It means that the system , as it gets warmer , gets less predictable .
There ’s two ways to make a system warmer ; import heat from outside ( which is happening ) and prevent heat from escaping ( which is where the CO2 “ lid ” is relevant ) .
And what this does not mean is that New York will have a sunny winter .
What it means is that our biosphere is going to start bubbling .
Whether humans have , or can , do much about the change in our climate is ( I think ) still debateable .
That our climate is altering , and becoming less predictable , seems to be a consensus view among climatologists .
What is beyond rational dispute is what happens to systems as they warm up .
Food production , to name but one aspect of our lives , is heavily dependent on climate predictability .
I lived through the African famines of the early 80s , which happened because all the local farmers failed to predict a sudden drought .
Which lasted 5 years .
Just like the Cumbrian tempest , that famine was a symptom of climactic change resulting in unpredictable weather .
One great propaganda coup for the Strip - mine and Robber Baron cohort ( or “ military - industrial complex ” ) in our society is that they have convinced people that “ global warming ” somehow means hotter summers and milder winters , in a nice and convenient way for the local humans .
This allows millions of people world - wide and very nearly half of all Americans to look at any snowstorm , or wet summer , and say “ Ah - hah !
Those damyankee librul ’s are talking out their asses !
This ai n’t no warmer than last year ! ”
Climate change means less predictable weather , less food , more dead people .
Just like boiling a kettle , if you ’re living inside it .
So when you hear climatologists using words like “ unexpected ” , “ out of season ” , “ unprecedented ” , … “ catastrophic ” , it ’s just a symptom of climate change .
Apparently on the ancient principle , “ To he who hath it shall be given … ”
A strategy that combines gene therapy with blood stem cell therapy may be a useful tool for treating a fatal brain disease , French researchers have found .
These findings appear in the 6 November 2009 issue of the journal Science , which is published by AAAS , the nonprofit science society .
In a pilot study of two patients monitored for two years , an international team of researchers slowed the onset of the debilitating brain disease X - linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) using a lentiviral vector to introduce a therapeutic gene into patient 's blood cells .
Although studies with larger cohorts of patients are needed , these results suggest that gene therapy with lentiviral vectors , which are derived from disabled versions of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , could potentially become instrumental in treating a broad range of human disorders .
" This is the first time we were able to successfully use an HIV - derived lentivirus vector for gene therapy in humans , and also the first time that a very severe brain disease has been treated with efficacy by gene therapy .
We 've demonstrated that this HIV - derived lentivirus vector works as was hoped for so many years , " said coauthor Patrick Aubourg , professor of pediatrics at University Paris - Descartes and head of a research unit at Inserm - University Paris Descartes .
Featured in the movie " Lorenzo's Oil , " ALD is a severe hereditary condition caused by a deficiency of a protein called ALD that is involved in fatty acid degradation .
Sufferers steadily lose their myelin sheath , the protective layer that coats nerve fibers in the brain .
Without myelin the nerves lose function , leading to increasing physical and mental disability in patients .
X - linked ALD , the most common form of the disease , affects boys starting at age 6 - 8 years of age and death usually occurs before the patients reach adolescence .
Bone marrow transplants typically slow progression of the disease because the donor marrow includes cells that develop into myelin - producing cells .
However , finding a matching bone marrow donor can be a challenging and lengthy process , and the procedure carries considerable risks .

Genetically correcting the blood stem cells in the patients ' own bone marrow may prove to be a valuable alternative approach when no matched donors are available .
In most gene therapy studies , a working gene is inserted into the genome to replace a dysfunctional , disease - causing gene .
A carrier molecule called a vector is used to deliver the therapeutic gene into the patient 's cells .
Vectors are typically the backbones of viruses that have been genetically altered to carry normal human DNA .
Scientists have recently turned to vectors based on the lentivirus genus of retroviruses , which includes HIV .
Lentiviral vectors are a type of retrovirus that can infect both dividing and nondividing cells , and are thought to provide long - term and stable gene expression , unlike other retroviruses .
" The HIV - derived lentivirus vector allows expression of the therapeutic gene in principle for life , because the therapeutic gene is inserted in the chromosomes -- the genome .
Therefore , cells that derive from the initially corrected cells , stem cells in particular , will continue to express the therapeutic gene forever , " said Aubourg .
In the study , blood stem cells were removed from the patients and genetically corrected in the lab , using a lentiviral vector to introduce a working copy of the ALD gene into the cells .
The modified cells were then infused back into the patients ' after they had received a treatment that destroyed their bone marrow .
Two years later , healthy ALD proteins were still detectable in both patients ' blood cells .
Encouragingly , both patients showed neurological improvement and a delay in disease progression comparable to that seen with bone marrow transplants .
The healthy ALD protein was expressed in about 15 percent of blood cells , yet surprisingly this low level was sufficient to slow brain disease in ALD .
" This percentage of correction will not be sufficient for all diseases , " warns Aubourg .
" There is a lot of work to be done to make this gene therapy vector more powerful , less complicated , and less expensive .
This is only the beginning , " he said .
Gene therapy is not without serious risks .
Like other retrovirus vectors , the HIV - derived lentivirus vector is tasked with inserting the therapeutic gene in the chromosomes of the patients ' cells .
In a worst case scenario , this action could disturb the biology of the cells and patients could end up with leukemia ; this outcome has occurred in past gene therapy trials .
" The HIV - derived lentivirus vector basically has this same risk , although the design of the vector makes patients less prone to this side effect , " said Aubourg .
This research was funded by INSERM ( National Institute of Health and Research Medical ) , Assistance Publique des Hôpitaux de Paris , PHRC programs , the Deutsche Forchungsgemeinschaft and the German Ministry of Education and Research , the European Leukodystrophy Association , the Association Française contre les Myopathies , the Stop ALD Foundation and University Paris - Descartes .
Related Press Briefing in France : A press conference related to the forthcoming Science paper , " Hematopoietic Stem Cell Gene Therapy with a Lentiviral Vector in X - linked Adrenoleukodystrophy , " by Dr. Nathalie Cartier and colleagues is planned for 2:00 p.m. in Paris on Wednesday , 4 November .
State of Ruby VMs : Ruby Renaissance
Ruby is commonly associated with the frameworks ( Rails , RSpec , and many others ) that it enabled , but it is much more than that .
The same ideology and design principles that popularized the language at the start are also the reason why it is being currently ported to a variety of alternative platforms : JVM , Objective - C , Smalltalk VM and Microsoft ’s DLR .
Technical details aside , few will disagree that Matz ’s focus on “ how we feel while programming ” and the objective of “ making the programmer happy ” has resonated with the larger community .
In a short span of just a couple of years , the Ruby VM space has evolved to more than just a handful of choices : MRI , JRuby , IronRuby , MacRuby , Rubinius , MagLev , REE and BlueRuby .
In fact , keeping up with all of the most recent developments within each VM is now easily a full - time job .
For that reason , and with RubyConf ‘ 09 in full swing , let ’s take a quick survey of the space and where it ’s taking us .
2010 : Year of Ruby Renaissance
Observing the trends and acceleration of development amongst all the VM ’s , it is clear that 2010 is going to be an exciting year for the language .
While more than a few developers have proclaimed Ruby ( and more often , Rails ) as dead within the past year , likely due to it losing the initial novelty angle , in reality the language is at the cusp of becoming available to a much broader community .
Within the next year , MacRuby , Rubinius , IronRuby , and MagLev should all hit the 1.0 status , effectively making all the things we love about Ruby available to entirely new communities of programmers .
HotCocoa with MacRuby makes writing Mac apps a breeze , IronRuby will bring Ruby scripting to the .NET crowd , Rubinius will become a viable deployment platform , and MagLev will give us the distributed persistence model offered by their Smalltalk VM .
All of this without even mentioning the growing adoption of JRuby , which marries the best of JVM with Ruby , or the rising popularity of REE fork of Matz ’s Ruby which offers significant performance and memory improvements .
In other words , if the “ Ruby revolution is over ” , then the next year is likely to be the first year of its Renaissance .
It wo n’t happen overnight , but slowly and surely we will see the same idioms , tools , and DSL ’s we are all accustomed to in Ruby make their way to adjacent platforms .
Many projects and companies are already using RSpec and WebRat to test their non-Ruby code .
Likewise , why not use Ruby for DOM manipulation via Silverlight ( Gestalt ) , or abstract Java or Cocoa API ’s into concise DSL’s ?
It ’s an exciting time to be a Rubyist .
MRI : Matz ’s Ruby ( 1.8.x / 1.9.x )
MRI Ruby , which is the original and the default platform for the vast majority of Ruby users have been making steady progress throughout the past year .
First , we saw the 1.9.1 release at the beginning of the year , which made Ruby 1.9 a viable deployment platform , although the overall pickup has remained relatively low .
In mid July , Ruby 1.9.2 preview 1 hit the shelves , and the original schedule planned for the final 1.9.2 release on December 25th .
However , Yuki Sonoda ( release manager ) recently indicated that the schedule will be canceled in favor of making Ruby 1.9.2 compatible with the RubySpec suite prior to the final release - this is great news for everyone and well worth the wait .
Sitting in the audience at RubyKaigi in Tokyo earlier this year , it was clear that the focus of the development team is on Ruby 1.9 .
Moving forward , there will be one more release within the 1.8.x branch ( Ruby 1.8.8 ) , and it will serve as a bridge between 1.8 and 1.9 .
If you have n’t already , you should investigate migrating your code to Ruby 1.9 - most of the critical gems , and all popular frameworks work out of the box , not to mention the numerous performance improvements .
In the coming year , we may even see a Ruby 2.0 , and in all likelihood a continual improvement in speed and library support .
Matz showed off a number of experimental branches at RubyKaigi , and Koichi Sasada indicated that many of the performance optimizations are yet to be turned on for Ruby 1.9 - to date the focus has been on compatibility and feature completeness .
JRuby : Ruby on the JVM
Out of all the “ alternative ” Ruby VM ’s , JRuby is by far the most mature project both in terms of compatibility and community coverage .
By combining the best of the JVM platform - generational GC , true concurrency ( no GIL ) , and transparent interop with any Java library - with Ruby syntax , it is no surprise that JRuby has been quietly gaining market share in the community .
It is fast , it runs Rails , and it will soon be compatible with Ruby 1.9 .
Within the past year the JRuby team , which consists of 7 active committers ( 3 of whom migrated from Sun to Engine Yard earlier this year ) , and dozens of intermittent contributors has fixed more user reported issues than in all previous releases combined .
JRuby 1.4.0 is a good indicator of the health of the project : a large collection of new features , and over 307 bug fixes since JRuby 1.3.1 .
Tickets for JRubyConf were sold out in a matter of hours following the announcement , and in all likelihood serve as a good indicator that JRuby is the platform to watch in the coming year .
The combination of the JVM optimizations and its widescale deployment within the enterprise world will definitely make it an appealing Ruby VM .
MacRuby : Objective -C , LLVM and Ruby
Want to mix and match Cocoa API ’s or access OSX system libraries all within a Ruby VM ?
Then MacRuby is the answer and the VM is picking up steam fast .
On March 9th , MacRuby 0.4 shipped with a threaded GC , full 64 - bit support , DTrace probes , and many improvements to the HotCocoa API ’s .
Since then , the project has switched from YARV to a completely new VM based on LLVM compiler infrastructure ( shipped in 0.5 beta 1 ) , and the benefits are numerous : machine code compilation , true concurrency ( no GIL ) , a working JIT , and even ahead of time compilation ( AOT ) !
In other words , MacRuby is now a true Ruby compiler .
You can write a HotCocoa app , leverage native POSIX threads , or even take advantage of Apple ’s Grand Central Dispatch ( GCD ) and then compile your program and distribute it as a binary to any OSX user .
With 7 members on the team and a growing community ( RubyOnOSX ) , MacRuby is quickly becoming one of the most promising open - source projects for Apple - it would be great to see them officially embrace it in the coming year .
With the new VM and numerous performance improvements , MacRuby has the potential to bring Ruby to all the Objective - C developers and open up an entirely new market for Ruby .
In theory , we could even see MacRuby on the IPhone , that is , if we overcome a few minor snags , like a missing GC .
Definitely a project to watch in the coming year as it edges towards the 1.0 status .
MagLev : Smalltalk VM and Ruby
The GemStone team has been quietly making steady progress with MagLev over the past year .
The development is being done in parallel with work on their upcoming GemStone 3.0 VM and is promising to bring Ruby to their 64 - bit Smalltalk VM , which offers a JIT , years of VM optimizations , and most importantly , a built - in persistence and distribution layer .
In other words , you could think of Maglev as a distributed database that runs Ruby code internally - thousands of concurrent VM ’s can be spread across hundreds of nodes , all accessing the same data with ACID semantics .
At RailsConf this year the team showed off a working Sinatra app , and since then they have gone from passing 5000 to nearly ~ 27900 RubySpecs .
Rack , Sinatra , MiniTest and a few others already run unmodified on the VM and the tentative plan is for the project to hit 1.0 sometime in the upcoming year .
At the moment , there is a closed alpha test in progress , but soon it will be opened to the larger public . _ ( Update : grab the public beta here ) ._
The persistence layer offered by the VM is definitely one of the most interesting features , but the team has also indicated that MagLev will support other persistence models as well - you ’ll be able to use ActiveRecord with MySQL , etc .
Ruby Enterprise Edition
Launched in mid 2008 , REE is a fork of Ruby 1.8.7 optimized for server and production deployments of MRI Ruby .
Combination of MBARI patches , improvements in thread and scheduling overhead by Joe Damato and Aman Gupta , a copy - on - write ( COW ) fork model , and a tunable GC all contribute to a measurable difference in the amount of used memory and overall performance .
Earlier this year Twitter switched their infrastructure to REE and reported a 30 % improvement in throughput !
Phusion Passenger , developed by the same team , has also seen a good pickup in the community within the past year , but it remains to be seen if REE adoption will continue to grow in light of all the progress by alternative VM’s .
IronRuby : Ruby on .NET
IronRuby is a .NET implementation of the Ruby VM which leverages Microsoft ’s Dynamic Language Runtime ( DLR ) , and hence enables an entire host of interesting use cases for Ruby .
For example , not only is there seamless integration with all the .NET libraries and infrastructure , but running on top of the DLR also means that Ruby can be run within Silverlight ( yep , right in your browser - check out Gestalt ) .
The 1.0 release is looming on the horizon and the team has been making great progress .
IronRuby now passes over 92 % of all the RubySpecs and the adaptive compiler , combined with the optimized DLR also means much lower VM startup times , as well as significant performance improvements over MRI .
( Update : download IronRuby 1.0 RC1 )
It remains to be seen if the .NET community will embrace IronRuby , but it sounds like tool support ( Visual Studio , Intellisense , etc ) might be the next big hurdle for the project .
Rubinius : Ruby written in ( mostly ) Ruby
Rubinius is an initiative to implement as much of Ruby as possible via Ruby code itself - turtles all the way down .
In the works since 2006 , the Rubinius team lost a few developers early this year , but the project is alive and healthy .
The VM has been rewritten in C++ , a JIT compiler has been added , and you can now run mongrel , thin , rack , amqp , and a number of other gems all unmodified .
The roadmap shows 1.0RC in the works , and a focus on enabling real - world application deployments ( packaging , distribution , etc ) .
It is too early to talk about performance , but the combination of the JIT and LLVM infrastructure means that Rubinius will have true concurrency ( no GIL ) , and plenty of opportunities for introspection and optimization of your code - an inherent benefit of rewriting Ruby in Ruby itself .
Both FFI and RubySpecs , which are now used by virtually every other VM are a direct result of the project , so all things considered , Rubinius can already be called a resounding success .
However , with 1.0 on the horizon , it remains to be seen how and if the community will react to the release .
Getting a few production deployments under the belt , as well as building a larger user community , are likely to be the big challenges for the year ahead .
BlueRuby : Ruby on ABAP VM
An exploratory research project form SAP Labs , BlueRuby is an initiative to bring the Ruby runtime to the ABAP VM powering the AP NetWeaver and SAP ERP 6.0 products .
It is already passing 75.5 % of all the RubySpecs and is being pushed by SAP as a way to adopt TDD practices within their products .
At this point , there is no known release schedule or public roadmap for BlueRuby , so do n’t expect Rails apps on top of SAP NetWeaver anytime soon , but it does have the potential to bring Ruby and all the best practices enabled by it to thousands of enterprise developers .
Rubies everywhere !
Talking to the developers of all of the alternative VM ’s you ca n’t help but to feel excited about the future of Ruby .
There is a clear pattern emerging : using Ruby to go beyond Ruby , and as a bridge to other communities .
Halfway through RubyConf , it is a clear theme here as well - several serialization talks , code generation , and an entire evening of presentations on all the Ruby VM’s .
[ Haskell - cafe ] ANNOUNCE : gnome - keyring 0.1 ( bindings to libgnome - keyring )
The GNOME Keyring is a service for securely storing per-user secret information , such as passwords and encryption keys , on the GNOME desktop .
This library is a binding to the libgnome - keyring C library .
The API is still a bit too slave - ish to the original for my taste , some modules will be changing / merging in the next version .
The innards are an absolute horror -- do n't look too close if you 're one of those people who faint at rampant unsafe casting .
That said , it works surprisingly well for a first - release FFI binding -- mostly due to the excellent design of libgnome - keyring and c2hs .
So if any Linux / BSD / OpenSolaris / etc users have needed secure password storage in Haskell , please try it out and let me know if you encounter any problems .

WASHINGTON  Despite being in the minority in Congress , Republican campaign committees outraised Democrats by $ 1.7 million in August as they have aggressively collected political cash amid the rancorous debate over health care .
Republicans also held an edge over Democrats in the amount of money available , when counting debts , as both parties set the stage for the 2010 elections , in which more than three dozen competitive House and Senate seats are at stake .
POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEES :
How much money do they have ?
The GOP spike is a departure .
In each of the past four years , the party in power — whether Democrat or Republican — raised more than the minority 's fundraising committees in August , a USA TODAY review of campaign records shows .
" Republicans have been able to tap into some of the anger against Democrats in power and translate that into fundraising , " said Nathan Gonzales of The Rothenberg Political Report .
" There are a lot of Republicans who wish the election were this November , not November 2010 , because they feel like the momentum is on their side now . "
In the Senate , where Republicans are far outnumbered , their fundraising committee collected $ 3.1 million last month , compared to $ 2.2 million by the Democratic committee .
It was the second month in a row that the Senate GOP committee outperformed Democrats — bringing its fundraising total for the year to $ 26.5 million , just $ 1 million less than the Democrats .
Brian Walsh , spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee , said the committee has attracted more than 70,000 first - time donors this year as voters grew alarmed by President Obama 's policies .
" There are a lot of independents who may have voted for Obama who are now saying , ' This type of big government spending is not what we signed up for , ' " he said .
The Republican National Committee ( RNC ) also had a fundraising bump in August , bringing in $ 1 million more than the Democratic National Committee .
Only the House Democratic committee outraised the Republicans in August — by $ 200,000 .
For the year , the three GOP committees have $ 28.3 million in available funds after expenses and debts — about $ 8 million more than the Democrats .
RNC spokeswoman Gail Gitcho said the health - care debate that played out in town - hall meetings in August boosted fundraising .
In the first three weeks in August , for example , the party averaged 2,000 donations a day from new donors , she said .
Democrats say they are on track for a strong showing in 2010 .
" We continue to raise the resources we need to accomplish our goals , " Democratic National Committee spokesman Hari Sevugan said .
Eric Schultz , a spokesman for the Senate Democratic committee , said his group " will have more than enough funds to be competitive . "
Jennifer Duffy , who follows Senate races for The Cook Political Report , said the Republican surge is not a surprise .
GOP " apathy turned pretty quickly into activism " after the White House and congressional Democrats moved swiftly this year to pass an economic rescue plan and work on health care and climate change legislation , she said .
" If the administration and Democrats in Congress were doing nothing , it might be harder to raise money , " Duffy said .
" They have certainly given Republicans something to work with . "
She said GOP activists are focused on winning enough Senate seats to deprive Democrats of the 60 votes needed to avoid GOP filibusters of controversial measures .

Here are a couple of items worth noting for those who believe adults should be free to dispose of their disposable income as they please and that government should n't interfere unnecessarily with what people choose to do in the privacy of their own Web browsers .
First , in an announcement that was muffled by the commercial din of Black Friday , Uncle Sam has backed off for at least six months on enforcing a criminally misguided crackdown on transactions between credit - card companies and the users of Internet poker sites and online casinos .
In the meantime , brick - and - mortar casino owners in California have taken a new swing at convincing lawmakers there that allowing , regulating and taxing online poker sites would provide that perpetually cash - strapped state with a measure of financial relief .
It would also provide a U.S. - based alternative for the estimated 1 million Californians who currently play poker on sites that operate and generate their profits abroad .
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
The California initiative is likely a non-starter without that six - month enforcement reprieve becoming a permanent commutation .
That legislative effort is being led by U.S. Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass. , a longtime proponent of Internet freedom .
From a story in this morning 's Boston Globe :
" I urged them to do it and I was very pleased , '' the Newton Democrat said of the ( enforcement ) delay .
" It gives us a chance . ''
You wo n't find the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee at a poker table or roulette wheel , as Frank does n't gamble .
But he said he does not want the government telling people what to do with their own money .
Frank has established himself as a friend of the online gambling industry by seeking to overturn a 2006 law that will make it illegal for US credit card companies to process charges from Internet gambling sites .
The law , intended to cut off the life blood of the $ 16 - billion - a - year online gambling industry , was scheduled to take effect Dec. 1 .
But last week , the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department pushed back the effective date until June to give Frank and other gambling supporters time to draft a bill to set up a system to regulate and collect taxes from legal online gaming .
The reprieve was announced the day after Thanksgiving , at which time Frank issued a press release saying : " This will give us a chance to act in an unhurried manner on my legislation to undo this regulatory excess by the Bush administration and to undo this ill - advised law . "
As for what 's happening in California , here 's what the Los Angeles Times reported yesterday :
With the state bracing for billions of dollars in budget shortfalls , a group of casinos is offering California leaders a stake in a new pot of money if they allow Internet poker sites to set up business in the state .
A consortium including the Morongo Band of Mission Indians and the Commerce Casino plans to take the idea to the state Legislature next month .
The two would be among the gambling interests seeking to operate poker websites if the proposal were approved .
Proponents estimate the state could reap $ 250 million a year from such an arrangement .
And while government revenue is by no means the best reason for legalizing , regulating and taxing online gambling , $ 250 million a year will fund a lot of teachers , police officers and firefighters .
But the principle is far more important here .
And , as regular readers know , this issue is a personal one , too .
Unlike Frank , I do play poker ( although I 've never played online ) .
Last Monday , I drove from my home in Massachusetts to a casino in Connecticut to play in a Texas Hold ' Em poker tournament .
Friday evening , I played poker with a group of friends , a group that has been doing so for 12 years now .
We 're not criminals .
The government should not treat us as criminals .
Yesterday , the new media team at the White House announced via the Associated Press that whitehouse.gov is now running on Drupal , the open source content management system .
That Drupal implementation is in turn running on a Red Hat Linux system with Apache , MySQL and the rest of the LAMP stack .
Apache Solr is the new White House search engine .
This move is obviously a big win for open source .
As John Scott of Open Source for America ( a group advocating open source adoption by government , to which I am an advisor ) noted in an email to me : “ This is great news not only for the use of open source software , but the validation of the open source development model .
The White House ’s adoption of community - based software provides a great example for the rest of the government to follow . ”
John is right .
While open source is already widespread throughout the government , its adoption by the White House will almost certainly give permission for much wider uptake .
Particularly telling are the reasons that the White House made the switch .
According to the AP article :
White House officials described the change as similar to rebuilding the foundation of a building without changing the street - level appearance of the facade .
It was expected to make the White House site more secure – and the same could be true for other administration sites in the future … .
Having the public write code may seem like a security risk , but it ’s just the opposite , experts inside and outside the government argued .
Because programmers collaborate to find errors or opportunities to exploit Web code , the final product is therefore more secure .
More than just security , though , the White House saw the opportunity to increase their flexibility .
Drupal has a huge library of user - contributed modules that will provide functionality the White House can use to expand its social media capabilities , with everything from super - scalable live chats to multi-lingual support .
In many ways , this is the complement to the Government as Platform mantra I ’ve been chanting in Washington .
When you build a vibrant , extensible platform , others add value to the foundation you establish ; when you join such a platform , you get the benefit of all those features you did n’t have to develop yourself .
Of course , it ’s easy to imagine that the use of open source software will slash the government ’s IT budget .
After all , this software is freely downloadable .
I have a feeling it ’s quite a bit more complicated than that .
First off , government has a huge number of special requirements ( remember the flap over President Obama ’s blackberry ? )
Second , do n’t underestimate the difficulty of doing business in Washington .
Procurement is done through a complex ballet understood by few open source companies .
Third , a big IT deployment like this requires coordination between many companies , each providing a piece of the puzzle .
According to techpresident.com , no fewer than five firms were involved in the switch : prime contractor General Dynamics Information Systems , Drupal specialists Phase 2 and Acquia , hosting provider Terremark , and CDN - supplier Akamai .
( Disclosure : O’Reilly AlphaTech Ventures is an investor in Acquia . )
The special nature of the government marketplace is one of the reasons why I launched the Gov 2.0 Expo , which will be held in Washington DC next May .
There are huge opportunities for open source , web 2.0 , and new media companies in government , but there are also challenges reaching that market .
One of my goals for the event is to increase the visibility of cutting edge technology firms not just to government agencies , but also to the prime contractors who are putting together these complex procurements .
The net - net is that I suspect that simply using open source software wo n’t slash government IT budgets , at least not right away .
What it will do is increase the amount of value we get for our money and the speed with which new technology can be adopted .
Features that would have cost millions of dollars and years of development to add will now be rolled into the scope of current contracts .
It ’s also important to realize that using open source is very different from contributing to open source .
Despite the exaggerated claims in the AP story , that “ the programming language is written in public view , available for public use and able for people to edit ” , the White House has not yet released any of the modifications they made to Drupal or its operating environment back to the open source community .
The source code for Drupal ( and the rest of the LAMP stack ) is indeed available , but the modifications that were made to meet government security , scalability , and hosting requirements have not yet been shared .
In my conversations with the new media team at the White House , it is clear that they are exploring this option .
Giving modifications back to the Drupal community is the next breakthrough announcement that I ’ll be looking for .
Releasing code is more than just being a good open source community citizen , though .
Code sharing is a major cost - saving opportunity for government .
There are countless government agencies at the federal level , not to mention at the state and local level , that perform similar functions .
Yet each of them does its own development , driving up costs .
Federal CIO Vivek Kundra has made a great step forward in web services by creating data.gov .
I ’m eager to see an analogous code.gov portal for government agencies to share their open source software code .

ZHANGLIDONG , China - Visitors can smell this village long before they see it .
More than 100 dump trucks piled high with garbage line the narrow road leading to Zhanglidong , waiting to empty their loads in a landfill as big as 20 football fields .
In less than five years , the Zhengzhou Comprehensive Waste Treatment Landfill has overwhelmed this otherwise pristine village of about 1,000 people .
Peaches and cherries rot on trees , infested with insect life drawn by the smell .
Fields lie unharvested , contaminated by toxic muck .
Every day , another 100 or so tons of garbage arrive from nearby Zhengzhou , a provincial capital of 8 million .
" Life here went from heaven to hell in an instant , " says lifelong resident Wang Xiuhua , swatting away clouds of mosquitoes and flies .
The 78 - year - old woman suddenly coughs uncontrollably and says the landfill gases inflame her bronchitis .
As more Chinese ride the nation 's economic boom , a torrent of garbage is one result .
Cities are bursting at the seams , and their officials struggle to cope .
The amount of paper , plastic and other garbage has more than tripled in two decades to about 300 million tons a year , according to Nie Yongfeng , a waste management expert at Beijing 's Tsinghua University .
Americans are still way ahead of China in garbage ; a population less than a quarter the size of China 's 1.3 billion generated 254 million tons of garbage in 2007 , a third of which is recycled or composted , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
But for China , the problem represents a rapid turnabout from a generation ago , when families , then largely rural and poor , used and reused everything .
" Trash was never complicated before , because we did n't have supermarkets , we did n't have fancy packaging and endless things to buy , " said Nie .
" Now suddenly , the government is panicking about the mountains of garbage piling up with no place to put it all . "
In Zhanglidong , villagers engage in shouting matches with drivers and sometimes try to bodily block their garbage trucks coming from Zhengzhou , 20 miles away .
" Zhengzhou is spotless because their trash is dumped into our village , " says Li Qiaohong , who blames it for her 5 - year - old son 's eczema .
Li's family is one of a few who live within 100 meters ( 300 feet ) of the landfill , separated from it by a fence .
These families get 100 yuan ( $ 15 ) a month in government compensation .
The dump has poisoned not just the air and ground , but relationships .
Villagers say they were never consulted , and suspect their Communist Party officials were paid to accept the landfill .
In China , especially in rural regions , there is often no recourse once local officials make a decision .
The villagers say not only were their petitions ignored , but they were warned by the Zhengzhou police to stop protesting or face punishment .
" We villagers were too naive ... we did n't know what a landfill was , " said Li .
" If we had known earlier about all the pollution it would cause , we would had done everything possible to stop the construction process .
Now it 's too late . "
Elsewhere , thousands of farmers in the central province of Hubei clashed with police last year over illegal dumping near their homes .
A person filming the clash died after being beaten by police .
Protests in cities are driving trash to the countryside .
Residents in central Beijing swarmed the offices of the Ministry of Environment last year , protesting the stench from a landfill and plans for a new incinerator there .
In July , officials scrapped the incinerator plan and closed the landfill four years early .
In eastern Beijing , local officials invested millions of dollars to make the Gao An Tun landfill and incinerator one of a handful in China to meet global health standards .
That was after 200,000 residents petitioned for a year about the smell .
" Our standard of living is improving , so it 's natural that more and more of us begin to fight for a better quality of life , " says Zhang Jianhua , 67 , one of the petitioners .
" Widespread media coverage embarrassed the local government , so they finally decided to take action , " she says .
After millennia as a farming society , China expects to be majority urban in five years .
Busy families are shifting from fresh to packaged foods , consumption of which rose 10.8 percent a year from 2000 to 2008 , well above the 4.2 percent average in Asia , according to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council .
By 2013 , the packaged - food market is expected to reach $ 195 billion , up 74 percent from last year .
At least 85 percent of China 's seven billion tons of trash is in landfills , much of it in unlicensed dumps in the countryside .
Most have only thin linings of plastic or fiberglass .
Rain drips heavy metals , ammonia , and bacteria into the groundwater and soil , and the decomposing stew sends out methane and carbon dioxide .
Regulations allow incinerators to emit 10 times the level of dioxins permitted in the U.S. , and these release cancer - causing dioxins and other poisons , according to a Chinese government study .
" If the government does n't step up efforts to solve our garbage woes , China will likely face an impending health crisis in the coming decade , " warns Liu Yangsheng , an expert in waste management at Peking University .
In Zhanglidong , resident Zheng Dongxiao says the village 's only water well is polluted and causing chronic ulcers .
Wang Ling , a spokesman for the Zhengzhou Ministry of Environment , said the landfill has a polyethylene liner to protect the ground beneath .
" Test results of the local soil , water , and air quality , in 2006 and this year , showed that everything was in line with national standards , " he told The Associated Press .
Residents say the liner has tears and only covers a fraction of the landfill .
The government knows its garbage disposal will always draw complaints , says Liu .
" What they need to do is invest more money into building and maintaining better plants . "
That remains a tall order in a country bent on growth , where economic planners hold more sway than environmental regulators and are loath to spend scarce funds on waste management .
This is part 2 of my post on oil demand .
This time I look at the Non-OECD demand and how it may impact global oil demand .
Based on data from the 2009 BP Statistical Review , the OECD oil consumption in 2008 decreased by - 3.2 % while demand within emerging economies increased by +3.1 % .
The report also indicates that oil production from OECD countries has been declining since 1997 and is now below 23 % of the world production .
Non-OECD Demand
Emerging economies ( China , India ) with strong population growth , high economic growth , low car ownership and very low oil consumption per capita .
Oil resources managed by governments ( NOC ) .
Gasoline subsidies ( especially in Middle - East oil producers such as Saudi Arabia ) making those market unresponsive to prices signals .
Figure 2 . Linear fit in the log -domain for the Non-OECD consumption ( monthly , total petroleum products ) , volumes in million barrels per day ( mbpd ) .
Figure 3 . OECD and Non-OECD shares of the world total liquids consumption ( EIA data ) .
The Non-OECD group is a net exporter ( see Figure 4 ) , and to date production has grown at the same rate as consumption .
In contrast , total production from the OECD countries peaked in 1997 and has been declining at an accelerating rate ever since ( see Figure 5 ) .
The situation is somewhat similar to the Export Land Model .
It is unlikely that growth in oil production from Non-OECD countries can match consumption growth for very long ( + 3.2 % / year ) , therefore their ability to export will diminish in the next few years .

Where Oil Prices are Heading ?

EIA data .
Long term structural changes in OECD demand are triggered mainly through economic recessions ( i.e. high unemployment , etc. ) .
OECD countries go into periodic economic slowdown and recessions triggered by oil prices increasing beyond $ 150 a barrel .
The excess demand model and its relationship to oil prices are the one established in my previous post and corresponds to $ 20 per 1 mbpd of excess demand .
The Non-OECD demand exceed that of follows the exponential model described above .
There are no long term structural changes in demand within the Non-OECD .
The world total liquid production growth is anemic , amounting to 0.610 million barrels per day per year of additional supply and is not influenced by oil prices .

Conclusions
OECD oil consumption is very reactive to oil prices .
OECD oil production has peaked in 1997 and will be increasingly dependent on oil imports from Non-OECD countries .
Non-OECD oil consumption is quite unresponsive to oil prices .
Non-OECD consumption will likely be the main driver behind high oil prices , but the OECD will be the first to reduce consumption ( and demand ) .
Are we witnessing a kind of geopolitical Jevons paradox ?
Structural changes in demand are very likely for the OECD , but the oil then made available will be absorbed by the relentless growth of Non-OECD .
The Non-OECD consumption is well modeled by an exponential fit as shown on Figure 2 .
The equivalent growth rate is around 3.2 % per year .
One amazing observation is that there is no apparent slowdown in consumption growth due to high oil prices .
This pattern is very different from what has been observed for the OECD .
There are three main factors contributing to this growth :
As a result , Non-OECD consumption grew from 40 % of the world demand in 2004 to 45 % in 2009 .
Interestingly , the OECD is now producing less than 22.4 % of world production , its lowest value since 1976 .
Since to date the OECD has taken the brunt of the high oil prices , the question can be asked : how low can the OECD consumption go ?
One interesting perspective is to look at various per capita consumption levels combined with population growth forecasts .
Presently , consumption for the OECD excluding the US is hovering around 12 barrels per capita per year .
In the WEO 2009 , the IEA is predicting by 2015 a further consumption decrease toward 10 barrels / capita / year for the OECD excluding the US and toward 20 b/ c / year for the US .
The following scenario is set forth to illustrate how an asymmetric demand destruction could occur between the OECD and the Non-OECD .
I do n't assume a peak oil scenario for now .
Instead , I simply assume that the growth in production capacity within a high oil price environment observed between 2007 and 2009 will remain the same until 2020 ( see Figure 7 ) .
This is equivalent to a net addition of 0.610 million barrels per day as shown on Figure 8 below .
This scenario is optimistic on the supply side and pessimistic on the demand side .
It is based on the assumption that the conditions observed since 2002 continue to remain the same in the future , namely :
The simulation result is shown on Figure 9 .
The simulation indicates periodic oil price superspikes will occur and will trigger periodic recessions within the OECD .
The OECD consumption is reduced each time , then briefly recovers once oil prices go below $ 40 .
In this model , the Non-OECD demand exceeds that of the OECD around 2015 .
In conclusion , I think there is no end in sight for high oil prices and in particular for high volatility even assuming a somewhat optimistic supply growth scenario .
The Non-OECD consumption will continue to grow , partially shielded by gasoline subsidies and an increasing share of the world oil production .
The void created by a rapid contraction of the OECD consumption will be filled by Non-OECD demand .
In summary :
With the proliferation of new receipt and expense organizing apps , such as PaperTrail , ShoeBoxed and OneReceipt , tech - savvy types are finding it easier to get organized for tax season .
But if you ’re like me and have yet to catch up with all the latest apps , you ’re still rummaging through stacks of paper W - 2s , 1099s , receipts and other financial records in preparation for filing .
Here ’s how to get your paperwork organized ( finally ! ) and tame that ever - growing receipts & records drawer .
Step 1 : Take Stock of What You Have
In preparation for de-cluttering , you ’ll need to first assess and sort the types of documents and files you ’re working with .
Common categories can include previous years ’ tax filings or tax forms ; pay stubs ; bank , loan , retirement account or mortgage statements ; assets sales receipts noting gains / losses ( such as stocks , vehicles , or residential property ) ; expense or deduction receipts ; insurance or annuities ; and interest paid / interest deductions , such as student loan interest .
You ’ll need this list later to keep track of what you choose to keep in paper or electronic form vs. what you dispose .
Step 2 : How Long Do I Need
This ?
How long you need to keep financial records depends on why you need them .
For most of us , that means our annual tax returns , but there are other reasons ( such as insurance claims , asset sales , or investments ) for why you may wish to keep financial records beyond tax season .
An insurance or financial professional can advise you regarding these records .
For tax purposes , however , the most important factor in your record keeping should be the IRS .
Their statute of limitations for audits on filings typically extends three years after your file ( or the tax return ’s due date ) , so you ’ll probably want to keep your records at least this long .
But this does n’t apply if you do n’t file , or if the IRS has any reason to believe fraudulence :
There is no statute of limitation in these cases , so keep any relevant tax documents as long as possible if this applies to you .
Note , too , that if the IRS believes you ’ve underpaid your taxes significantly ( by 25 % or more ) , the statute of limitations can extend for up to six years .
If you have any doubt about underpaying , store these documents for this longer period of time .
The self - employed are generally subject to more scrutiny , and longer statutes of limitations .
They should hold on to filings records for four years .
Step 3 : Sort Your Records
The IRS and many experts suggest you sort financial records and receipts based on how soon you ’ll need them .
Active File documents are exactly that – items you ’ll actively need in the coming year , such as W - 2s or expense receipts .
It ’s suggested you keep paper versions of these if possible ; a scanned or electronic back - up is also a good idea .
At the end of the tax year ( or once you file ) , you can safely dispose of the following :
Pay stubs : Reconcile these with your W - 2 and then pitch them .
Reconcile these with your W - 2 and then pitch them .
Bank statements :
Say bye - bye to your monthly statements .
Since these are stored for free in your online bank account portal , there ’s no reason to keep them longer than this , unless there are unusual or important financial events occurring that particular month .
In this case , you ’ll want to keep either a paper or scanned electronic version for your records .

Since these are stored for free in your online bank account portal , there ’s no reason to keep them longer than this , unless there are unusual or important financial events occurring that particular month .
In this case , you ’ll want to keep either a paper or scanned electronic version for your records .
Investment Statements :
If you ’re still receiving paper versions of these , shred them once you receive the year - end statement .
Like bank statements , however , you should opt to receive electronic communications , if possible , to minimize your paper file .

Like bank statements , however , you should opt to receive electronic communications , if possible , to minimize your paper file .
Receipts :
Once you file your taxes , paper receipts for expenses or deductions should be shredded .
Scan or upload electronic versions of these to meet IRS statute of limitation requirements , however .
Once you file your taxes , paper receipts for expenses or deductions should be shredded .
Scan or upload electronic versions of these to meet IRS statute of limitation requirements , however .
Loan Interest Statements : Ditto here .
Statements for student loan or mortgage interest paid , for example , should only be kept in paper form until the year - end version is available and your taxes are filed .
Then , keep an electronic version on hand until the statute of limitations elapses .
Fortunately , these are usually available in your loan servicer ’s account portal .
Records that you no longer actively need – but may need to access in an audit ( remember your statute of limitations ) or other financial event – should be kept in what ’s known as Dead Storage .
These items usually do n’t need to take up physical space in your drawer any longer , and can be scanned or uploaded into the cloud or another online storage service .
Examples of this can include electronic versions of any of the items listed above , along with records of property sales , retirement account yearly statements , lawsuit or legal proceeding gains , lottery or gambling gains / losses , and so forth .
Remember that the stature of limitations begins when you claim a gain or loss on the asset on your taxes , so if your return suggests you lost $ 2,000 in the stock market this year ( ouch ! ) , you ’ll want to keep the record for the full relevant statute of limitations after such a tax event occurs .
Ditch What ’s Left & Document the Rest
Your final “ disposal ” pile should include anything supplanted by more recent copies or filings , items you ’ll no longer need , or files past the statute of limitations .
This is the stuff you can pretty definitively get rid of .
Make a note of the location and type of storage for each document .
For example , you might note that you ’re storing old tax filings , deduction and expense receipts in paper and electronic forms , but that your bank and loan statements are only being kept in your online account .
This will make accessing your records easier , and will also facilitate the transition to newer , more efficient forms of storage in the future .
One last thing : Keep note of what you ditch , too .
It ’ll not only help you keep track of what you ’ve disposed , but it can also increase your confidence in your record - keeping abilities .

[ UPDATE 1 : See bottom of post ; I knew it ! ]
Earlier in the morning today ( around 8:00 a.m. local time ) this weird thing was seen over the skies of Norway :
My first reaction when I saw that was , " What the FRAK is THAT ? ! "
My second thought was , " Photoshop " .
But then I saw lots of pictures of this on a bunch of different Norwegian media , so I do n't think it 's a digital hoax .
Then videos started surfacing , like this one , which clearly show the spiral spinning .
It 's not just a static picture , whatever this thing was ; it was really in the sky .
However , after a moment , I realized this must be a rocket , most likely spiraling out of control .
I do n't understand all the details -- I do n't have all the info yet -- but a rocket fits what we 're seeing here .
First , this was seen all over Norway , so it must have been at a high altitude to be so visible .
Second , the blue spiral angling down to the right is clearly due to perspective .
A rocket spiraling around , and coming up from the lower right , would appear to make tight spirals when it was far away and bigger ones as it got closer .
Third , you can actually see the bright white spiral spinning in the videos .
That threw me for a second , to be honest , but after a moment I figured that it makes sense if the rocket is headed more or less straight toward the camera .
Whatever it is being lit up ( exhaust , or a leaking payload ? ) would appear to expand in a spiral like water from a spinning sprinklerhead .
The spiral itself is not spinning any more than water from the sprinkler is ; that 's an illusion of motion .
Fourth , after a few moments , a black disk appears to expand in the center of the white spiral , as seen in this picture ( it 's a little fuzzy ; you can see the person taking it must have used a long exposure because foreground lights are jittery , but you get the idea ) .
That 's exactly what I would expect if whatever is being ejected by the rocket ran out ; the arms of the spiral would expand away from the center , leaving black emptiness in the middle .
So that 's my hypothesis .
A rocket got out of control , perhaps losing a stabilizer , and started to spiral .
The two spirals , different in shape , size , and color , indicate something happened in the middle of all this ( the rocket second stage fired while still spinning , or something else started leaking out ) , changing the rocket 's direction .
Then , when the fuel or whatever ran out , the white spiral began to disappear from the inside out as the material expanded in space .
So who launched it ?
The Russians are a likely guess , but -- shocker -- they 're denying it .
I 'd love to know and find out what the details are , but whoever shot it up and whatever the purpose , I 'm pretty sure what we 're seeing here is a rocket launch that did n't go exactly according to plan .
Note : there are a lot of stories online about this with more very cool pictures :
The Sun and The Daily Mail have it in English , while Norwegian media include VG Nett , Altaposten.no , NRK.no , Framtidinord .no , Nordlis.no , and amazing videos can be seen here and here .
UPDATE : From Doctor Atlantis
I heard of this video which simulates particles being spewed out from a spinning rocket booster .

Two newly - discovered white dwarf stars exhibit extremely odd properties , almost resembling planets .
Their dense cores are exposed , shrouded in a layer of oxygen .
Are these dying stars potentially habitable ?
Advertisement
Researchers at the University of Warwick and Kiel University looked over the data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) , and spotted the two white dwarfs with large amounts of oxygen present , both approximately the size of planets .
These stars , SDSS 0922+2928 and SDSS 1102+2054 are 400 and 220 light years from us , and may be some of the most massive that can produce this type of white dwarf .
How did these stars get into this state ?
Current theories on the lifecycle of large suns ( 7 - 10 times the mass of our Sun ) , state that eventually they 'll consume all their hydrogen , helium and carbon , and then either collapse into a white dwarf with an oxygen - rich core , or go supernova before condensing into a neutron star .
However , all the white dwarfs spotted previously have been surrounded by a hydrogen an / or helium layer , which obscures us from seeing their cores .
Until now .
Advertisement
The current understanding of the process of how these stars are created predicts a carbon - rich layer would surround the core , and prevent the oxygen from making its way outwards .
However , the higher the mass of the star , the thinner this layer , so the discovery of two stars with oxygen rich surfaces means they were originally extremely massive stars .
They would have had as dense a progenitor star as possible , in order to form a white dwarf .
Unfortunately , the data is insufficient to calculate precisely how much mass these stars have , but they 're thought to be more than 500 million years old .
Luckily , more information on these stars could soon be available .
Head researcher Boris Gänsicke wants to try to measure the mass of the suns , which can be derived from their distance .
And according to Gänsicke , " once you know the distance of a star , and you know how bright it is , you can calculate its radius , and for white dwarfs there is a theoretically well - understood relation between mass and radius . "
They also plan to get more detailed spectroscopy , to confirm whether the elements in their cores line up with what 's expected .
Gänsicke believes that this research is crucial to understanding where the boundary lies between stars that end their lives as white dwarfs , and those that end as neutron stars .

A growing effort in the House to require periodic audits of the Federal Reserve is little more than " great PR , " one Republican senator stressed Friday .
Reps . Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) and Alan Grayson 's ( D - Fla . ) effort to subject much of the Fed 's records , communications and decisions to public scrutiny survived a key committee vote this week , and it now over 300 supporters in the House .
But Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - N.H. ) told CNBC
Friday morning that the amendment was little more than " pandering [ to ] populism . "
ADVERTISEMENT
" For the Congress to get into monetary policy , it 's just absolutely inexcusable , " he said .
" We can't handle fiscal policy , but now we want to manage monetary policy ?
One of the great strengths of our nation is an independent Fed , and this idea that 's coming out of the House , which is populist fervor ... is absolutely wrong , and it would do fundamental damage to our system of monetary policy . "
" They 're all absolutely wrong , there 's no question about it , and [ it 's ] because they want to get reelected , " a frustrated Gregg added .
" It 's great PR ; you go home and beat up the Fed . "
Ultimately , Gregg 's remarks on Friday perhaps indicate that the House 's provision on Fed audits could be a key sticking point when both chambers vote on financial regulatory reform later this year .
While a reform bill with Paul 's amendment intact seems likely to pass the House , it is not clear whether that amendment will have a similar fate in the Senate .
The audit proposal could thus become yet another sticking point chamber conferees will have to hammer out , assuming the bills progress to that stage .
At the very least , however , Gregg has signaled an unwillingness to vote for any variation of such an audit .
He maintained on Friday that it would undermine the country 's monetary policy , and he attributed its growing popularity to a dangerous , " William Jennings Bryan philosophy of governance " taking hold in Congress .
" We can't allow it to be successful because if we do , we will undermine one of great strengths , which is that we have an independent Fed which maintains the soundness of the dollar , " he said .
" And that is absolutely critical — not only to us , but the world . "
Mr. Cullather 's history of the green revolution , The Hungry World : America 's Encounter with Rural Asia , will be published by Harvard University Press in 2010 .
Norman Borlaug never liked being called the father of the green revolution .
It was “ a miserable term , ” he felt , for the modernization of global agriculture , and he knew no one scientist could claim all the credit .
His obituaries this week repeated it anyway , along with another accomplishment he never disputed , that his work had saved “ hundreds of millions of lives . ”
It is a low estimate .
Writers for The Atlantic and Reason magazines claim “ billions ” owe their lives to Borlaug .
They cite no data or source .
Rather , the claim is based on forecasts made in the 1960s that without a major jump in food output the world would be ravaged by famines .
It began in 1966 with René Dumont ’s Nous Allons á la Famine followed by William Paddock ’s Famine 1975 !
“ The battle to feed all of humanity is over . ” Paul Ehrlich ’s The Population Bomb announced .
“ In the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now . ”
Instead , in the spring of 1968 , India and Pakistan reaped the largest wheat harvests on record .
After two drought years , the sudden abundance caught officials off guard .
They commandeered school buildings and theaters to hold the overflow , but it was not enough .
Thousands of bushels , piled on roads and railway sidings , rotted for lack of storage .
Nonetheless , the governments of Indira Gandhi and Ayub Kahn — along with the Rockefeller Foundation — claimed credit , attributing the turnaround to rural revitalization programs emphasizing fertilizer , irrigation , and new dwarf strains of wheat developed by Borlaug .
Trusting both the forecasts and the press releases , the Norwegian parliament awarded Borlaug the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize for lifting the “ menace of doomsday hanging over us . ”
There were other explanations for what had happened on the Punjabi plains .
Central Intelligence Agency analysts were deeply skeptical of “ the so - called green revolution . ”
Noting that too few acres were planted in the new wheats to account for the statistical gains , and that China , without dwarf varieties , had also seen a major turnaround , they chalked up the bumper crop to a pronounced shift in the weather , a phenomenon later known as the El Nino cycle .
Others wondered if only the statistics had changed .
Despite India ’s declaration of self - suffiency , the Bombay tabloid Blitz found that 80 percent of pupils in the city ’s schools still showed signs of chronic malnutrition .
The ratios of population to food supply brandished by Malthusians and green revolutionaries alike had little bearing on the jobs or incomes of the millions struggling to buy enough to eat .
Leading economists also questioned the theory that a Malthusian barrier had been broken .
Simon Kuznets pointed out that food output had outpaced population growth throughout human history , defying the predictions of Ehrlich and his gloomy forebears .
The slight downward trend in Asian food production in the early 1960s could be easily explained ; the United States was dumping tons of surplus grain on Asian markets through the Food for Peace Program , depressing food prices and forcing farmers to grow cotton instead .
When US shipments declined in 1967 , they returned to wheat .
Borlaug ’s own estimate of the increase , 11 million tons , matched exactly the amount sent from Kansas in 1966 .
Another Nobelist , Amartya Sen , convincingly refuted the claim that either food supply or population had anything to do with famine .
Famines regularly occurred at times and places where food was plentiful , and in the most thinly populated places , like Darfur .
But while Borlaug had little respect for the doomsayers , their prophecies were the best justification for a second green revolution for Africa , which Borlaug campaigned for alone before gaining the support of the Rockefeller and Gates foundations and the Obama administration .
Africa produces enough to feed itself and Europe ; no French market would be complete without citrus from Ghana , cut flowers from Kenya , or lobster from Mozambique .
But because it is poor , it also receives millions in U.S. food aid , generosity which discourages local farmers from growing cheap grain for local consumption , just as it did in Asia in the 1960s .
A new scientific push is needed , the foundations claim , to save “ tens of millions of people who are living on the brink of starvation in sub-Saharan Africa . ”
So , inevitably , Borlaug ’s life achievements are summed up this week in the context of the mythic food / population race .
“ His breeding of high - yielding crop varieties , ” the New York Timeseulogized , “ helped to avert mass famines that were widely predicted in the 1960s , altering the course of history . ”
But Borlaug did more than prevent an imaginary catastrophe .
The Malthusian fable blinds us to the real - life history he made .
Seen from Washington in the 1960s , rural Asia was the most dangerous place on earth .
Guerrilla wars in Southeast Asia and separatist movements in India and Pakistan drew strength from the fierce anger of peasants , whose sudden restlessness mystified American leaders .
The spike in the birth rate of the domino nations after 1945 foreshadowed bigger crises to come .
Aid programs , land reforms , the Peace Corps , counterinsurgency teams , and village development all aimed to transform this traditional rural world into stable , urbanized , modern societies , but there was little to show for the millions invested until Borlaug came along .
The Rockefeller and Ford foundations set out to change the mentality and politics of rural Asia .
Food was their tool .
“ I ’ve worked with wheat , but wheat is merely a catalyst , ” Borlaug explained .
“ I ’m interested in the total economic development in all countries . ”
Development meant installing progressive leaders , like military dictator Ayub Kahn , and the Philippines ’ Ferdinand Marcos who ran for office on the slogan “ progress is a grain of rice . ”
By requiring imported fertilizer and fuel , the new grain production strategy broke India ’s planned economy , forcing Gandhi to divert resources from industry and devalue the rupee .
Borlaug and President Lyndon Johnson saw this as a victory .
In retrospect it ’s less clear .
China and India were evenly matched in 1966 , but China continued its industrial drive without letup .
Borlaug believed the process of high - yield agriculture would change the mentality of farmers .
The dwarf wheats required cultivators to precisely regulate water and chemicals , to set aside beliefs in nature and custom and put trust in technology .
It made peasants into scientists .
He expected this new attitude to affect their relations with their leaders , each other , and their families .
They would follow the profit motive , and he hoped , have fewer children .
The link between the new seeds and state birth control and sterilization programs was so plain that in many countries it was rumored that the seeds caused impotence .
“ If only that were true , ” Borlaug sighed .
“ We would really merit the Nobel Peace Prize . ”
The political effects of agrarian modernization were hard to predict .
In the Philippines a Maoist rebellion swept the countryside .
In Pakistan , absentee landlords raised rents , and six months after the bumper harvest tenant farmers declared jihad and overthrew Ayub ’s junta , paving the way for a brutal Islamist regime , civil war , and the eventual independence of Bangladesh .
In Lahore , Borlaug watched as an enraged mob sacked a smallpox clinic .
“ Pakistan ’s fate will certainly have a numbing effect on the world ’s general approach to development , ” the Washington Post predicted .
And it did .
The green revolution was declared the greatest success since the Marshall Plan , but the scale and ambition of foreign aid dropped sharply in the 1970s .
Instead of transformation , programs sought only to be “ sustainable . ”
At a time when farming was marginalized in his own country , Borlaug recognized that agriculture was intimately connected with human life , and consequently with every political act .
More than feed the world , he aimed to change it .
Asked if he considered himself an extension agent to the world , he shook his head .
“ No , ” he replied .
“ We move governments . ”

Why Russia wo n't cooperate on Iranian sanctions .
After years of stalemate , negotiations over Iran 's controversial nuclear development program seemed to progress last week when an Iranian delegation in Vienna agreed to the export and modification of its low - enriched uranium .
The resulting optimism did not last .
Officials in Tehran demurred , insisting that they needed more time to study the proposal and could not meet Friday 's deadline to ratify the agreement .
While Iran 's stonewalling came as a disappointment to the United States , it did not come as a surprise .
Over the past month , the White House has signaled that it is preparing a new , more severe round of sanctions in case current negotiations fail .
The United States has reached out to many countries for help in implementing its strategy , but none more so than Russia , which has come to play an increasingly central role in the battle over the Iranian nuclear program .
In September , President Dmitri Medvedev stirred hopes after he emerged from a meeting with President Barack Obama and hinted that the Kremlin might be open to the idea of new sanctions on Iran .
Together with China , Russia has long been considered Tehran 's patron at the UN , and many U.S. analysts believe that sincere Russian cooperation may prove to be the key component in bringing the program in line with international strictures .
Yet recent events suggest that U.S. confidence in Russia 's willingness to wield both carrot and stick may have been misplaced .
After a visit from Secretary of State Hilary Clinton , Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that " threats , sanctions , and threats of pressure in the present situation are counter - productive . "
Ensuring the point was lost on no one , Vladimir Putin , Russia 's prime minister and erstwhile president , said that talk of sanctions was " premature . "

Sebastian Vettel may have lost out on the world title in 2009 , but he has been rated as the season 's best driver by team bosses in AUTOSPORT 's annual top ten .
AUTOSPORT once again enlisted , in total privacy , the driver ratings from all ten of the current team principals to figure out who the key men in the paddock believe was the star driver of the year .
With the rankings then converted into points ( on a 10 - 8- 6-5-4-3 -2-1 basis ) , the results were collated and have been published for the first time in AUTOSPORT 's F1 Season Review , on sale in newsagents now .
And it is Vettel who has come out on top , over world champion Jenson Button - with last year 's number one rated driver , McLaren 's Lewis Hamilton , coming a close third .
The full AUTOSPORT F1 Team Principals ' top ten results for 2009 are :
1. Sebastian Vettel 76 2 . Jenson Button 67 3 . Lewis Hamilton 65 4 . Fernando Alonso 39 5 . Rubens Barrichello 35 6 = Kimi Raikkonen 30 6 = Mark Webber 30 8 . Felipe Massa 19 9 . Robert Kubica 10 10 .
Adrian Sutil 8
Vettel was clearly delighted about being ranked as the best driver by team principals , but equally knows that the real target is to achieve the number one spot on track .
" It 's an honour to be recognised after such an exciting season with many ups and downs , " he told AUTOSPORT .
" However , the votes wo n't help me be faster on the track next year and it will still be down to me to prove myself again next season . "
Red Bull Racing boss Christian Horner , who joined in fellow team principals in contributing his own rankings for the vote , was equally happy with the outcome .
" Sebastian had a great year in 2009 and I am certain he has the makings of a future world champion , " Horner told AUTOSPORT .
" It 's easy to forget how young he is sometimes .
He 's very mature in how he works with the car and his engineers - and it's remarkable to think that he can only just hire a rental car .
" It 's great to see that his talent has been recognised by others and we 're very much looking forward to working with him again in the coming seasons . "

IF THEY’VE ALREADY MADE UP THEIR MINDS ….
On Fox News yesterday , Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) explained , in no uncertain terms , that “ every single Republican ” in the Senate “ will oppose ” health care reform .
Kyl conceded that the reform bill may change before a final floor vote , but every Republican already realizes that the legislation “ will only get worse . ”
Since it ’s his job to keep track of such things , Kyl ’s declaration is probably accurate .
Indeed , it ’s not the least bit surprising — the far - right Minority Whip has made similar declarations before .
But Kyl ’s affirmation led Sam Stein to raise a good point .
If the entire Senate Republican caucus has already decided to oppose the bill , no matter what changes might be made , then why should anyone care that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) wants six weeks of debate ?
… Kyl ’s prophecy of across - the - board opposition does seem to undercut that other GOP tactic .
Why do Senate Republicans need six weeks to debate and consider the legislation if they ’re already determined to vote against it ?
“ We know it ’s been in Harry Reid ’s office for six weeks and the other 99 senators have n’t seen it , ” McConnell told “ Fox News Sunday ” last week .
“ I think we ought to at least have as much time for the other 99 senators and all of the American people to take a look at this bill as Majority Leader Reid has had . ”
And why , for that matter , are Senate Republicans complaining about a limited three - day window to read the legislation if they have already come to a final verdict on its contents ?
I ’m going to go out on a limb here and guess that GOP demands for six weeks of debate has very little to do with genuine interest in good - faith deliberations , and everything to do with pointless delay tactics .
Call it a hunch .
Here ’s hoping Senate Democratic leaders ignore Republican pleas for more time to attack a bill the minority has already decided to oppose en masse .

Crown copyright concerns were raised repeatedly during this summer 's copyright consultation as many groups expressed the view that government works should be treated as public domain .
The issue generated some surprise from Industry Minister Tony Clement , who asked for examples about why crown copyright was a problem .
This morning , the Auditor General provided a helpful example as her office has sent takedown demands to the Globe and Mail and Scribd for posting one chapter from her report ( Globe article , Scribd post ) .
The office argues that crown copyright applies and that a written request for permission on a case - by - case basis is required .
Leaving aside the fact that this is arguably fair dealing – it is news reporting and consists of one chapter from a much larger report – the very notion that Canadians need advance permission to post a portion of government report runs counter to the Auditor General 's own efforts at government transparency and efficiency .
The Auditor General should be encouraging broad dissemination of her work , not sending legal demand letters to shut down Internet postings .
This incident highlights yet again why the Canadian government needs a far more progressive approach to its own copyright policy .
It should be leading by example by : ( 1 ) dropping crown copyright and ( 2 ) adopting Creative Commons licences on its work and sites to promote the use of government documents without permission ( see this list for similar examples from around the world ) .
Update : The Globe has reposted the chapter on Scribd roughly 24 hours after initially taking it down .
It is good to see the paper stand up for fair dealing in this case .
Although their presence in the landscape is a bit unexpected , these three landfills where so much New York City trash goes to die look nothing like trash heaps of old .
They are soil - topped mountains by the scenic Delaware River  the Tullytown site rises 240 feet above sea level  that are part of a 6,000 - acre complex that includes freshwater lakes , misting devices to help control odor and the largest solar - panel farm on the East Coast .
As Robert Iuliucci , a senior district manager for Waste Management , drove around the Tullytown landfill , his Phillies cap on the dashboard , neither the World Series nor New York City ’s refuse was on his mind .

“ There ’s quite a few of the red - tailed hawks around , ” Mr. Iuliucci said , looking skyward .
The garbage at the complex comes primarily from southeastern Pennsylvania , New York and New Jersey .
People in Morrisville , Tullytown and Falls Township have long known they live in the shadow of New York City garbage .
But this common knowledge still seemed to rankle at least a few local residents , especially when reminded of it by a reporter from New York .
“ Talking about it now ?
Yeah , keep your losing Yankees up there and keep your trash up there , ” said the otherwise pleasant Henrietta Hansberry , 59 , who co-owns Anthony ’s IV Pizza & Pasta in downtown Morrisville , where a poster outside featured the Yankees ’ logo with a red slash through it , the balloons read “ Spank the Yanks ” and , in an even more outrageous slap in the face to all that New York represents , a plain slice costs $ 1.60 .
Though on opposite ends of the waste stream , New York City ( population 8,308,163 ) and Morrisville ( population 10,023 ) have some things in common .
Both have neighborhoods called Washington Heights .
One is officially a borough , the other is made up of five of them .
And the two places share Morrisville ’s mayor , Tom Wisnosky , 54 , who lives in Morrisville but works in Manhattan , as director of the morning newscast on Channel 11 .
“ We have to put up with it because it ’s there , ” Mr. Wisnosky said of the garbage .
“ But as far as jumping for joy that we ’re waving at your trash as it comes down the highway , that ’s really not happening here . ”
Mr. Wisnosky said Waste Management has been a good neighbor , though he expressed frustration with the fact that , because the landfills have a Morrisville address but are physically in Falls Township and Tullytown , Morrisville receives no host fees from the company .
The decades - old firehouse for Morrisville ’s volunteer fire company is falling apart , and a red - brick building opened recently on Bridge Street , the first new construction in downtown Morrisville in 80 years , he said .
But the situation could be worse , Mr. Wisnosky and others said .
They could be in Florence Township , N.J. , across the Delaware River from the landfill complex , and in the path , it turns out , of the prevailing winds .
A man with an extensive criminal past was being sought Sunday as a " person of interest " in an ambush on four police officers who were killed inside a coffee shop in Parkland , Wash .
Pierce County sheriff 's spokesman Ed Troyer told reporters that Maurice Clemmons , 37 years old , was one of several people investigators want to talk to and that he could n't be called a suspect at this point .
In a news release , the sheriff 's office said Mr. Clemmons has an extensive violent criminal history from Arkansas and recently was arrested and charged in Pierce County in Washington state on suspicion of third - degree assault on a police officer and second - degree rape of a child .
He was released from custody six days ago , according to the Seattle Times .
In 1989 , Mr. Clemmons , then 17 , was convicted in Little Rock of aggravated robbery .
He was paroled in 2000 after then - Gov. Mike Huckabee commuted Mr. Clemmons 's 95 - year prison sentence .
In Parkland , the four officers were just starting their shifts and were at the Forza Coffee Company shortly after 8 a.m. , said Brandy Kessler , a spokeswoman for the Washington State Patrol .
Do you remember when I discussed the crushing disappointment that is Google AdSense in Podcast 64 ?

Do you remember when I discussed the crushing disappointment that is Google AdSense in Podcast 64 ?
If Stack Overflow , a site that does a million pageviews a day , ca n’t make enough from AdSense to pay even one person half time — and let me tell you , that ’s being overly generous based on the actual income it generated — how does anyone make a decent living with AdSense ?
Seriously , how ?
Exclusively talking about Mesothomelia and Asbestos , or what ?
As a result , we dropped AdSense like a hot ( or , rather , a particularly cold ) potato .
Instead , we turned to our pal Alex of The Daily WTF , and hooked into his curated ad network for software developers .
We are firm believers in responsible ( read : no flash , no animation ) and restrained ( read : limited to 3 ad slots , reduced ads for > 200 rep ) advertising .
This has worked quite well for us so far .
How well ?
On the order of fifty to a hundred times better than AdSense !
I am not exaggerating .
Those are actual numbers .
Even though Alex does a great job , we always have a lot of left over unsold ad space .
And as the site has grown over the last 6 months , this gap has widened .
So then the question becomes — if AdSense does n’t work for us ( and boy , does it ever not work for us ) — then what can you do with that remnant ad space ?
I hate the word monetization with a passion , but surely something useful could be done here ?
That ’s when Portman Wills approached us .
He ’s not only an old school 4 digit Stack Overflow user and fellow programmer — he also has extensive experience in his previous gigs with advertising code .
Portman is currently busy building cool stuff like shuffletime ( not to mention his hilarious parody sites woofer and feeling unlucky ) .
But he was enthused about the opportunity to help out Stack Overflow — and maybe , just maybe , generate some ads that were actually ( gasp ! ) useful and relevant to his fellow programmers at the same time .
Thus , Portman generously offered to build a custom ad - serving site for us , which we gladly hosted at rads.stackoverflow.com .
Rads has three main components : A spider which uses the Amazon Product Advertising API to crawl the Amazon product catalog .
A website which renders an advertisement based on Stack Overflow tags .
Some analytics to determine which ads , books , and tags are most effective .
The spider was fed the top 5000 tags on Stack Overflow .
For each tag , it preformed a keyword search on the “ Computers & Internet ” node , returning the top 10 books with five - star reviews , sorted by number of reviews .
You can read the full skinny in Portman ’s summary .
We had high hopes of building something that connected great programmers with quality programming books on Amazon .
The ads looked nice , too :
Excellent plan , right ?
Smart .
Clever , even !
Well , it was a complete and utter failure .
Despite our purported cleverness , it did n’t work .
Not even a little .
The Amazon ad experiment was a total failure by any metric I can think of .
Clicks , revenue , goodwill , newton - pounds , cuils , you name it .
It was literally a waste of everyone ’s time .
Even flipping burgers would have paid more .
But this failure was not for lack of trying .
If a guy as skilled as Portman — who not only has a deep background in custom advertising , but is also a programmer capable of writing a solution tailored to our specific audience — can’t make this work , I had to regretfully conclude that nobody could make it work .
It ’s just not possible .
So we scrapped the whole thing , and we ’re going in a different direction .
More news on that soon .
But in the meantime , since we had our fancy - shmancy Amazon Affiliates account set up , we might as well put it to good use .
Even way back in the original Stack Overflow beta , people were proposing that we convert any Amazon book links to Stack Overflow amazon affiliate book links .
I was hesitant to do this at the time , but given our failure , I was licking my wounds .
I was willing to give it a try .
Particularly since the community seemed totally OK with the concept .
So , onward to plan B : we now auto - insert Stack Overflow affiliate info into any amazon book links posted on Stack Overflow .
Oh yeah , and here ’s the kicker .
These silly little rewritten text links work 200% - 300 % better than our custom amazon book ads !
Go figure .
All I can say is , advertising is hard , let ’s go shopping !
And when it ’s not hard , it ’s borderline scammy , which is something we just do n’t do at Stack Overflow .
At any rate , I ’m glad Portman is here to take the blamehelp .
Apparently we can add advertising to the long , long list of things that we suck at .
But we do plan to suck less every year !

Twilight is a ' deviant moral vacuum ' : Vatican slams blockbuster New Moon film
The latest movie in vampire saga Twilight is a ' deviant moral vacuum ' , the Vatican said yesterday .
New Moon , which opens in Britain today , is a ' mixture of excesses aimed at young people and gives a heavy esoteric element ' , a spokesman added .
The blockbuster opened on Wednesday in Italy and took £ 1.8 million at the box office .
' Deviant ' : The Vatican claims vampire flick New Moon , which stars Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart ( pictured ) , occupies a ' moral vacuum '
Monsignor Franco Perazzolo , of the Pontifical Council of Culture , said : ' Men and women are transformed with horrible masks and it is once again that age - old trick or ideal formula of using extremes to make an impact at the box office .
' This film is nothing more than a moral vacuum with a deviant message and as such should be of concern . '
The attack comes three weeks after the Catholic Church in Italy condemned Halloween as ' anti-Christian and dangerous ' and urged parents not to dress their children as ghosts and goblins .
In the past , the Vatican has also attacked the Harry Potter books and films .
Six years ago , Pope Benedict XVI criticised the ' subtle seductions ' in J.K. Rowling 's stories , which could ' corrupt the Christian faith ' in impressionable young children .
Last year Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano ran an editorial attacking the teen wizard - as ' the wrong kind of hero ' .
But in a U - turn four months ago it published an article approving of the latest big screen installment , Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince .
The film managed to ' distinguish between good and evil ' , it said .
Cardinals also urged people not to see or read Dan Brown 's The Da Vinci Code , which they said was an insult to Christianity .
The Vatican denied film crews access to churches in Rome when they wanted to shoot sequel Angels and Demons last year .
Twilight , based on books by U.S. author Stephanie Meyer , tells the story of a romance between vampire Edward Cullen ( Robert Pattinson ) and Bella Swan ( Kristen Stewart ) .
The High Court in Britain has ruled that US classified intelligence documents that may support claims by a terrorism suspect that he was tortured can be publicly released .
UK resident Binyam Mohamed spent four years at Guantanamo Bay and claimed he had been tortured while held in Morocco , Pakistan and Afghanistan .
He believes the British government colluded with US intelligence agencies , supplying questions for the detainee .
Until now , those details were blocked from public view after the British government said the release of the information would compromise future intelligence sharing between the two countries .
However , the High Court has ruled the release of the suppressed details will not damage relations .
The information will not be made public immediately , as the British government is appealing the decision " in the strongest possible terms " .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband says he is " deeply disappointed " by the judgment , and says the principle that underpins the sharing of intelligence between countries is at stake .
Mr Miliband says the US will not prejudice its own intelligence if it perceives that it might be disclosed at the order of a foreign court .

Much has been made of Keira Knightley 's slender frame and relatively flat chest .
Indeed , Keira herself has spoken openly of not having breasts , but ' pecs ' , and said that she would die for a curvy body like Scarlett Johansson's .

But in an extraordinarily revealing interview , the actress has told of how American audiences view her rather differently .
The 21 - year - old star of the Pirates of the Caribbean films has spoken of her bemusement at being surgically enhanced by computer trickery in promotional material publicising her films in the US .
She says studio executives and magazine publishers have decided that instead of presenting her as she really is , she should be seen as a lot bustier in case her flat chest ' turned people off ' .
The actress says her breasts were digitally boosted for the advertising campaign for her 2004 movie King Arthur .
She also claims magazine publishers in the US ban stars from appearing on their front covers unless they have at least a C - cup size , or are willing to be digitally enhanced to make it appear as if they have .
Keira , who played Guinevere in King Arthur , said her normal breasts were blown out of all proportion and looked droopy on the advert to promote the film .
' Those things certainly were n't mine , ' she told a US magazine yesterday .
' I remember we had an interesting discussion when they said , " We want to make them slightly larger and you 'll get approval " and I was like , " OK , fine .
' I honestly do n't give a s***. "
' But then they showed me the first copy and these things must have been double - Es - and they were down to my knees .
' And I was like , " I do n't mind you making them bigger , but do n't give me droopy breasts .
They look like your grandmother 's t***' , the actress said .
She then went on to say the incident was certainly not the first time she has had her chest digitally enhanced .
She explained : ' I did one magazine and found out you 're not actually allowed to be on a cover in the US without at least a C cup because it turns people off .
' Apparently they have done market research and found that women want to see no less than a C cup on other women .
Is n't that crazy ?
' So they made my t*** bigger for that as well . '
Miss Knightley 's comments will be seen as refreshingly honest in an industry fettered by publicists and agents watching every word .
the actress has an agent , but unusually , no publicist .
