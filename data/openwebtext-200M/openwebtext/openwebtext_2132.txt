Canadian Network Neutrality Protest May 27
Bell Canada decision sparks continued outrage ...
Rocky Gaudrault , the CEO of Canadian DSL provider TekSavvy , tells me that their planned network neutrality protest is officially scheduled for May 27 .
Canadians plan to protest on Parliament Hill in Ottawa , assuming they are n't detained , tasered , and subsequently liquidated by Bell Canada shock troops .
Obviously I 'm kidding .
Everyone knows it 's the automated Bell Canada hunter seeker drones you have to watch out for .
A few weeks ago , Bell Canada thought it would be a really good idea to degrade the quality of the bandwidth they sold wholesalers by throttling it before it reached competitor networks .
They also thought it would be a good idea initially not to tell any of those competitors and customers they'd be doing this .
Their decision , aimed primarily at ensuring that competing ISPs could n't offer better service than Bell Canada 's throttled Sympatico service , resulted in Canadians getting a crash course in network neutrality .
Gaudrault tells me indie ISPs are expecting a decision by Canadian regulators on whether they plan to do anything about it by May 15 .
The official protest website should have additional information in short order .
Forums – iStockphoto Discussion – Two FBI agents just showed up at my door …
( I think I 'm being investigated ) | iStockphoto.com
File this under more irrational reactionary police action against photographers .
One of my Flickr friends , Hal Bergman , emailed me today to tell me about a recent run in he had with the FBI after photographing the Port of Los Angeles .
According to Bergman , he and a buddy were taking photos at the Port of Los Angeles when they were confronted by a security guard who told them that they could not take photographs of a Valero plant even from the public street .
You can see some of the shots that they got that day on Flickr here .
Bergman did n’t push the issue at the time and left his shoot .
After leaving his shoot he was followed by a man in a pick up truck for a while .
Fast forward to this morning when Bergman says two men with badges show up at his door :
“ So , I go to talk to them .
The first one informs me he needs to ask me some questions about what I was doing in the port complex two weeks ago .
The other one demands to see my driver ’s license .
I politely decline , and he informs me that he already has all the information on it ( I look , and sure enough , there is a photo of me on his clipboard along with god knows what else ) .
He makes a crack about “ wow , you ’re younger than you look in this photo ” when he comments on my birthdate ( gee , thanks ) .
I decide to give him my ID .
We exchange cards .
I give him my business card that says “ Photographer ” as well as my iStock card ( for legitimacy ) , and he gives me his card that says “ Detective , FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force ” .
Yikes . ”
Personally it troubles me that the FBI would think that their best use of time would be to harass photographers out shooting industrial stuff .
It would also seem that at a minimum the FBI used DMV records to track down Bergman and pulled his personal information for the crime of photography .
Stuff like this worries me and makes me wonder if the FBI now is n’t keeping some sort of file on Bergman that could impact him in other ways down the road .
I had a similar run in a few years back when Sheriffs in Oakland stopped me and a few friends while we were shooting in an industrial area of Oakland and demanded our drivers licenses and ran what I felt were illegal background checks on us .
Photographers who are documenting the American landscape should not be subjected to this kind of harassment .
Photography is not a crime .
A 34 - YEAR - OLD driver has been charged over a pile - up involving up to 50 elite cyclists in Kensington last Thursday which threatens to derail the Olympic preparation of the cycling champion Ben Kersten .
Kate Nichols , who suffered horrific injuries during a crash in Germany in 2005 which killed the cycling champion Amy Gillett , was also riding in the large pack after a long lay - off from cycling .
Cyclists in the group , many of whom suffered cuts and bruises after crashing while travelling close to 60 kmh , reported that an older model Ford Falcon sedan swerved into their lane and slammed on its brakes .
They say we 're no more than six degrees of separation from everyone in the world .
So , for instance , you do n't know Harrison Ford , but you know a guy , who knows a guy , who knows a guy who knows Harrison Ford .
What you probably have n't heard is that you most likely are no more than six degrees of sex from Paris Hilton 's vagina .
Pick any random person , and if you dig hard enough you 'll find that they had sex with somebody , who had sex with somebody , who had sex with Paris .
We 'll demonstrate .
Let 's start with an easy one , say , '70s porn star John Holmes :
Have you ever wondered what corrupt Republicans look like when they are caught in the act ?
Well , now you can find out -- live and in color .
Alabama blogger Roger Shuler recently saw his house unlawfully auctioned on the front steps of the Shelby County Courthouse in Columbiana , Alabama .
Shuler explains why this process is unlawful , and it is just the latest threat he has received from the corrupt Republicans who run Shelby County , Alabama .
But this story goes way beyond Alabama .
The lawyer responsible for the unlawful sale of Shuler 's house is William E. Swatek .
His son , Dax Swatek , is a close associate of Bill Canary , who is a close associate of Karl Rove .
In other words , the Swatek 's GOP roots run right up to the front door of the Bush White House .
Mounting evidence , of course , indicates that Canary and Rove were at the heart of plot to politically prosecute former Democratic Governor Don Siegelman .
Ties to the Bush White House help explain why Bill Swatek gets away with all kinds of unlawful acts in Alabama courts , even though he has a 30 - year history of unethical activities .
Bill Swatek has been disciplined three times by the Alabama State Bar , including a suspension of his license for acts of " fraud and deceit . "
He also was tried in criminal court for perjury .
Norwegian automaker
Think Global said Monday it planned to sell low - priced electric cars to the masses and will introduce its first models in the U.S. by the end of next year .
The battery - powered Think City will be able to travel up to 110 miles on a single charge , with a top speed of about 65 mph , the company said .
It will be priced below $ 25,000 .
Oslo - based
Think said venture capital firms RockPort Capital Partners and Kleiner , Perkins , Caufield & Byers had made investments to fund its entry into the U.S. under the auspices of Think North America .
“ This is not a toy , ” said Wilber James , RockPort managing partner .
“ This is a serious car that we expect to sell . ”
Think North America is likely to be based in Southern California , the investors said , and the cars it sells here will be assembled locally .
The venture investors will own half of Think North America .
In March , General Electric Co. invested $ 4 million in Think Global .
Although technology for electric cars has been advancing -- and consumer interest has been rising amid growing concern over gasoline prices and greenhouse gases -- few vehicles have come to market .
Last month , San Carlos , Calif . - based Tesla Motors began production of its Roadster , an electric vehicle that costs $ 100,000 .
The Think City “ is a mass - market vehicle , ” said Kleiner managing partner Ray Lane , dismissing comparisons to the Roadster .
Tesla ’s car is being produced in relatively small numbers , with roughly 300 expected by the end of this year .
“ Our desire is to be selling 30 - 40 - 50,000 of these cars in a couple of years . ”
Think Chief Executive Jan-Olaf Willums said the company would bring test vehicles to the U.S. in the coming months .
The Think City runs on sodium batteries , but future versions could use lithium ion batteries , Willums said .
The company is working with A123 Systems and EnerDel Inc. , to develop the batteries , which would boost range and speed .
With most automakers focusing on hybrid technology , only a handful , including Nissan Motor Co. and Mitsubishi Motor Co. , have announced plans to produce all - electric cars .
Mitsubishi ’s MiEV is set to go on sale in Japan next year .
Ford Motor Co. was the longtime owner of Think but sold it in 2003 .
It was purchased by Norweigan investors two years ago , and began selling cars in Norway this year , with sales in Sweden , Denmark and Britain expected this year .
The company said its annual production capacity in Europe is 10,000 vehicles .
The Think City , a two - seater that can be fitted with two additional seats for children , has a mostly plastic exterior and is 95 % recyclable .
Willums said a convertible was in development .
“ Women want to buy it immediately , ” he said .

Schizophrenia is a devastating illness .
One percent of the world ’s population suffers from its symptoms of hallucinations , psychosis and impaired cognitive ability .
The disease destroys relationships and renders many of its sufferers unable to hold down a job .
What could cause such frightening damage to the brain ?
According to a growing body of research , the culprit is surprising : the flu .
What do women find sexy ?
Hybrids .
They 're chick magnets .
So says a survey by General Motors that found nearly nine in 10 women would rather talk to a guy in a Prius than a Porsche .
Dumping the SUV in favor of an econobox would make you more popular at parties , too .
Eighty percent of respondents said they find people who drive fuel efficient cars more interesting than those that do n't .
Personally , we 've never found people at parties give two shakes about what you rolled up in , but maybe we 're attending the wrong parties .
The survey found 45 percent of respondents consider gas guzzlers a fashion faux - pas .
We 're not about to trust the company that brought us the Pontiac Aztek to know the first thing about what 's sexy , but GM 's survey underscores consumers ' changing attitudes toward fuel efficiency as gas flirts with four bucks a gallon .
It was n't all that long ago that Trent Lott - remember him ?
- said Americans would never embrace small cars and Sen. Barbara Mikulski said we needed " the functional civilian equivalent of a Humvee " to protect us from road rage .
Detroit thought it could keep cranking out SUVs , and people kept buying them even as gas prices topped $ 2 a gallon , then $ 3 .
Just a few weeks ago GM honcho Bob Lutz said people wo n't give up their SUVs and pickup trucks until gas hits 10 bucks a gallon .
But with gas having crossed the $ 4 threshold in some cities and oil prices promising to climb out of sight , people are giving small cars a closer look .
They 're about the only thing automakers are selling these days , hybrid sales grew 38 percent last year even as auto sales declined , and Toyota saw sales of its Prius hybrid jump 67 percent last month .
Even cheap econoboxes from the 1980s and 90s are in high demand .
Fuel economy has become consumers '
No. 1 consideration when choosing a car , trumping even their preference for a particular automaker , according to a recent AAA survey .
Sixty - one percent of those surveyed said the government should adopt tougher fuel economy standards , and the Associated Press says high fuel prices have people driving less .
And someone ought to tell Lutz that GM's own survey found 36 percent of consumers who describe themselves as " on the fence " about buying a hybrid said they'd take the plunge if gas reaches $ 4 a gallon .
As for us , we 're thinking about getting a Nash Metropolitan .

Almost everyone loves video games .
From sports to fantasy adventure RPG , to about anything you can imagine , there are all sorts of games for any type of taste .
Some games never get old : look at Mario , Final Fantasy , and the Legend of Zelda .
Other games , however , should never have made their way out of the idea room .
As a note : it ’s amazing how many terrible games are out there .
If you look at item 15 , it ’s hard to believe there are 14 games worse , and yet …
15 V - Tech Rampage ( 2007 ) System : PC
On the shame level , this one is up there with “ Custer ’s Revenge . ”
This game is based on the Virginia Tech massacre , and the creator of the game said he did so “ because it was funny . ”
14 Bebe ’s Kids ( 1993 ) System : Super Nintendo
A terrible game based on a terrible movie , with one of the most boring games ever .
Characters look like they were made by a 10 year old using Microsoft Paint program .
13 Extreme Paintbrawl ( 1998 ) System : PC game
This is one of the worst games ever , getting only a 6 % out of 100 from PC World , and is best known as the game that was knowingly shipped without any AI programming at all .
This remains the second lowest rated game by PC Gamer US of all time .
12 Zelda : The Wand of Gamelon ( 1993 ) System : CD -i
There were three bastard legend of Zelda games developed by a different company when one branch of Nintendo tried to go to CD technology and failed .
The game is considered one of the worst ever .
11 Kabuki Warriors ( 2001 ) System : X - Box
This is the game that almost killed Microsoft ’s video game dreams .
Early on the system was strong , but the games were terrible .
This video game was so bad that it received some of the lowest scores in the entire history of several video game reviewers .
“ Edge ” only gave it a 1/10 ( it is still the only game ever to score that badly ) while “ Game Informer ” gave it 0.5 out of 10 .
That ’s beyond bad .
10 Aquaman : Battle for Atlantis ( 2003 ) System : Nintendo Game Cube
This game was named the worst game cube game ever , and inspired G - 4 ’s golden mullet award , based on the hair style of one of the evil bosses in this game .
The “ golden mullet award ” is given to the worst game of the year , and it all started with Aquaman .
9 Shaq Fu ( 1994 ) System : SNES & Sega Genesis
How bad is this game ?
It is widely considered by many experts to be the worst fighting game of all time , and it needed Shaq ’s image to make sure it did n’t completely bomb .
The story is idiotic ( Shaq is in Japan and learns kung fu to save the world … really ? )
The controls suck , game play sucks , and this is on almost every top ten list of worst video games ever made .
This game was so terrible , that there is an actual website of people whose mission is to buy every copy and destroy it .
They will pay you for your copy of the game and then destroy it .
That ’s dedication , and worthy of a place on the all time bad game list .
8 FBI Hostage Rescue ( 2004 ) System : PC
The introduction starts out promisingly enough with a full brief , decent looking opening graphics , and the promise of good missions .
And that ’s it .
This game is the epitome of terrible programming and AI .
the professional video game players from GameStop said they NEVER got past level one .
Hostages were stupid , would disappear into walls and thin air , and a ridiculous time limit would count down as you tried to do an impossible mission .
So the graphics are terrible , controls far more complicated than they should be , the AI is junk , and the game is literally impossible … from as early as level one .
7 Drake of the 99 Dragons ( 2003 ) System : Xbox
Early on , Xbox just could not get it right !
Winner of the Golden Mullet award , an award given out for the worst video game every year , this game was generally declared an even worse video game than the Aquaman video game that was so bad it gave them an idea for the Golden Mullet awards .
There is nothing about this game that works .
Not fighting , not graphics , not story line .
With how many early Xbox games were terrible , it ’s amazing the system survived long enough to hit its groove .
Drake is one game that most likely , will not be on the top of anyone ’s list to make Xbox 360 compatible .
6 Bubsy 3D : The Furbitten Fruit ( 1996 ) System : PlayStation
This is on the majority of top ten horrible lists .
The graphics and controls are terrible , and this is a blatant rip off of Mario 64 , with the stupid furry whatever it is yelling a “ cool , hip ” line every 3 seconds .
5 Plumbers Do n’t Wear Ties ( 1994 ) System : 3DO
The 3DO is considered perhaps the worst video game platform ever , and many of the 3DO forums online brag about “ as owners of the 3DO , we gamers know about truly bad games . ”
This game was the bar for bad , by which all the terrible 3DO games were measured .
Most people have never even heard of “ plumbers . ”
They ’re much luckier than the ones who actually played this game , a sad attempt at a sim game about plumbers trying to woo women .
4 Super Man 64 ( 1999 ) System : Nintendo 64
There has n’t been a good Superman game yet , but this one takes the cake .
Terrible cube like graphics that were even worse than pixel games , a weird green haze over everything , and shoddy game play are just a few of the things wrong .
One example : you ’re supposed to be able to throw cars .
Only problem is the game wo n’t let you ever pick one up .
This game was on Nintendo Power ’s list of “ 5 Worst Games Ever , ” and this game even has an award named after it : the “ Superman 64 ” award for most disappointing game of the year .
3 Desert Bus ( planned 1995 ) System : would have been Sega CD
Okay this is kind of a cheap one since it was never technically released , as this was going to be part of a mini- game from an unreleased Penn and Teller video game that would have been released for Sega CD back in 1994 .
This game is now available as a download to PC .
But the idea behind this game ( even if it was meant as a joke , and it is n’t clear if it was or not ) is so bad that it belonged on the top ten .
This game is very straightforward .
You have to drive a bus through the desert from Tucson , Arizona , to Las Vegas , Nevada .
And in an homage to accuracy , the entire trip is in real time , so it is a minimum of 8 hours .
Even better :
There is no scenery or traffic or anything on the road .
Only one plain desert scene that never changes for eight hours .
At five hours of driving , one bug hits the windshield and becomes a green splatter .
And the alignment is off just enough that the bus veers to the right just slightly , so it ’s impossible to just tape down a button and go do something else .
If you make it through eight of the most boring and painful hours of your life , then you score one point .
2 Any “ Adult ” game by Atari
Especially notable : Burning desire and Custer ’s Revenge .
As far as not only being bad , but being “ shameful , ” these are the worst games ever made .
Either they ’re trying to peddle violent sexual fantasies to kids , with those great Atari graphics , or the sheer stupidity of not catching what those games implied is just stunning .
These are the types of games that give video gaming a bad name , and are by far and away the most shameful examples of games ever made .
Not only do these games make almost every list of worst games ever , but when Game Spy Magazine put together a list of the most shameful games ever , Custer ’s Revenge came in # 1 .
There is nothing redeeming in any way about these games , and quite frankly I ’m amazed they were ever allowed to be produced .
1 E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial ( 1982 ) System : Atari 2600
This game was so terrible that even after over 30 years of video gaming , there is still consensus that this is the worst game ever .
So many returned cartridges came back that they literally buried thousands upon thousands of them in the desert , piling concrete on top of it .
This is n’t even a myth .
You can look up online where the dump site is in the Nevada desert .
Ouch .
This game was so bad it single handedly destroyed the Atari corporation , and almost destroyed video games , being the biggest single contributor to the “ Video Game Crash of 1983 . ”
Wow .
I mean , wow .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on Wednesday faced a long fight for the Democratic U.S. presidential nomination , with Obama promising to get tougher on his rival and Clinton hinting the two could team up in November against Republican John McCain .
McCain won the endorsement of President George W. Bush in a White House ceremony that capped the Arizona senator ’s rise to the party ’s nomination after his campaign nearly collapsed last year .
While McCain turned his attention to the November election , Democrats faced more of the grueling state - by - state nominating duel between Obama and Clinton that threatened to extend into June or beyond .
Clinton dodged another possible knockout blow from Obama on Tuesday , coming back from a series of losses to win the big states of Ohio and Texas and revitalize her campaign .
The New York senator said the wins showed she had the type of broad support needed against McCain .
Obama promised to more aggressively confront Clinton , who hammered him in Ohio and Texas with questions about his readiness to be commander in chief , his commitment to renegotiating U.S. trade deals and his strength in a general election campaign .
“ I think that over the coming weeks we will join her in that argument , ” Obama told reporters .
“ She has made the argument that she is thoroughly vetted , in contrast to me .
I think it ’s important to examine that argument . ”
His campaign renewed demands that Clinton release tax returns filed with her husband , former President Bill Clinton , since they left the White House .
Clinton aides said she would release the returns “ on or around April 15 . ”
Obama , an Illinois senator , pointed to his substantial lead in pledged delegates who will select the nominee at the party ’s convention in August , and said he was on the way to the nomination .
Under Democratic rules allowing the losers in each state to win a proportional number of delegates , Clinton must win most of the remaining contests by big margins to have a shot at significantly closing the gap with Obama in the delegate race .
An MSNBC count gave Obama 1,307 pledged delegates to Clinton ’s 1,175 , with most of the delegate apportionment from Tuesday ’s contests still being calculated .
But both candidates are liable to remain short of the 2,025 needed to win the nomination without substantial help from the party ’s 796 “ superdelegates ” -- party officials and insiders who are free to back any candidate .
They could heavily influence the race if they began moving in a bloc toward either Obama or Clinton .

CLINTON , OBAMA ON SAME TICKET ?
The battle also renewed attention on Florida and Michigan , which were stripped of delegates in a dispute with the national party .
Clinton won contests in both states , although the candidates did not campaign there , and officials in both states renewed talks about whether the contests should be redone .
Amid the uncertainty , Clinton acknowledged the prospect the two might wind up on the same ticket as presidential and vice presidential candidates .
“ Well that may be where this is headed , but we have to decide who is on the top of the ticket , ” Clinton , who usually dodges the topic when asked , said on CBS ’s “ The Early Show . ”
Slideshow ( 24 images )
Clinton and Obama both said later it was “ premature ” to discuss a joint ticket .
Up next are Democratic contests in Wyoming on Saturday and Mississippi on Tuesday , and Obama will be favored in both .
The next stop is a big showdown in Pennsylvania on April 22 .
“ I think that voters are finally focused on who they think would be the best commander in chief and who would be the best president to turn the economy around , ” Clinton , 60 , said in an interview on NBC ’s “ Today ” show .
Obama , 46 , said he was still in control of the Democratic race .
“ I ’m pretty confident that we ’re going to end up with more delegates , having won more states , won more primaries , won more caucuses , and have more of the popular vote , ” he said .
McCain ’s big victories in Ohio , Texas , Rhode Island and Vermont on Tuesday drove his last major rival , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , from the race .
“ John showed incredible courage and strength of character and perseverance in order to get to this moment , ” Bush said in offering his support in a Rose Garden endorsement .
“ That ’s exactly what we need in a president -- somebody who can handle the tough decisions , somebody who wo n’t flinch in the face of danger , ” said Bush , who defeated McCain in a bitter 2000 battle for the Republican nomination .
Despite Bush ’s low approval ratings , McCain said he would welcome the president ’s help on the campaign trail .
“ And I will be very privileged to have the opportunity being again on the campaign trail with him , only slightly different roles this time . ” the former Navy fighter pilot and former prisoner of war in Vietnam added .

Study : ' Weight- ism ' More Widespread Than Racism
Our culture condones a bias against people who are overweight , researchers say .
April 2 , 2008  --
It 's illegal to discriminate against someone because of race or gender , but our culture condones a bias against people who are overweight .
There are no federal laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of weight , and only Michigan has such a law , according to a new study from Yale University .
As a result , the researchers contend , weight discrimination is spiraling upward , and that 's a dangerous trend that could add fuel to the obesity epidemic .
Weight discrimination " occurs in employment settings and daily interpersonal relationships virtually as often as race discrimination , and in some cases even more frequently than age or gender discrimination , " the researchers report in the current issue of the International Journal of Obesity .
Overweight women are twice as vulnerable as men , and discrimination strikes much earlier in their lives , the report states .
" This is a form of bias that remains very socially acceptable in our culture , " research scientist Rebecca Puhl , lead author of the study , said in a telephone interview .
Puhl , who was trained as a clinical psychologist , and co-author Tatiana Andreyeva , studied data collected from 3,437 adults as part of a national survey conducted in 1995 - 1996 .
They have just updated the work in a disturbing paper showing that weight discrimination has accelerated through 2006 .
Puhl , who has been studying weight discrimination for nine years , said our culture has made it clear that it 's wrong to discriminate against someone because of race , color , creed , gender , age and so forth , but that it 's OK to show someone the door because he or she is fat .
" We send a message to citizens in our culture that this is something that is tolerated , " she said .
" We live in a culture where we obviously place a premium on fitness , and fitness has come to symbolize very important values in our culture , like hard work and discipline and ambition .
Unfortunately , if a person is not thin , or is overweight or obese , then they must lack self - discipline , have poor willpower , etc. , and as a result they get blamed and stigmatized . "
The social current driving this is the obvious fact that no one is responsible for his or her race , or gender or even age .
That 's a given .
But the traditional thinking goes that people should be able to control their weight , so if they 're obese , it 's their fault .
But that , according to Puhl , is dead wrong .
" We place a lot of emphasis on personal responsibility for body weight , " she said .
" Our billion - dollar diet industry is founded on that premise .
Your weight is modifiable .
But that does not reflect the current state of science .
We know from hundreds of randomized clinically controlled trials that it 's very difficult to sustain weight loss over time with our existing treatment methods . "
" That has compelled a number of expert panels , like the National Institutes of Health , to conclude that we really can't expect you to lose more than 10 percent of your body weight and be able to keep that off . "
For a 300 - pound man , she notes , that 's a mere 30 pounds , and he 's still overweight , unless he 's nearly seven feet tall .
Obesity is based on the body mass index ( BMI ) that is derived from a formula based on weight vs. height .
Normal BMI is 18.5 to 24.9 .
Obesity begins at BMI 30 and ranges up to 40 .
Puhl emphasized that she is n't saying people should n't try to control their weight .
Scores of studies have shown that excess weight contributes to a wide range of diseases , and physical fitness is one of our best bets for fighting everything from heart attacks to aging .
But let 's face it , if diets worked , we would all be skinny .
Many uncontrollable factors contribute to obesity , like genetics and some diseases , yet we still blame the individual .
The heart of the problem , Puhl said , is that obesity brings social stigmatism and stereotyping , and that can lead to depression , discrimination and binge eating , so the problem just gets worse .
But why are we failing so miserably at keeping our weight under control ?
" We live in a very toxic food environment , " Puhl said .
" We make it very easy for people to be unhealthy .
Unhealthy foods , or junk foods , are accessible , cheap and engineered to taste very , very good .
Healthy foods , like produce , are not as accessible , and are more expensive . "
And it 's everywhere .
A friend recently offered me one of those cookies sold by Girl Scouts in our community .
The label on the box said one cookie has four grams of fat .
And nobody eats just one Girl Scout cookie .
It tastes great , it 's cheap and it's for a worthy cause .
But that little angel standing at your door is offering you a one - way ticket to obesity .
So grab a handful , and if you get fat , it 's your fault , right ?
" We take this personal responsibility approach and say well , just exercise more and eat less , but it 's much more complicated than that , " Puhl said .
" If it were that easy , we would n't have this epidemic that we have now . "
So people who are overweight , regardless of the cause , are blamed for their excesses and it's OK to discriminate against them , at least according to federal law and cultural norms .
Here are some of the findings in Puhl 's study :
Puhl ( whose BMI is in the normal range ) thinks this is a very big deal .
Our culture , she said , sanctions biases against people who are even a little overweight .
We blame them for a condition that may result from their genes , or a health problem , and that condemnation in many cases backfires .
And the solution is n't as simple as eat less , exercise more .

LAST week at South by Southwest , the rock music conference held every year in Austin , Tex. , the talk in hotel lobbies , coffeeshops and the convention center was dominated by one issue : how do musicians make a living in the age of the Internet ?
It ’s a problem our industry has struggled with in the wake of the rising popularity of sharing mp3 music files .
Our discussions were brought into sharp relief when news reached Austin of the sale of Bebo.com to AOL for a staggering $ 850 million .
Bebo is a social - networking site whose membership has risen to 40 million in just two years .
In Britain , it ranks with MySpace and Facebook in popularity , although its users tend to come from a younger age group .
Estimates suggested that the founder , Michael Birch ( along with his wife and co-founder , Xochi ) , walked away with $ 600 million for his 70 percent stake in the company .
I heard the news with a particular piquancy , as Mr. Birch has cited me as an influence in Bebo ’s attitude toward artists .
He got in touch two years ago after I took MySpace to task over its proprietary rights clause .
I was concerned that the site was harvesting residual rights from original songs posted there by unsigned musicians .
As a result of my complaints , MySpace changed its terms and conditions to state clearly that all rights to material appearing on the site remain with the originator .
A family member told police about the three babies
The bodies of three babies have been found in a basement freezer in the town of Wenden , in western Germany , prosecutors say .
A woman believed to be the mother of the three has been arrested , a state prosecutor 's office spokesman said .
The three were not stillborn , police said , but the cause of death and the infants ' ages have not been released .
There have been several similar cases in Germany recently , including a woman jailed for killing her eight children .
The babies appeared to have died shortly after birth and were in the freezer wrapped in plastic bags , the prosecutor 's office said .
Post - mortems are to be conducted to establish the cause of death , it added .
' 1988 '
One of the bags contained a newspaper from 1988 , indicating the babies may have died that year , AFP news agency quoted police investigator Herbert Fingerhut as saying .
Officials said a couple with three children aged 18 to 24 lived at the house .
Two of the couple 's adult children found the babies when they were looking for something to eat while their parents were out , police said .
" They both decided to get a pizza and realised that the freezer had to be cleaned up because it was full of out - of - date food , " Mr Fingerhut said .
" It was then that they discovered the first bag . "
One of the couple 's sons went with his parents to the police , who then searched the house and arrested the 44 - year - old woman , who is believed to also be the mother of the three babies , German media have reported .
It is not the first such case in Germany .
Two years ago , the body of a dead toddler was found in the fridge of his drug - addicted parents in the northern city of Bremen .
Also in 2006 , a woman in eastern Germany was sentenced to 15 years in prison for killing eight of her babies .
She had buried them in flower pots and a fish tank in the garden of her parents ' home near the Polish border .

Zimbabwe 's central bank introduced a $ 10 m note in January
Zimbabwe 's soaring inflation hit an annual rate of 100,000 % in January , new official figures show .
Ongoing shortages of food and fuel helped drive inflation from December 's rate of 66,212 % .
Government officials say the shortages make it hard to work out inflation with any degree of accuracy .
About 80 % of the country 's population lives in poverty and it is estimated that three million people have left the country for a new life in South Africa .
New notes
The economy has been in trouble for seven years , with supplies of basic foodstuffs , cooking oil and petrol all running low .
The central bank has introduced new banknotes to cope with the spiralling prices .
Last month it issued a 10 million Zimbabwe dollar note .
President Robert Mugabe stands for re-election next month .
He faces a challenge from his former finance minister , Simba Makoni and the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic change , Morgan Tsvangirai .

It ’s time for what ’s become a semiannual ritual : General David Petraeus comes to Capitol Hill .
Last September , the top military commander in Iraq testified before several House and Senate committees in what was widely depicted as a make - or - break moment for the Bush administration and its war in Iraq .
Wielding charts and graphs , Petraeus , who was accompanied by U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker , claimed that the so - called surge of U.S. troops in Iraq was working and that “ it is possible to achieve our objectives in Iraq over time . ”
Such an outcome , he added , “ will require a long - term effort . ”
The questions he received from the legislators were mostly softballs .
( Neither senators Hillary Clinton nor Barack Obama were impressive when questioning Petraeus . )
But when Republican Senator John Warner asked Petraeus if the Iraq War “ makes America safer , ” the general replied , “ I do n’t know , actually .
I have not sat down and sorted [ it ] out in my own mind . ”
War critics zeroed in on that comment , yet Petraeus ’ performance was generally deemed a success , in that it appeared to have created political space ( in the United States ) for the war — six month ’s of space , at least .
Petraeus told Congress that a decision on reducing the level of troops should be put off until March 2008 and that in half a year he would report back to Congress .
His return is scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday , when he will testify before the armed services and foreign affairs committees of the Senate and the House .
In recent weeks , the purported success of the surge strategy has been called into question , due to the rise of sectarian fighting with the Mahdi militia of Moqtada al - Sadr ( an army also known as JAM ) clashing with the Iraqi military .
Before those battles occurred , Petraeus himself noted that the overall decline in violence ( which in late 2007 dipped to 2005 levels ) had not been accompanied by success on the political front :
“ No one feels that there has been sufficient progress by any means in the area of national reconciliation . ”
And on Tuesday , senior Army and Marines Corps leaders told Congress that the surge of troops in Iraq has placed unsustainable stress on the U.S. military and rendered it less able to handle other conflicts .
Yet Petraeus is not expected to provide Congress with testimony that will inconvenience the Bush administration or undermine its arguments for staying the course in Iraq .
And there ’s no telling if members of Congress — including Democrats — will give Petraeus a more thorough grilling than he received in September , given that most members of Congress appear to have concluded that the House and the Senate cannot do much to slow or reverse Bush ’s war in Iraq .
So I asked various national security experts to provide questions that they would like to see posed to Petraeus .
Here ’s what they want to know .
Andrew Bacevich , professor of history and international relations at Boston University :
— Many credit the “ surge ” with reducing the level of violence in Iraq .
Yet violence continues and over the past several months has leveled out .
How will you reduce violence to levels that are acceptable ?
What is the definition of “ acceptable ” in this context ?
— You have written of counterinsurgency as an enterprise that typically takes 10 to 12 years to complete .
Where do we stand today on that timeline ?
The war is now more than five years old .
Are we halfway to accomplishing our mission ?
Or did the 10 - to - 12 - year “ clock ” only begin when you took command and began to implement the army ’s revised counterinsurgency doctrine ?
Larry Johnson , former CIA and State Department intelligence official :
— How many Iraqi army divisions are capable of conducting unilateral operations ?
— Of those units , what is their ethnic ( i.e. tribal ) and sectarian composition ?
In other words , do we have mixed Sunni - Shiite units , or are we creating glorified tribal militias ?
— Given that groups headed by people such as Abdul Aziz al - Hakim [ leader of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq ] are very closely tied to Iran and considered allies of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , what is the evidence that Iran is trying to destabilize a government filled by people who are sympathetic to Tehran ?
Wayne White , head of the State Department ’s Iraq intelligence team 2003 to 2005 and an adviser to the Iraq Study Group :
— Regarding the JAM - related debacle in March , could the pitter - patter of relatively limited U.S. ( and Iraqi government ) attacks against some of Sadr ’s leaders and JAM cadres during a period in which so many of them were observing a ceasefire not only have had little impact on the JAM ’s overall capabilities , but also have constituted a provocation that increased the level of militancy ( even a desire for revenge ) among many of its fighters ?
Did this expand the JAM ’s popular base ?
— With Hakim seemingly playing ball with Washington , Maliki doing likewise , and the Concerned Local Citizens [ program ] taking most Sunni Arab insurgents off the playing field , have many Shiites come to regard Sadr ’s organization as the only nationalist and anti-American force left standing ?
If so , what can — or should — be done about that ?
Juan Cole , professor of history at University of Michigan :
— General Petraeus , you have done what you can do militarily .
It ’s unclear that more can be done on that front , and yet there is still a fair amount of violence .
The question is , what now ?
This is not facetious .
Sam Gardiner , retired Air Force colonel and expert on military strategy :
— Why did Iran help broker the cease - fire with the Mahdi Army ?
A research professor at a military institute who asked not to be named :
— The Sunni Muslim Awakening groups now have between 80,000 and 100,000 members , according to press reports .
These groups are slated to be reduced to 20,000 or 25,000 as the crisis in western Iraq becomes more manageable .
What is the likelihood that these groups will accept a 75 percent demobilization even if noncombat jobs are found for them ?
Is it possible that they will see a pressing need to remain under arms to protect their home communities from a Shiite - dominated government ?
What would be the consequences if these groups remain in existence at the current level ?
If they are a short - term solution to the Al Qaeda in Iraq problem , might they also be a long - term building block for an Iraqi civil war ?
— There is considerable fear that a residual Al Qaeda presence in western Iraq would lead to a terrorism campaign against neighboring countries .
Yet when Al Qaeda mounted the November 2005 Jordanian hotel bombings , this led to a massive backlash and collapse of already limited Jordanian and Palestinian public sympathy for Al Qaeda , according to all relevant polling .
Does this situation suggest that the danger of terrorism against other regional states is not as great as originally believed since it can lead to counterproductive results for Al Qaeda ?
David Isenberg , military affairs analyst and adjunct scholar with the Cato Institute :
— What role do you see for both private military and security contractors in Iraq in the future ?
— The surge was supposed to provide space for political reconciliation .
What does the recent fighting in Basra and Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq say about the supposed success of the surge ?
— What are the likely average monthly costs for the Iraq war ?
Will they reach a predicted peak level of $ 12 billion a month ?
— Would you advocate a long - term presence of U.S. troops in Iraq ?
If so , under which of the following scenarios ?
A combat scenario : approximately 55,000 military personnel in Iraq , operating at the same pace and conducting the same types of missions as the forces currently deployed there ?
Or a noncombat scenario : approximately 55,000 military personnel indefinitely stationed there in a manner similar to the current practice in Korea or Germany , with the troops rarely , if ever , engaged in combat operations ?
A former intelligence analyst who handled Middle Eastern issues for years and who asked not to be identified by name :
— What is your candid assessment of the chances that the Maliki - led regime can survive without Sadr ’s backing and having failed to convince both the U.S. and Iran that it has the capability to govern ?
— What do you make of Sadr ’s cease - fires ?
And are the positive remarks you and other Americans have made whenever Sadr shows signs of cooperating truly justified ?
— What does the most recent Iranian intervention — the commandant of the al - Qods Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard intervening and getting Sadr to sign another cease - fire — say about Iran ’s role in Iraq and its ability to orchestrate events ?
— How do you assess the military capabilities of the Iraqi forces used in the Basra campaign ?
Who were they , and are the stories of defections of these troops to the other side true ?
Lawrence Wilkerson , chief of staff to former Secretary of State Colin Powell :
— As a military man with some strategic acumen , you must realize how badly positioned the U.S. military is to protect and secure America ’s fundamental strategic interests in the Middle East , interests such as the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz , the security of Israel , relationships with Turkey , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , the Gulf Cooperation Council [ of Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , and the United Arab Emirates ] , and the real fight against Al Qaeda , which is largely in Afghanistan and the tribal areas of Pakistan , not Iraq .
How much concern does this malpositioning risk give you ?
And how swiftly do you believe the U.S. must move to correct it ?
— Clearly , the U.S. destroyed the old balance of power in the Persian Gulf when it invaded Iraq , so that now the U.S. presence in Iraq sits , as it were , upon the scales , balancing Iran .
Since it is inevitable that the U.S. presence in Iraq will be diminished over time , how would you reestablish the balance of power in the wake of that diminishment ? —
Gordon Adams , professor of U.S. Foreign Policy at the School of International Service , American University :
— Why do you and the administration continue to plan policy as if we have any leverage in Iraq ?
Do n’t American forces have precious little to do with the “ frozen ” character of the conflict ?
Sunni peace is dependent on the sheikhs , not us ; Shiite peace is in question because of the decisions of militia we have little influence over ; and Baghdad has already purged its mixed neighborhoods , which has solidified the barriers between hostile neighbors .
A dysfunctional government we prop up has virtually no impact on the country ’s security or economy outside Baghdad , and 70 percent of the people want us to leave .
It seems the U.S. is completely unable to influence the fundamentals of the situation .
So why should anyone assume that more or fewer U.S. troops are the key factor in Iraq ’s future ?
Retired Colonel W. Patrick Lang Jr. , former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency ’s human intelligence service :
— Why has Colonel H.R. McMaster not been promoted to brigadier general ?
McMaster is arguably the most successful officer of the war .
His command of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment at Tal Afar was brilliant .
But he was not promoted , while the usual conformist dullards rise to the top .
The failure to promote McMaster shows the Army has learned little from Iraq .
After all , you were president of the promotion board that should have promoted McMaster .
— Why did the Iraqis go to Qom for mediation of the recent crisis at Basra ?
A former Army colonel and planner who asked not to be identified :
— In Field Manual 3 - 24 , Counterinsurgency , you wrote that forces that learn counterinsurgency effectively have regularly challenged their assumptions , both informally and formally .
What assumptions did you make in the course of planning for surge and postsurge operations and how have you challenged them ?
— You wrote that long - term success in counterinsurgency depends on the people taking charge of their own affairs and the government eliminating as many causes of the insurgency as feasible .
So then how are the latest Iraqi government operations in Basra and Baghdad — which target Sadr ’s competing militia , which is associated with a political party — eliminating the causes of an insurgency , especially when you ’ve said that Al Qaeda in Iraq is enemy No. 1 ?
If the Baghdad government has to use force against a competing power center , is n’t this evidence of a nascent civil war ?
— In Rick Atkinson ’s account of the invasion of Iraq , In the Company of Soldiers , you are depicted as constantly asking Atkinson , “ Tell me how this ends . ”
After five years of war , do you have any better idea of how this all ends ?

The Chinese city of Chengdu was building a new museum , so it opened up the design to an international competition .
British architecture firm Sutherland Hussey won with this building .
The exterior may look ultra-modern , but this City Museum will feature traditional Chinese art like the shadow play and some natural history and folk history .
When completed , the museum will form the fourth side to the famous Tian Fu Square .

Chengdu , in Southern China , is one of the country 's most important economic hubs .

A fitting and catchy phrase for the {*} syntax element , used to indicate the {expand} functionality .
polyphemus operator : Jeff Hobbs from the trenches [ L1 ]
From the same thread :
wart : Mark Roseman [ L2 ]
On the {*} page , JMN suggests :
nipple : " which is clearly better than a wart "
Since I asked the question and wondering now , why this seems to be an unsolved problem :
My stk two suggestions are :
bellybutton : Because that 's , what it looks like ...
: Because that 's , what it looks like ...
Deeper Meaning of ... : Coming from Douglas Adams The Deeper Meaning of Liff ( JHJL Dear WikiGnomes , it is Liff not Life ) , where he invented all the until - then - unknown words for the actions and things we all know , but have no words for .
It also somehow matches the functionality of {*} , since it gets up the deeper meaning of what it follows , and for {* }$var you can say The deeper meaning of $var , which is , what it is ...
slebetman :
Why not the most obvious : the expansion operator .
-- Lars H :
Or perhaps expansion prefix , since it 's rather different from " expr operators " .
-- SPB : expansion operator has clear meaning .
Maybe one could use expop for short ?
Nice because one can intuitively use it in a sentence : expop the list ' and have the right intuitive connotation ... maybe ?
AM Too prozaic :)
I suggest : accolade .
My reasons : the sign { is called an accolade in Dutch , but more importantly the word of old is the name of some intricate dance from the French court , elegant yet complicated .
stk ... and because of Tcl Marketing discussion ...
EKB I like prosaic .
" Expansion operator " sounds good to me .
It says what it does , and will make sense to programmers from other languages .
It could also be called the " Polyphemus operator . "
Something like this : " Oh , that ?
It 's an expansion operator .
Because it looks like an eye , it was officially named ' Polyphemus ' , after the cyclops . " ( " Wart " and " nipple " made me laugh , but I 'd rather not have to use that when introducing people to Tcl ! )
If it looks like an eye , why not just the eye operator ?
It can even be nicely explained then : " The eye operator is for looking into the next argument . " ( KD )
operator ?
It can even be nicely explained then : " The eye operator is for looking into the next argument . " ( KD ) explode : descriptive because something which was one piece breaks into multiple pieces , and it looks like a little explosion - Colin Macleod .
MG also likes " expansion operator " ( especially given that {*} used to be {expand} , if only for a brief time ) , though " explode " is the name used for similar things in PHP , and I believe some other languages , too .
TJK
If you like cute names then how about splat ( a common name for " * " ) , other wise I would vote for expansion trigraph .
-- stk
As a technical term , I like expansion trigraph , but it 's very C- centric and it's not a " cool name " for non-Tclers .
-- Lars H : Also , it is syntactically very different from the C trigraphs , where the usual meaning of the characters is overridden when combined in that particular way .
In {*} all characters retain their usual interpretation , and it is only when they occur in a particular position that the combination means anything special .
LV How about scream ?
The {*} reminds me of a famous painting [ L3 ] ... stk Scream is brilliant ... EKB I agree .
Or it could be the Munch Operator .
It sounds like it came from some deep computation - theoretical source , but actually it 's the painter of The Scream !
escargo -
How about reveal ( or the somewhat more risque , disrobe ) ?
stk
How will this go on , does someone " close " the time for new entries in the poll after a week or so and then start a vote or something ?
LV Since this is n't an official function , it will go on until the community in general sees a term that they like and start using it ...
stk Sure , I know that .
I just thought ... since it was announced as a " poll " not as a " hanging around discussion " , I would expect , that someone actually polls ... ;-)
LV I guess , from the poll point of view , someone could summarize the results here at the bottom , with people updating as they vote on existing names or add new ones ...
EKB OK , I 'll take a shot
JJM Leading expander .
AMG : Making up silly names is fun !
How about dismember or dismemberment operator ?
Mmm , slicy !
( Okay , that was scary . )
stk : " And now , Tcl 8.5 introducing ( put in , whatever wins ) a creation of the Dept. of silly names , a branch of the famous " Ministry of silly walks " [ L4 ]
KBK : How about ' splice ' , because it splices a list into a command under construction ?
Given that it has braces surronding it , we could say " Splice the Main Brace ! "
That would please Pastafarians , and would indeed be familiar to anyone who knows sea language ( C language ? ) .
In nautical usage , it 's come to mean , " let 's have a drink ! "
Ideally of fine whisky , which may come from a stained coffee cup .
The {*} looks a bit like a spill surrounded by the ring from the base of a cup , does n't it ?
Peter Shawhan : RS observed on {expand} that " {expand} is , so to speak , the inverse of list " .
How about calling it the unlist operator ?
JMN Atoning for my earlier contribution , I now suggest : Bracelet .
Not just cute - but we can do ' contrived ' too !
Formed from : Brace List Expansion Trigraph / Trio :)
... and if that 's not contrived enough : Braces ' Round Asterisk Causes Expanded List Equivalent Term / Tcl .
It looks sort of like a jeweled bracelet .. and I figure it's a little easier in corporate situations to refer to the Tcl Bracelet than the Tcl nipple .
( especially if you pronounce T C L as Tickle . )
TP Wart is both a visual clue and a commentary of the Perlification of the Tcl syntax caused by the operator .
stevel - " freckle "
CMcC it 's the goatse operator .
It should have been {|} but what can you do ?
FB - I like !
Perl / Python / Whatever user :
My language is better than yours , because it has < some feature > .
Tcl user :
That 's all fine and dandy , but does your language have the goatse operator ?
Perl / Python / Whatever user : ...
Tcl user : I win .
Now leave us grownups alone and go play in the backyard .
NL Please do not use explode as it have a different meaning in PHP ( more like split ) and will confuse everyone .
hat0 I 'd recommend against splice for the same reason .. both php and perl have other meanings for splice .
I 'd also recommend against anything " clever " because we 're going to be stuck with whatever settles out for a long time , and what 's " clever " now may just seem stupid five years from now .
Keep it simple , easy to understand .
shoo prefix or scatter - faran - scip - prefix , maybe goro - or leak - operator ?
FB : How about " braster " , short for " braced asterisk " ?
MT : I say ' unravel ' ; just because it implies deep thoughts and a sense of mystery .
pcam :
What about " unwind " in the sense of : to separate the tangled parts of ; disentangle . ?
It 's quite obviously a yoni .
As an old Kyokushin practitioner ( it 's about 30 years since I last was in a dojo ) , I can also see it as a Kanku , except for the lack of an enclosing circle .

Is the " standard " name for {*} still undecided ?
How about the " reparse " operator ?
The content is not really changing , just the tokenization , which Tcl calls words .
The Dodekalogue essentially describes {*} as applying an extra cycle through the parser .
aricb - it may not have an official name , but people seem to be calling it the expansion operator or something similar .
If you choose to call it something else , better clarify what you 're talking about or people are likely to be confused .
Recently , with hundreds of Indonesian troops just out of sight in scenes of intense security , Prince Andrew , the government 's official business envoy , dropped in on Bintuni Bay , one of Indonesia 's mots remote corners .
The plan was to inspect BP 's new £ 3.5 bn natural gas plant .
What the Duke of York probably did not know was that he had walked straight into a row between the giant oil company and local villagers .
The British firm had promised its new neighbours , who live on the edge of the pristine Papuan rainforest , better homes , long - term jobs and full environmental protection when it started several years ago to build its giant plant to extract 14 trillion cubic metres of gas .
But with the gas about to flow , village leaders have now complained bitterly that the company has reneged on its agreements .
In a long letter sent to the Guardian and in telephone conversations , Papuan leaders requesting anonymity have complained that the company has blocked off their fishing grounds , attracted a flood of migrants to the villages , provided very few jobs for local people and is now siding with the Indonesian authorities against native Papuans who are engaged in a long struggle for independence .
" Everything we feared when BP came to the area has come true , " claims one community leader .
" People are not allowed to catch any fish or shrimps in the exclusive zone established by BP .
More and more migrants are coming because of the plant .
There is very high inflation because there is lots of money around .
The number of local people from Bintuni Bay who work in the project is very low .
Local Papuans are never recruited as full - time members of staff . "
BP has been desperately keen to avoid the experiences that it , Shell and other oil companies , have had in Africa and Latin America , where oil and gas extraction has left a trail of pollution , human rights abuses and distressed people with no share in the wealth extracted from their land .
The company pledged from the start to set new social and environmental standards , and to be a model of corporate social responsibility .
It hired some of the best development NGOs to offer advice .
Papuan leaders say they were initially impressed when BP completely rebuilt one fishing village , poured money into the nearby communities , and employed leading environment , human rights and health groups to advise them on how to avoid conflict and bring prosperity to the villages .
But as the project has come closer to opening , people have flooded into the area .
" Conflicts between local communities and migrants have begun , " says the leader .
" The migrants [ from all over Indonesia ] have come here to look for jobs , and are staying .
There are about 1,500 in the village of Babo and 1,200 in Bintuni .
They are the majority now in all the villages , " he says .
The Tangguh gas field , believed to be eventually worth more than £ 100bn to BP and the Indonesian government , is one of the largest in the world .
Known as a " super giant " , it is contracted to provide gas for China , Mexico and the US , and should last 30 years .
But the Papuan leaders , who have long been pressing for independence from Indonesia , say they fear that BP is taking sides with the Indonesian government , as they are bypassed from all the lasting benefits .
According to documents seen by the Guardian , less than £ 30 m was budgeted for the Tangguh social programme over six years , including money for resettlement and security ; nearly £ 15 m was earmarked for " consultants " and administration .
The nine most affected villages in the area are being given £ 15,000 a year for five years , and others in the area £ 5,500 a year .
" BP has built 100 houses for 100 heads of families .
All looks wonderful , " another village leader says .
" But the people actually suffer mentally from their new settlement .
Their access to the sea is limited because of the company 's exclusion zone , and they cannot expand their gardens .
They do not have enough [ space ] to expand their families . "
Criticism of BP 's employment policy was levelled at the company last year and the Tangguh Independent Advisory Panel , chaired by Lord [ David ]
Hannay , to monitor the project , encouraged BP to employ more Papuans and to educate the local population about the " demobilisation " process when the construction work is complete .
Although nearly 6,000 people have been employed in constructing the plant , fewer than 500 will be employed by the company after the building is complete later this year .
Of these , only around 50 are expected to be Papuan .
" People 's dependency on BP is very high .
There will be problems when the work ends .
There will be economic and psychological degradation , " say Papuan leaders in their letter to the Guardian .
" We predicted that BP and Indonesia would not care about the very survival of the Papuans on their land and their nation .
We expected that BP and Indonesia would continuously destroy our forests and our trees and pollute the rivers and seas , " they says .
" And we feared that BP and Indonesia would bring misfortune for the Papuans by employing skilled workers from outside West Papua , claiming that we Papuans are not ' skilled workers ' .
I have to tell you that our worst predictions and fears have come true . "
BP denies that it is causing environmental damage , or that it is favouring non-Papuans .
The company said it is bound by strict guidelines about how many Papuans should be employed .
A spokesman says : " We think about 30 % of the construction workforce is Papuan .
The intention is that there will be long - term employment for Papuans .
We are prioritising the most affected villages , " says a BP spokesman .
But he also concedes that Papua is large and that it has been difficult to identify who is an original inhabitant of these villages .
On the fishing situation , he points out that BP has provided outboard motors to some people so they can travel further to fishing grounds .
" We believe we have set new standards for the BP group .
There has been a lot of progress but there is no complacency , " he says .
Abstract
Context Studies of selected groups of persons with mental illness , such as those who are institutionalized or seen in mental health clinics , have reported rates of smoking to be higher than in persons without mental illness .
However , recent population - based , nationally representative data are lacking .
Objective
To assess rates of smoking and tobacco cessation in adults , with and without mental illness .
Design , Setting , and Participants Analysis of data on 4411 respondents aged 15 to 54 years from the National Comorbidity Survey , a nationally representative multistage probability survey conducted from 1991 to 1992 .
Main Outcome Measures Rates of smoking and tobacco cessation according to the number and type of psychiatric diagnoses , assessed by a modified version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview .
Results Current smoking rates for respondents with no mental illness , lifetime mental illness , and past - month mental illness were 22.5 % , 34.8 % , and 41.0 % , respectively .
Lifetime smoking rates were 39.1 % , 55.3 % , and 59.0 % , respectively ( P<.001 for all comparisons ) .
Smokers with any history of mental illness had a self - reported quit rate of 37.1 % ( P = .04 ) , and smokers with past - month mental illness had a self - reported quit rate of 30.5 % ( P<.001 ) compared with smokers without mental illness ( 42.5 % ) .
Odds ratios for current and lifetime smoking in respondents with mental illness in the past month vs respondents without mental illness , adjusted for age , sex , and region of the country , were 2.7 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 2.3-3.1 ) and 2.7 ( 95 % CI , 2.4-3.2 ) , respectively .
Persons with a mental disorder in the past month consumed approximately 44.3 % of cigarettes smoked by this nationally representative sample .
Conclusions Persons with mental illness are about twice as likely to smoke as other persons but have substantial quit rates .
Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States .
1
In an effort to target public health interventions , recent studies have focused on smoking in distinct populations , such as pregnant women2 and adolescents .
3
We believe those with mental illness are another group that merits special attention .
Previous studies have found high smoking rates among selected populations of persons with mental illness , such as psychiatric outpatients4 and patients in a state mental hospital .
5
Others have found elevated smoking rates among patients with specific diagnoses , such as bipolar illness , depression , schizophrenia , and panic disorder .
6 - 11 Persons with mental illness may encounter greater difficulty with tobacco cessation .
4,12,13
However , no recent study has analyzed rates of smoking and quit rates across the spectrum of psychiatric diagnoses in a nationally representative sample .
We hypothesized that persons with mental illness smoke at higher rates than persons without mental illness , have lower quit rates , and comprise a large proportion of the US tobacco market .
We used population - based data from the National Comorbidity Survey14 ( NCS ) to examine the association between type and severity of mental illness and the likelihood of smoking and subsequent cessation .
The NCS differed from previous studies because it was the first to administer a structured psychiatric interview to a nationally representative sample .
15 Furthermore , the NCS was specifically designed to examine both substance - use and nonsubstance - use psychiatric disorders .
Methods
Data Sources
The NCS was a congressionally mandated study of the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the United States .
15 Administered between September 1990 and February 1992 , the survey used a stratified , multistage probability sample of persons aged 15 to 54 years in the noninstitutionalized civilian population .
The data were released for public use in 1998 .
The study design allowed for estimation of the national prevalence of mental illness as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Third Edition , Revised ( DSM - III - R ) .16
The NCS surveyed 8098 persons .
Questions regarding tobacco use were asked of the 4411 respondents interviewed during the latter half of the survey ( 1991 - 1992 ) .
Specially trained staff from the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan administered a modified version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview ( CIDI ) .
17
The CIDI is a well - validated , structured diagnostic interview based on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule ( DIS ) , which was used in the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study .18
In the NCS , the overall response rate was 82.4 % ; nonrespondents resembled respondents in age and sex , which are the only demographic variables available for all nonrespondents .
A supplemental survey was administered to a random sample of nonrespondents , who were found to have elevated rates of both lifetime and current psychiatric disorders .
The data were weighted to account for sample design ( ie , probabilities of selection among households ) and for nonresponse using information from the supplemental survey .
An additional weight was used to extrapolate the data to the national population by age , sex , race or ethnicity , marital status , educational level , living arrangements , region , and urbanicity ( Table 1 ) .
Definitions of Mental Illness and Tobacco Use
We defined respondents as lifetime smokers if they answered affirmatively to the question , " Have you ever smoked daily for a month or more ? "
We defined current smokers as those who responded , " in the past month " when they were asked , " When was the last time you smoked fairly regularly — in the past month , past six months , past year , or more than a year ago ? "
We defined the quit rate as the proportion of lifetime smokers who were not current smokers .
Because this definition of quit rate differs from that used in other studies , we also analyzed the data with a more conservative definition of quit rate : the proportion of lifetime smokers who had stopped smoking for more than a year .
This analysis did not significantly change our findings ; hence , we used the former definition of quit rate .
The NCS did not ascertain the total lifetime consumption of tobacco or the current number of cigarettes smoked .
However , respondents were asked , " How many cigarettes did you smoke per day during the period when you were smoking most ? "
We defined this number as peak consumption .
We considered persons whose peak consumption exceeded 24 cigarettes per day to be heavy smokers .
We defined moderate and light smokers as those whose peak consumption was 24 cigarettes per day or less .
We did not analyze cigar or pipe smoking .
We defined mental illness as major depression , bipolar disorder , dysthymia , panic disorder , agoraphobia , social phobia , simple phobia , generalized anxiety disorder , alcohol abuse , alcohol dependence , drug abuse , drug dependence , antisocial personality , conduct disorder , or nonaffective psychosis .
The latter includes schizophrenia , schizophreniform disorder , schizoaffective disorder , delusional disorder , and atypical psychosis .
We analyzed persons with and without any mental illness at any time in their lives ( lifetime mental illness ) , persons with active mental illness in the past month ( whom we define as " the mentally ill " ) , and persons with each of the individual DSM - III -R diagnoses and with multiple DSM - III -R diagnoses .
In addition , we compared smoking rates in respondents with current alcohol and drug use to those of respondents who had been abstinent for at least 1 year .
We also estimated the proportion of all cigarettes smoked in the United States that were consumed by persons with mental illness via the following calculation : ( M ) ( C 1 ) / { ( N ) ( C 2 ) + ( M ) ( C 1 ) } , where M = the number of current smokers with mental illness in the past month ; C 1 = the mean peak consumption of cigarettes per day by current smokers with mental illness in the past month ; N = the number of current smokers without mental illness in the past month , which includes persons with and without lifetime mental illness ; and C 2 = the mean peak consumption of cigarettes per day by current smokers without mental illness in the past month .
For both persons with and without mental illness , we assumed that the peak number of cigarettes consumed correlated with the current number of cigarettes consumed .
Statistical Methods
We used the SAS computer statistical package ( Version 7 ; SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) .
We used the χ 2 test to compare differences between groups in the proportion of persons who smoked , and the Mantel Haenszel χ 2 test for trend to compare smoking rates with the number of lifetime DSM - III -R diagnoses .
We used logistic regression to analyze mental illness as a predictor of smoking , while controlling for sex , age , and region of the United States .
Results
The demographic characteristics of persons with a lifetime history of mental illness and persons with mental illness in the past month are shown in Table 1 .
The population prevalence of current smoking was 28.5 % , while the lifetime prevalence was 47.1 % .
Forty - one percent of persons who reported having mental illness in the past month were current smokers and represented 40.6 % of all current smokers in the United States .
Respondents with a history of mental illness had elevated smoking rates , and smoking rates increased further in respondents with mental illness in the past month ( Table 2 ) .
Current smokers without mental illness in the past month ( n = 746 ) had a mean peak consumption of 22.6 cigarettes per day vs 26.2 in those with mental illness in the past month ( n = 511 ) .
We estimated that persons with mental illness comprised 44.3 % of the US tobacco market .
The relationship between smoking and mental illness persisted when we controlled for age , sex , and geographic region using logistic regression ( details available on request ) .
Compared with respondents without mental illness , those with any history of mental illness were significantly more likely to be lifetime smokers ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 2.1 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.9 - 2.4 ) or current smokers ( OR , 1.9 ; 95 % CI , 1.7 - 2.2 ) .
This relationship was stronger among respondents with mental illness in the past month ( OR , 2.7 ; 95 % CI , 2.3-3.1 for current smokers ; OR , 2.7 ; 95 % CI , 2.4-3.2 for lifetime smokers ) .
Persons with multiple lifetime psychiatric diagnoses had higher rates of smoking and smoked more heavily than persons with only 1 DSM - III -R diagnosis ( P<.001 , Figure 1 ) .
Heavy smoking was rare in persons with no history of mental illness ; only 10 % of such persons were heavy smokers .
We observed a dose - response relationship between the number of lifetime psychiatric diagnoses and smoking rates .
Quit rates were lower in smokers with mental illness in the past month ( 30.5 % , P < .0001 ) and in smokers with any lifetime history of mental illness ( 37.1 % , P = .04 ) compared with smokers without mental illness ( 42.5 % ) .
Table 3 and Table 4 show smoking rates according to psychiatric diagnosis ( lifetime and in the past month ) , as well as the corresponding quit rates .
The quit rates of respondents who were abstinent from alcohol ( 41.5 % ) or drugs ( 39.0 % ) were similar to the quit rate of persons with no mental illness history ( 42.5 % ) .
Due to small numbers in some diagnostic categories , differences between individual diagnoses should be interpreted cautiously .
Comment
We found that persons with mental illness are about twice as likely to smoke as other persons , a finding consistent with previous studies .
4,6,19,20 Population - based data collected in the early 1980s by the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study showed that persons with major depression , dysthymia , agoraphobia , and alcoholism were 1.6 to 4.7 times more likely to have ever smoked than subjects without mental illness .
6
However , we observed that more than a third of patients with a history of mental illness had quit smoking by the time of the survey .
The quit rate in the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study was lower than this and was only determined for persons with major depression .
Our finding that persons abstinent from alcohol had quit rates equal to those of persons without mental illness confirms previous findings .
21 However , our finding that persons abstinent from drugs also had quit rates equal to those of persons without mental illness is a novel one .
Our study is based on data collected from 1991 to 1992 and released for public use in 1998 , the most recent national data available on mental illness and smoking .
Given the minimal decline in the prevalence of smoking in the United States over the past decade , from 26.5 % in 1992 to 24.7 % in 1997,22 our findings are still pertinent .
Similarly , we doubt that the prevalence of mental illness has decreased dramatically since 1992 .
In the NCS , almost half of the respondents had experienced a DSM - III - R–defined mental illness in their lifetime , and 28 % had experienced mental illness in the past month .
These numbers appear high because the definition of mental illness in the NCS ( the standard definition used by most psychiatrists in the United States ) encompassed a broad spectrum of severity , from simple phobia to schizophrenia .
Mentally - ill cigarette smokers , like other smokers , are at high risk of smoking - related deaths .
Persons with major depression , alcohol disorders , and schizophrenia have high mortality rates from vascular disease and cancer .23
Smoking also complicates the treatment of some mental disorders by decreasing blood levels of neuroleptics .
24
Thus , smokers may require larger doses to achieve therapeutic effect , and thereby run an increased risk of adverse effects .
13,25,26 Some26,27 but not all 28,29 studies have found that smokers experience more tardive dyskinesia than nonsmokers .
Why do the mentally ill smoke more ?
Some have suggested that such persons use cigarettes as a means of self - medication of psychiatric symptoms .
13,30
This theory implicitly assumes that mental illness causes smoking .
However , recent finding s9,10,31 raise questions about the direction of causality .
In a study of childhood and adolescent depression ,31 antecedent smoking was associated with an increased risk of depression , but not vice - versa .
Similarly , current smokers have an elevated risk of first - time occurrence of panic attacks relative to nonsmokers or former smokers ,10 and smoking may increase the risk of certain anxiety disorders during late adolescence and early adulthood .
32 Lastly , a recent study9 found that smoking preceded the onset of schizophrenia in the majority of persons with schizophrenia who smoked .
Internal documents from the tobacco industry suggest that the industry has identified psychologically vulnerable persons as a part of their tobacco market .
In the 1981 Segmentation Study , 33 market researchers at R. J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co described smokers who smoked for " mood enhancement " and " positive stimulation . "
This marketing study implied that smokers used nicotine for depressive symptoms , stating that smoking " helps perk you up " and " helps you think out problems . "
The authors also identified the role of smoking in " anxiety relief , " stating that smoking helped people " gain self - control , " " calm down , " and " cope with stress . "
While studies have shown that cigarette advertising and promotion influence smoking in adolescents , 34 no studies have examined the effect of cigarette advertising on the mentally ill .
Extrapolating our results to the US population , we estimate that persons with a diagnosable mental disorder in the past month consume nearly half of all cigarettes smoked in the United States .
Our findings emphasize the importance of focusing smoking prevention and cessation efforts on the mentally ill .
Individual clinicians ' efforts in this regard need to be coupled with broader public policy interventions .
Increases in tobacco taxes and antismoking media campaigns have been shown to reduce cigarette sales and consumption ,35 - 38 particularly in lower - income smokers .
37
While data are not available on the impact of tobacco taxation on the subpopulation of smokers with mental illness , we believe that taxation might be an effective smoking deterrent in this group , which tends to be at a low - income level .
Tax revenues could then be used to fund smoking cessation and other programs for persons with mental illness and to support counter - advertising campaigns .
Mental illness carries a unique burden of suffering — an " inexplicable agony " — according to one eloquent victim .39
The mentally ill also carry the burden of nearly half of all US tobacco consumption .
However , the fact that smokers with mental illness are able to quit should offer hope .
Global Warming Massive Computer Centers Bad for the Environment
There 's been a lot of hand - wringing lately about how much air traffic contributes to global warming .
But another damaging culprit has recently been found : the Internet .
Computer centers consume massive amounts of energy , and their use is growing astronomically .
Robert Mugabe is preparing to defy international pressure and launch a systematic crackdown in Zimbabwe aimed at reversing his defeat in the presidential election two weeks ago , according to dissident policemen who have been briefed on his plans .
Through an intermediary , the policemen told The Independent on Sunday that they have been ordered to be ready to deploy today or tomorrow .
With their ranks swollen by so - called " war veterans " given police uniforms , they would take over constituency " command centres " used in the 29 March elections .
Two weeks ago the ruling Zanu - PF party not only lost its majority in the House of Assembly , but , in the presidential contest , Mr Mugabe is believed to have finished well behind Morgan Tsvangirai , leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The growing crisis over the government 's failure to release the election results , coupled with rising violence in rural areas where the MDC did well , has reinforced fears of a crackdown .
Mr Mugabe has also defied international pressure to declare the result , spurning a regional summit on Zimbabwe 's problems called yesterday by the President of neighbouring Zambia .
On Friday , police banned all political rallies , a move initially thought to be aimed at an MDC protest meeting in the capital Harare today .
A police spokesman said the force did not have enough officers to handle rallies because many were still guarding ballot boxes or preventing post-election violence .
But it appears the order may also have been issued to give the police time to move into position around the country .
Once they are deployed , opposition parties believe , the government could announce the presidential result and the date of the second round , claiming no candidate won an overall majority .
This would also forestall the MDC's High Court action demanding the immediate release of the results , on which a judge has promised to rule tomorrow .
The dissident policemen said that " war veterans " – in reality Zanu - PF enforcers – would be given police uniforms , and , for the first time , police numbers , making it impossible to distinguish them from regular officers .
In rural constituencies , the policemen said they had been told their role would be to campaign openly for Mr Mugabe .
Some areas would be closed altogether to outsiders .
" This is a national plan , " they told the intermediary .
They added that the " war veterans " had been recruited to act as watchdogs over any policemen reluctant to carry out orders .
President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa met Mr Mugabe in Harare yesterday before going on to Zambia , but said there was " no crisis " in Zimbabwe and called for patience .
Yesterday , Gordon Brown called for the election results to be published " immediately " .
Yushchenko did not explicitly accuse the Russian government of involvement in his poisoning , but he did say he has " practically all the pieces put together " and that the attempt against his life was " not a private action . "
Yushchenko fell gravely ill in September 2004 during his pro-Western campaign for the Ukrainian presidency .
He was rushed to a clinic in Vienna , where doctors determined he had ingested large quantities of the poison dioxin .
Yushchenko survived and eventually returned to Kyiv -- his face horribly scarred by the poison -- to defeat pro-Moscow candidate Viktor Yanukovych in a late December rerun of the first vote , which was deemed to have been rigged .
The rerun was ordered by the country 's Supreme Court after weeks of Orange Revolution protests .
Now , Yushchenko is accusing Russia of blocking an investigation into who was behind the poisoning , and of harboring three key suspects in the case .
No one has ever been charged .
Requests Unanswered
In comments on September 11 to reporters in Dnipropetrovsk , in central Ukraine , Yushchenko said only three laboratories in the world produce dioxin , and that Ukraine has received samples from two of them .
" Analyses of dioxin have been made from all laboratories in the world , except those in Russia .
I believe and hope that this research will also be done soon , " Yushchenko said .
" The three people needed most for the investigation are currently in Russia .
All our requests to the prosecutor - general to have these people appear in Ukrainian courts have gone unanswered , including one in December that I personally handed over , requesting the help of Russian President Vladimir Putin . "
Yushchenko said it is very easy to determine the origin of dioxin .
The fact that Russia has not sent samples to be analyzed , he said , " limits the possibilities of the investigation . "
He added that Moscow has a moral obligation to cooperate .
" A country cannot let an attempt on anyone 's life go unpunished , let alone on a presidential candidate .
For both the country 's honor and rule of law , the investigation must be completed and people have a right to know who committed the crime , " Yushchenko said .
In separate newspaper interviews on Tuesday -- with " The Times " of London and the French daily " Le Figaro " -- Yushchenko stopped short of accusing Moscow of involvement , but said the attempt against his life was not the work of " private " individuals .
' Sudden ' Accusations
There has been no official reaction from the Kremlin to Yushchenko's statements .
But Moscow 's ambassador to Kyiv , Viktor Chernomyrdin , expressed surprise , saying he knows of no requests from Kyiv for assistance .
" Why are they making such accusations now , all of a sudden ?
They should have asked and talked to us .
But who did they ask , who did they talk to ?
I have no idea , I 've been here all the time and I have met the [ Ukrainian ] president many times and not only him , but also others , and it is the first time I 've heard that he made such a request to the [ Russian ] president himself , " Chernomyrdin said .
Russian political analyst Sergei Markov , who has close ties to the Kremlin , told RFE / RL's Ukrainian Service that Yushchenko's allegations reflect nothing more than a deep - seated resentment toward Russia .
" Yushchenko is a Russophobe in his views .
He hates Russia and Russians .
He is trying to find a pretext for accusing Russia of something , " Markov said .
He continued : " Yushchenko is jumping to take advantage of the accusations made in Great Britain and other countries that Russia is hindering court investigations into murders and poisonings -- in particular , the accusation that Russia is hindering the investigation into [ former security officer Aleksandr ]
Litvinenko's poisoning .
He 's simply making use of this pattern . "
It is unclear why the Ukrainian president waited three years to level such an accusation .
Ukrainian political expert Kost Bondarenko suggests such claims -- about Yushchenko's poisoning and other high - profile criminal cases -- may be seen as useful PR for Yushchenko and his Our Ukraine bloc ahead of Ukraine 's September 30 parliamentary elections .
" These are absolutely groundless accusations .
As early as two years ago , Yuriy Lutsenko , who was then [ Ukrainian ] interior minister , announced that the [ poisoning ] case had actually been solved and that he knew all the perpetrators , " Bondarenko said .
" They are now trying to find a way out of this situation . "
He added that people are increasingly seeking answers not only to the Yushchenko poisoning , but also to the unsolved murders of Ukrainian journalist Heorhiy Gongadze in 2000 and former National Bank governor Vadym Hetman in 1998 .
Yushchenko's physical appearance has markedly improved since the poisoning .
His face is still pockmarked but his skin seems to have healed considerably and no longer has a grayish - green hue .
Describing his recovery to reporters in Dnipropetrovsk , Yushchenko said , " Given what has happened over the past three years , I have not really told anyone how difficult it has been for me simply to get up each morning , or for how many months I have no longer been taking pain - killers and antibiotics -- in short , the price I paid to remain among you . "
Yushchenko has had to undergo regular treatment at a Swiss clinic to remove the dioxin from his body .
Obama or Clinton : Will Party Elite or Voters Decide ?
Democratic rivals woo party elite in contest that could go the distance .
Feb. 8 , 2008  -- With Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama digging in their heels in an entrenched battle for the Democratic Party 's presidential nomination , some Democrats worry that the fight could carry all the way to the party 's national convention in August in Denver .
That 's led to an uproar by some about the role of the 796 Democratic " super delegates " -- state party leaders , national party leaders and former Democratic presidents -- who get to act as free agents at the party 's convention able to back any candidate they wish .
" If 795 of my colleagues decide this election , I will quit the Democratic Party .
I feel very strongly about this , " Donna Brazile told CNN this week .
Brazile , who managed Al Gore 's presidential campaign in 2000 , is herself a super delegate .
Super Delegate Uproar
The prospect of the Democratic presidential nomination being decided by super delegates has also raised the ire of left - wing bloggers , who have suggested it would not be democratic to have party leaders decide between Obama and Clinton .
" This is a complete disaster , " blogged Chris Bowers this week on his Open Left website .
" It will shine light on complicated bylaws , and the questionable democratic nature of the delegate selection process instead of on voters .
Fascinating as it might be for political junkies , it is not the kind of image Democrats need , " Bowers wrote .
Other liberal pundits are piling on against what they call the " tyranny " of the Democratic Party 's super delegates .
" Strengthen our democracy by reforming the super - delegate system so that the people , not the party establishment , choose their candidate , " blogged Katrina vanden Heuvel , editor of The Nation .
Dean : Decide Before Convention
The firestorm over the role of super delegates may be premature .
This week , Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean said that if there is no nominee selected by mid-March or April , or by the last presidential primary on the Democratic calendar in June , the party would likely bring both sides together to work out a deal .
" I do n't think we can afford to have a brokered convention , " Dean told NY1 this week .
" That would not be good news for either party . "
Not taking any chances , the Obama and Clinton campaigns have been actively wooing super delegates .
A Clinton campaign official told ABC News ' Kate Snow that even Chelsea Clinton has been making calls to super delegates when she 's in the car between stops at campaign events .
Democratic super delegate Vince Powers , an attorney and party official in Lincoln , Neb. , originally endorsed former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina , but got a call from former president Bill Clinton minutes before Edwards delivered his official farewell speech last Wednesday .
Powers told ABC News ' Michael Elmore that he told Bill Clinton he would n't be endorsing another candidate unless they personally visited Nebraska .
" We 're not asking for much .
We do n't get much help from the national party , " Powers told ABC News .
" We are starved out here .
I want a generation that says they remember when Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama campaigned out here . "
Obama visited Nebraska this week , and now Powers is supporting him .
Most Super Delegates Undecided
Of the almost 800 super delegates , less than half have decided whom they will support at the convention ; the rest are sitting on the fence , according to ongoing calls by ABC News to the super delegates .
Of the 400 super delegates who have committed , Clinton is leading , with the support of 213 super delegates ; 142 are committed to Obama , according to the latest ABC News survey .

This week Obama warned super delegates to vote the way their states have voted .
" If this contest comes down to super delegates , we are going to be able to say we have more pledged delegates , which means the Democratic voters have spoken .
Those super delegates , those party insiders would have to think long and hard how they would approach the nomination , " Obama told reporters this week .
Despite the assertions by liberal bloggers that super delegates are contrary to the principles of the Democratic Party , the party decided more than three decades ago that party leaders and former Democratic politicians should become the ultimate deciders in a tight race .
Super delegates were created to essentially blunt any party outsider who built up a head of steam in the primaries .
After the insurgent outsider campaigns of George McGovern and Jimmy Carter won the Democratic party nominations in 1972 and 1976 , many party officials felt the need to have a greater role in the process .
Democratic National Committee press secretary Stacie Paxton said super delegates play an important role in the party 's nomination process .
" Unpledged delegates , aka super delegates -- about 19 percent of the delegates to the Democratic convention -- represent a range of people from party activists to elected officials to rank and file Democrats who are active in grassroots politics , " Paxton argued .
" Unpledged delegates are elected and entrusted by voters to represent their states , " she said .
Former Sen. Gary Hart , D - Colo. , who lost his 1984 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination to Vice President Walter Mondale , blames super delegates for scuttling his bid .
" In 1984 , I was roughly the equivalent of the Obama candidate .
I was the new figure , the new face , " Hart said in an interview with ABC News .
" The super delegates in that contest did make the difference .
I wanted their support , and I did n't get it . "
Legitimacy Problem
Hart said Clinton could have a legitimacy problem if the super delegates swing her way , as they did in 1984 for Mondale .
" What they should do … unlike my year , they should keep an open mind to see how until the end of the caucus and primary process , which goes at least till May , and then make their mind up after that , after speaking to both candidates and deciding which one would be more electable and run the stronger race in the fall , " Hart said .
But Hart , who is now a professor at the University of Colorado , has accepted the role super delegates have been given in the party .
" Many have put their lives into the party , and building the party , or running for office and holding office so they feel that they have some claim on participation , and I think that , to a point , is fair , " he said .
" It 's not quite pure democracy but it's one of the accommodations that institutions make . "

Manchester United 1 - 1 Chelsea ( Manchester United win 6 - 5 on penalties )
UEFA Champions League Final
21 May 2008 – Luzhniki Stadium – Moscow
Time : 20:45 ( CET ) , 19:45 ( UK ) , 23:45 ( PK ) , 14:45 ( EST ) .
Update : Get your Manchester United ‘ Champions ’ merchandise here .
Nothing that I can put into words can express the range of emotions that the players and the fans watching around the world went through during this game .
Nothing anyone can say will ever capture the drama of the penalty shootout – Cech saving from Ronaldo , EVDS being beaten every time till Terry pumped it wide , coolness personified from Ryan Giggs to slot his penalty and then Edwin van der Sar ’s save to win the Champions League .
It was madness – for United to take the lead , slip up , stagger from the return punch and then slip up again at the final hurdle – it took massive , massive balls to stay in there and while Terry will cop the responsibility from most sections , the game was there to be won for both sides in normal time .
Well played Chelsea – it was an absorbing and fitting finale to the season .
When Mourinho left and Grant lost his first game to United , it seemed like their season was over but they came back strong and pushed United to the final hurdle .
No other team in the Premier League currently has the quality or the spirit to do this , well done .
Fantastic stuff from Manchester United – defeat here would n’t have taken anything away from a great season but victory and the league and european cup double serves to highlight the spirit and tenacity of this United side .
Few teams recover from the horror start they had to the season – to go on and win the double is fantastic .
I ’m off to celebrate 🙂 Glory Glory Manchester United !!!
Manchester United v Chelsea Preview
The 2007/2008 season will end like it started – with Chelsea and Manchester United scrapping for bragging rights as the best team in England .
United have won the Premier League but for both clubs the Champions League holds a greater significance .
The various stats , trivia , historical links and significant milestones have been done to death – if you want a comprehensive list please download the press kit from UEFA ( PDF ) .
Both teams will hold a press conference on Tuesday evening before their respective training sessions , something that will give us a good picture of prospective starting lineups .
As Grant said , this wo n’t be a platform for tactical surprises so expect something similar to what you ’ve seen at Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge this season – both teams tight at the back and pushing forward in numbers when they get the chance .
United have , in recent matches against Chelsea , Arsenal and sometimes even Liverpool , have had a weak center that ’s been unable to hold it ’s own and as a result the team is often pinned back , although that does allow United to play on the counter and create opportunities as we ’ve seen against Liverpool and Arsenal .
In fact at Emirates United were quite positive ( as they were at Old Trafford against Chelsea , even before the red card ) and I hope we ’ll see that again in Moscow with a strong midfield standing up to Chelsea and pushing them back instead of being pinned outside the penalty area .
If you ’re aching for pretty triangles , you ’re in the wrong place .
The end product of the two sides ’ playing styles is a battle of physical attrition split by the odd mistake or moment of brilliance , and unless one team plays shockingly poor you ’ll see a fairly even game decided by the odd goal .
The stakes – this time worth more than just the financial rewards – are too high for this game to be an aesthetic showpiece where opponents are allowed the time and space to conjure magic for their TV audience .
Manchester United Watch
Visit Red Rants for the latest news and discussions on the Champions League final and other Manchester United news .
Rooney will kill himself to be fit for this game , so expect him to play .
A Champions League final , especially the club ’s first in 9 years , is no place for emotion or goodbyes .
Still , Giggs and Scholes have little value as impact players and one of them will probably start seeing that Fergie will probably play a 4 - 5 - 1/4-3- 3 with Rooney on the left and 3 central midfielders ( Carrick is the only certain starter IMO ) to match Chelsea ’s physical strength down the middle .
Potential starting lineup : EVDS , Brown , Rio , Vidic , Evra , Carrick , Hargreaves , Scholes , Ronaldo , Rooney , Tevez
I ’d rather see Anderson there instead of Scholes ( based purely on his energy levels and the fact that both Carrick and Hargreaves can be creative outlets if given that role ) , but Scholes gives United a better option in terms of goal - scoring / goal - creating opportunities than Anderson , and I ’m pretty sure this game will have both managers looking to score as opposed to sitting back and waiting for mistakes .
Chelsea Watch
John Terry and Didier Drogba , like Wayne Rooney , would walk through walls to play in the Champions League final and you can expect both of them to be fit barring a serious problem .
Both players are central to Chelsea ’s chances of success against United here and their presence will be a psychological and physical bonus for their teammates .
Carvalho should be back as well .
Other than that , the Coles , Ballack , Lampard , Essien and Cech would also start , leaving only the right - back ( if Essien takes up a midfield berth ) and the second striker / winger position up for grabs , and I ’d put that to either Kalou or Malouda .
Make of the Chelsea side what you will , but I do n’t think Bosingwa is the answer Chelsea are looking for at right - back .
He might do an Evra / Vidic and surprise everyone , but what are the odds ?
Regardless of what happened in the league , Chelsea go into the Champions League final as slight favourites , if only because of their superiority in central midfield , and I ’d expect Grant to capitalise on that .
Predictions
If there was ever a time for United ’s star kids ( Ronaldo and Rooney , I ’m looking at you ) to stand up and answer their critics , this is it .
No predictions though – Chelsea or Manchester United , just keep in mind that it ’s been a good season for both clubs .
This is a really interesting piece from the South China Morning Post on a story that has captivated China .
Two reporters beaten as gag on case tightens
Pressure on activists over accused killer 's plight
SCMP He Huifeng May 29 , 2009
Two reporters were beaten in Hubei's Badong county as local authorities sealed off the epicentre of a scandal involving a cadre allegedly killed by a hotel pedicurist .
Two reporters - Kong Pu from the Beijing Times and Wei Yi from the Nangfang People Weekly - were beaten yesterday morning by officials in Yesanguan town , according to media sources .
They were interviewing a grandmother of the 21 - year - old pedicurist , Deng Yujiao .
The reporters were left bruised by the attack and both had their cameras smashed , the sources said .
They were detained from 1 pm to 5 pm , and there were a number of security personnel monitoring their hotel after their release .
Both reporters said they had proper media credentials .
A media gag was introduced by central government censors on Tuesday .
News organisations were ordered to halt their reporting on the case and recall reporters from Hubei , saying the case was under judicial investigation .
Deng 's plight has sparked one of the biggest civil rights movements on the mainland in recent years as various groups showed their solidarity with her .
Many netizens and reporters have travelled to Yesanguan to follow the case voluntarily .
But a group of five women 's rights activists who arrived in Yesanguan on Monday said the town was eerily quiet because access to it had been cut by local authorities .
" We were told by local residents that the ferry from Yichang to Badong had been suspended since Tuesday , " said Zhou Li , one of the activists .
" Every vehicle entering Badong county is being checked .
If drivers or passengers are not locals , they are told to turn back . "
Ms Zhou said hotels in the town had been told not to receive outsiders .
Some shops had even been shut since Wednesday .
" We 've been followed by more than a dozen plain - clothes police since we arrived in Badong .
Now , the electricity and water supply to our hotel has been cut off .
They are trying to make us give in , " said Ms Zhou .
" Five Yesanguan officials , including the chief of police , came [ on Wednesday night ] and asked us to leave .
They said they could not guarantee our safety if we stay here .
We came here to show support for the powerless and anger at officialdom .
We 'll be here until the end . "
The dead official , Deng Guida , the head of a trade promotion department in the town , reportedly demanded " special services " - a euphemism for sex - from Deng at Yesanguan 's Xiongfeng hotel on May 10 .
In the presence of a subordinate , he threw money in her face and pushed her to the sofa several times before she stabbed him with a fruit knife .
The subordinate was injured .
The reported behaviour of the officials sparked fury among netizens , and this was heightened when local authorities appeared to tone down the description of the officials ' activities in a way that could see them avoid charges of demanding sexual services or rape .
On Wednesday , Deng was released from custody and placed under house arrest .
Commentators said the move would help to address public mistrust in the government .
They also said the house arrest could be an indication of official back - pedalling from the earlier murder charges and an attempt to defuse public anger .
University of California , San Diego electrical engineers have created experimental solar cells spiked with nanowires that could lead to highly efficient thin - film solar cells of the future .
Indium phosphide ( InP ) nanowires can serve as electron superhighways that carry electrons kicked loose by photons of light directly to the device ’s electron - attracting electrode – and this scenario could boost thin - film solar cell efficiency , according to research recently published in NanoLetters .
The new design increases the number of electrons that make it from the light - absorbing polymer to an electrode .
By reducing electron - hole recombination , the UC San Diego engineers have demonstrated a way to increases the efficiency with which sunlight can be converted to electricity in thin - film photovoltaics .
Including nanowires in the experimental solar cell increased the “ forward bias current ” – which is a measure of electrical current – by six to seven orders of magnitude as compared to their polymer - only control device , the engineers found .
“ If you provide electrons with a defined pathway to the electrode , you can reduce some of the inefficiencies that currently plague thin - film solar cells made from polymer mixtures .
More efficient transport of electrons and holes – collectively known as carriers – is critical for creating more efficient solar cells , ” said Clint Novotny the first author of the NanoLetters paper , and a recent electrical engineering Ph.D. from UC San Diego ’s Jacobs School of Engineering .
Novotny is now working on solar technologies at BAE Systems .
Simplified Nanowire Growth
The engineers devised a way to grow nanowires directly on the electrode .
This advance allowed them to create the electron superhighways that deliver electrons from the polymer - nanowire interface directly to an electrode .

“ If nanowires are going to be used massively in photovoltaic devices , then the growth mechanism of nanowires on arbitrary metallic surfaces is an issue of great importance , ” said co-author Paul Yu , a professor of electrical engineering at UC San Diego ’s Jacobs School of Engineering .
“ We contributed one approach to growing nanowires directly on metal . ”
The UCSD electrical engineers grew their InP nanowires on the metal electrode – indium tin oxide ( ITO ) – and then covered the nanowire - electrode platform in the organic polymer , P3HT , also known as poly ( 3 - hexylthiophene ) .
The researchers say they were the first group to publish work demonstrating growth of nanowires directly on metal electrodes without using specially prepared substrates such as gold nanodrops .
“ Just a layer of metal can work .
In this paper we used ITO , but you can use other metals , including aluminum , ” said Paul Yu .
Growing nanowires directly on untreated electrodes is an important step toward the goal of growing nanowires on cheap metal substrates that could serve as foundations for next - generation photovoltaics that conform to the curved surfaces like rooftops , cars or other supporting structures , the engineers say .
“ By growing nanowires directly on an untreated electrode surface , you can start thinking about incorporating millions or billions of nanowires in a single device .
I think this is where the field is eventually going to end up , ” said Novotny .
“ But I think we are at least a decade away from this becoming a mainstream technology . ”
Polymer Solar Cells and Nanowires Meet

As in more traditional organic polymer thin - film solar cells , the polymer material in the experimental system absorbs photons of light .
To convert this energy to electricity , each photon - absorbing electron must split apart from its hole companion at the interface of the polymer and the nanowire – a region known as the p-n junction .
Once the electron and hole split , the electron travels down the nanowire – the electron superhighway – and merges seamlessly with the electron - capturing electrode .
This rapid shuttling of electrons from the p-n junction to the electrode could serve to make future photovoltaic devices made with polymers more efficient .
“ In effect , we used nanowires to extend an electrode into the polymer material , ” said co-author Edward Yu , a professor of electrical engineering at UCSD ’s Jacobs School of Engineering .
While the electrons travel down the nanowires in one direction , the holes travel along the nanowires in the opposite direction – until the nanowire dead ends .
At this point , the holes are forced to travel through a thin polymer layer before reaching their electrode .
Today ’s thin - film polymer photovoltaics do not provide freed electrons with a direct path from the p-n junction to the electrode – a situation which increases recombination between holes and electrons and reduces efficiency in converting sunlight to electricity .
In many of today ’s polymer photovoltaics , interfaces between two different polymers serve as the p-n junction .
Some experimental photovoltaic designs do include nanowires or carbon nanotubes , but these wires and tubes are not electrically connected to an electrode .
Thus , they do not minimize electron - hole recombination by providing electrons with a direct path from the p-n junction to the electrode the way the new UCSD design does .
Before these kinds of electron superhighways can be incorporated into photovoltaic devices , a series of technical hurdles must be addressed – including the issue of polymer degradation .
“ The polymers degrade quickly when exposed to air .
Researchers around the world are working to improve the properties of organic polymers , ” said Paul Yu .
As it was a proof - of - concept project , the UCSD engineers did not measure how efficiently the device converted sunlight to electricity .
This explains , in part , why the authors refer to the device in their NanoLetters paper as a “ photodiode ” rather than a “ photovoltaic . ”
Having a more efficient method for getting electrons to their electrode means that researchers can make thin - film polymer solar cells that are a little bit thicker , and this could increase the amount of sunlight that the devices absorb .
We 've come a long way in bridge building since crossing a river on a fallen log .
The first bridges were built with wooden planks , ropes and stones .
Soon , stronger material were required .
Wood and stone bridges gave way to iron , then to steel ones .
Bridge building techniques also evolved : beam , cantilevered , cable - stayed , and suspension bridges - each with advantages that made it the right choice for a particular location .
Political fortunes and wars have been made or lost by bridges .
Throughout history , bridges had been built by engineers and burned by warriors , and crossed by kings and commoners alike .
Millions of people owe their livelihood to bridges , as most require them to commute ; and yet thousands of people choose to end their lives by jumping off them every year .
Bridges are stylish : from classical to modern , they are as much a work of art as they are marvels of engineering .
To celebrate the wonders of " classic " bridges , here are Neatorama 's picks for the Top 10 Most Beautiful Bridges in the World :
10 . Khaju Bridge

The Khaju Bridge ( Pol - e - Khajoo ) in Isfahan , Iran , was built in the 17th century by Shah Abbas II .
The bridge also serves as a dam , with sluice gates under the archways .
When the gates are closed , the water level behind the bridge is raised to irrigate gardens alongside the Zayandeh River .
The Khoju Bridge has two stories of arcades , marked by the distinctive intersecting arches decorated with richly colored tiles .
At the center of the bridge , there are two large pavilions , called the Prince Parlors , that were originally reserved for the Shah .
9. Pont du Gard

Pont du Gard , an aqueduct spanning the Gard River in southern France , is a masterpiece of Roman engineering .
It was n't built to transport people ( though there is a pedestrian footbridge on it ) - instead , it was part of a complex aqueduct system that carried water over 30 miles ( about 50 km ) to the ancient Roman city of Nemausus ( now Nîmes ) .
The Pont du Gard was built by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa ( 63 - 12 BC ) , the son - in - law of Caesar Augustus .
The bridge 's stones , some of which weigh up to 6 tons , were cut perfectly to fit together without any mortar .
The wedge - shaped stones , known as voussoirs , were arranged in three levels , the top - most being the water conduit .
So precise was the engineering that the entire system descends only 56 ft. ( 17 m ) vertically - over 30 miles !
- to deliver 5 million gallons ( 20,00 m3 ) of water to the city .
8. Bridge of Sighs

In the 19th century , Lord Byron named a Venetian limestone bridge across the Rio di Palazzo connecting the Doge 's prison to the interrogation room in the main palace , the Bridge of Sighs ( Ponte dei Sospiri ) .
Supposedly , the prisoners would sigh when they look out the window - with stone bars no less - to see their last view of beautiful Venice before their imprisonment , torture or execution .
In reality , Doge 's prison held mostly small - time criminals .
Also , the bridge was built in 1600 by Antonio Contino , after the days of the inquisitions and summary executions .
Legend has it that if lovers kissed on a gondola underneath the Bridge of Sighs at sunset , their love would last for eternity .
7. Iron Bridge

The Iron Bridge , spanning the Severn river in Shropshire , England , is n't a particularly large or ornate bridge , but it does have something that made it unique : it 's the first bridge made completely out of cast iron .
In the 18th century , Shropshire was rich in iron and coal - indeed , there were more iron factories within two - mile radius of the town than any other city in the world .
It was also there that iron was first smelt with coke .
So it was only natural that the bridge would be made out of iron , a stronger alternative to wood .
( Photo of the railing : zorro [ Flickr ] )
Architect Thomas Farnolls Pritchard proposed a single arch bridge that would let boats pass underneath , but he died before the bridge was built .
The construction of the Iron Bridge was carried out by a local master ironworker named Abraham Darby III .
About 400 tons ( 363 tonnes ) of cast iron was used , with about 800 separate castings .
The Iron Bridge has 5 arch ribs , each cast in two halves .
It only took three months to put the parts together ( which they did using screws instead of bolts ! ) .
The ease and speed of the Iron Bridge 's construction helped convince engineers of the versatility and strength of iron , and helped usher in the Industrial Revolution era .
Darby , however , did n't fare so well : he severely underestimated the cost to build the bridge , and remained in debt for the rest of his life .

Covered bridges are simply that : bridges that have enclosed sides and roof .
Though technically the Bridge of Sigh , Ponte Vecchio , and the Wind and Rain Bridges in this list are covered bridges , this term usually means simple , single - lane bridges in rural settings .
Before they are made famous by the 1995 Clint Eastwood film The Bridges of Madison County , " kissing bridges " or " tunnels of love " have been the pride and joy of many small towns across Europe and especially Northern America where more than ten thousands of such bridges were built .
In the 19th century , timber was plentiful and cheap ( or , in many cases , free ) .
So it 's natural that these bridges were made of wood .
But why were they covered ?
Well , lovers aside , the real reason was much more practical : the wooden beams of the bridge lasted longer when protected from the elements .
Unfortunately , due to neglect , theft of lumber , vandalism , and fire , most covered bridges in the United States and Canada have disappeared .
5. Ponte Vecchio

The Ponte Vecchio is a medieval bridge over the Arno River .
Actually , it 's much more than a bridge - it's a street , a marketplace , and a landmark of Florence , Italy .
The Ponte Vecchio that we know today was built in 1345 by Taddeo Gaddi after an older span was destroyed in a flood .
To finance the bridge , lots along the roadway were rented out to merchants , especially butchers and tanners , to hawk their wares .
In 1565 , Duke Cosimo I de Medici ordered an architect named Giorgio Vasari to construct a roofed passageway .
Soon after , jewelers , goldsmiths , and merchants of luxury goods pushed out the butchers out of Ponte Vecchio .
Centuries of haphazard additions gave the bridge 's distinctive , irregular appearance today .
During World War II , after having survived many floods , the bridge faced its gravest threat : German bombers were blowing up bridges in Florence .
It was a direct order from Hitler that spared Ponte Vecchio from certain destruction .
It is said that the word " bankruptcy " came from Ponte Vecchio .
When a merchant failed to pay his debt , the table ( " banco " ) he used to sell his wares was broken ( " rotto " ) by soldiers .
Not having a table anymore ( " bancorotto " ) , meant the seller was bankrupt .
4. The Wind and Rain Bridge

The wind and rain bridges were a type of bridge built by the Dong people ( a minority ethnic group ) in China .
Because they live in the lowlands and the valleys with many rivers , the Dong people are excellent bridge builders .
They are called " wind and rain " bridges because the covered bridges not only let people cross the river , but also protect them from the elements .
The Dong people do n't use nails or rivets to build these bridges - instead , they dovetail all of the wood .
The largest and most magnificent is the Chenyang Bridge , spanning the Linxi River near the Dong village of Maan .
The bridge is about 100 years old , and like all wind and rain bridges , it was built without a single nail .
3. Brooklyn Bridge

In 1855 , engineer John Roebling started to design a bridge that at the time would be the longest suspension bridge in the world , with towers being the tallest structures in the Western Hemisphere : the Brooklyn Bridge in New York .
Today , the Brooklyn Bridge is one of the main crossings of the East River and one of the most heavily trafficked bridges in the world .
But in the late 19th century , it took Roebling more than 14 years to convince the city to build the bridge .
After he got approval , Roebling was surveying a site when his foot was crushed by a ferry .
Three weeks before the scheduled groundbreaking , he died of tetanus .
His son , an engineer named Washington Roebling took over the project .
In 1872 , while working on caissons to set the foundation for the towers , Washington fell ill with caisson disease ( a decompression sickness commonly known as " the bends " ) that left him barely able to see , talk , or write .
His wife , Emily Warren Roebling , rose to the occasion - she learned engineering on the fly and for nine years went to the job site to deliver her husband 's directions .
Washington himself was said to watch the construction from his room through a binocular .
When the Brooklyn Bridge was opened , Emily was honored with the first ride over the bridge .
She held a rooster , a symbol of victory , in her lap .
Washington himself rarely visited the bridge till his death in 1926 .
One interesting note about the Brooklyn Bridge : it stood fast while other bridges built around the same time had crumbled .
Engineers credit Roebling for designing a bridge and truss system six times as strong as he thought it needed to be !
2. Tower Bridge

It 's funny to think about ancient traffic jams , but that was why the Tower Bridge in London , England was built .
By the end of the 19th century , the development of the eastern part of London caused such a load on the London Bridge that the city decided to build a new bridge .
Construction of the Tower Bridge started in 1886 , led by architect Sir Horace Jones and engineer Sir John Wolfe Barry .
The design was a bascule ( draw ) bridge with two towers built on piers , so the bridge would n't interefere with the port facilities nearby .
A year after construction was started , Jones died and his replacement , George D. Stevenson along with Barry decided to modify the design a little bit .
Instead of the original brick facade design , the Tower Bridge had a more ornate Victorian Gothic style meant to harmonize it with the nearby Tower of London .
When the bridge opened in 1894 , the public was aghast .
H. Heathcote Statham , Fellow of the Royal Insitute of British Architect , wrote the familiar sentiment as thus : " The Tower Bridge ... represents the vice of tawdriness and pretentiousness , and of falsification of the actual facts of the structure . "
( Source : Waddell , J. , Bridge Engineering , Google Books )
But over time , people warmed up to the bridge .
Indeed , the Tower Bridge grew to be one of London 's most recognizable landmarks .
Even one of its loudest critics , architectural critic Eric de Maré conceded : the British people " have grown fond of the old fraud ... and we must admit that it has carried on its task with admirable regularity and efficiency . "

The Golden Gate Bridge is such an iconic symbol of San Francisco ( and of suspension bridge in general ) that it's hard to imagine a time when it did n't exist .
But before it was built , most people thought it was an impossible task .
In 1916 , the idea of a bridge to cross the Golden Gate , a narrow strait that separated San Francisco Peninsula and the Marin Headlands , was conceived .
Though it was almost immediately dismissed as the cost was estimated to be $ 100 million ( astronomical for the time ) , a veteran bridge builder named Joseph Strauss lobbied for more than two decades to have it built .
The Golden Gate Bridge faced tough opposition : the Department of War thought it would interfere with ship traffic and the Southern Pacific Railroad opposed it as competition to its ferry service .
At first , even the public did n't like the bridge ... because Strauss ' original design was deemed too ugly !
But Strauss finally won , and after 22 - years of drumming up support , the bridge was built .
( Photo : SF Museum )
Strauss insisted that the project take worker 's safety seriously .
It was the first major bridge project that used hard hats and a safety net .
During the course of construction , 19 people were saved by the net to become members of the Halfway to Hell Club .
( Source )
The color of the Golden Gate Bridge is actually not red - it's an orange vermillion called International Orange .
The color was chosen specifically because it complements the bridge 's natural surrounding yet enhances its visibility in the fog .
Construction took more than four years , at a cost of $ 27 million .
The Golden Gate Bridge actually came in $ 1.3 million under budget ( though 5 months late ) .
For his work , Strauss got $ 1 million ... and a lifetime bridge pass !
We 'll be the first to acknowledge that this list is far from complete .
Modern beauties like the Millau Viaduct , the Erasmusbrug , or the Tsing Ma Bridge are n't on it .
( Well , we did say " classic " bridges ...)
Nor is this the only " top 10 bridges " list on the Web .
Though many of our picks are the same , there are enough differences between this list and others ( like Frikoo 's 18 Stunning Bridges From Around the World , and Dark Roasted Blend 's World 's Most Interesting Bridges Part 1 and Part 2 ) that you should also check them out .
Finally , there are thousands of bridges in the world and hundreds of major bridges that are sources for local prides .
If your town 's favorite span is n't included here , please do n't get mad .

150 - year - old Monkey puzzle tree facing chop because council says its needles are ' like syringes '
For 150 years , it has stood in splendid serenity on the village green , harming no one and pleasing many .
Over the decades , the monkey puzzle tree at West Cross , near Swansea , became a much - loved local landmark .
But now it is facing the chop … because , in modern Britain , the needle - like points of its leaves are deemed a danger to health and safety .

Threatened : A 150 - year - old monkey puzzle tree is facing the chop after health and safety experts said its needles could injure schoolchildren
One expert likened the effect of the needles to being pricked by a hypodermic syringe .
‘ Every effort is made in this day and age to prevent children playing with discarded syringe needles , ’ a report stated .
‘ Every effort must be made to prevent children coming into contact with these potentially , equally sharp needles . ’
But a campaign to save the 50ft tree , also known as a Chilean Pine , has been launched by residents , who insist the prickly foliage is not likely to present the same risk of spreading infectious diseases as a discarded syringe .
The protest is being led by Mike and Carol Crafer , who are threatening
to sell up if the tree – which stands in front of their home – is axed .
‘ It ’s another case of health and safety gone mad , ’ said Mrs Crafer , a 49 - yearold mother of two .
‘ The tree ’s needles are not that dangerous – comparing them to syringes is ridiculous .
‘ The tree is part of the local landscape and has been for a century and a half .
It rarely sheds its foliage and there are plenty of volunteers here who would be happy to clear up the needles . ’
Danger : Tom Henderson , five , of West Cross , Swansea , with one of the needles
Her husband , a 57 - year - old sustainability manager with Thames Water , said : ‘ This is a crazy decision to cut the tree down .
‘ We have put this to the test by trying to prick ourselves with the needles , but have not been able to – that ’s how dangerous they are . ’
The Crafers led more than 30 banner - waving residents in a protest against Swansea Council ’s decision to cut the tree down ,
The council brought in two independent health and safety experts who both advised to give the monkey puzzle the chop , especially since a new school is being opened nearby .
A council spokesman said : ‘ Safety experts have said the tree is too much of a risk to children for it to remain .
‘ One expert likened the tree foliage to discarded syringe needles and warns they pose a probable risk of serious injury to children .
The authority could find itself defending any litigation , should this arise . ’
However , Martin Caton , MP for Gower , Swansea , yesterday said the decision ‘ stinks ’ .
He added : ‘ I urge everyone who cares about the quality of their environment to protest against this council plan . ’
The monkey puzzle tree : A ' living fossil ' the dinosaurs dined on
• The monkey puzzle tree is native to the Andes of Chile and Argentina .
• Plant collector Archibald Menzies is thought to have introduced it to Britain in
1795 .
• It got its name when a gardener in Cornwall was showing his specimen to friends and one remarked : ‘ It would puzzle a monkey to climb that . ’
• It is sometimes associated with bad luck .
• Often described as a living fossil , its family the Araucariaceae can be traced back to the Mesozoic era , which started 250 million years ago .
• Far from deterring monkeys , the spiky leaves probably developed to try to fend off grazing dinosaurs .
• Araucarias can live for 1,200 years and reach 160ft .
• To some indigenous peoples of Chile and Argentina , the tree is sacred .
• The seeds were traditionally collected as a food crop .
• Trade in its timber is now banned because it is so rare .
U.S. Spy Boss : Iraq WMD Intel Failure Just ' A Bad Hair Day ' Fingar also criticized the U.S. intel on whether Iraq had nuclear weapons .
March 18 , 2008  --
The failure of U.S. intelligence in assessing Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction was like " a yearbook photo on your worst hair day ever , " according to one of the country 's top spy bosses , Thomas Fingar , deputy director of National Intelligence .
Fingar made the comment in defending the overall quality of U.S. intelligence during an appearance at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York , five years to the week after the 2003 start of the Iraq war .
At another point , Fingar called the U.S. assessment of whether Iraq had nuclear weapons " the single worst product " he had seen in his 38 years serving in various U.S. intelligence agencies .
Fingar , who was at the State Department in 2003 , says he has since instituted a number of new procedures to prevent a repeat of the intelligence failure that led to the U.S. invasion of Iraq , costing more than 3,900 American lives and tens of thousands of Iraqi lives .
Fingar said the CIA and other intelligence gatherers are required to better " scrub " information from their sources , and that intelligence analysis better reflects dissenting views .
CIA estimates on Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction relied heavily on an Iraqi informant code - named " Curveball , " who was later found to have fabricated his claims .
A former CIA official , Tyler Drumheller , told ABC News he was ignored when he tried to warn his superiors that " Curveball , " controlled by the German secret service , was an unreliable informant .

NTT has begun selling a device that transmits data across the surface of the human body and lets users communicate with electronic devices simply by touching them , the company announced on April 23 .
The new product , called " Firmo , " consists of a card - sized transmitter carried in the user 's pocket .
The card converts stored data into a weak AC electric field that extends across the body , and when the user touches a device or object embedded with a compatible receiver , the electric field is converted back into a data signal that can be read by the device .
For now , Firmo transfers data at 230 kbps , but NTT is reportedly working on a low - cost 10 M bps version that can handle audio / video data transfers .
Firmo is based on NTT's RedTacton human area network ( HAN ) technology , which is designed to allow convenient human - machine data exchange through natural physical contact -- even through clothing , gloves and shoes .
NTT initially hopes this human area network technology will appeal to organizations looking to boost convenience and security in the office .
Obvious applications include secure entrances and keyless cabinets that recognize employees when they touch the door handle ( thus bypassing the need for card - swipers and keys ) , or secure printers that operate only when you touch them .
For now , a set of 5 card transmitters and 1 receiver goes for around 800,000 yen ( $ 8,000 ) , but NTT expects the price to come down when mass production begins .

I said it here once , twice and now for the third time .
It is over for Hillary Clinton , the Zoo ’s first Veruca Salt Award winner ever .
It is so obvious .
There is nothing she says or does , that helps her campaign anymore .
The tall tales she is telling to sell her bid for the Presidency like “ Gollywhopper ’s Eggs ” , are backfiring on her one by one .
The sniper fire never happened , she was not instrumental in bringing peace to Northern Ireland , She obviously did n’t oppose NAFTA the way she claimed or she would have fired Mark Penn on the spot after his recent lobbying for a free trade pact .
She made up a tale about a health care tragedy and , of course , that does n’t hold water either .
She even had the cheek to claim she had opposed the Iraq war before Barack Obama did so , not true , of course .
She had to be sued into releasing her schedules as First Lady and promptly the details debunked many of her claims at experience .
The tax returns came in after long delays , after much prompting by the Obama campaign and the blogosphere , and guess what ?
They showed business partnerships and dealings , quite as expected and not at all in line with Hillary Clinton ’s claims at fighting for the average American .
Bill Clinton earned more than $ 10 m from the Dubai - linked firm , Yucaipa Companies , since 2005 .
The couple has also earned $ 800,000 in the past two years from InfoUSA , a database company under investigation by the US securities agents for misusing corporate funds .
Of course , why else should they try and avoid publishing the tax returns if the facts would have been favourable .
Just one detail .
The Clinton ’s have given a sizeable chunk of their income to charity .
This is praiseworthy .
They gave most of it to their own family foundation .
Tax evasion ?
True , the family foundation has given the money to other , more independent charities ( amongst others , the United Church of Christ of Jeremiah Wright fame ) but only after Hillary Clinton started campaigning for the Presidency .
Opportunism ?
The bulk of the cash went to the Clinton Family Foundation and served as a tax write - off .
The foundation has distributed only half its money – and most of that was after Hillary Clinton began running for president last year .
Honestly , it is not really necessary anymore to produce the donors list for the William J. Clinton library or the phone logs of Hillary Clinton as a First Lady .
With every step she takes , the worst suspicions prove to be correct predictions .
If there was anything helpful for her campaign in any of those documents , she would have been ready to produce them on day one .
But honestly , I doubt even whether the Senate will have any use for her anymore , if she goes on like this .
If she keeps stumbling over her own feet at the current pace she will have campaigned herself into early retirement by the end of June .
The real surprise in this campaign is Hillary Clinton ’s deplorably poor performance .
I kept waiting for Barack Obama ’s first big blunder , but it never happened .
There have been news and situations that were decidedly detrimental to his campaign , but he mostly got on his feet again swiftly and competently .
The allegedly unsurmountable and formidable Clinton political machine is nothing but a myth .
Earlier in the race , Hillary Clinton would have been able to withdraw for the greater welfare of her party .
None of the above would have been dragged in front of the public the way it is now .
She would have been able to hold onto her reputation as an intelligent , hard - working politician and an asset to her constituency .
Now she comes across as an incompetent and opportunistic loudmouth who will stop at nothing to wriggle her way into the White House .

Hillary Clinton says she is the best placed candidate for the Democrats to beat Republican John McCain when it comes to the US presidential elections .
She says her win over Barack Obama in the Pennsylvania primary showed she could gather a broad base of support .
But Mr Obama 's campaign points to polls suggesting that he would do better against Mr McCain than Mrs Clinton in a general election .
Mr Obama has won more elected delegates and raised more money than Mrs Clinton .
Mrs Clinton says an appeal launched after Tuesday 's win raised $ 3 m ( £ 1.5 m ) .
The internet fundraising is a much - needed boost to her debt - laden campaign - in Pennsylvania , Mr Obama outspent her three - to - one .
She has said securing more donations was the only way she could continue to compete with a rival who was outspending her " massively " .
Blue - collar appeal
The results in Pennsylvania , which Mrs Clinton claimed to be an " overwhelming victory " , showed 54.3 % for Mrs Clinton to 45.7 % for Mr Obama , with a little over 99 % of returns counted .
DEMOCRATIC DELEGATES
Barack Obama : Pledged delegates : 1,488 Super - delegates : 235 Total : 1,723 Hillary Clinton : Pledged delegates : 1,333 Super - delegates : 259 Total : 1,592 Source : AP at 1400 GMT , 23 April
In pictures : Pennsylvania primary Justin Webb 's blog
In quotes : Pennsylvania primary Mrs Clinton has ruled out the possibility of her dropping out of the race before all primary and caucus contests were finished .
" We 're going to go through the next nine contests and I hope to do well in many of them , " she told NBC .
" But I 'm confident that when delegates - as well as voters , like the voters of Pennsylvania just did - ask themselves who 's the stronger candidate against John McCain that I will be the nominee of the Democratic party . "
She told ABC television : " The big win that I had , the broad base of coalition is exactly what we are going to need in the fall [ autumn ] . "
Mr Obama told the audience at a town hall meeting in Indiana not to be worried about the apparently divisive campaigns being fought by the two Democratic candidates .
" The Democratic party is going to recognise that , as soon as we have nominee , there is too much at stake for us to be divided , " he said .
" They will see the choice between John McCain and the Democratic nominee and see that there is a clear choice .
We know what they are offering - more of the same . "
His speech on Wednesday focused more on attacking the policies of Mr McCain than Mrs Clinton .
Big - state winner Exit polls for US media suggest Mrs Clinton won by taking the votes of blue - collar workers , women and white men , the Associated Press reported .
Women - who have tended to favour Mrs Clinton - made up 60 % of Democratic voters in the state , according to the exit polls .
Barack Obama is leading the popular vote in the Democratic race Neither candidate is expected to win sufficient pledged delegates to seal the nomination in the remaining primaries , which is why the candidates are focusing on the 800 or so unelected " super - delegates " to decide the outcome at the Democratic convention in August .
Mrs Clinton has won most of the contests in the big states .
She argues that only she will be able to secure wins in critical large states come November 's presidential election .
Mr Obama has dismissed the big - state argument , saying there was " no chance " of the Democrats losing New York or California in the presidential election , no matter who the candidate was .
In the next round of primaries , on 6 May , polls suggest that Mr Obama is likely to take North Carolina , while both candidates have a chance to win in Indiana .

Mr. Mehsud , perhaps Pakistan ’s most notorious militant , leads an umbrella group of the militants in the border areas , known as the Tehrik - i- Taliban Pakistan , or the Taliban Movement of Pakistan .
Pakistan ’s previous government and American officials have said a communications intercept linked him to Ms. Bhutto ’s assassination , and a Pakistani court has charged Mr. Mehsud in absentia with planning it .
Ms. Bhutto ’s widower , Asif Ali Zardari , and other members of her party have cast doubt on the previous government ’s version of events , however .
Farhatullah Babar , a spokesman for the party , called the cease - fire announcement by Mr. Mehsud a “ welcome development , ” but said the negotiations were continuing .
“ No deal has been finalized , ” he said by telephone .
Regarding Mr. Mehsud ’s alleged involvement in Ms. Bhutto ’s assassination , he said the “ Pakistan Peoples Party had not named Baitullah Mehsud ” as being responsible for her attack .
Even so , Mr. Mehsud claims to have scores of suicide bombers at his disposal , and he is blamed for many if not most of the suicide attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the last two years .
Diplomats and Afghan officials said they believed that the new government recognized that he was a long - term danger , even though it may be seeking a short - term reprieve from his attacks through the negotiations .
Previously , leaders of the Awami National Party , which leads the government in North - West Frontier Province and is part of the national coalition , have said they do not think Mr. Mehsud will enter into serious negotiations .
In Washington , Assistant Secretary of State Richard A. Boucher said the United States viewed the negotiations as a tactic , acknowledging that it had been tried before by Mr. Musharraf .
The concern was follow - through and enforcement , he said .
“ The outcome is what matters , ” he said .
“ There has to be less violent activity .
There has to be an end to the Al Qaeda elements who are very dangerous , who are up there plotting and planning . ”
The draft agreement , which was approved by senior political leaders in Islamabad , has the backing of the military establishment , officials here said .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday that turmoil in credit markets could spread with losses possibly approaching $ 1 trillion , and cautioned that risks to global economic growth had increased .
In its twice - yearly assessment of global financial markets , the IMF said there had been a “ collective failure ” to grasp the extent of leverage in the financial system and the risk that it could be unwound in a disorderly fashion .
Conditions may get worse as the limping U.S. economy leads to more credit losses .
“ The credit shock emanating from the U.S. subprime crisis is set to broaden amid a significant economic slowdown , ” Jaime Caruana , director of the IMF ’s monetary and capital markets department , said at a news conference .
“ The deterioration in credit has moved up and across the credit spectrum to prime residential and commercial mortgage markets , and to corporate credit markets .
As the credit cycle turns , default rates are likely to rise across the board . ”
The fund estimated that write - downs and losses could conceivably reach $ 945 billion , but stressed that its calculations reflected market conditions in March , and the situation had improved somewhat since then .
Still , officials declined to comment on whether financial markets were overestimating potential losses .
Caruana said a key concern now was how credit conditions would fare in a U.S. economic downturn , which is likely to increase delinquencies on a variety of loans .
He said the current crisis , which traces its roots to defaults in the U.S. subprime mortgage market but spread to other forms of credit with astonishing speed , was not simply a matter of over - exuberant markets that needed correction .
The turmoil had exposed “ fault lines ” beneath the markets that needed serious repair .
That will require the attention of the private sector , central banks and perhaps the use of public funds , Caruana said , adding that governments should be “ open ” to all options .
“ Get ready for early intervention , for early action , ” he said .
The IMF said threats to global financial stability had risen and the potential for spillovers to emerging markets increased through funding channels and trade .
“ Downside macroeconomic risks that are concentrated in the U.S. economy have a significant impact on systemically important financial institutions that may spill over to global markets , ” it said in its report .
“ Our analysis indicated that a contraction in the supply of private sector credit and market borrowings could bring a significant slowdown in U.S. output growth in the following several quarters , ” the IMF said in its Global Financial Stability Report .
The IMF also warned that signs of a downturn are becoming evident in some European housing markets , and said if economic growth slows in Europe , as forecast by the IMF , repossessions and write - offs will rise .
It noted that some analysts foresee a near doubling of home repossessions in Britain .

The Bush regime has quagmired America into a sixth year of war in Afghanistan and Iraq with no end in sight .
The cost of these wars of aggression is horrendous .
Official U.S. combat casualties stand at 4,538 dead .
Officially , 29,780 U.S. troops have been wounded in Iraq .
On April 17 , 2008 , AP News reported that a new study released by the RAND Corporation concludes that “ some 300,000 U.S. troops are suffering from major depression or post - traumatic stress from serving in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and 320,000 received brain injuries . ”
On April 21 , 2008 , OpEdNews.com reported that an internal e-mail from Gen. Michael J. Kussman , undersecretary for health at the Veterans Administration , to Ira Katz , head of mental health at the VA , confirms a McClatchy Newspaper report that 126 veterans per week commit suicide .
To the extent that the suicides are attributable to the war , more than 500 deaths should be added to the reported combat fatalities each month .
Turning to Iraqi deaths , expert studies support as many as 1.2 million dead Iraqis , almost entirely civilians .
Another 2 million Iraqis have fled their country , and there are 2 million displaced Iraqis within Iraq .
Afghan casualties are unknown .
Both Afghanistan and Iraq have suffered unconscionable civilian deaths and damage to housing , infrastructure , and environment .
Iraq is afflicted with depleted uranium and open sewers .
Then there are the economic costs to the U.S. Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz estimates the full cost of the invasion and attempted occupation of Iraq to be between $ 3 trillion and $ 5 trillion .
The dollar price of oil and gasoline have tripled , and the dollar has lost value against other currencies , declining dramatically even against the lowly Thai baht .
Before Bush launched his wars of aggression , one U.S. dollar was worth 45 baht .
Today the dollar is only worth 30 baht .
The U.S. can not afford these costs .
Prior to his resignation last month , U.S. Comptroller General David Walker reported that the accumulated unfunded liabilities of the U.S. government total $ 53 trillion .
The U.S. government cannot cover these liabilities .
The Bush regime even has to borrow the money from foreigners to pay for its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
There is no more certain way to bankrupt the country and dethrone the dollar as world reserve currency .
The moral costs are perhaps the highest .
All of the deaths , injuries , and economic costs to the U.S. and its victims are due entirely to lies told by the president and vice president of the U.S. , by the secretary of defense , the national security adviser , the secretary of state , and , of course , by the media , including the “ liberal ” New York Times .
All of these lies were uttered in behalf of an undeclared agenda .
“ Our ” government has still not told “ we the people ” the real reasons “ our ” government invaded Afghanistan and Iraq .
Instead , the American sheeple have accepted a succession of transparent lies : weapons of mass destruction , al - Qaeda connections and complicity in the 9/11 attack , overthrowing a dictator and “ bringing democracy ” to Iraqis .
The great , moral American people would rather believe government lies than to acknowledge the government ’s crimes and to hold the government accountable .
There are many effective ways in which a moral people could protest .
Consider investors , for example .
Clearly Halliburton and military suppliers are cleaning up .
Investors flock to the stocks in order to participate in the rise in value from booming profits .
But what would a moral people do ?
Would n’t they boycott the stocks of the companies that are profiting from the Bush regime ’s war crimes ?
If the U.S. invaded Iraq for any of the succession of reasons the Bush regime has given , why would the U.S. have spent $ 750 million on a fortress “ embassy ” with anti-missile systems and its own electricity and water systems spread over 104 acres ?
No one has ever seen or heard of such an embassy before .
Clearly , this “ embassy ” is constructed as the headquarters of an occupying colonial ruler .
The fact is that Bush invaded Iraq with the intent of turning Iraq into an American colony .
The so - called government of Maliki is not a government .
Maliki is the well paid front man for U.S. colonial rule .
Maliki ’s government does not exist outside the protected Green Zone , the headquarters of the American occupation .
If colonial rule were not the intent , the U.S. would not be going out of its way to force Sadr ’s 60,000 - man militia into a fight .
Sadr is a Shi’ite who is a real Iraqi leader , perhaps the only Iraqi who could end the sectarian conflict and restore some unity to Iraq .
As such he is regarded by the Bush regime as a danger to the American puppet Maliki .
Unless the U.S. is able to purchase or rig the upcoming Iraqi election , Sadr is likely to emerge as the dominant figure .
This would be a highly unfavorable development for the Bush regime ’s hopes of establishing its colonial rule behind the facade of a Maliki fake democracy .
Rather than work with Sadr in order to extract themselves from a quagmire , the Americans will be doing everything possible to assassinate Sadr .
Why does the Bush regime want to rule Iraq ?
Some speculate that it is a matter of “ peak oil . ”
Oil supplies are said to be declining even as demand for oil multiplies from developing countries such as China .
According to this argument , the U.S. decided to seize Iraq to ensure its own oil supply .
This explanation is problematic .
Most U.S. oil comes from Canada , Mexico , and Venezuela .
The best way for the U.S. to ensure its oil supplies would be to protect the dollar ’s role as world reserve currency .
Moreover , $ 3 - 5 trillion would have purchased a tremendous amount of oil .
Prior to the U.S. invasions , the U.S. oil import bill was running less than $ 100 billion per year .
Even in 2006 total U.S. imports from OPEC countries was $ 145 billion , and the U.S. trade deficit with OPEC totaled $ 106 billion .
Three trillion dollars could have paid for U.S. oil imports for 30 years ; $ 5 trillion could pay the U.S. oil bill for a half century had the Bush regime preserved a sound dollar .
The more likely explanation for the U.S. invasion of Iraq is the neoconservative Bush regime ’s commitment to the defense of Israeli territorial expansion .
There is no such thing as a neoconservative who is not allied with Israel .
Israel hopes to steal all of the West Bank and southern Lebanon for its territorial expansion .
An American colonial regime in Iraq not only buttresses Israel from attack , but also can pressure Syria and Iran not to support the Palestinians and Lebanese .
The Iraqi war is a war for Israeli territorial expansion .
Americans are dying and bleeding to death financially for Israel .
Bush ’s “ war on terror ” is a hoax that serves to cover U.S. intervention in the Middle East on behalf of “ greater Israel . ”
There has been talk about the possibility of a Greatest American Hero movie for years .
However , it appears that things are actually now officially greenlit and production on the movie is set to begin in July ( assuming there ’s no actors strike that is ) .
The folks over at Moviehole give us this :
The casting breakdown for Hinkley says he ’s “ 29 - 39 , an all - around good guy , with boyish handsome good looks , smart , decent , honorable and resilient , Ralph is a high school history teacher in Tempe , Arizona , a bachelor who has n’t yet found the right girl .
Selected by a bunch of aliens as the perfect hero to champion the rights of humankind against an evil nemesis , Ralph gets a superhero suit and a rather gruff squire in the form of FBI agent Bill Maxwell – neither of which yield easily to his control .
Stuck inside the suit while awaiting for a duel - to - the - death challenge from his sinister opponent , Harve Lundy , Ralph proves to be honest , upright , cheerful , thrifty , brave , clean and reverent as he prepares himself to do or die , without losing his Eagle Scout - ish honor or his suit in the process .
Oh , and he gets a girlfriend along the way . ”
I ’m not going to lie to you …
I frigging LOVED this TV show when I was a little kid .
It ’s also one of the all time greatest TV Show theme songs EVER .
Sing it with me : “ Look at what ’s happened to me -ee .
I ca n’t believe it myself .
Suddenly I ’m up on top of the world .
Should have been somebody else .
Da da da da da… da… da da da da da BELEIVE IT OR NOT , I ’M WALKING ON AIR .
I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD FEEL SO FREE-EE-EE … ” Oh yeah , good times .
The movie itself will probably end up being forgettable … but I ’m still pumped to see it .
A cure for MRSA appears to be within grasp after scientists claimed to have developed a drug that destroys the most virulent strains of the deadly superbug .
The breakthrough by British researchers could save 1,600 lives a year and wipe out the highly infectious bacteria .
A landmark peer - reviewed study has found that in the lab MRSA does not develop resistance to the drug , as it does to antibiotics .
Tests showed that the XF - 73 " bacteriocidal " compound continued to destroy MRSA after repeated treatment , long past the stage when it would have become resistant to antibiotics .
MRSA has proved to be an intractable problem in hospitals , despite repeated government initiatives – concentrating on improved staff hygiene and deep - cleaning programmes – to eradicate it .

Scientists at Sussex - based Destiny Pharma are now carrying out human trials and could have a product ready within three years .
Mystery Meat Macrophotography A NaturalNews PhotoTour by Mike Adams
Welcome to the " Meet Your Mystery Meat " photo tour on NewsTarget.com .
Hold on to your lunch for this one !
We 're about to take you on a journey into some sick macrophotography of processed meat products .
As I 'm a nature macrophotography buff , I took all these pictures myself , in my own kitchen , using the same high - end photography equipment I use to take pictures of flowers and insects .
As you 'll see from these pictures , the detail is astonishing .
You may never look at your sandwich meat the same way again .
All these photos are completely un-touched ( they were not Photoshopped in any way except to alter brightness and contrast ) and were taken of popular processed meat products purchased at Wal - Mart just yesterday .
We 're starting our journey with Oscar Mayer 's Cotto Salami product .

After a sneak peak and trial run last month , the what .cd team has finally made a semi-public release of the Gazelle tracker and site software , by doing its first large scale roll - out on its own site .
Gazelle , as we reported back in November , is an attempt by the group to replace the aging and buggy TBsource .
It is intended as a fast , flexible system , that reduces load on servers and databases , whilst increasing features .
Over the weekend , what.cd was upgraded , so that all of its roughly 43,000 members could try it .
Whilst there were initial bugs , including a problem with IRC channel password keys , everything seems to be running smoothly now .
More of a problem was a DDOS the site experienced when it had just gone live to its members .
The attack which lasted over 4 hours and pulled 100 Mb / sec , frustrated a number of the site ’s users .
Also a source of frustration for many was a misunderstanding over a ‘ freeleech ’ offer .
Done as a stress test , it was canceled after 6 hours , the announcement about it said it could last 24 .
Many users who grabbed stuff they would n’t have gotten otherwise in an attempt to increase their ratio , started downloads and still had them going when it was stopped , which lead to some friction between staff and users .
As always , the golden rule is to never download something you do n’t want in an attempt to boost ratio .
However , Gazelle is not just for music trackers .
Another site , Ntorrents , will be changing over to it shortly , according to an administrator there .
This will be as much of a test in many ways for Gazelle as this weekend ’s launch on what .cd was .
This time though , it will be testing its viability beyond music trackers .
The developers have not yet announced a release date beyond ‘ when all the major bugs are fixed ’ .
Stay tuned for more .
A May 2007 Envisat image shows a crack beginning to form in the Pine Island Glacier ( left image ) .
This crack eventually caused a new iceberg to break off the glacier in October 2007 ( right image ) .
Satellite images taken over the last year show the birth of an iceberg as it broke away from its parent glacier in Antarctica and drifted out to sea .
The newborn iceberg , which measured 21 by 12 miles ( 34 by 20 kilometers ) , was spotted breaking away from the Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica by scientists in images taken by the European Space Agency 's Envisat satellite between September 2006 and October 2007 .
The process of iceberg formation , called calving , can be caused by wave or wind action , collision with a larger iceberg , or an ice shelf growing too large to support itself at the point where it meets the sea .
The calving of large icebergs such as this one is a natural part of the life cycle of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet ( WAIS ) ; a 34 - year - long study showed that one of the icebergs breaks off every 5 to 10 years .
The last such major iceberg calved away in 2001 .
The Pine Island Glacier is the largest in the WAIS and transports ice from the deep interior of the ice sheet out to see .
The glacier is up to 8200 feet ( 2500 meters ) thick and comprises about 10 percent of the WAIS .
Observations have shown that the flow rate of the glacier out to sea has accelerated over the past 15 years , and a study by scientists at the British Antarctic Survey and University College London showed a loss of 7.5 cubic miles ( 31 cubic kilometers ) of ice from the interior of the WAIS between 1992 and 2001 , mostly from the Pine Island Glacier .
This thinning caused the glacier to retreat 3 miles ( 5 kilometers ) inland — further evidence that small changes on the Antarctic coast , such as the effects of global warming , can be rapidly transmitted inland and lead to accelerating sea level rise through ice melt .
This particular calving event , however , was not a significant change to the WAIS .
And I seem to remember hearing it costs $ 1 m a day to run a campaign .
Hillary ’s fairy tale comes with a cost .
At this point , she ’s simply bluffing .
But it ’s not clear what she ’s trying to win .
She ’s not stupid , she knows she lost the nomination .
So then what is she doing ?
Trying to suck up to MI and FL for the next election in 2012 ?
Trying to hurt Obama out of revenge ?
Trying to become Obama ’s VP ?
Trying to assuage her ego by finishing up all the primaries , to hell with how much damage she does the party ?
I suspect it ’s all of the above , plus staying on deck in case Obama gets hit by a meteor .
In any case , stories like this will only accelerate her campaign ’s demise .
May 7 , 2008  --
A Florida grand jury will decide whether a 15 - year - old girl whose disappearance triggered an Amber Alert should be tried as an adult in the murder of a man she and her boyfriend allegedly beat and suffocated .
Authorities in Florida issued arrest warrants on first - degree murder charges against the teenager , Amanda Morgan Leppert , and Toby Lee Lowry , 22 .
Authorities say the couple fled the state April 25 in a stolen pickup truck belonging to murder victim James Thomas Stewart , 66 .
Both remain in custody in El Paso , Texas , where police found them Saturday , 1,600 miles from home , panhandling by an interstate highway after a motorist recognized Leppert from a nationally publicized Amber Alert .
Stewart was found dead inside his Melrose , Fla. , home May 1 .
His Toyota Tacoma was missing from his driveway .
An autopsy found that he had been beaten , stabbed and suffocated before he died , authorities said .
" Mr. Stewart had been viciously beaten with two metal rods and had been stabbed multiple times with a knife , " Putnam County Sheriff Dean Kelly said at a press conference Tuesday .
" The autopsy also revealed that Mr. Stewart had been suffocated with a plastic garbage bag that had been put over his head . "
Leppert was originally reported missing April 22 .
Her mother told police that she feared her daughter may be with Lowry , a Florida man with a lengthy criminal history in Putnam and Clay counties .
Lowry was released from a 20 - month prison sentence last summer .
Kelly said Leppert and Lowry may have become romantically involved sometime last fall .
It was unclear how they 'd met , but Kelly said it could have been over MySpace .
After Stewart 's family reported to police that the 66 - year - old , who 's hard of hearing , had not contacted them in days , police entered the house and discovered the murder scene .
Leppert had left behind her phone at Lowry 's house when she disappeared , Kelly said at yesterday 's press conference , and authorities saw that a call had been made from Stewart 's home to Leppert 's phone April 25 .
With the pickup truck missing and Stewart dead , authorities had reason to believe that Lowry -- and perhaps Leppert -- were involved in his death .
A warrant was issued for Lowry 's arrest on charges of auto theft and interfering with child custody .
Authorities tracked the pair in the truck through three states to Texas .
According to a timeline provided by the Putnam County Sheriff 's Office , the two stopped at a Gainesville , Fla. , Wal - Mart after the murder and bought new clothing .
They dumped the cap to their victim 's trunk and picked up a hitchhiker in Georgia who authorities said was unaware of the homicide .
The trio decided to head for California .
The vehicle is spotted in Biloxi , Miss. , April 29 ; Crowley , La. , April 30 ; and finally Katy , Texas , May 1 .
Two days later , a motorist reported seeing the couple , along with the hitchhiker they 'd picked up in Georgia , panhandling Saturday in El Paso .
Authorities believe that Leppert and Lowry spent the first few days following her disappearance in Putnam County on the lookout for a crime of opportunity .
They spent time in a wooded area behind Stewart 's house before Leppert knocked on the man 's door and asked to use his phone .
" There was no prior relationship , " Kelly said Tuesday of the alleged decision to attack Stewart .
" They cased the area looking for an easy mark . "
After placing the call to her own phone , she returned to Lowry and reported that Stewart was vulnerable .
Later that night , Kelly said , the two entered the house and committed the murder .
Authorities said that the Amber Alert worked as planned in this case .
If Leppert had been 18 , they would not have been able to publicize that she was missing as widely .
At 15 , Kelly said , they had to at least assume there was a possibility that she was being held against her will .
" We said all along that she was a victim until we proved otherwise , " Kelly said .
" And we 've proved otherwise . "
Florida authorities expect the pair to be extradited from Texas to Florida by the end of this week .
A grand jury will likely hand down an indictment on the murder charges in the next few weeks .
DALLAS ( Reuters ) - Authorities have now removed 401 children from a remote ranch in west Texas belonging to a breakaway Mormon sect linked to jailed polygamist leader Warren Jeffs , local media reported on Monday .
The San Angelo Standard Times reported the total number of children taken away from the ranch and quoted a Texas Child Protective Services official as saying they were removed as police and welfare officials investigate a case of possible abuse .
Scores of women have also reportedly been removed from or left the compound owned by the secretive sect .
Texas child protection authorities could not immediately be reached for comment .
Lisa Block , a spokeswoman with the Department of Public Safety , told Reuters one person had been arrested at the compound for “ interfering with the duties of a public servant ” but no one has yet been arrested on charges related to the abuse probe .
“ An unknown number of men remain on the compound and are not free to leave , ” she said .
Law enforcement officials initially swooped on the compound late last week in a remote , semi-arid region of west Texas about 120 miles northwest of San Antonio in response to a complaint of abuse by a young woman there .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
They have yet to identify the woman .
It is unclear how many people have been living at the compound or precisely who is in charge .
The investigation is the latest brush the polygamist Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints has had with the law .
In November , the sect ’s spiritual leader and prophet , Warren Jeffs , was sentenced in a Utah court to 10 years to life in prison as an accomplice to rape for forcing a 14 - year - old girl to marry her 19 - year - old first cousin .
He is in jail in Arizona awaiting trial on similar charges for arranged marriages there .
Polygamy is outlawed everywhere in the United States but the male followers of such sects typically marry one woman officially and take the others as “ spiritual wives . ”
This makes the women single in the eyes of the state which can entitle them and their children to various welfare benefits .
The mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , as the Mormon faith is officially known , renounced polygamy more than a century ago and tries to distance itself from breakaway factions that still practice it .

Monkeys modified to get Huntington's
Scientists have for the first time genetically engineered monkeys to develop the deadly neurological disease , Huntington's .
The researchers say one of two surviving rhesus macaque monkeys engineered to have the defective gene that causes Huntington 's in humans is already showing tell - tale symptoms at age 10 months .
The advance , reported online in the latest edition of Nature , could lead to major breakthroughs in the effort to develop new treatments for a range of neurological diseases .
Huntington's , which is incurable and hereditary , is caused by a single abnormal gene in which certain nerve cells in the brain waste away .
People are born with the gene but symptoms typically do not appear until middle age .
Researchers often study laboratory animals such as mice to get insights into the underlying biology of diseases .
But monkeys and other primates are more similar to people than rodents in physiological , neurological and genetic features .
The scientists at Emory University 's Yerkes National Primate Research Centre in Atlanta say the monkeys are the first primates genetically modified to have a human disease .
They hope studying the monkeys will allow for greater knowledge of Huntington 's and ideas for new drugs .
Disease 's essence
" Rodent species can capture some of the characteristics of the disease , but they have not been satisfactory in being able to really capture the essence of the disease , " Dr Stuart Zola , head of the Yerkes centre , says .
" Now we have a genetically modified nonhuman primate that really has captured the clinical signs that we see in patients with Huntington 's disease . "
Those with the progressive , degenerative disease experience uncontrolled movements , emotional disturbances and mental deterioration .
Drugs can help manage symptoms but do not stop the physical and mental decline .
People typically die within 10 to 15 years after symptoms arise .
The researchers say they chose Huntington 's as the disease for creating the genetically modified monkeys with an eye toward simplicity , because it is linked to mutations in a single gene rather than multiple genes .
Zola says the achievement could pave the way for creating genetically modified primates with other neurodegenerative ailments such as Parkinson 's disease and Alzheimer 's disease .
" This research allows scientists to advance beyond mouse models , which do not replicate all of the changes in the brain and behaviour that humans with Huntington 's disease experience , " says Dr John Harding , a primate resources official at the National Institutes of Health , which funded the study .
Viral vector technology
Using so - called viral vector technology , the researchers transferred the Huntington 's gene into a monkey egg cell .
After using in vitro fertilisation , the egg grew into a four - cell embryo and was then placed in the womb of a female monkey acting as a surrogate mother .
Of the five baby monkeys born using this process , two died within about a day , another one died in about a month and two are still living at age 10 months , according to Dr Anthony Chan of the Yerkes centre and Emory University School of Medicine .
One of the two surviving monkeys has developed symptoms including involuntary movements of the hands and face , Chan says .
The other has no symptoms of the disease yet but may develop them later , he says .
Chris Casal , a Brooklyn , N.Y. , elementary - school teacher , used to drive to work almost every day , mainly because it took 12 minutes compared with an hour by subway .
But rising fuel and parking costs made the trip " kind of ridiculous , " he says .
So last year he bought a Vespa GTS scooter that uses about $ 7 of fuel every two weeks instead of the $ 30 his Honda Civic consumed .
He parks free in the schoolyard , and the two - wheeler impresses his students .
The kids also like " the odd factor , " he says .
" I 'm a six - foot - one - inch , 255 - pound ...
Climate change has dominated the spring summit European leaders meeting in Brussels are set to endorse binding measures for cutting greenhouse gas emissions .
Slovenia 's PM , who is chairing the summit , said the leaders had approved a timetable to implement an agreed 20 % cut by 2020 , compared with 1990 levels .
He likened the EU 's plans to move to a low - carbon economy to a " third industrial revolution " .
The summit is also discussing financial instability , as well as liberalisation of the bloc 's energy markets .
Slovenian PM
Janez Jansa said the leaders had taken note of a report by EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana warning of potential security concerns arising from global warming .
The report says climate change will have a growing impact on global security , multiplying existing threats such as shortages of food and water .
It warns that climate change could cause millions of people to migrate towards Europe as other parts of the world suffer environmental degradation .
EU 'S 20/20/20 VISION : KEY AIMS AND POTENTIAL CHALLENGES AIM : 20 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 AIM : Reduction in energy imports , saving money and increasing energy security AIM : World leadership in renewable energy technology CHALLENGE : Government and companies may try to weaken their emissions targets CHALLENGE : Some countries likely to find renewables targets too ambitious CHALLENGE : Wrangles likely over technicalities of emissions trading
The EU and emissions Climate change quiz Mr Solana 's report " enjoyed a lot of support " , Mr Jansa told reporters .
The EU leaders are considering specific targets put forward by the European Commission in January on how to achieve the agreed 20 % cut in greenhouse emissions by 2020 .
The BBC's Paul Kirby in Brussels says an important barometer for the success of the summit is how far the leaders are prepared to go in implementing those targets .
The liberalisation of energy markets is another contentious issue , our correspondent says .
Germany and France lead a group of countries hostile to calls for the break - up of big energy companies which run both power stations and the distribution networks .
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said there was a general understanding that a European energy market was linked to having a secure supply and promoting renewable energy .
' Med club '
Meanwhile a UK proposal to cut sales tax on " green " goods is unlikely to succeed .
The idea put forward by UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown would cover such products as low - energy light bulbs .
Mr Barroso said some countries did not agree with the idea which he described as " a very sensitive issue " .
He went on to say that he did not want to dismiss the importance of positive discrimination for such products , but alternatives such as rebates might be more suitable .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The EU will not acknowledge that they need to take responsibility for pollution they created over the last 100 years Rohit Vashist , Delhi , India EU leaders are also discussing the turmoil in financial markets .
They are expected to say that the European economy could ride out the current instability , as well as a downturn in the US .
Mr Barroso said it was clear that people felt it was yet " another reason not to allow complacency , but on the contrary to pursue the modernisation of the European economy " .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy arrived at the talks having secured support from Germany for a watered - down proposal for a Mediterranean Union .
His aim is to forge closer ties between European countries bordering the Mediterranean and those beyond Europe , including Israel , Algeria and Tunisia .
The main objection to what some have dubbed " Club Med " was the cost , but there have also been complaints that a Euro - Mediterranean partnership already exists .
The compromise appears to be an " upgrade " on what already exists and hopes for its success have been carefully lowered .

Like us , our canine friends are able to form abstract concepts .
Friederike Range and colleagues from the University of Vienna in Austria have shown for the first time that dogs can classify complex color photographs and place them into categories in the same way that humans do .
And the dogs successfully demonstrate their learning through the use of computer automated touch - screens , eliminating potential human influence .
In order to test whether dogs can visually categorize pictures , and transfer their knowledge to new situations , four dogs were shown landscape and dog photographs , and expected to make a selection on a computer touch - screen .
In the training phase , the dogs were shown both the landscape and dog photographs simultaneously and were rewarded with a food pellet if they selected the dog picture ( positive stimulus ) .
The dogs then took part in two tests .
In the first test , the dogs were shown completely different dog and landscape pictures .
They continued to reliably select the dog photographs , demonstrating that they could transfer their knowledge gained in the training phase to a new set of visual stimuli , even though they had never seen those particular pictures before .
In the second test , the dogs were shown new dog pictures pasted onto the landscape pictures used in the training phase , facing them with contradictory information : on the one hand , a new positive stimulus as the pictures contained dogs even though they were new dogs ; on the other hand , a familiar negative stimulus in the form of the landscape .
When the dogs were faced with a choice between the new dog on the familiar landscape and a completely new landscape with no dog , they reliably selected the option with the dog .
These results show that the dogs were able to form a concept i.e. ‘ dog ’ , although the experiment cannot tell us whether they recognized the dog pictures as actual dogs .
The authors also draw some conclusions on the strength of their methodology : “ Using touch - screen computers with dogs opens up a whole world of possibilities on how to test the cognitive abilities of dogs by basically completely controlling any influence from the owner or experimenter . ”
They add that the method can also be used to test a range of learning strategies and has the potential to allow researchers to compare the cognitive abilities of different species using a single method .

Mr Bush met his Romanian counterpart before the start of the Nato summit US President George W Bush has repeated his call for Nato to expand eastwards .
Speaking in Romania ahead of Nato 's summit in Bucharest , he said the former Soviet states of Ukraine and Georgia should be offered paths to membership .
Mr Bush also said he " felt good " about Nato allies ' reaction to appeals for more troops to be sent to Afghanistan .
Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said his country would not sulk over the expansion plans - but stressed that they would not " go unanswered " .
" This will not be left without an answer , I can assure you , " Mr Lavrov told parliament in Moscow .
" But we will respond pragmatically , not like small boys in school who sulk at those who bully them , run out of the room , slam the door and start crying in the corner .
" We must concentrate on increasing our economic power and taking our defence capabilities to a higher technologic level . "
More time Mr Bush stressed that Georgia and Ukraine should be offered " a clear path " towards the goal of Nato membership .
" We must make clear that Nato welcomes the aspirations of Georgia and Ukraine for membership in Nato , " he said .
He added that " Nato membership must remain open to all of Europe 's democracies that seek it , and are ready to share in the responsibilities of Nato " .
The prospect of more ex-Soviet states joining Nato is opposed by Russia , while Nato members France and Germany have warned that it will worsen relations with Moscow .
The Cold War is over and Russia is not our enemy
George W Bush
Uncertainty as Nato door opens Bush praises Nato Afghan pledges Arriving for the summit , Germany 's Chancellor Angela Merkel said Ukraine and Georgia should have a long - term prospect of Nato membership , but that now was not the time for Membership Action Plans ( MAP ) to be extended to them .
" We have reached the conclusion that it is too early to give both countries MAP status , " she said , but added : " The message is : the door is open .
We see a perspective for accession .
We want to help both countries go toward MAP . "
French prime minister Francois Fillon said on Tuesday of Ukrainian and Georgian membership : " We think that it is not the correct response to the balance of power in Europe . "
Mr Bush spoke at the Black Sea resort of Neptun on Wednesday , where he met Romania 's President Traian Basescu .
In a joint press conference , Mr Bush said he " strongly believed " Croatia , Albania and Macedonia should be able to join Nato as full members .
The huge Parliament Palace in Bucharest is hosting the summit
He added that Membership Action Plans should be extended to Ukraine and Georgia , and strongly supported calls by Montenegro and Bosnia - Hercegovina for " intensified dialogue " on membership .
" We ought to open the door to closer co-operation with Serbia , " he also said .
However , Greece has said that , if no last - minute compromise is reached , it would veto an invitation to Macedonia to join Nato because it objects to the country 's name .
Macedonia is also the name of a province in northern Greece , and Athens worries that this could imply a claim on its territory .
Earlier , Nato Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer told the BBC he supported membership for the former Soviet states .
" There 's no way that the door will be locked for Ukraine and Georgia , " he said .
Giant conference " The Nato Treaty very clearly states that European democracies fulfilling their criteria for Nato membership are welcome . "
Mr de Hoop Scheffer said he understood Russian concerns but added that the " final decision will be taken by the allies and not by anybody else " .
The three - day summit of leaders from the 26 - nation alliance in the Romanian capital , Bucharest , is being billed as the biggest in the alliance 's 59 - year history .
Nato enlargement and efforts to rally support for the Nato - led force in Afghanistan are the topics expected to dominate the agenda .
Mr Bush also spoke of his forthcoming talks with outgoing Russian president Vladimir Putin - whom he will meet at the summit , and again at private talks in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi at the weekend .
The US leader said he would make clear to Mr Putin that " the Cold War is over and Russia is not our enemy " .
" This is a good chance for me to sit down and have yet another heart - to - heart with him , " he said .

Just before the sun dips below the horizon , sometimes a brilliant green or blue flash appears at the edge of the fiery ball .
To see it , you have to be somewhere with an unobstructed view of the sun and a very stable atmosphere .

The perfect spot is the Cerro Paranal Observatory in Chile , perched on a 2,635 - meter ( 8,645 - foot ) mountain in the Atacama Desert , where they get an average of 300 cloudless days per year .
Check out these images , as well as another solar phenomenon called a " Gegenschein . "
The observatory , which is operated by the 13 - nation European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere ( ESO ) , is home to the Very Large Telescope ( yes , that 's the official name ) , which ESO describes as the world 's most advanced optical instrument .
The green and blue flashes happen when Earth 's atmosphere acts as a giant prism , refracting certain colors from the setting sun 's rays .
It 's a tradition at Paranal for the staff to gather at sunset every day to watch for the flashes before settling down for a night of astronomical observations , according to the ESO Web site .
But kids , do n't try this at home – at least not without proper eye protection .
The ESO site emphasizes that looking at the sun with the naked eye is dangerous , and looking at it through a camera , binoculars , or telescope is even worse .
" Do not attempt to observe the Sun unless you know what you are doing , " the site warns repeatedly .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
The Fed 's agreement to buy up to $ 30 billion in troubled Bear Stearns mortgage bonds may have saved JPMorgan Chase from a big writedown , according to senior executives involved in the transaction .
Ultimately , it enabled a deal to be done even as alternatives rapidly dried up .
JPMorgan ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) executives initially decided to pass on a purchase of Bear Stearns this past weekend , Bear execs said , largely because of the risks tied to Bear 's mortgage portfolios .
They changed their minds after the Fed agreed to pony up $ 30 billion in so - called nonrecourse loans - agreements that transfer the risk of Bear 's bad mortgage bets to U.S. taxpayers .
The Fed 's decision paved the way for the Sunday evening deal that put Bear in JPMorgan 's hands for $ 2 a share , a 93 % discount to Friday 's closing price .
But the value of Bear 's balance sheet was n't the only worry at JPMorgan .
Bear execs say JPMorgan was also worried that without help from the Fed , buying mortgages from Bear ( BSC , Fortune 500 ) could force JPMorgan to write down the value of its own mortgage holdings .
That fear stemmed in part from the sharp decline in the value of mortgage debt this year , along with the different calendars the firms report on .
At the end of February , Bear had $ 16 billion in commercial mortgage - backed securities , $ 15 billion in prime and Alt - A mortgage bonds and $ 2 billion in various subprime bonds , JPMorgan said .
The value of those securities has been in sharp decline , along with U.S. house prices .
Indeed , values in the mortgage securities market have plunged just over the past month , as investors in lenders such as Thornburg Mortgage ( TMA ) - which is dealing with unmet margin calls triggered by plunging prices - will surely tell you .
JPMorgan 's fiscal year ends Dec. 31 , so the firm 's mortgage holdings are marked to prices that prevailed then - before the bloodbath of the last month .
But Bear 's latest quarter ended just last month - and Bear executives told Fortune that in that quarter , they marked their mortgage desk 's portfolio down by $ 2.5 billion .
As a result , Bear Stearns ' mortgage - portfolio marks could have been lower than JPMorgan 's - and bringing the Bear Stearns loans onto JPMorgan 's balance sheet could have resulted in a so - called marking event that would have forced JPMorgan to apply Bear 's freshly lowered values to its own mortgage book .
That could have led to billions of dollars worth of writedowns at JPMorgan - even assuming JPMorgan 's marks were entirely appropriate as of Dec. 31 .
Midway through the weekend , it had become clear that Bear Stearns had two choices : a deal with JPMorgan or a bankruptcy filing .
However , the three - day marathon started out with a glimmer of hope for Bear 's beleaguered management .
They had access to the Federal Reserve , so an immediate collapse was n't in the offing ( without the Fed 's support , the firm would have collapsed late Thursday or early Friday morning ) and there were at least " indications of interest " from a handful of prospective suitors .
Banks like HSBC , Royal Bank of Scotland , and J.P. Morgan Chase , as well as financial private equity powerhouse J.C. Flowers , were all said to be interested .
A Bear senior executive told Fortune that the mood inside 383 Madison Avenue was : " The more suitors the better Get some interest going , maybe an auction would occur . "
An auction was precisely what did not occur however .
HSBC and RBS did not even attend meetings at Bear 's headquarters over the weekend ; bankers from J.C. Flowers , despite putting in an appearance at headquarters , did not express an interest in putting in a bid , according to Bear executives .
It was understandable why HSBC did not show up , as they largely kicked off the mortgage - market collapse with a stunning $ 10.5 billion charge in February 2007 , capping off with news of another planned $ 17 billion hit .
Interestingly , HSBC had made a series of overtures to Bear going back to 2003 , but chief executive Jimmy Cayne had refused to discuss a sale at anything other a multiple to its book value .
RBS ' unit RBS Greenwich Capital was a smaller , mirror - image of Bear Stearns , almost entirely focused on fixed - income with a specialty in underwriting mortgage and asset - backed debt .
Despite building an impressive new trading floor and headquarters in Stamford , across from UBS , RBS Greenwich Capital is wrestling with its own layoffs and billion - dollar inventory write - downs .
Lastly , despite an expertise in the finance sector , J.C. Flowers did n't have anything like the resources needed to manage a firm like Bear , which had over $ 102 billion in repo lines outstanding as of last quarter .
JPMorgan , for its part , has so far been one of the best managers of mortgage - related risk on Wall Street .
The firm has taken just $ 3.7 billion in mortgage - related writedowns - a fraction of the hits endured by rivals Citi ( C , Fortune 500 ) , Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) and UBS ( UBS ) .
So potentially leaving the Fed with $ 20 billion worth of troubled securities from Bear 's balance sheet - as JPMorgan said Sunday night it intends to do - marks another instance of strong risk management by the bank .
A J.P. Morgan official counseled Monday that no decisions have been made yet .
Another oddity in this deal centers on Bear 's mortgage trading desk .
While much has been justifiably made of that desk 's central role during the wide - ranging global credit collapse - it was perennially the first - or second - biggest underwriter on Wall Street - the embattled desk actually made money in the first quarter , Bear execs said .
Over the previous three months , Bear 's mortgage and asset - backed trading desks shifted a portion of their capital into a series of proprietary trades designed to profit from the ongoing maelstrom .
Notionally called hedges , in reality they were a series of free - standing bets that Bear executives dubbed The Chaos Trade , given the current climate .
The trades were bets pretty far afield from the standard trading of standard Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae guaranteed securities .
The trades speculated on the decline of value in specific tranches of mortgage securities , futures on bond indexes , the shape of the yield curve and individual brokerage and bank bonds .
The payoff for Bear from the so - called chaos trade was impressive : $ 1.9 billion in one quarter , nearly off - setting the $ 2.5 billion write - down , Bear execs said .
On top of that , one senior Bear executive told Fortune that in the quarter , the firm made $ 800 million on a series of other mortgage trades , giving its desk a profit for the quarter .
The senior Bear executive declined to characterize the nature of the trades .
BECKY BARROW
Daily Mail
April 13 , 2008
Mortgage lenders were yesterday accused of cashing in on the credit crunch by raising the cost of home loans hours before the Bank of England cut interest rates .
In an attempt to boost the ailing economy , the Bank yesterday reduced the base rate from 5.25 per cent to 5 per cent .
But the move came after two of the biggest lenders revealed plans to move in the opposite direction and raise their mortgage rates today .
One of these is Alliance & Leicester , which will have increased its rates twice in less than a week .
The firm raised its fixed - rate mortgage deals on Tuesday then just 72 hours later today .
On Monday , customers could take out a two - year fixed rate mortgage of 4.99 per cent .
Today , the rate will be 5.74 per cent .
This means a customer who takes out the average loan of £ 158,100 with the bank today will need to find about £ 850 more in repayments this year than a customer who took one out on Monday .
The country ’s biggest building society , Nationwide , will today also increase its prices for a sixth time since the beginning of the year .
With rates soaring despite the Bank ’s base rate falling , homeowners are paying the price for the credit crunch .

Those of us who oppose the war , who believe that all U.S. troops should be withdrawn and the network of permanent bases in Iraq dismantled , have only two options in the coming presidential elections — Ralph Nader and Cynthia McKinney .
A vote for any of the Republican and Democratic candidates is a vote to perpetuate the occupation of Iraq and a lengthy and futile war of attrition with the Iraqi insurgency .
You can sign on for the suicidal hundred - year war with John McCain or for the nebulous open - ended war - lite with Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama , or back those who reject the war .
If you vote Democrat or Republican in the coming election be honest with yourself — you have voted to allow the U.S. government to continue , in some form , the campaign that needlessly kills ever more Americans and Iraqis in a conflict that has become the worst foreign policy disaster in U.S. history and a crime under international law .
“ When will the American people actually vote to give to the world more than bombs and missiles , sweatshops , dubious science , frankenfood , poverty and misery ? ” Cynthia McKinney , the presidential candidate in the Green Party primaries , told me .
“ Not only do we need an immediate , orderly withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan , we need an end to the militarism that has placed U.S. troops on the soil of over 100 countries .
A true peace agenda means a complete redefinition of security .
I remain convinced that if people in Haiti , Venezuela , Brazil , Ecuador , Bolivia and Nicaragua can vote a peace and justice agenda into power , then so too can we . ”
Examine the proposals on Iraq offered by Clinton and Obama .
They talk about withdrawing some troops , but they also talk about leaving behind forces to protect U.S. bases in Iraq , assigning troops to train the Iraqi army and continuing the fight against “ terrorism . ”
Clinton and Obama do not throw out numbers , but a rough estimate would be 40,000 or 50,000 troops permanently stationed in Iraq .
Obama , his advisers say , will also not rule out continuing to use private security companies like Blackwater Worldwide in Iraq .
The war would not end under a Democratic administration .
It would drag on until the mission collapsed and the U.S. retreated in humiliation .
And when pressed , the Democratic candidates have admitted as much .
Tim Russert in the New Hampshire debate asked the Democratic candidates to guarantee that all U.S. troops in Iraq would be home by 2013 .
No one , including John Edwards , was prepared to make such a commitment .
Dennis Kucinich , the only Democratic candidate who opposed a continuation of the war , had been excluded from the debate .
When the question was asked he was standing outside the hall in the snow with supporters to protest his exclusion .
But the lust for militarism by Clinton and Obama does not end with Iraq .
The two remaining Democratic candidates back the occupation of Afghanistan .
They defend Israel ’s indiscriminate bombing of Lebanon , which killed hundreds of Lebanese , destroyed huge parts of Lebanon ’s infrastructure and left U.S. - manufactured cluster bombs littered over southern Lebanon .
Clinton and Obama praise the right - wing government in Jerusalem and callously blame the Palestinian victims for the suffering inflicted on them by Israel .
They support , in open defiance of international law , the 40 - year Israeli occupation of Palestinian land and the draconian siege of Gaza , dismissing the grim humanitarian crisis it has unleashed on the 1.5 million Palestinians trapped in the world ’s largest open - air prison .
The Democrats , who took control of the Congress in midterm elections largely because of public dissatisfaction with the Iraq war , have continued to fund the war , ignoring anti-war voters .
The party , as a result , has sunk even lower in public opinion polls than the president , to a 19 percent approval rating , according to a NBC / Wall Street Journal poll .
Clinton and Obama dutifully lined up with most other Democratic legislators to cast ballots in favor of squandering more than $ 300 billion in taxpayer money on a war that should never have been fought .
And , if either is elected , he or she will spend billions more on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
I will skip the rest of the mediocre voting records of Obama and Clinton , which include pandering to corporate interests , failing to back a universal single - payer health care system , refusing to call for the slashing of the bloated military budget , not urging repeal of NAFTA and the Taft - Hartley Act , which cripples the ability of unions to organize , and not seeking an end to nuclear power as an energy resource .
Let ’s stick with the war .
It is depressing enough .
The anti-war movement bears much of the blame .
It sold us out to the Democratic Party .
The decision by anti-war activists to accept a moratorium on demonstrations in 2004 in order to support John Kerry ended our chance to build a widespread , grass - roots movement against the war .
Kerry , in return for this support , ridiculed and humiliated those of us who opposed the war .
He called for more troops in Iraq .
He mouthed thought - terminating patriotic slogans to out - Bush Bush .
He promised victory in Iraq .
He assured voters that he , unlike George W. Bush , would never have pulled out of Fallujah .
Anti-war voters stood passively behind him as they were humiliated and abused .
And the anti-war movement has never recovered .
The groundswell of popular revulsion that led hundreds of thousands to take to the streets before 2006 collapsed .
The five - year anniversary of the war was marked with tepid protests that were sparsely attended .
Why not ?
If the anti-war movement gutlessly backs pro-war candidates , what credibility does it have ?
If it fails to support those candidates on the margins of the political spectrum who stand with it against the war , what is the movement worth ?
Why not be cynical and go home ?
“ It is a virus , ” Nader said in a phone interview .
“ It is self - defeating .
What are they doing this for if they ca n’t push it into the political arena ?
Is it all theater ? ”
“ The strategy of the Democratic Party is to beat the Republicans by becoming more like them , ” Nader said .
“ How can they get away with that ?
If they become more like the Republic Party they start eating into the Republican vote .
This usually would inflict a price on them .
They would lose the left ’s vote , but since the left signaled to the Democrats that their vote can be taken for granted because the Republicans are too horrible to contemplate , they get both .
As a result , when you put this cocktail together , becoming more Republican to get Republican votes and hanging on to the left because they have nowhere to go , you set up a tug in the direction of the corporations .
There is no discernable end to this strategy by the left .
When you ask the left they say not this year , sometime later .
But when ?
If it is not now , if it is sometime in the future , when ?
What is their breaking point ?
If you do not have a breaking point you are a slave . ”
The energy and idealism are out there .
Nader , in a March 13 - 14 Zogby poll , took 5 to 6 percent in a race between McCain and either Clinton or Obama .
Nader , among voters under 30 and among independents , polled 12 to 15 percent .
If the anti-war movement gets behind him and McKinney , if it stands behind its principles , it could begin to shake the foundations of the Democratic Party .
It could re-energize itself .
It might even force Democrats to offer voters a concrete plan to withdraw from Iraq .
War is not an abstraction to me .
I know its evil .
It is time , if we care about the state of the nation , to take an unequivocal stand against the war .
If Clinton and Obama do not want to join us , so be it .
I support those candidates and organizations that fight back .
We should , in solidarity , strike with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union on May 1 against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
We should support Code Pink ’s refusal to pay the portion of our taxes that go to funding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
But most of all , we should refuse to be suckered by Democratic candidates who use fuzzy language and will not commit to a total withdrawal from Iraq .
We owe it to the hundreds of thousands of dead and injured .
We owe to those Iraqis and Americans who will die in the coming days , weeks and months .
We owe it to ourselves so , at the very least , we can salvage our integrity .
West Australian Opposition Leader Troy Buswell has broken down at a press conference and admitted he sniffed the chair of a female Liberal Party staffer .
Speaking to journalists at a press conference at Mandurah , south of Perth , Mr Buswell confirmed details of the woman 's account of a 2005 incident , reported in The West Australian newspaper today .
He said he was not standing down as Liberal leader .

Q : How do you get 116 mpg ( US ) in a Metro XFi ?
A : Pulse and glide .
- added May 30/07
---
" Pulse and glide "
It sounds like some kind of tactical maneuver from the starship Enterprise .
But in fact , it 's a driving technique for more Earthly transportation .
( Never mind that the car most closely associated with the term is kind of spacy - looking . )
Of course the car in question is the Prius , and this summer , a group of five efficiency aficionados drove an unmodified 2nd generation version of Toyota 's hybrid to a fuel economy record of 109.3 mpg ( US ) over 1397 miles on a " loop " of public roads in Pittsburgh , PA .
When I first heard about their mpg marathon , I mistakenly assumed that their technique was possible only because of the hybrid system .
I was wrong .
Pulse and glide works - in theory - on any car ( it 's just easier to do in a Prius , as you 'll see ) .
Before going into the details , I should point out that it's not a technique that can be used all the time in real world driving .
Even one member of the group who made the run stated that their feat was in no way " normal " , but rather a demonstration of the potential efficiency of a hybrid when driven with ultimate fuel economy in mind .
Pulse & glide overview
Pulse and glide works like this : let 's say you 're on a road where you want to go 60 km /h .
Instead of driving along at a steady 60 , you instead accelerate to 70 ( that 's the pulse ) , and then coast in neutral with the engine off down to 50 ( that 's the glide ) .
That 's it .
Rinse and repeat .
And repeat .
And repeat ...
By doing this , you 're still averaging 60 km/h , but it turns out that pulse and glide is significantly more efficient than driving along maintaining a steady 60 km/h .
If you 're like me , it seems completely counter - intuitive .
You 're asking , " how can that possibly be more efficient than maintaining a steady speed in the highest possible gear ? "
After all , it violates one of the main commandments of efficient driving : conserving momentum .
Why it works
Prius MPG marathoners at the completion of their nearly 48 - hour endeavour .
( Source : Toyota.com hybrid newsletter )
The secret is in the glide , and it's is best illustrated by the extreme Prius demonstration .
The Prius is particularly excellent at gliding because under most conditions when the the accelerator is released below 40 mph , the gasoline engine shuts off completely and the transmission effectively freewheels in neutral ( it 's actually slightly more complicated than that , but stick with me ) .
So , while gliding , it 's effectively getting infinite mpg - it 's using no gas at all .
For that reason , the marathon drivers picked 40 mph as the upper limit of their pulse & glide cycle ( 33 mph was the bottom ) .
So in order to achieve 109.3 mpg , they just had to average 54.65 mpg while pulsing gently from 33 - 40 mph .
And it turns out , in a Prius , you can .
So , assuming equal length pulses & glides , they traveled half the total distance of their trip getting 54.65 mpg , and half the total distance using no fuel at all .
It averages out to 109.3 mpg .
( Their driving was actually more complex than the simple illustration above , so their pulse vs. glide proportions were not necessarily equal .
But for the purposes of understanding the basics of pulse & glide , it helps to think in terms of equal halves .
The drivers also took pains to ensure they were pulsing and gliding in a very specific way that minimized the flow of energy to and from the battery pack - they were in effect going to great lengths to avoid using the car 's hybrid propulsion while driving .
Whenever braking , however , they sought to take advantage of the hybrid system 's energy regeneration .
Follow the links at the end of this article for detailed Prius - specific pulse & glide info . )
Pulse & glide in a Geo Metro
Still skeptical , I went out in my car with the ScanGauge .
I really did n't believe it was going to work , but here are the numbers I saw .
I went to my " test course " - a nearly perfectly level stretch of 2 - lane highway about 6.5 km long - but these numbers are n't meant to be taken as experimentally valid .
I only did one run , so consider yourself warned .
It 's just a snapshot :
At a steady 80 km/h ( about 50 mph ) I was getting 59 mpg ( US ) ( there was a tail wind )
" gliding " down from 90 to 70 km/h took 16 seconds
" pulsing " back up from 70 to 90 km/h at a rate of acceleration that also took 16 seconds I was getting about 34 mpg ( US )
So my pulse and glide average would be 68 mpg , vs. 59 at the same average speed .
That 's a 15 % increase over the steady state mpg - theoretically .
I say theoretically because the engine would have to be off in the glide to get that mileage .
You could do it , but it adds another step in an already arguably impractical process ( remember the engine shuts off automatically in the Prius when you lift off the accelerator ) .
So I took a couple more readings .
With the engine idling , and the car in neutral , the average mpg shown on the ScanGauge in the glide down from 90 - 70 km/h was 550 mpg .
When you average that against the 34 mpg of the pulse , it works out to an average of 64 mpg .
Now we 're at an 8 % increase over the steady - state mpg .
I would name the difference between the two techniques " full " pulse & glide ( neutral , with engine off in the glide ) vs. " mild " ( neutral , with engine idling in the glide ) .
So , now you know the next time you find yourself cruising down a lonely road at a steady speed , you 're not getting the best mileage you could .
You could be pulsing & gliding to maintain the same average speed , and saving lots of fuel in the process .
To exceed your steady - state mpg ( X ) , you just have to be able to " pulse " at a rate of fuel consumption that is greater than half of X ( assuming equal length pulses & glides ; you may be able to increase the proportion of glide to pulse - meaning faster acceleration in the pulse , or glides that are timed to take advantage of descending a grade - and still beat your steady - state mpg for that average speed ) .
You can see how fuel economy instrumentation plays a critical role in determining the best rate of pulse to make this work .
The Pulse & Glide Workout !
But it 's not really very practical , is it ?
When I said off the top that there 's nothing special about hybrid technology that makes this work , that 's only true in theory .
In practical terms , the Prius enables this technique because all of its individual steps are performed through a single control - the throttle pedal .
Contrast that to my manual shift Firefly : in order to duplicate the behaviour of the Prius requires 6 discrete steps using 3 of my limbs ... every 16 seconds .
Glide : release accelerator , clutch in , key off , pause ... key on .
Pulse : pop clutch to restart engine , depress accelerator .
That 's quite a workout , compared to 2 steps in the Toyota accomplished entirely with the right foot : glide - release accelerator ; pulse - depress accelerator .
Practical implications
What useful information comes from this for the non -hybrid driver ?
( Okay , the first one is hybrid related ... )
Toyota ultra -efficient cruise control !
The Prius could potentially have a " pulse and glide " cruise control setting to completely automate the cycle .
Set your target speed , and the car pulses & glides around it .
For me , the technique simply underlines the importance of maximizing the amount of " glide " ( whether engine on or off ) in my driving .
In other words , time spent in neutral , or with the clutch depressed .
For example , when approaching a stop or a forced speed reduction , rather than maintaining a constant speed as I approach , I now try to execute the optimal pulse that permits me to coast half the distance ( or more ) with as little braking as possible .
It causes you to carefully consider the comparitive efficiencies of different ways of accelerating or decelerating .
E.G. deceleration efficiency , from best to worst in a non -hybrid ( standard liability statement applies - do n't do this if it puts you or others at risk ) : ( 1 ) engine off , in neutral ( or clutch in ) ; ( 2 ) engine idling , in neutral ; ( 3 ) engine running , in gear ( it 's true that some cars ' fuel injectors shut off when decelerating in gear above a certain engine RPM threshold , but the savings in fuel is cancelled by the faster rate of deceleration from engine braking .
Relative to coasting in neutral , it 's less efficient . ) ; ( 4 ) braking ( assumes engine also running , in gear ) .
The pulse & glide downside : it stands to reason that the technique is somewhat harder on the machinery ( in terms of wear ) than simply maintaining a steady speed .
This is even more true in " full " pulse & glide mode , if you are repeatedly using the starter to re-start the engine .
For that reason alone I 'd be reluctant to use it to boost " steady state " ( e.g. hwy ) mileage .
Its benefits are more practically realized in situations where you have to accelerate and decelerate on a regular basis anyway ( e.g. sub /urban driving ) .

An 18 - month BBC investigation for Panorama has found evidence that :
- Pakistani peacekeepers in the eastern town of Mongbwalu were involved in the illegal trade in gold with the FNI militia ( described by Human Rights Watch as " some of the most murderous individuals that operate in eastern Congo " ) , providing them with weapons to guard the perimeter of the mines .
- The Indians traded gold , bought drugs from the militias and flew a UN helicopter into the Virunga National Park , where they exchanged ammunition for ivory .
A UN investigation concluded that one officer had been responsible for dealing in gold - allowing traders to use UN aircraft to fly into the town , putting them up at the UN base and taking them around the town .
But the UN decided that " in the absence of corroborative evidence " its investigators " could not substantiate the allegation " that Pakistani peacekeepers supplied weapons or ammunition to the militia .
It did , however , identify " an individual who seemed to have facilitated gold smuggling " .
The BBC allegations were confirmed by militia leaders .
UN insiders close to the investigation told the BBC they had been prevented from pursuing their inquiries for political reasons .

My comments :
This is despicable and a slap in the face of those UN humanitarians who do try to make a difference .
It is not the first time the UN peacekeeping ( UNDPKO ) troops have been discredited by scandals ( see the post Sometimes I am ashamed to work for the UN ) .
A lack of consequent leadership in UNDPKO , a lack of accountability , direct and clear lines of command , proper supervision , proper screening of the troops , justice for those offending the rules , transparent and public auditing ... and above all a lack of political will to structurally make a change to avoid similar scandals from happening again and again .

On Meet the Press this morning , NBC's Chuck Todd got honest and told us what we already know , but what the media rarely likes to confess .
McCain has a lot in the bank with the media and they will help him out of his problems .
You 're all aware of McCain 's linking al - Qaeda to Iran all last week --- which is not happening because of the Sunni / Shia difference .
He had to get bailed out by his Lieberman posse and his FOX friend Britt Hume , but the real story given to us by Chuck Todd is that the media would have attacked either of the two Democratic nominees for days on end over the same gaffe .
Download Download ( h/t Heather )
Todd :
He 's got enough of that in the bank , at least with the media , that he can get away with it .
I mean , the irony to this is had either Senator Clinton or Senator Obama misspoke like that , it'd have been on a running loop , and it would become a , a big problem for a couple of days for them .
He 's got enough in the bank so he can get away with it , but the Dems need to have fear of the media 's running loop .
Here you have it folks .
When McCain makes a HUGE blunder on the one issue he tells America he 's qualified to run on : foreign policy , the media shrugs it off , but if a Democratic candidate had made the same mistake it would have been headlines for days .
You could assume that Lieberman would then have been booked on teevee 24/7 --- yelling into the cameras that they are incompetents on the very serious issue of foreign policy instead of whispering sweet answers in McCain 's ear to correct him .
Get used to this treatment from the media .
It 's sickening ...
MR. RUSSERT : And then , then Lindsey Graham , who he was with , and then Joe Lieberman both tried to say to him , al - Qaeda is Sunni , not trained by the Shiite Iranian government .
Does that kind of stumble hurt a McCain candidacy ?
MR . TODD : Well , what 's odd about the , the stumble is that it -- is it a stumble or was it , or was it that this talking point that he'd been , that he'd been using for actually a couple weeks or over a week , where he was talking about sort of almost blurring that the , the enemy of al - Qaeda and the enemy of the , the Shia - trained Iranians and sort of blurring them as one enemy .
And the , the question is , did he just sort of -- he truncated it to the point where he ended up misspeaking .
The , the problem , of course , McCain has is that he can't , you know , he does n't want to make it so that he , he forgot it for a minute .
You know , he 's -- because of the age issue , he can't ever look like he 's having a senior moment .
So instead , he 's better off going ahead and saying , you know , OK , so he misspoke .
Even if he gets dinged on the experience stuff , " Oh , he says he 's Mr. Experience .
Does n't he know the difference between this stuff ? "
He 's got enough of that in the bank , at least with the media , that he can get away with it .
I mean , the irony to this is had either Senator Clinton or Senator Obama misspoke like that , it'd have been on a running loop , and it would become a , a big problem for a couple of days for them .
Earth , not space , is the final frontier of “ Battlestar Galactica . ”
The galaxy - wandering survivors of an apocalyptic attack begin the fourth and last season of this Sci Fi Channel wunderseries where they left off : with the faint but improbable hope that one of them has found the lost , mythical home planet .
Whether anyone should believe Kara Thrace , a k a Starbuck , the swashbuckling fighter pilot who was thought to be dead for two months and cannot account for her lost time or prove her claim , is only one of many mysteries confounding the crew of the Galactica .
Another is her latest sleeping arrangements : Kara ( played by Katee Sackhoff ) has a husband and a lover ( two , if one counts the amorous Cylon who held her captive on the robot - occupied settlement New Caprica ) .
“ Battlestar Galactica , ” which begins on Friday , is a space opera , a high - minded space odyssey with more than a touch of the daytime soaps .
It is critically acclaimed and widely respected , but the science - fiction show ’s fiercely dedicated cult following has become something of a mass - culture joke : the two lonely mathematicians on the CBS sitcom “ The Big Bang Theory ” decline lunch with a pretty girl so they can view the commentary on the DVD of Season 2 .
And that is a disservice because “ Battlestar Galactica ” is one of the more beguiling series on television , an action - adventure drama that travels through time and space to explore morality , politics and metaphysics .
Science fiction often serves as a modesty curtain that permits authors to think big thoughts at a safe remove  special effects and laser make - believe palliate abstract musings and pompous parables that might otherwise bore or offend viewers .
( Without phasers and Vulcan death grips , the moralizing streak in the original “ Star Trek ” would have been insufferable . )
Most Americans do not even think about getting information from alternative news sources
The US most popular TV channel Fox News has been beaten by CNN for the first time during the last seven years .
Preferences of US citizens were affected by the media reporting of the election campaign and the country ’s foreign policy .
Twelve million TV viewers preferred the ‘ objective ’ CNN to Fox News that justifies George Bush ’s policy .
Most Americans do not even think about getting information from alternative news sources
In April 2008 the CNN audience counted 62 million people , while Fox News had only 50 million TV viewers , Handelsblatt reports .
According to US media experts , the reason for this change is the information policy run by the competing TV channels .
“ CNN has beaten all the TV channels by the quality of its programs concerning the elections , ” said Joe Cuthbert , a professor of the Department of Journalism of the Columbia University in the City of New York .
Fox News , a part of Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corporation , engaged in one - sided advocacy of the stance of the current US administration , instead of providing all - round objective reports of election campaigns .
Economists proved that George Bush would have never won the 2000 election but for the support from Fox News .
The TV channel definitely backs up right - wing Republicans , Cuthbert considers .
“ Fox is rather the advocate of Bush ’s government than a news TV channel .
Now the political ship is sinking , and so is Fox . ”
Jonathan Mann who has been working for CNN for 20 years remembers that “ CNN used to be a tiny company with a small budget and minimum possibilities . ”
Now the moderator is 47 years old , but he started as a European correspondent in Paris , and did reports on the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe .
“ At that time we first tried to work in a new way – to broadcast news day and night . ”
Naturally , some companies followed that example and later turned into our serious rivals : Fox News and MSNBC in the USA , as well as BBC World , Sky News , N - TV , N24 and other channels in Europe .
Today in India alone there are over 25 news channels .
“ CNN sells a certain product – this product is called information , ” Jonathan Mann said .
In late 1990s CNN reduced the amount of political news and started doing more talk shows .
As a result , from 2000 to 2003 the corporation lost a part of its audience and profits .
The parent company Time Warner thought about the merger of CNN and TV giant ABC or a possible sale of CNN .
The New York Times wrote several articles at that time about “ the identity crisis ” at CNN .
“ Rivals ’ attempts to imitate each other testify to unhealthy situation , ” said professor Cuthbert .
“ Healthy competition means that rivals oppose and differ from each other . ”
Finally , the CNN management came back to the things the channel has always been good at .
“ It is news combined with innovations and the latest technologies , ” said David Boreman , the head of the CNN politics department .
Success came fast .
Although Time Warner does not publicize CNN financial indexes , profits of the legendary channel increased by 20 percent since 2004 , The New York Times said .

After the National Intelligence Estimate last November which reported that Iran had no nuclear program since 2003 , many of us breathed a sigh of relief .
It was official : When it came to attacking Iran , the administration had n't a leg to stand on .
But , as with Iraq , it was used to that .
Once anointed lame duck , it did n't skip a beat and continued to stumble forward .
In a recent post at his blog " Early Warning , " Washington Post security analyst William Arkin writes : " Those predicting war with Iran or some Bush - Cheney October surprise attack on Tehran are constantly looking for signs of military preparations . "
He cites the unauthorized transfer of nuclear warheads from Minot to Barksdale Air Force bases , extra aircraft carriers sent to the Persian Gulf , and the B - 1 that crashed in Qatar last month .
Then Arkin recalls a secret mission conducted last August over Afghanistan .
He claims it " tells us everything we need to know about the ability of the U.S. military to conduct a bolt - out - of - the - blue attack in Iran . "
It seems that four F - 16CJ fighters completed a mission that won the prestigious Mackay Trophy for the " most meritorious " Air Force fight of the year .
They flew from Iraq to Eastern Afghanistan , where they dropping more than a dozen " precision - guided " bombs on Taliban targets .
It " was the equivalent of flying from New York to Los Angeles and back , " Arkin explains .
In other words , like a 10 - K runner logging a hundred miles a week , they might have been training for a strike on Iran , which is just the next country over from Iraq .
Meanwhile , on May 2 , Andrew Cockburn ( author of a new book , " Muqtada , " called " required reading " in the New York Times Sunday Book Review today ) reported on Counterpunch that , six weeks before , President Bush signed a secret directive authorizing a covert offensive against Iran .
Supposedly , it surpasses in scope anything attempted before .
Assuming , that is , that you do n't count the CIA 's work to destabilize Iran 's democratically elected prime minister , Mohammad Mossadegh's , in 1953 .
The directive , Cockburn writes , funds ( to the tune of $ 300 million ) , " actions across a huge geographic area –- from Lebanon to Afghanistan -– but is also far more sweeping in the type of actions permitted .
. . including the assassination of targeted officials . "
Presumably by the terrorist MEK , the Iranian anti-Islamic Republic group that , despite its designation as a terrorist group by the State Department , we 're only too glad to make use of .
But , on his blog , Pen and Sword , outspoken Military.com columnist Ken Huber calls Cockburn 's Counterpunch piece " counterproductive . "
" Cockburn seems to want us to get excited that this Lebanon - to - Afghanistan offensive may involve assassination , " he writes .
But " we 're already assassinating people in Somalia with freaking cruise missiles .
We 're doing the same thing in Pakistan with Hellfire missiles fired from pilotless spy planes ; the folks who pickle off the missiles are dweebs sitting at consoles in an Air Force base in Nevada . "
Pickle off , indeed .
Huber concludes : " The door to this barn has been open for a long , long time .
That the horses are gone should n't be news to anybody . "
However , the threat has since been kicked into a higher gear by respected security analyst Philip Giraldi , who was a former CIA officer and is now foreign policy advisor to the Ron Paul campaign .
In his latest blog at the American Conservative , " War With Iran Might Be Closer Than You Think , " he writes : " There is considerable speculation and buzz in Washington today suggesting that the National Security Council has agreed in principle to proceed with plans to attack an Iranian al - Qods - run camp [ near Tehran ] that is believed to be training Iraqi militants . "
" Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , " he adds , " was the only senior official urging delay .
. . .
[ The decision ] is the direct result of concerns [ over ] the deteriorating situation in Lebanon , where Iranian ally Hezbollah appears to have gained the upper hand against government forces . "
After contacting Iran and reading them the riot act , the White House decided that " some sort of unambiguous signal has to be sent to the Iranian leadership , presumably in the form of cruise missiles . "
Unambiguous , thy name is cruise missile .
Of course , President Bush " will still have to give the order to launch after all preparations are made . "
PBS has been running a series titled Carrier , about life aboard the USS Nimitz .
Imagine Iran retaliating to an air strike by blowing a mega - tub like this , along with its crew of over 5,000 mostly young people , out of the water ?
Iran 's state - of - the - art Shahab - 3 missiles are able to reach parts of the Arabian Sea and even the Mediterranean .
In other words , not only is the Persian Gulf , but total war , a hop , skip and a jump away .

He is a rescue , and sincewe do n’t knowhis actual birthday , we celebrate the day we adopted him … two years ago today .
He ’s been a bit of a problem pooch as he has some slight behavior issues …
Irefer to him as five pounds of raw aggression .
However , once he gets to know you , this little guy doles out big buckets o’ love .
That ’s how he got the nickname Bucky , but he also answers to Rocky and Stinkster .
Thisisnot just a boring cake , but a savory one flavored with pureed chicken and … yes … that ’s real bacon lining the sides .
Carrots add sweetness and a nice fleck of color .
The frosting is simply yogurt andcottage cheese pureed with a dab of swiss cheese ( for extra stinky factor ) and cake crumbs to make it stiff enough to be spreadable .
The candles were Pupperonis cut in half .
Good stuff .
I ’d almost eat it … ehhhh almost .
All Natural Ingredients list : Vegetable oil , eggs , chicken , flour , baking powder , carrots , low - sodium bacon , cottage cheese , yogurt , swiss cheese .
Before they got to eat the cake , the dogs had already worked themselves into a lather … its not often we have real bacon at home .
I kept thinking of that obnoxious commercial fordog treatswhere the dog isyelling bacon , BACON , BACON !!!!
The poor dogswere practically drooling with anticipation before I let them eat the cake .
They both got a teensy slice of cake which theyate with a vengeance .
Also , a quick plug for Petfinder.com , where we found Rocky .
I ’m a big advocate of pet rescue and have rescued both of my dogs .
If you ’re looking for a fourlegged additionto your family , please considerrescuing an animal before going to a pet store .
There are so many loving pets out there that need homes !
Researchers have successfully identified over 5,000 proteins that are present in embryonic stem cells , tripling the size of previous results and in the process creating the largest quantified protein map to date .
Stem cells hold great potential in biology and medicine , but a host of questions lingers about how they operate and convert into other cells .
To help answer these questions , researchers have begun taking a ' big picture ' approach , identifying all the proteins that are expressed in stem cells .
Currently , around 1700 proteins have been identified in stem cells .
Now , using mass spectrometry and special " heavy " amino acids ( made with carbon - 13 ) , Matthias Mann and colleagues quantified 5111 distinct mouse stem cell proteins .
As expected , a good portion of these proteins are involved in rapid cell growth , but overall the proteome encompassed a broad range of cell functions .
While this study may help uncover new clues to stem cell biology , it does raise the bar on the complexity of these important cells , considering they express at least 25 % of all known mouse proteins .

On People , the Death of Privacy , and Data Pollution
The following is an excerpt from an interview with Bruce Schneier .
Matt Pasiewicz , EDUCAUSE content program manager , conducted the interview at the EDUCAUSE 2007 Annual Conference .
Full podcast
MP : Bruce , perhaps you can get us started by sharing some of your thoughts about the psychology and economics of security .
Schneier : Security is a lot more about people than technology .
One thing I ’ve learned from studying economics , the psychology of risk , security , and people is that those problems are actually way harder than the tech problems .
We have as much technology as we need , but securing the people end is hard .
I ’m doing a lot of research in psychology right now .
People are very complex : they ’re not linear and rational , and they ’re not computers at all .
We try to think of them as logical and rational , and that ’s just not true .
People have internal contradictions ….
No matter how good the tech is , if we do n’t solve the human end , it ’s just not going to work .
MP : What can we do to educate ourselves and our users when the experiences often are n’t as contiguous as those events that we seem to learn from most quickly ?
Schneier :
The answer is , really , nothing .
There ’s nothing we can do to educate users , and anyone who has met an actual user knows that .
Users are going to pick up their knowledge from their experiences .
You can try to teach them stuff explicitly , but it ’s not going to stick in the same way that experiences do , and unfortunately , the experiences often do n’t match our reality , whether it ’s an experience of fear , an experience of an attack , or an experience of no attacks .
Rather than focus on what can we do to educate users , we need to focus on building security that does n’t require educated users .
That will be much more resilient , because while there are some educated users , there are a lot of noneducated users … .
For example , my mother is never going to be a security maven — not because she ’s stupid but because it ’s not her area of expertise .
And we ca n’t expect it to be .
If I say , “ Look , Mom , you did n’t know enough to do this and that , and you deserve to get hacked , ” I think that ’s blaming the victim … .
MP : In 2006 , you wrote a Wired article titled “ The Eternal Value of Privacy . ”
To what extent do you project that the problem of privacy will get worse over the coming years ?
In an era of mash - ups , widgets , and service - oriented architectures , should we pause before embracing the new forms of innovation , or should we believe Scott McNeely , who reportedly said in 1999 : “ Privacy is dead ; get over it ” ?
Schneier :
The death of privacy has been predicted forever ….
Simson Garfinkel wrote a book .
Robert O’Harrow wrote a book .
David Brin wrote The Transparent Society .
You can go back to 1969 and a book by Jerry Rosenberg : The Death of Privacy .
We ’ve been saying this for generations , but it turns out it ’s not necessarily true .
Technology might limit privacy , but just because cameras have been invented , that does n’t mean naked pictures of you appear everywhere .
We are a nation of laws , and laws protect us in places that technology does n’t .
Certainly technology is moving away from privacy .
Your cell phone knows where you are at all times .
That ’s how it delivers phone calls .
It also knows who you call , and it knows your text messages .
More data is collected every day : your credit card , all of the cameras that are out there , automatic fare collections , anything you do on the Internet .
So there is this inherent lack of privacy .
But what happens to that data ?
Who is allowed access to it , how it is stored , how it is deleted — this is all a matter of laws .
So where technology does n’t protect us , laws have to .
MP : Do you foresee a pendulum swing over the coming decades , or are we going to continuously encroach on privacy as we know it today ?
Schneier : I think it is going back and forth .
We ’re living in an era right now in which , in some misguided attempt to make us safe from terrorism , we are putting ourselves at risk to all sorts of other things .
There is this massive loss of privacy that ’s happening everywhere .
That ’s going to change .
That ’s not going to make us safer from terrorism , and it ’s going to cause lots of other risks .
Eventually , maybe in ten or twenty years , we ’re going to have comprehensive data - privacy laws in this country and in most other countries .
I take solace in a quote by Martin Luther King Jr. : “ The arc of history is long , but it bends toward justice . ”
Things happen slowly , but they are getting better .
One hundred years ago , half of us could n’t vote .
Two hundred years ago , some of us were slaves .
Things do get better .
They get better slowly .
MP : At DEFCON 15 in August 2007 , you noted that data is the pollution of the information age .
Can you elaborate on that ?
Schneier :
That ’s a good metaphor .
Data is the pollution problem in the information age in the same way that pollution was the pollution problem in the industrial age .
All processes today produce data .
Every computer process produces data .
Data stays around .
Data festers , and how we deal with it — how we recycle it , reuse it , dispose of it , what the regulations are concerning it — is central to the information age .
Just as in the industrial age , we ’re largely ignoring the problem in a rush to get new technology , and twenty , thirty , fifty years from now we ’re going to be cleaning up massive data problems — just like we ’re cleaning up massive pollution problems today .
There is a notion of data decay , and some people have written about the fact that computers should be programmed to forget things , that remembering stuff forever is not necessarily good .
That ’s a very complex , really philosophical issue , and there is no time to go into it now , but it is well worth thinking about … .
There are some really good thinkers thinking about what it means to live in a society where people never forget .
This is the first time in the history of our civilization that we ’ve had that possibility .
Is that a good thing or not ?
I do n’t know .
MP : Many CIOs and ISOs are struggling with how to measure the success of their security programs .
Are there metrics or methods that you recommend for demonstrating success to upper management ?
Schneier :
This is hard .
The hard part about demonstrating success is the lack of data , so one of two things happens .
You have a good security program , and you do n’t get hacked .
Is that because you have a good security program or because there ’s no risk ?
How do you prove one and not the other ?
It ’s very hard without data .
On the streets , it ’s easy : you can go to your police department , or your newspaper , and get the crime statistics for the neighborhood you live in .
You know exactly how safe you are .
You ca n’t do that on the net .
We just do n’t have that data , so it ’s very hard to demonstrate the success of a security program .
It ’s even worse when you ’re dealing with rare events .
If you have an event that happens very , very rarely , did you prevent it , or did it just not happen ?
We have this problem in our country with terrorism .
It is a very rare event , and we do some really ridiculous things to try to prevent terrorism , but it ’s hard to prove whether these things were effective , because there ’s no data .
MP : Are there any ethical boundaries that we need to start thinking about in relationship to security , privacy , and the professionals who occupy security and privacy positions ?
Schneier : I tend not to rely on ethics .
Ethics involve social norms .
I like to see economic incentives .
I think they work better than social norms .
Social norms do work .
There is less bicycle theft in Japan because people do n’t steal your bicycles , so you do n’t need as good a lock in Japan as you do in the United States .
That ’s entirely a social norm providing security , and you see a lot of that in IT .
But if you can get an economic incentive , I think you ’re doing better .
MP : If you could make one call to action for security professionals in higher education , what would it be ?
Schneier :
To think of your networks dynamically .
We ’re living in a world where things change all the time , and in universities , things change faster — not just because each year you have a new student body that is doing the new things that they ’ve discovered no one else does , but also because you have , on the other side , the research professors who are doing the new things that have n’t been talked about yet .
There are a lot of dangers in that , and a lot of additional risks , but there are also a lot of opportunities for you to see solutions and ideas that might not come to the rest of us until a year or two later .
So I want people to talk .
I want people to write .
I think the experiences in academia are things that the rest of us can really make use of .
The more I read about your experiences , the better I am .

Former CIA official indicted anew in bribery case Associated Press
Published : Wednesday May 21 , 2008

Print This Email This By MATTHEW BARAKAT WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
A new indictment of a former top CIA official alleges that he received bribes in the form of " sexual companionship " in exchange for helping a friend get an edge in landing multimillion - dollar contracts from the agency .
Federal prosecutors in Alexandria , Va. , on Tuesday obtained a superseding indictment against Kyle " Dusty " Foggo , who as executive director held the CIA 's No. 3 rank before leaving in 2006 .
The indictment accuses Foggo of accepting tens of thousands of dollars in meals , vacations and other perks in exchange for helping friend Brent Wilkes obtain various contracts with the CIA .
The new indictment also includes an allegation that Foggo received sexual companionship and " enrichment of a mistress , " though the allegations are not detailed in the indictment .
Calls and an e-mail sent to Foggo 's lawyers were not immediately returned Tuesday .
The sexual companionship allegation may be new to the formal charges against Foggo , but they are a familiar part of the case as a whole .
Wilkes has already pleaded guilty to paying bribes to then - Rep. Randy " Duke " Cunningham , R - Calif. , some of which came in the form of prostitutes .
The superseding indictment also adds new counts of making false statements and conflict of interest against Foggo .
Specifically , the indictment accuses him of failing to disclose the various gifts he received from Wilkes on his federal financial disclosure form .
The conflict of interest charges allege , among other things , that Foggo tried to steer to Wilkes a contract worth more than $ 100 million to provide air support to the CIA , even as Foggo stood to benefit financially .
Generally , though , the new indictment spells out many of the same allegations made previously ; prosecutors had said earlier this year that the new indictment would not contain any major surprises for the defense .
CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said Tuesday that " the CIA has cooperated closely with the investigating agencies and the Department of Justice .
That cooperation continues today . "
A hearing is scheduled for Thursday .
Iraq , where women once had more rights and freedom than most others in the Arab world , has turned deadly for women who dream of education and a professional career .
Former dictator Saddam Hussein maintained a relatively secular society , where it was common for women to take up jobs as professors , doctors and government officials .
In today ’s Iraq , women are being killed by militia groups for not conforming to strict Islamist ways .
Basra police chief Gen. Jalil Hannoon told reporters and Arab TV channels in December that at least 40 women had been killed during the previous five months in that city alone .
" We are sure there are many more victims whose families did not report their killing for fear of scandal , " Gen. Hannoon said .
The militias dominated by the Shi’ite Badr Organization and the Mahdi Army are leading imposition of strict Islamist rules .
The Shi’ite - dominated Iraqi government is seen as providing tacit and sometimes direct support to them .
The Badr Organization answers to the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council ( SIIC ) , the Shi’ite bloc in the Iraqi government .
The Mahdi army is the militia of anti-occupation Shi’ite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr .
Women who do not wear the hijab are becoming prime targets of militias , residents both in Basra and Baghdad have told IPS in recent months .
Many women say they are threatened with death if they do not obey .
" Militiamen approached us to tell us we must wear the hijab and stop wearing make - up , " college student Zahra Alwan who fled Basra to Baghdad told IPS last December .
Graffiti in red on walls across Basra warns women against wearing make - up and stepping out without covering their bodies from head to toe , Alwan said .
" The situation in Baghdad is not very different , " Mazin Abdul Jabbar , social researcher at Baghdad University told IPS .
" All universities are controlled by Islamic militiamen who harass female students all the time with religious restrictions . "
Jabbar said this is one reason that " many families have stopped sending their daughters to high schools and colleges . "
In early 2007 Iraq ’s Ministry of Education found that more than 70 percent of girls and young women no longer attend school or college .
Several women victims have been accused of being " bad " before they were abducted , residents have told IPS in Baghdad .
Most women who are abducted are later found dead .
The bodies of several have been found in garbage dumps , showing signs of rape and torture .
Many bodies had a note attached saying the woman was " bad , " according to residents who did not give their names to IPS .
Similar problems exist for women in Baquba , the capital city of Diyala province , 40 km northeast of Baghdad .
" My neighbor was killed because she was accused of working in the directorate - general of police of Diyala , " resident Um Haider told IPS in January .
" This woman worked as a receptionist in the governor ’s office , and not in the police .
She was in charge of checking women who work in the governor ’s office . "
Killings like this have led countless women to quit jobs , or to change them .
" I was head of the personnel division in an office , " a woman speaking on condition of anonymity told IPS in Baquba .
" On the insistence of my family and relatives , I gave up my position and chose to be an employee . "
Women ’s lives have changed , and women are beginning to look different across most of Iraq .
They are now too afraid to wear anything but conservative dresses  modern clothes could be a death warrant .
The veil is particularly dominant in areas under the control of militias .
Women are paying a price for the occupation in all sorts of ways .
" Women bear great pain and risks when militants control the streets , " Um Basim , a mother of three , told IPS in Baquba recently .
" No woman can move here or there .
When a man is killed , the body is taken to the morgue .
The body has to be received by the family , so women often go alone to the morgue to escort the body home .
Some are targeted by militants when they do this . "
Confined to home , many women live in isolation and depression .
" Women have nowhere to go to spend leisure time , " Um Ali , a married woman in Baquba , told IPS .
" Our time is spent only at home now .
I have not traveled outside Baquba for more than four years .
The only place I can go to is my parents ’ home .
Housekeeping and children have been all my life ; I have no goals to attain , no education to complete .
Sometimes , I ca n’t leave home for weeks . "
In northern Kurdish controlled Iraq , " honor killings " continue .
In the ancient tradition of " honor killing , " the view is that a family ’s " honor " is paramount .
As of last December , at least 27 Kurdish women were murdered on suspicion of having had " illicit " affairs in the previous four months , according to Youssif Mohamed Aziz , the regional minister of human rights .
Iraqi women are not spared US military prisons either .
In December , Iraq ’s parliamentary committee for women ’s and children ’s affairs demanded the release of female detainees in Iraqi and US - run prisons .
According to Nadira Habib , deputy head of the parliamentary committee , there are around 200 women detained in the Iraqi run al - Adala prison in Baghdad .
Habibi says there are presumably women in US - run prisons too .
" But no one knows how many female detainees are now in prisons run by US forces as they always refuse requests from our committee to visit them . "
As the central government remains essentially powerless , and religious fundamentalism continues to grow across Iraq , it appears that the plight of Iraqi women will get worse .

Protest songs comforted Tomas
Young when he was paralyzed from an injury sustained in the Iraq war .
| Courtesy Anti-war songs fall flat
“ Yo George , ” sneers Tori Amos , outrage flowing from her lyrics .
“ Is this just the madness of King George ? ”
“ Yo George , ” follows the next verse .
“ Well you have the whole nation on all fours . ”

Amos ’ bitter indictment of President Bush in “ Yo George ” is a clear sign of the times .
But so is the fact that , if you are not part of the songwriter - pianist ’s loyal cadre of fans , you probably have never heard the song .
An unpopular president , an unpopular war , a restless young generation eager for change — all the elements of a mass protest culture would seem to be present in this election year .
But one thing is missing : a mass culture .
The Vietnam era produced an entire genre of anti-war and cultural protest songs , the best - known of which became anthems of the age .
Iraq and the Bush presidency have inspired lots of music in this tradition , but nothing that has gained a large popular audience or is vying to be a generational anthem .
Music , say some sociologists , is just one manifestation of a more fundamental trend .
Opposition to the Iraq war , which commands strong majorities in the polls , has not produced mass marches on the Pentagon or shut down college campuses .
The reasons are varied , including the lack of a military draft and much lower casualty figures than were suffered in Southeast Asia 40 years ago .
But another big factor is the fragmented nature of how Americans live and communicate — with no clearer example than how we listen to music .
The trend was highlighted this month when Warner Music ’s Sire Records issued a 30 - song soundtrack for the anti-war documentary “ Body of War , ” the release timed for the fifth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq .
The album includes musical heavyweights like Bruce Springsteen , Eddie Vedder and 62 - year - old Neil Young , who has contributed to the anti-war songbook for both Vietnam and Iraq .
Despite the project ’s star power and its appeal to multiple generations , its format — the concept album — has , for the most part , been left for dead .
People today download their favorite songs from multiple albums at a time , unlike in the '60s , when an iPod would have looked like something from the set of " Star Trek . "
Back then , says Robert Thompson , founder of the Institute on Popular Culture at Syracuse University , protest music was inescapable .
“ Those songs , whether you were listening to them in your dorm room or whether parents were upset that their kids were listening to them in the basement , you were hearing them , ” Thompson said .
“ Those songs were the soundtrack of that period .
They were in the air literally , and people had to come to grips with them . ”
In today ’s culture , Thompson added , music consumption tends to take place in a narrow channel .
“ Now it ’s completely possible for songs that are getting huge distribution one way or another amidst their core fan base to remain completely unnoticed to a fully intelligent and aware American , ” Thompson said .
“ Back in the pre-digital , network era , we all fed from the same culture trough , whether you liked it or not . ”
The biggest reason why today ’s protest music is failing to echo broadly , some cultural critics believe , is not just a shortened attention span on the part of music fans , but the move to an all - volunteer military .
Compulsory military service during Vietnam meant millions more families felt they had a stake in the debate .
“ If you ’re at risk of going to a foreign country and getting your head blown off , then you take a very personal interest in what ’s going on around you , ” said David Fricke , senior editor at Rolling Stone .
“ Let ’s face it , people are distracted , they are distracted by reality shows , none of which have anything to do with reality , ” Fricke added .
“ They spend more time watching ' American Idol ' than they [ did ] voting in the last couple of elections . ”
Without a draft , it ’s easy for the public to lose sight of the war , especially when the media and presidential candidates turn their focus to the economy and other issues .
The mission of rock activists against the war , then , becomes part of the subculture straining to reach the masses .
“ Just because we ’re not hearing as much about [ Iraq ] in the first 10 minutes of every news broadcast does n’t mean that antipathy and that feeling of protest against the war has gone away , ” Thompson said .
“ A lot of people out there still feel as strongly as they did before . ”
For the activist group Iraq Veterans Against the War ( IVAW ) , which will be receiving the proceeds of the “ Body of War ” album sales , the disconnect between mass culture and the war is particularly frustrating .
Tomas Young , who enlisted in the Army two days after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , had been in Iraq for less than a year in April 2004 when a bullet severed his spine and left him paralyzed .
He later joined IVAW .
It was the degree to which protest songs helped him deal with his rehabilitation and constant frustration that inspired the album ’s title “ Body of War : Songs That Inspired an Iraq War Veteran . ”
“ These songs are not flower - and - hugs protest music , ” Young said .
“ It ’s meant to incite anger and frustration in the listener that they need to make change . ”
Along with Tomas Young , musicians featured on the “ Body of War ” soundtrack are confident that they still play a significant role in American culture .
“ Body of War ” contributor Tom Morello , a lead guitarist for the mainstream rock bands Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave , thinks that politically inspired music can still inspire action .
“ It was certainly the mixture of music and politics in groups like The Clash and Public Enemy that helped spur me into becoming an activist and helped me feel less alone in my ideas and convictions that ran very contrary to the ideas and convictions that I heard espoused on the nightly news , ” Morello said .
“ This ‘ Body of War ’ project is one more link in that chain of rebel music that serves on the one hand to fan the flames of discontent [ and ] , on the other hand , provide a feeling of solidarity among those who think this is an awful and immoral war that we really want to do something about . ”
Morello ’s generation of activist - musicians differs from that of the Vietnam War era in another important way other than album sales .
Whether it reflects a struggle to be heard , or simply a different stylistic approach , today ’s brand of anti-war music is unmistakably direct and biting when compared to most of the songs of Bob Dylan and his contemporaries , which tended to take their power from metaphor and allusion rather than engaging by name with the headlines and public personalities of the day .
One of the tracks on “ Body of War ” is entitled “ Son of Bush , ” by Public Enemy .
Another song on the album , by Talib Kweli and Cornel West , is called “ Bushonomics . ”
“ [ I ]t ’s important to sort of , to balance a more obvious statement with something that is more shadowy and metaphorical , ” Morello said .
“ I love the music of Bob Dylan , but , frankly , he was afraid of being a topical songwriter . …
He was afraid to take it to the next level . ”
Indeed , Morello leaves little to the imagination about the intentions of his craft and believes activism , not political practice and endorsement , is the key to change .
Despite “ the eerie similarities ” between him and Barack Obama — both men have Kenyan fathers and were educated at Harvard and lived in Chicago — Morello has n’t endorsed a presidential candidate .
“ How change happens is people whose name you do n’t read about in the history books organizing , struggling , standing up and fighting for their rights where they live , where they work and go to school , ” he said .
“ It does n’t happen because one of several super - rich candidates gets in and feigns to go against their corporate backings for a brief minute so we have a respite from the nonstop drum roll of corporatism and war .
It happens because of heroic acts like Tomas Young . ”
For his part , Young is hopeful that people will start paying attention .
“ My hope [ is ] that people wo n’t hop on iTunes and cherry - pick songs for 99 cents apiece .
I hope people will buy the whole album . ”
Ieri per me era fondamentalmente San Marco , Santo Patrono di Venezia , e come ogni buon veneziano ( benchè de téra , di terra ) ho regalato alla mia bella il " bòcolo " , un bocciolo di rosa .
Ma il 25 aprile é anche il giorno dedicato alla festa della Liberazione ed all 'attesissimo V - 2 Day di Beppe Grillo , spesso sovrapposti e messi in competizione tra loro , anche al fine di alimentare polemiche competizioni tra la sacralità del primo evento e la dissacrazione intrinseca del secondo .
Fingiamo che la scelta della data del V - 2 Day sia stata una coincidenza , per tagliare la testa al toro , anche perchè sono ben altri gli aspetti ai quali voglio dedicare attenzione .
Il giorno dopo la manifestazione di Torino i due principali quotidiani nazionali , Corriere e Repubblica , commentano gli eventi da osservatori ciechi ed ottusi , confermando la bontà delle ragioni di Grillo .
Il Corriere della Sera , si limita ad una cronaca asettica della giornata soffermandosi in particolare sui toni più accesi dell ' intervento di Grillo , riservati al Presidente della Repubblica Napolitano ( definito Morfeo ) e si trastulla per qualche riga sulla diversità tra le cifre presentate dagli organizzatori e Questura , riferendo solennemente , invece , dei Vaffa di ritorno ululati dal presidente dell ’
Ordine dei giornalisti , Lorenzo Del Boca , e dall 'esponente della Lega Nord Calderoli .
Repubblica fa addirittura peggio , affiancando alle note di cronaca un rancoroso commento di Francesco Merlo dall ' eloquente titolo " Il comico del malumore " .
Secondo Merlo , in buona sostanza , Piazza San Carlo traboccava di fans disorientati e portoghesi , ansiosi di godere gratis della ' verve ' comica di Grillo tra le maglie della manifestazione .
Tanto Repubblica che il Corriere , però , dimenticano di spiegare il funzionamento dei tre referendum di iniziativa popolare promossi da Grillo , quasi il risultato di ogni sua iniziativa fosse determinata unicamente dalle ' masaniellate ' o dai colpi di testa del comico genovese .
Niente più contributi pubblici ai giornali , frequenze radiotelevisive libere , abolizione dell ' Ordine dei Giornalisti .
Grillo è la parte apparente di quanti chiedono , con mezzi legittimi e costituzionali , di affrancare l'informazione dai propri debiti verso un qualsiasi potere , sia esso disciplinare , amministrativo od economico .
Giornali ingrassati dalle prebende di Stato , televisioni dipendenti da una burocrazia colonizzata , giornalisti legati al potere disciplinare di un Ordine sono la nemesi dell ' imparzialità dell ' informazione .
Quale interesse può esservi nel loro operato di contrario alla conservazione ( anche ruffiana ) dello status quo ?
Perchè Corriere e Repubblica non analizzano gli effetti del possibile successo dell ' iniziativa , accompagnata da Grillo , ma anche dalle firme di migliaia di cittadini ?
Grillo forse non è un genio , ma è sicuramente sottovalutato , perchè ogni sua iniziativa viene ormai personalizzata , senza tenere conto del malessere generale che riassume , che monta inesorabilmente e che in ogni caso gli sopravviverebbe .
Ha dichiarato al sistema una guerra aperta che i suoi avversari dimostrano di non aver compreso , e che pensano di combattere con i sistemi tradizionali dell ' attacco personale , della censura fiacca di qualche notabile , della ridicolizzazione di ogni successo del ' nemico ' .
Ad un appassionato di storia questa contrapposizione fa venire in mente la guerra del Vietnam , dove i generali americani , dotati di ogni mezzo conosciuto , hanno affrontato i nord vietnamiti ed i loro tunnel come se fossero divisioni meccanizzate tedesche .
Il terreno su cui Grillo si muove bene è la " foresta " della Rete e delle relazioni che si sono aggregate intorno al suo Vaffanculo !
ed i suoi simpatizzanti se ne fregano bellamente dell ' articolo di Francesco Merlo .
Un'opinione se la sono già fatta da soli , nel bene e nel male , perchè la differenza sta nel fatto che la formazione del processo decisionale è ora indipendente , e si sviluppa attraverso fonti spontanee quali sono i blog , che di tributi non ne devono versare a nessuno .
Questo li rende più credibili di media ossequiosi verso munifici sponsor , mecenati , correnti politiche , gruppi finanziari .
Chissà se Grillo arriverà alla sua Saigon , certo che ' far saltare ponti e strade ' , come si è visto , non serve a niente .
Per interrompere i tunnel , alias il web , dovrebbero cambiare strategia .

This is a follow - up article concerning online rumors of AIPAC and Pelosi pressuring of Kucinich to drop his push for impeachment ]
AfterDowningStreet.org
By David Swanson
I spoke with Congressman Dennis Kucinich because a rumor was gaining traction that :
“ Before the Nevada primary , Dennis was visited by representatives of Nancy Pelosi and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee — AIPAC .
They told Dennis that if he would drop his campaigns to impeach Cheney and Bush , they would guarantee his re-election to the House of Representatives .
Kucinich threw them out of his office . ”
According to Kucinich , “ The incident did not happen . ”

It 's doing what Microsoft appears to be doing with the Zune : making ituseful for buyers .
Remember , last month NBC Universal claimed that the reason it was keeping TV shows off of iTunes was because Apple refused to build a filter that would try to spot other unauthorized material and block it from getting on the iPod .
So , with Microsoft announcing a deal to carry NBC TV shows for the Zune ... the question had to be asked .
And , yes , NBC is claiming that it went with Microsoft because Microsoft has agreed to build a copyright cop into the Zune .
In other words , if you want the " legitimate " version of Heroes on your Zune , you may no longer be able to transfer lots of other content onto your Zune .
This from the company that is already struggling to find people to buy a Zune .
It 's difficult to figure out which side is making the bigger mistake here , so we 'll just say that both companies are working hard to drag each other down .
First off , Microsoft .
Apparently not having learned anything from recent DRM debacles , building a special copyright cop into the Zune software immediately makes the device that much less useful .
Any such filter will be more of a nuisance than anything else .
While it may temporarily cause annoyance to some users , those who really want to get content onto their Zunes will figure out other ways -- so this will only serve to piss them off .
And , in many cases it will ( yes , it will ) stop the perfectly legitimate transfer of content to the Zune .
So , it wo n't serve the purpose , but it will piss people off .
Why would anyone buy into that plan ?
As for NBC , remember , we 're talking abouthere .
TV shows that the company already distributes for .
You want as many people watching these shows as possible .
Stop worrying about " piracy " and focus on making it as damn easy as possible for as many people to watch the shows as possible , and just include a few non-intrusive , non-annoying ( but very entertaining ) advertisements in there and everything will be great .
Pissing off the very people you 're trying to get to watch your ( free ! )
TV shows does n't seem like a strategy that 's going to make many fans happy .
They have plenty of other options on what to do with their time .
Even worse , making sure that the only way that owners of iPods ( the dominant player in the market ) can see your shows is to get them from unauthorized sources ( of which there are plenty ) does n't seem particularly smart .
These are rather simple things that should be obvious to anyone online at this point .
That folks at Microsoft and NBC Universal seem to not realize them gives you a hint of what direction both companies are heading in with this effort . :
Microsoft is denying the NY Times story : Microsoft PR points us to Microsoft 's blog statement denying the story as well .
Reading between the lines , it sounds like NBC brought it up and Microsoft basically said " we 'll think about it , " but has n't promised to do anything .

[ 2008-04 - 17 ] PVC pipe key stash
Here 's a clever way to stash a key or other small object outdoors in a place that 's easy to find but not likely to attract suspicion .
Take a piece of large - diameter pipe and cut it at a long , shallow angle along its axis , as shown in the lower photo , to make a kind of hollow cylindrical wedge .
This is easily done on a table saw with the right jig .
Resting with the cut face down in soft earth , the wedge looks just like the end of a long , buried pipe that has been in place a long time and would not be easy to pull or dig up .
A slight incline of the terrain supports the illusion but is not essential .
It 's easy to find again , because of the bright white plastic , but , unless somebody trips over it and knocks it away , no - one is likely to suspect it .
Position near a wall or other obstacle to alleviate the possibility of the " trip " scenario .
The stash object , of course , should be well up from the open end of the pipe , so that it wo n't be noticed from an approach angle .

もう２年ほど前に話題になったアレなんですけど、今更ながらあるサービスでこの仕組みの導入を検討しています。
- スポンサーリンク -
onsubmit の disable 化ですが既に議論が終わっているように、onsubmit disable の実装方法として 、
onsubmit イベント発生時に submit 要素を disable にして値をサーバへ渡すための hidden 要素を生成する方法 setTimeout ( ) でボタン押下後（＝サーバへデータがとんだ直後）に disable を仕掛ける方 法
がありますが、次の２点の問題が考えられます。
中止ボタンを押された際に disable のままになる history .
back ( )
やブラウザの戻るボタンで戻ったときにボタンが disable になったまま表示されるブラウザ（firefox/safari）がある。
いま導入を検討しているサービスでは history.back ( )
で戻るボタンが簡易的に実装されている部分があったり、ブラウザの戻るボタンで戻ることも可能な実装になっている部分もあったりで上記２点を解消しなければなりません。
中止ボタン押下時にボタンの問題を解決する方法は onsubmit で disable にするやつ - 鷹の島 の実装方法の通り setTimeout ( ) で一定時間後に disable = false ; を仕掛けておく方法しかなさそうです。もっともタイマーを何秒後に設定するかはサービス毎にチューニングしないとアレですし、中止ボタンを押下直後に有効になるわけでもないので、これまたちょっとアレですが一定時間後にはリロードしなくてもボタンの disable が解除されるので再度 submit をすることが可能になるってか 。
history.back ( ) の問題を解決する方法はonload を使ってページアウト時に各種フォームを元の状態に戻しておくことで解決可能です。
ってことで、既出の onsubmit disable の方法で 上 記２つを満たすものはなかったので自分でアレコレ検証しながら実装していました。で、ふと思い返して現行のはてブは history .
back ( ) ってかブラウザの戻るボタンを押しても disable が解除されてるなぁ〜と思い、どうやって解決してるんだろう〜とコードを追っていったらこんな感じでした。
< script type =" text / javascript " src="/js/utility.js " ></ script > < script type =" text / javascript " src="/js/prototype-1.4.0.js " ></ script > < script type =" text / javascript " src="/js/keybind.js " ></ script > < script type =" text / javascript " src="/js/pin.js " ></ script > < script type =" text / javascript " src="/js/bookmark.js " ></ script>
onsubmit disable の処理は utility .js が担当しています 。
function disableSubmit ( form ) { var elements = form.elements ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < elements.length ; i++) { if ( elements [ i ] . type == ' submit ' || elements [ i]. type == ' button ' ) { elements [ i]. disabled = true ; } } } function setHiddenValue ( button ) { if ( button.name ) { var q = document.createElement ( ' input ' ) ; q.type = ' hidden ' ; q.name = button.name ; q.value = button.value ; button.form.appendChild(q ) ; } }
でもって、form タグで onsubmit= " disableSubmit( this ) " として submit を disable しているのですが unload 処理での初期化部分が見あたりません。上記 JS を １ つずつ削っていった ら prototype.js が初期化をしてくれていました。おぉ〜 prototype.js 賢いよぉ〜
ver 1.4.0 でいえば 1550 行目付近になるわけですが 、
/* prevent memory leaks in IE */ Event.observe( window , ' unload ' , Event.unloadCache , false ) ;
ってコードがあっ て Event.unloadCache って部分が元の状態に戻す処理をしています。試しに上記コードをコメントアウトしてみたら、しっかりと submit ボタンが disable されたままになりました 。
さて、そんなこととは別に僕はこんなコードを書いて実装を完了していました。二度押し対策、中止ボタン対策、history.back()
対策を全て実装したつもりです。いろいろな謎が解明されたので頭がスッキリしました。
var DisableSubmit ={ arg : {} , timer : 1000 , init : function ( arg , timer ) { if ( typeof ( arg ) == " object " ) this .arg = arg ; if ( timer ) this .
timer = timer ; this .addEvent ( window , ' load ' , this.setEvent( ) , false ) ; this .addEvent ( window , ' unload ' , this.setEnable( ) , false ) ; } , addEvent : function ( elem , eventType , fn , useCapture ) { if ( elem.addEventListener ) { elem.addEventListener( eventType , fn , useCapture ) ; return true ; } else if ( elem.attachEvent ) { var r = elem.attachEvent( ' on ' + eventType , fn ) ; return r ; } else{ elem [ ' on '+ eventType ] = fn ; } } , setEvent : function ( ) { var self = this ; return function ( ) { if ( self.arg.name ) { for ( var i = 0 ; i < self.arg.name.length ; i++) { var elem = document.getElementsByName(self.arg.name[i ] ) ; if ( elem ) { for ( var j = 0 ; j < elem.length ; j++ ) { self.addEvent( elem[j ] , ' click ' , self.setDisable( elem[j ] ) , false ) ; } } } } if ( self.arg.id ) { for ( var i = 0 ; i < self.arg.id.length ; i++) { var elem = document.getElementById(self.arg.id[ i ] ) ; if ( elem ) { self.addEvent(elem , ' click ' , self.setDisable( elem ) , false ) ; } } } } } , // history.back ( ) 対策でページアウトするするときにボタンを再度enable化しておく setEnable : function ( ) { var self = this ; return function ( ) { if ( self.arg.name ) { for ( var i = 0 ; i < self.arg.name.length ; i++) { var elem = document.getElementsByName(self.arg.name[i ] ) ; if ( elem ) { for ( var j = 0 ; j < elem.length ; j++ ) { elem[j ] .
disabled = false ; } } } } if ( self.arg.id ) { for ( var i = 0 ; i < self.arg.id.length ; i++) { var elem = document.getElementById(self.arg.id[ i ] ) ; if ( elem ) { elem .
disabled = false ; } } } } } , // 二度押し防止対策でボタンを 1 mm-sec 後にdisable 化しておく。これで hidden データ作成しなくても get / post が正常処理される setDisable : function ( elem ) { var self = this ; var func = elem.onclick ; elem.onclick = " " ; return function ( evt ) { var elem = evt.srcElement || evt.target ; window.setTimeout( function ( ) { elem .disabled = true ; } , 1 ) ; if ( func ) window.setTimeout( function ( ) { func( ) ; } , 2 ) ; window.setTimeout( function ( ) { elem.disabled = false ; } , self . timer ) ; } } }
僕的な使い方で全自動に submit disable を効かせたくなかったので、name または id で disable するヶ所を指定できる作りにしています 。
name 値が " back_button " と " submit_button " のボタンと id =" submit_id " のボタンに対してイベントを設定したい場合はこんな感じ。disable を解除するのは３秒後。
DisableSubmit.init( { " name " : [ " back_button " , " submit_button " ] , " id " : [ " submit_id " ] } , 3000 ) ;
id だけで指定したい場合はこんな感じ 。
DisableSubmit.init( { " id " : [" submit_id " ] } , 3000 ) ;
name だけで指定したい場合はこんな感じ 。
DisableSubmit.init( { " name " : [ " back_button " , " submit_button " ] } , 3000 ) ;
ちなみに unload ではなくて beforeunload で処理すると unload よりも早いタイミングで処理できるのですが beforeunload が実装されていな い Opera とかがあるので unload 処理としています 。
一応テストプログラムも置いておきます。
1. 戻るボタンで再表示できないヤツ
2. 戻るボタンで再表示できなるヤツ
3. １秒後に再表示されるヤツ

This ain't a bubble , folks .
Better get used to it .
We 've gotten a little relief in recent days , but the stubborn upward spiral of oil prices is n't going to let up to any significant degree .
Yes , there 's some debate between economists and industry analysts who fall into two camps – Bubble , Not -a - Bubble – but the evidence suggests high prices are here to stay .
New York Times columnist Paul Krugman is firmly in the not - a - bubble camp .
The only way for speculators to have a persistent effect on oil prices , he maintains , is if there is hoarding – a tightening of supplies .
There 's no evidence of that .
Oil inventories have remained at more or less normal levels throughout the recent run-up in prices .
Kevin Drum , from CBS News , agrees .
He points out that the Energy Information Agency has been consistently wrong in its near - term forecasts for months now .
The agency seems to insist that we 're living in an oil - price bubble , but reality refuses to comply .
On the other hand , the United States is unquestionably in the midst of an economic slowdown .
As demand for imported ( read : Chinese and Indian ) goods slows , it will weaken economies around the world .
This will weaken the price of oil , which is used to ship all those goods from country to country to store shelves .
So the stubborn price of oil must be a bubble caused by speculators .
Who are you going to believe ?
There are signs demand is easing in emerging markets like China and India .
Chinese demand for oil dipped in April and India 's industrial production fell to its lowest level since 2002 .
Some analysts believe this accounts for why prices have leveled off in recent days .
Peter Beutel of the energy - risk - management company Cameron Hanover believes the steep run-up since September has primarily been because of the Federal Reserve and the falling value of the dollar ( oil is priced in dollars ) .
" Because we use 25 percent of the world 's oil even though we only have 5 percent of the world 's population , we 'll always pay extra for that incremental barrel of oil when supplies are tight , " he says .
He believes the price of oil will probably peak by Memorial Day then ebb slightly , depending on the direction of the economy and what the Federal Reserve does .
So oil prices are in a bubble , thanks to speculation and the falling dollar , right ?
" No , " says Severin Borenstein , director of the University of California Energy Institute .
" Real oil changes hands for real demand and real supply .
And that price has to be pretty close to the futures ' price or you 're going to get a crash .
So you could see a bubble going for a couple of weeks , maybe , if there was a real miscalculation in supply and demand .
But you 're not seeing that . "
Borenstein maintains that the sustained rise in prices proves that supply and demand are currently aligned .
He demurs on making forecasts about where the price of oil is headed .
Could gas fall back to those blissful days of $ 3 a gallon by summer ?
Not likely , for reasons that lie somewhere between the bubble , not - bubble camps .
Chinese and Indian demand for oil has been rising in a relatively slow upward arc .
These countries alone can't explain why oil prices have more than quadrupled over five years .
And there 's no question that supplies have tightened , but not enough to explain the high spike in prices .
Daniel Yergin , chairman of the Cambridge Energy Research Associates , explains that spare capacity is very tight .
The oil market is vulnerable to crises .
As a result , speculators are driving up the price .
Tight capacity is one reason that , just today , the Senate handed the president a veto - proof vote to stop stockpiling fuel in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve over President Bush 's strong objections .
So as the global economy slows , we may see a relatively sharp - but - brief downward drop as speculators get burned , then a slow easing of prices until the economy recovers .
But in all likelihood , it wo n't last for long .
High prices are here to stay .

The tornadoes that ripped through the Midwest and South over the weekend killed about two dozen people , officials said Monday , making 2008 the deadliest year so far for twisters in a decade .
According to the National Weather Service , 96 people have lost their lives in a year that has seen an unusual number of storms .
In 1998 , 115 had perished by May 11 .
“ It ’s certainly one of the biggest years we ’ve had , ” said Harold Brooks , a meteorologist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman , Okla .
One reason , he said , was a turbulent winter in the northern half of the country .
When cooler low - pressure systems from the north collide with warm air from the Gulf of Mexico , it creates extreme weather conditions that can spawn a tornado .
Advertisement
“ We ’ve had a lot more times when the atmosphere is primed for tornadoes to occur , ” Brooks said .
What is unusual about this year is the large number of storms in January and February -- clustered in places that are normally too far north for winter twisters , such as Illinois and Wisconsin -- said Greg Forbes , a severe - weather expert at the Weather Channel .
On Jan. 7 , for example , two strong tornadoes tore through southern Wisconsin .
There has been only one other January tornado in that region since 1844 , Forbes said .
February saw an onslaught of twisters that killed more than 50 people in Arkansas , Tennessee , Kentucky and Alabama .
Advertisement
“ What we ’re seeing over the last 10 years is more wintertime events and [ storms ] creeping north , ” Forbes said .
“ Whether that ’s global warming or not , you can only speculate . ”
Forbes , who keeps his own list of confirmed tornadoes , said there have been 654 so far this year .
The chart - topper was 1999 , when 676 tornadoes were recorded in the U.S. through May 11 .
Though there is a lag of several months in the official tally , “ we continue to be on a record pace , ” Forbes said .
Last weekend ’s storms devastated rural stretches of northeastern Oklahoma and southwestern Missouri .
Tornadoes also touched down in Georgia , leaving 18,000 without power .
Half of the dying mining town of Picher , Okla . , which is already a federal Superfund cleanup site , was flattened .
Advertisement
The federal government is in the process of buying out the town ’s residents , but only about half the homes had been assessed by the time the storms hit Saturday night , killing seven .
Few residents in the impoverished area had insurance , and they fear they will be left with nothing .
Oklahoma and federal officials vowed Monday to find a way to continue with the assessments .
That is little comfort , said Ed Keheley , a rancher who has spearheaded the fight to compensate homeowners in Picher .
“ It still has not sunk into people that they have no place to go back to , ” Keheley said .
Of the town , he added , “ It ’s done .
It ’s toast . ”
In Missouri , emergency workers were slowly restoring electricity to more than 7,000 people after the storms cut a 12 - mile - wide swath along the Oklahoma border .

The twisters killed 17 people in Missouri , injured 88 and destroyed more than 100 buildings .
One family of four was killed driving to a wedding .
“ It was n’t real pretty , ” said Mac McKeough , a spokesman for the Office of Emergency Management in Newton County , Mo .
This year ’s high death toll may result from the fact that many of the storms have hit at night , said Kishor Mehta , an expert on tornado damage prevention at Texas Tech University in Lubbock .
Residents have a harder time spotting twisters in the dark and may not get warnings in time .
Advertisement
He said the year ’s devastation highlights the need for residents of tornado - prone regions to build shelters in their homes .
It is also a reminder of how changing population patterns may make people more vulnerable .
“ As we continue to sprawl , we are exposing a larger number of people to the hazards of tornadoes , ” Mehta said .
The deadliest year for tornadoes since the federal government began regular tracking was 1953 , when 519 perished .

Tony Stark 's amazing suit is a long way from realization , mostly due to practical energy constraints .
As a comic book fan and physics professor , I am looking forward to the big screen debut of Iron Man .
This is due , in part , to the fact that instead of getting belted with gamma rays or being born a demon from hell , industrialist and scientist Tony Stark got his super powers by means of his engineering genius .
But just how realistic is Stark 's amazing suit ?
Sadly , nearly all of the features of the Iron Man suit , with one important exception , are not likely to be realized anytime soon .
Let 's look at each of the suit 's major elements in turn .
Jet boots
The reason that we do n't fly to work using boot - mounted jets as Iron Man does has nothing to do with technology and everything to do with energy .
We know how to achieve thrust and propulsion using personal jet packs , and a person can indeed fly from home to their place of employment like Buck Rogers or Adam Strange – provided they live 30 seconds from work .
The problem is that lifting a full - grown person 100 feet into the air considerably increases their potential energy , and that gain in energy must come from the stored chemical energy in the jet pack .
Ditto for the energy required to zip around once airborne .
You just can't store enough energy to make long flights without making the suit too big to wear .
So jet boots alone do n't make Iron Man an escapist fantasy , but the idea that Stark could store enough energy in his suit to fly for more than half a minute does .
Repulsor rays
Similarly , the directed energy weapons Iron Man uses , such as the " repulsor rays " built into the palms of his gloves , should require that Stark drag along a large power generator whenever he faces off against the Mandarin or Titanium Man .
I 'm not exactly sure what a " repulsor ray " is , but if it 's anything like a high - power laser , then the energy demands are considerable .
Even assuming that Iron Man can convert any stored energy in his suit into laser light with 100 percent efficiency , then to generate a beam powerful enough to melt a fist - size hole through a half - inch thick steel plate ( which any comic book fan can tell you is well within Shellhead 's capabilities ) would require an energy pulse of more than 2 gigawatts of power , greater than the output of a nuclear power plant .
Cybernetic helmet
There is one aspect of Iron Man 's armor that is not only scientifically sound , but may be available for our use someday soon : the " cybernetic helmet " Tony Stark uses to control the devices within his armor .
When Iron Man wants to discharge his palm - mounted repulsor rays , he does not have to manually release a safety switch , enter a firing sequence code or even pull a trigger – he just tells the supervillain to " talk to the hand " and fires !
In fact , Bin He of the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Minnesota has already created a helmet much like Iron Man's .
It works on the principle that neurons ' electrical currents create electric and magnetic fields , which can be detected with devices such as the electroencephalograph , or EEG .
While the EEG has been around since the 1920s , recent advances in signal processing have enabled scientists to isolate and identify the firing signatures of neurons associated with particular motor - imagery tasks .
Professor
He identified the specific firing pattern that arises when a person , watching images on a computer monitor , tries to mentally move a cursor to the left or right .
These detected frequencies can then be amplified and , when suitably modified , can instruct the computer to move the cursor in the same direction .
Of course , He is not interested in developing control helmets for crime - fighting superheroes , but hopes to develop devices that will enable people with paralyzing injuries to communicate more easily , or eventually to activate artificial limbs and prosthetic devices .
To those trapped within unresponsive bodies , the development of a device that could " read their thoughts " would trump the wildest adventures in any superhero story .
James Kakalios is a professor at the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Minnesota and the author of The Physics of Superheroes ( Gotham , 2005 ) , now available in trade paperback .
The top editor of The Los Angeles Times has been forced out for resisting newsroom budget cuts , executives at the paper said Sunday , marking the fourth time in less than three years that the highest - ranking editor or the publisher has left for that reason .
The removal of the editor , James E. O’Shea , by the publisher , David D. Hiller , mirrors the odd spectacle of a little more than a year ago , when the previous publisher , Jeffrey M. Johnson , was fired for refusing to eliminate newsroom jobs as directed by the paper ’s owner , the Tribune Company .
In each case , a longtime Tribune executive was expected to rein in costs at the paper , but instead sided with the newsroom and lost his job for it .
The departure of Mr. O’Shea appears to contradict statements by Samuel Zell , the Chicago real estate magnate who took over the company last month and is now its chairman and chief executive .
Mr. Zell has repeatedly criticized the previous regime of the financially troubled company for trying to improve the bottom line by cutting costs , and he has said that he thinks the path to profit lies in finding new revenue , not paring costs .
Calls to Mr. O’Shea , Mr. Hiller and a spokeswoman for Mr. Zell were not returned .
A Tribune spokesman referred inquiries to Nancy Sullivan , a spokeswoman for The Los Angeles Times , who said , “ I do n’t have any comment for you . ”
Michelle Obama and Public Schools
James Joyner · · 41 comments
The Hotline On Call Quote Of The Day :
“ I want people to know when they look at me , to be clear that they see what an investment in public education can look like . ” — Michelle Obama
Now , I ’m in favor of investment in public education .
I went to seven different public schools growing up , including three on American military bases , and have three degrees from public institutions .
I ’ve even taught at four public colleges and universities .
But Michelle Obama ?
She ’s a different story :
Michelle graduated from Whitney Young High School in 1981 and went on to major in sociology and minor in African American studies at Princeton University , where she graduated cum laude with an Artium Baccalaureus in 1985 .
As part of her requirements for graduation , she wrote a thesis entitled , “ Princeton - Educated Blacks and the Black Community . ”
She obtained her Juris Doctor degree from Harvard Law School in 1988 .
Whitney Young High School “ is a highly selective - enrollment Chicago public school that opened its doors to students on September 3 , 1975 as the city ’s first public magnet high school . ”
It ’s as close to a private school as it gets on the taxpayer ’s dime .
Princeton and Harvard , of course , are not only private institutions but part of the Ivy League .
So , looking at Michelle Obama might give one a very good idea what going to the most selective institutions in the country can look like .
An investment in public education ?
Not so much .
UPDATE : A couple of commenters note that exclusive public magnet schools are still public schools .
True that .
The problem , though , is that it undercuts her argument .
You do n’t have to “ invest ” in a public school if it can cherry pick the best students in the city and send the bad ones elsewhere .
Any school would provide a good education under those conditions .
Indeed , one of the chief arguments against vouchers for private schools is that it leaves behind the hardest - to - teach children for the public schools and isolates those kids , disproportionately from minority groups and the underclass , even further .
Additionally , it appears the Obama ’s send their own kids to private school .
For the convenience , of course .
UPDATE II : Another commenter observes that Obama went to public grade school .
That ’s true .
The CST feature “ The woman behind Obama ” reports ,
Both Michelle and Craig , now head basketball coach at Brown University , learned to read at home by the age of 4 .
Both skipped second grade ( both their parents also skipped a grade ) .
By sixth grade , Michelle joined a gifted class at what is now Bouchet Elementary , at 73rd and Jeffery .
The gifted program exposed Michelle to three years of French before she graduated as class salutatorian , and , for two years , to special biology classes at Kennedy King College .
There , the gifted class studied photosynthesis , worked in a laboratory and identified the muscles of dissected rat specimens , recalled childhood friend Chiaka Davis Patterson .
“ This is not what normal seventh - graders were getting , ” Patterson said .
No joke .
So , if you ’re really bright , your parents teach you to read at home before you start school , you go to special college classes in grade school , and then to school with the best students in all of Chicago , then there ’s nothing like a public school education .
Then again , for most kids , that ’s nothing like a public school education .
The other day my wife and I treated ourselves to an evening of burlesque – a sort of sexy cabaret – at a theatre near us .
It was fantastic : the girls were supremely , tastefully erotic and scrumptious .
I could have made love to each and every one of them .
However , amid the beautiful breasts and the perfect , bare bottoms , I found my mind wondering and thinking about , believe it or not , Islamists – the Salafis and Wahhabis who nowadays are peeping out of every nook and cranny in the Arab world .
Beauty par excellence : a typical burlesque dance troupe
In case you suspect I ’m losing my mind , I do have some mitigation .
We – myself included – are all victims of religion – not just Muslims , but also Jews and Christians .
Religion screws up our minds and leaves a permanent blot on our psyche .
So , I suppose thinking about ugliness amid beauty is a symptom of the damage left on my sub-conscience by the contaminated environment in which I have been brought up .
I have never been religious and I cannot honestly say that I respect religious people .
Live and let live is my motto but how can I respect someone who is irrational , an adult who believes in fairies and fairy tales ?
That is not to say that I am antagonistic towards believers : they can believe in whatever they like as long as they do n't try to impose their views and beliefs on me or anyone else .
And vice - versa : while one should feel free to question believers about the " logic " of their beliefs , in the end it 's their choice whether or not to be religious .
Although I have been living in the West for many years , my mind and my habitat are in the Arab world .
So , it is not particularly surprising that I should be thinking – even for a few fleeting seconds here and there – about the ugliness afflicting my part of the world even while beautiful , exquisite angels are dancing semi- naked before my eyes .
In the interval during the burlesque show I looked around at the packed audience .
They were decent people of various ages : young , middle aged and bordering on the old .
Some were in burlesque - type attire while others wore formal or casual clothing .
Most or all were couples : girlfriend - boyfried or husbands and wives .
No hang - ups or complexes .
Everyone seemed to be thoroughly enjoying themselves .
And after the show I suppose they will do what we did : go home , have a cup of tea and go to bed .
The show ’s over and tomorrow is another day .
Islamists typically go out of their way to look scruffy and ugly
I then thought about my folk back home .
Once upon a time people in Egypt and other parts of the Arab world could enjoy a fun night out , going to an oriental dance , the theatre or the cinema .
That is still possible in some Arab countries , but is in no longer seen as normal as it used to .
Outlooks are shifting and , to a growing proportion of the population , going out to , say , a belly - dance is viewed less as a normal albeit niche activity , as was the case in the 1950s and 1960s , and more as something not that different to how some families in the UK view men who visit lap - dance clubs .
In other words , Muslims in the Arab world are stigmatizing fun .
Fun and innocent entertainment are being confined to the margins of society and the drivers behind this are the Islamists , not just the Salafis , but also those such as the Muslim Brotherhood cult who are increasingly seen in the West as “ moderates ” .
In truth , though , the difference between the two is superficial : both the Salafis and the Muslim Brotherhood types are primitive , harking back to what they imagine life was like 1,500 years ago ; bigoted ; sexist ; misogynist ; incapable of relating to the opposite sex ; and – hypocritically – prone to deviant sexual behaviour .
Instead of innocent , transparent entertainment such as oriental dance shows and music concerts , you will find many young Muslims flocking to mosques where they spend entire evenings listening to tales of the Prophet Muhammad and to preachers and other charlatans screwing up their minds with endless reminders of the billions of activities that would guarantee them a path to hell .
This is sad and , if you love your natural habitat – in my case the Arab world – it is depressing .
But it would seem that we must all taste the bitter poison of the Islamist charlatans before we vomit it back in their ugly , bearded faces and see them off once and for all .
The writer Henry Louis Mencken wrote that a Puritan “ is someone who is deathly afraid that someone , somewhere , is having fun ” .
That is true not just of the dull Christian Puritans to whom he was referring , but also of the twisted , humourless , one - track - minded bigots , charlatans and perverts of the Islamist trend , be they Muslim Brotherhood , Salafis , Wahhabis or whatever other name they go by .
For George Bush , his administration and his party , the politics of the Iraq war have always trumped the reality of the Iraq war .
Under the direction of Karl Rove , Bush made Iraq his major political issue in 2002 and 2004 .
The American people bought it .
John McCain ’s support for Bush ’s war is the central tenet of his campaign — and , again , Rove ’s fingerprints are all over McCain ’s campaign .
For Bush and McCain , the politics of Iraq have never matched the reality .
Most important of all , Bush and McCain still can’t explain how Iraq is making us safer .
Because it is n’t .
Page A1 of today ’s Washington Post addresses the politics of Iraq :
The hearings before the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees promise to be as much about presidential politics as about the past six months of military and diplomatic progress in Iraq .
All last summer , Washington anxiously awaited the September appearances of Petraeus , the commanding U.S. general in Iraq , and Crocker , the top U.S. diplomat in Baghdad , anticipating that their testimony could determine the political viability of continued war .
Much further back , Page A13 of the Post , addresses the reality of Iraq :
Three U.S. service members were killed and dozens were wounded Sunday in rocket attacks on the fortified Green Zone and a military base in Baghdad , the U.S. military said .
A fourth U.S. soldier was killed by a roadside bomb in Diyala province , the military said .
The rocket attacks came at 3:30 p.m. , according to a U.S. military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information .
The attack on the Green Zone killed two of the soldiers and wounded 17 , the official said .
The other attack in the city , at a U.S. military base in Rustamiyah in eastern Baghdad , killed one soldier and wounded 14 , the official said .
“ It ’s a tough day for us , ” the official said .
“ These are our colleagues , our friends . ”
Unfortunately , Iraq is about politics .
Only a political change in the presidency of the U.S. is going to stop this war .

COLUMBUS , Ohio ( AP )  Risking impeachment , Ohio ’s attorney general on Monday refused demands from the governor and other fellow Democrats that he resign over a sexual harassment scandal in his office and an affair with a subordinate .
Gov .
Ted Strickland told reporters that Democrats would begin drafting an impeachment resolution against Attorney General Marc Dann right away .
The Republican House speaker , Jon Husted , said Monday that his chamber was already reviewing the process .
Virtually every state - level Democratic officeholder urged Mr. Dann to resign in a letter late Sunday after Mr. Strickland tried twice during the day to persuade him to leave office .
A sexual harassment investigation uncovered an atmosphere in Mr. Dann ’s office rife with inappropriate staff - subordinate relationships , heavy drinking and harassing and threatening behavior by a supervisor .
On Friday , Mr. Dann admitted to an extramarital affair with a subordinate when the investigation threatened to reveal it .
In January 2000 , a German engineer living in South Africa met with a friend and business partner to hatch a deal .
Gerald Wisser , a 61 - year - old broker , visited his friend 's pipe factory outside Johannesburg to see if his friend wanted to make a bid on a manufacturing project .
According to what Wisser later told investigators , his friend , Johan Meyer , pointed to a foot - and - a - half tall stack of documents and said , " That is the beast .
I will make an offer . "
" The beast " was machinery to assist with the enrichment of uranium .
It was just one part of a much larger operation .
Its goal : to provide the fuel enabling Libya to produce its own nuclear bombs .
To men like Wisser and Meyer , it was just another business project .
Wisser and Meyer 's deal illustrates the increasingly white - collar nature of the nuclear bomb business .
The popular image of desperate terrorists smuggling enriched uranium across borders may not be the most serious nuclear threat to the world .
Instead , the people helping to make the bombs are often successful businessmen made even richer through illicit deals for making the machines to enrich uranium and build bombs .
They may live in suburbs and belong to country clubs .
And their ability to operate under the guise of " legitimate " business makes catching up with them far more difficult .
Wisser sent word back to his business connection in Switzerland :
His partner would take the job .
It would cost $ 2.5 million between the two of them .
Wisser 's Swiss connection was the intermediary for a man in Rawalpindi , Pakistan .
His name was Abdul Qadeer Khan .
A.Q. Khan was the architect of an audacious global trafficking network in sophisticated technology that supplied nuclear know - how and uranium enrichment equipment to North Korea , Iran and Libya .
Manufacturers and businesses from as many as 30 countries participated in the enterprise .
" The beast , " according to the National Nuclear Security Administration , was intended to become part of a uranium enrichment facility enabling Libya to produce as many as several nuclear bombs a year .
Gerhard Wisser and his partner , Johan Meyer , owner of the factory called Tradefin Engineering , had become part of the global network created by Khan to build nuclear weapons .
Their job was to construct the inner plumbing pipes , valves and the like for the processing of uranium hexafluoride , a gas that is the precursor to enriched , weapons - grade uranium .
Khan assembled a network of businesses able to dodge international export controls by secretly obtaining the technology for nuclear enrichment from multiple locales .
In some instances , the job was made easier by the fact that much of the technology needed to enrich uranium and build nuclear bombs has a civilian use as well , in everything from navigation to medicine to energy production , making exports far more difficult to control ( and penalties , for mere export violations , far less than those for illegally building a nuclear bomb ) .
A global network of manufacturers , linked together by Khan according to their specialties , turned their otherwise legitimate businesses into contractors for enriching uranium .
Most of them , unlike Gerhard Wisser and Johan Meyer , have yet to be prosecuted ; some critics say one reason has been the United States ' reluctance to cooperate on international investigations .
Democrats are about to determine whether Barack Obama is another Bobby Kennedy -- or another Gary Hart .

Unicef says fighting has damaged water supplies , posing health risks
It is increasingly hard for Iraqi aid workers to help tens of thousands of people caught up in fighting in Baghdad , according to Unicef .
The Sadr City area of the capital has seen the worst clashes between government forces and Shia militia .
The UN children 's agency says over 150,000 people there are having difficulty accessing clean water , food and other essential services .
The Iraqi government says almost 1,000 people have died in recent fighting .
Most of those have been civilians , and aid agencies say around 60 % of them are women and children .
Medical shortages
For seven weeks now Iraqi forces , backed up by US troops , have been trying to disarm Shia militiamen , but they have faced stiff resistance .
Unicef is warning that tens of thousands of people are at risk because they cannot freely move within their communities , cut off from clean water and food supplies by snipers or by roads laced with improvised explosive devices .
Fighting has severely damaged water and sewage pipes , posing serious health risks .
Hospitals are reporting shortages of medical supplies , while other health facilities open and close depending on the ability of staff to turn up for work , and are often in locations too dangerous for patients to use .
Unicef wants better access to those in need , and is working hard with the government to get water tankers into affected areas and medical supplies to hospitals and clinics .
The agency is also reporting one other worrying development stemming from the current conflict .
It says there are unconfirmed reports that children are being recruited by Shia militiamen into their ranks .
Open - source software is very attractive for companies looking to expand their services or quickly get new offerings to market , in part because it 's free .
Unfortunately , some companies tend to overlook the software license commonly attached to open - source software , the GPL .
Verizon is the latest company to do so , and its use of an OSS package in a wireless router has led to a copyright infringement lawsuit from the Software Freedom Law Center .
The SFLC has sued the telecom giant on behalf of the developers of BusyBox , a set of Unix utilities typically used in embedded systems .
One of the devices it 's found in is the Actiontec MI424WR wireless router , which Verizon distributes to its FiOS customers .
Under the terms of version 2 of the GPL , Verizon must include the BusyBox source code to its FiOS customers , which the lawsuit alleges the company has failed to do .
" Our clients licensed BusyBox under the GPL to ensure that all users of the program can access and modify its source code , " said Dan Ravicher , legal director of the SFLC in a statement .
" Because Verizon chose not to respond to our concerns , we had no choice but to file a lawsuit to ensure that they comply with the GPL . "
So far , the SFLC has filed four lawsuits on behalf of the creators of BusyBox , but Verizon is the highest - profile target so far .
The lawsuit against Verizon asks for damages , attorneys fees , and " all profits derived ... from its unlawful acts , " as well as an injunction barring the telecom from distributing BusyBox in any of its products ,
Earlier this week , the MPAA removed its University Toolkit , a collection of applications designed to assist schools in cracking down on file - sharing , after Ubuntu technical board member Matthew Garrett informed the group that it , too , had violated the GPL by failing to include the source code for the open source utilities .
An MPAA spokesperson told Ars that it would make sure it fully complied with the GPL before making the toolkit available .
Asus also ran afoul of the GPL with the Eee PC , a situation that it quickly remedied .
Like the MPAA and Asus situations , Verizon 's apparent violation is likely the result of not fully grasping its obligations under the GPL as opposed to a willful misappropriation of IP .
Verizon has not responded to our request for comment on the lawsuit .
25 % of Republicans Voted Against McCain in Indiana and North Carolina Primaries
I know it has flown under the radar , and for good reason , but the Republicans also held primaries in Indiana and North Carolina today .
You would think that because John McCain is the Republican nominee he would gather at least 90 % of all Republicans who bothered to vote in an already decided primary .
That is not the case however .
Republican primary results from Indiana :
Republican primary results from North Carolina :
As you can see John McCain only averaged about 75 % of the Republican vote in these two states .
So what does this mean ?
Probably not much , it seems to me that Republicans are sending a message to the turncoat that they have their eyes on him .
Leary Republicans just want John McCain to know that they are dissatisfied with him as the nominee and he better watch his step .
I would guess that most of these people will turn around and vote for McCain in the general election , other than the Ron Paul supporters who I would bet will vote for Ron Paul in the general even if they have to write him in .
As of right now I have to admit I am considering writing in Ron Paul myself .
Conservatives are sending a message to John McCain but will he listen ?
I doubt it , after all where will these voters go if they do n’t vote for McCain ?
He knows that they have to vote for him if they want to avoid a Clinton or Obama presidency so he will continue to shun conservatives as he tries to win moderates and independents .
John McCain has been shitting on conservatives for eight years , what ’s another six months ?
DIGG THIS
A license is a grant of permission .
The licensor grants permission to the licensee to do something that the licensee does not have a right to do .
A rental contract , though usually called a lease , is a form of license .
In exchange for money , the licensee ( in this case the lessee / tenant ) is allowed to occupy and live in the premises owned by the lessor ( in this case the licensor / landlord ) .
Notice that the owner of the property does not have a right to the ( potential ) tenant ’s money until after the contract is signed .
Similarly , the ( potential ) tenant does not have a right to enter the property .
If the landlord takes the money without consent or agreement it is theft ; if the tenant moves into the property without consent or agreement it is trespass .
Only those who have rights in property can grant licenses over that particular property .
The difference between borrowing a car and stealing it is the license , or permission .
Thus , it is clear that whenever a person owns a particular resource , only he or she can legitimately decide how to use or not use it .
Yet this is not what we see in everyday reality .
In fact , quite the opposite is true .
Upon entering most establishments you are greeted not just by an employee or manager , but also by a barrage of government papers that are usually framed and hanging on the walls .
Why , one asks , can this be ?
As we mentioned before , only the owner of a resource can decide how it should be used .
How , then , can state governments demand permission from owners before they can engage in certain activities ?
There are two solutions to this question :
The state owns certain things and thus has the right to license them
The state owns nothing but acts as if it did
Let ’s quickly go through the ways that the state claims it can own resources :
Buying them .
This is financed through taxation , which is theft .
Because the state does not own the tax revenue , its purchases are invalid .
By decree ( legislation , proclamations , executive orders , etc. ) .
There is no connection here .
The government merely claims ownership without a link to it .
It ’s as if I were to claim that I own a patch of forest without ever having worked the land , lived there , embordered it or other reasonable connection .
Conquest .
Does this one really require an explanation ?
Eminent domain .
A form of theft .
By “ homesteading ” it .
This is still not really homesteading as everything the state does is financed through taxation and backed by aggressive legislation .
If a thief steals your money and uses that to build a house on virgin land , he does not get to own the land ( or the house ) .
As the recipient of donations .
Even this one is not safe , for the management of resources donated to the state requires taxation and an army of bureaucrats .
Having briefly gone through each one of the possibilities , we can definitively conclude that the state cannot coherently own anything because all of its methods are criminal ; it is aggressively managing and / or occupying resources against the desires of the owners .
( If anything , it should be the people who give the government permission to do things ! )
Here ’s a short list of peaceful activities that either require a license or are generally prohibited ( i.e. , no license is granted ) or that are highly regulated :
Produce and sell unpasteurized dairy ;
Create vehicles that run on alternate forms of energy ;
Install pool tables in one ’s bar ( yes , in some places there is a law against that ) ;
Hire anyone regardless of national origin or status ;
Sell food without nutritional information ;
Manufacture handguns without serial numbers , attach suppressors to them , and raffle them off at the weekly bingo night for local seniors ;
Become an experienced marijuana gardener and open a neighborhood kiosk ;
Run a brothel ;
Teach ;
Open a website for organ donations and sales ;
Gamble ;
Gamble online ;
Research , develop and bring to market life - saving medicines ;
Videotape , sell and broadcast pornography ;
Cut hair , arrange flowers , give manicures , fix roofs , become a beautician , drive a cab , install plumbing or remove teeth ;
Coin money ;
Build a house or expand said house ;
Build an airstrip ( and use it of course ) ; and last but certainly not least …
Sell liquor .
The common thread across the examples above is that barring state interference ( through licenses and permits ) , anyone should be allowed to create , buy , sell , lease , give away , destroy , transport , inherit or bequeath anything so long as no one else ’s property is compromised .
It ’s that simple .
Anything else is tyrannical .
The Best of Manuel Lora
A truly good book teaches me better than to read it .
I must soon lay it down , and commence living on its hint .
What I began by reading , I must finish by acting .
— Henry David Thoreau
Much of who I am today grew from seeds planted by interesting literature .
As a 12 - year - old magician , I consumed a large part of the history and practice of the art form by way of written word .
A few years later , as an up - and - coming chess player , I met Bobby Fischer in the pages of My 60 Memorable Games .
Jeremy Silman ’s How to Reassess Your Chess virtually revolutionized the way I looked at the game .
Eckhart Tolle ’s words of wisdom helped me let go of the ego , which instilled in me a social fearlessness that has made meeting women a non-issue .
I am a writer today because of what words have done to me , and because delivering a message that changes people ’s lives is , to me , a worthy challenge .
There is one downside to being a book lover though : I want to own them all .
The Road to Hoardom
I think Maslow ’s Hierarchy needs another rung : Books — just above Safety and below Love .
As much as I love to read , my shelves are full of books I have n’t gotten around to .
When a blogger I admire recommends an interesting book , I ca n’t help myself .
They ’re smart .
They like this book .
Maybe if I read it , I ’ll be smart too .
Sometimes I ’ll drop everything and head directly to the bookstore , because clearly this book contains secrets I must know to make my next move .
I bring the book home , glance through a few chapters while sitting on the can , put it on the coffee table for later indulgence , and get back to whatever I was doing pre-bookstore - run .
I do n’t have time to actually read my new book yet .
I ’ve got a lot of work to do , and I ’m already part way through a couple other ones , so it ’ll have to wait .
But then a strange thing happens :
Over the next couple weeks , I ’ve done it again .
I ’ve bought another must - have book , given it some “ can time ” , and the last book , the one that was waiting for me on the coffee table , has silently migrated to my bookshelf , without ever getting read .
My name is Brad , and I ’m a book hoarder .
How to Have Your Book and Read It Too
If you ’re like me , and you love to buy far more books than you can read , how do you stop the insanity ?
After all , we ’re not going to just stop buying books .
Sometimes I hear of a book so intriguing that I ’m not willing to wait until I ’ve finished my current library .
Giving our old books away wo n’t fix the overcollection problem .
Even a strict book budget can be worked around by buying cheaper books .
As for buying the audio version , no thanks .
I learn much better with a dead tree in my hands .
Here ’s the solution I came up with :
Make a rule that you will read X number of books you currently own before buying another one .
I call this the read - to - purchase ratio .
This solution works well for me because it lets me control my book purchasing habits without requiring that I wait several years until I ’ve consumed my existing selection .
Had I done that , I ’d still not have read the books that inspired me to create 30 sleeps .
It also encourages me to read more , particularly to make more time for books than for blogs or mailing lists , knowing that I can reward myself with a new book soon enough , and not feel guilty about it .
My own read - to - purchase ratio is 5 - to - 1 . Choosing a ratio that ’ll work for you involves finding that sweet spot between how much time you have to read , how quickly you read , and how many shelves you ’ve still got to get through .
Using this simple rule , you can make steady progress at taming the literary beast , without having to give up your Amazon adventures .
また一つ、『計算機プログラムの構造と解釈』から面白いネタが飛び出してきた。
計算機プログラムの構造と解釈
一見なんでもないようなschemeの例題から 、Google のIndex生成アルゴリズムとして名高いMapReduceの概要を理解するための機会を得た。
あの例題の本質は何だったのか？ きっかけは、先日の 「プロセスの抽象化（シーケンスへの作用）」というエントリーに関して、会社の先輩から興味深い指摘をいただいたことだった。エントリーの内容は、抽象化によって「木構造の要素に対して作用する手続き」を改善するという話だが、その改善前後の手続きをもう一度掲載する。
【 A】改善前の実装 ( define ( sum - odd - squares tree ) ( cond ( ( null ?
tree ) 0 ) ( ( not ( pair ?
tree ) ) ( if ( odd ?
tree ) ( square tree ) 0 ) ) ( else ( + ( sum - odd - squares ( car tree ) ) ( sum -odd - squares ( cdr tree ) ) ) ) ) )
【 B】改善後の実装 ( define ( sum - odd - squares tree ) ( accumulate + 0 ( map square ( filter odd ? ( enumerate - tree tree ) ) ) ) ) 僕は 【B】への改善の本質的な目的として 「 可読性の向上」と、「部品の再利用性向上」を挙げた。しかし、先輩から以下の指摘を受けた。 ・【A】はそこまで可読性が低いのか？
・【B】では明らかに計算量が増加していることをどう説明するのか？
確かにその通りだ。特に計算量の問題は明らかで（リスト走査の回数が増えている）、そのことには前の記事を書いた段階でも気づいていたものの、「可読性の確保（今や自明ではないが…）」と「部品化による再利用」を行うことがこの例題で伝えたい本質なのだと考えてスルーしてしまった。
実際どの程度計算量が増加していたのか。【A】の計算量（シーケンスに対する全走査１回）をnとした場合、【B】では約３nの計算量を要することがわかる。 n + n + n/2 + n/2 = 3n ※enumerationとfilterが全走査であるため「n」、mapとaccumulationは奇数要素のみに対する作用であるため「n/2」となる。
つまり、計算量を３倍にしてでも【B】のスタイルをとる意味はあるのか？というのが先輩の問いだった。しばらく考えたものの、僕には明確なメリットを提示することができなかった。

France :
One million strike in defence of education and social services
By Antoine Lerougetel and Pierre Mabut
17 May 2008
Over one million public sector workers went on strike , and 300,000 demonstrated in the streets in all major cities and towns in France on Thursday .
The strikers were protesting government plans to eliminate 11,200 teaching positions and cut some 30,000 public service jobs .
If the government ’s plans are carried out , some 80,000 teaching posts will be eliminated by 2012 , the four - year course for the Bac Pro vocational diploma is to be reduced , and an intermediate qualification , the BEP , will be suppressed for some trades .
In many places high school students headed the protests , the culmination of two months of mobilisations against government attacks on education .
However , one of the two main high school unions , the FIDL ( Independent Democratic Federation of High School Students ) has called off further action this school year , but not the UNL ( National Union of High School Students .
They have claimed as a victory , however , Education Minister Xavier Darcos ’s offer of 1,500 low - paid , untrained teaching assistants in 200 of the most under - achieving high schools .
He has made no retreat on the 11,200 planned cuts in teaching posts .
Around 60,000 marched in Paris ; 30,000 each in Marseille and Rennes ; and 15,000 in Toulouse .
In Lyon and Bordeaux , 10,000 protestors were present .
In Strasbourg , Lille , Le Havre and Perpignan more than 5,000 people took to the streets .
The public sector workers were mobilised to denounce the dismantling of public services .
In Amiens , 3.000 workers and students marched behind the call for “ quality public services and more purchasing power ” .
High school banners denounced “ inequality in education . ”
A leaflet put out by Goodyear / Dunlop workers from the local tyre factory in Amiens — under threat of 402 layoffs for refusing to accept increased productivity and speed up rules — said : “ The Goodyear / Dunlop group fires workers without any scruples and announces for the first quarter of 2008 profits of € 100 million .
And the four main directors gave themselves € 20 million in salaries in 2008 . ”
According to government figures — generally about 20 percent lower than trade union estimates — at midday on May 15 some 34 percent of people employed in the schools were on strike , 27.3 percent in the rest of the State Civil Service , 3 percent of local government workers , and 5.8 percent of hospital staff .
The State Civil Service numbers 2.5 million people , of which one million are in the education service .
There are 1.6 million in local government jobs and a million in the hospital service .
Ten percent of 288,000 post workers struck , according to the SUD ( Solidarity , Unity , Democracy ) post - workers union .
Workers at French Telecom and those in the media also took part .
Even the weather forecast centres struck , with 23.7 percent of employees in 40 centres taking part .
Many centres are set for closure .
The practice of the trade unions has been to dissipate workers ’ action by numerous dispersed one - day strike calls .
This tactic was again on display in the unions ’ deliberate decision to separate last Thursday ’s strike from another on May 22 on the question of pensions .
Seven rail unions have called on their members to protest the government ’s move to increase the number of years required for full pension retirement from 40 to 41 .
They did not mobilise for the May 15 demonstrations , however .
After the rail strike that paralysed the country last year , and the unions ’ “ negotiated ” betrayal of that struggle , the May 22 strike call rings hollow for many workers .
On the evening of the May 15 strikes , President Nicolas Sarkozy announced that he would initiate legislation for a minimum service during strikes .
Teachers would be obliged to give 48 hours notice of their intention to strike .
Parents would have the right to demand of local authorities alternative provisions for pupils affected by the strike .
Teachers ’ unions have condemned this as an attack on the right to strike .
All municipal councils except those controlled by Sarkozy ’s ruling UMP ( Union for a Popular Movement ) have said that they would refuse to provide such a service and could not be forced to do so by the central government .
The Ouest - France newspaper commented : “ Mauled and destabilised in his own camp , in a difficult situation with public opinion , Nicolas Sarkozy has chosen a very ‘ Sarkozyite ’ way of making a come - back . ”
La Nouvelle République du Centre - Ouest wrote that Sarkozy was stoking up a mass movement : “ The good old trial of strength , which we thought had been buried as much as the spirit of May 68 , is taking on its former lustre : demonstrations against the government , the government toughening its stance .
The May 22 strike is likely to be another episode of a spring trial of strength , rather tougher than expected . ”
Teams of WSWS and International Students for Social Equality supporters handed out thousands of copies of an ISSE statement directed at the many thousands of high school students on the streets together with teachers , hospital workers and other public sector workers .
( See “ Defend public education against Sarkozy ’s cuts !
Unite workers and youth across Europe and internationally ! ” )
Many of those interviewed were familiar with the WSWS and displayed a serious attitude to the issues involved in the strike .
Referring to the determined mass movement of youth in 2005 against the First Job Contract ( CPE ) , Lambert said , “ Today ’s movement is less than the one against the CPE , but today there ’s a good amount of people .
The different sections of the working class must unite .
Against the CPE , we were united , and it worked ” .
Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin was obliged to withdraw the CPE but left the rest of the repressive legislation of the Equal Opportunities Law intact .
Jammie , a student from Tolbiac at the University of Paris , commented on the 2007 student struggle against the Pécresse Law .
The legislation was aimed at restricting access to higher education and tying the universities to big business .
“ We lost , ” he told the WSWS .
“ We were walked over and beaten with batons .
There was a lot of repression .
L’UNEF ( National Union of Students of France ) supposedly negotiated , but the law is not changed . ”
Jammie affirmed that the attack on rights in France “ was driven by the international context .
As for privatisations , Sarkozy is in line with the rest of the world .
The interests of the working class and the youth are the same .
If the working class is weakened , then so are the youth .
Already 50 percent of students have to work , so their interests are linked . ”
Jammie continued , “ Sarkozy is continuing France ’s imperialist policy .
Sarkozy is far too pro-American and pro-Israeli .
When he went to Dakar , he gave a speech telling the Africans that they lived in a backward country and a dark age ! ”
He said that the Socialist Party is no longer a party of the left .
“ It is no longer a credible alternative to capitalism .
The future is sombre and despairing .
The youth were repressed and clubbed and nobody reacted .
So that means that now it is acceptable to beat the youth when they revolt . ”
Tristan , 16 , a pupil at Maurice Ravel High School in Paris , was clear that the education cuts in France were part of a worldwide development :
“ What we are going through is an international phenomenon , in Italy , Spain , in the Anglo - Saxon world .
We ’ll bring this government down — that ’s what we are here for .
All the sections of the working class will unite naturally .
To win this struggle means overthrowing the government .
After that there will be a socialist , communist government , we will see . ”
He denounced French foreign policy : “ It ’s a scandal that France , the country of the rights of man should send its troops to Afghanistan and support Israel .
We youth will soon be voting and we ’ll change that . ”
He pointed out that “ capitalism was the problem .
Wealth is unequally distributed , there ’s no equality .
We ’ll destroy this world and build a new one . ”
A June 9 launch date for the iPhone 2 ?
No surprises there , and now it looks like inside sources are confirming the June 9 date , which is also when Steve Jobs ' keynote at Apple 's Worldwide Developers Conference is scheduled .
But Gizmodo's Jesus Diaz has got wind of the details of the launch , and his source tells him that the Second Coming will be a worldwide event – not just in the United States .
He also claims that his snitch , " someone very , very close to the 3 - G iPhone launch " , says that the current fixed pricing model will be discontinued in favor of a more Euro - friendly flexible price point , one that can shift subject to the markets and the whims of the telcos .
The last point concerns Spain .
As we reported this morning , Telefónica will indeed carry the iPhone , and will be launching it along with its brand new Madrid megastore on June 18 .
This seems plausible enough .
Despite the odd delay , all of Apple 's hardware ships worldwide immediately upon launch .
And the evidence coming in from around the world corroborates Jesus ' story :
The million and one one - line press releases from cellphone carriers announcing deals with Apple , for one , and the iPhone drought in the UK , Germany and even the online Apple store , for another .
What is amazing is that Apple kept things quiet for so long , considering the amount of people involved .
So far , we count over 40 countries with iPhone deals , and in some of these there will be multiple carriers offering the iPhone .
Here 's what I believe to be a comprehensive list , not including the countries where the iPhone is already on sale , in no particular order ( actually , the order I found them on Google ) :
Australia , the Czech Republic , Egypt , Greece , Italy , India , Portugal , New Zealand , South Africa , Turkey , Italy , India , Austria , Philippines , Argentina , Brazil , Chile , Colombia , Dominican Republic , Ecuador , El Salvador , Guatemala , Honduras , Jamaica , Mexico , Nicaragua , Paraguay , Peru , Puerto Rico , Uruguay , Canada , Singapore , Belgium , Jordan , Romania , Switzerland and Slovakia .
Fortune has a fancy infographic coloring the iPhone territories in red :
British readers might note an eerie similarity to the old map of the British Empire , with the controlled territories colored pink .
If Jesus ' tipoff is right , it looks like Apple is poised to conquer the world with the iPhone , much as it has done with the iPod , only a lot quicker .
Piper Jaffray consultant Gene Munster put the numbers into his calculator and totted up the potential market for the iPhone now that these deals are in place .
The number is 575 million .
If Apple does nothing more than keep its existing 3 percent market penetration , that means it could sell 17.25 million iPhones .
Muster does n't stop there , though .
He reckons that Apple could shift 45 million units by the end of 2009 .
Truly , the iPhone could be the phone on which the sun never sets .

ten stupid things people do
to mess up their credit Even smart people occasionally do stupid things .
Most of these come under the category , " it seemed like a good idea at the time , " but they may come back to haunt you and your credit later .
Many of these are signs of a precarious debt situation , and all are likely to make that situation worse .
Cosign for relatives .
When you 're asked to cosign for someone , the creditor has determined that it does not trust that person to repay the loan .
The creditor insists on you putting up your money , your property , your future income and your good name to guarantee that the loan will be repaid .
If your relative does not pay , the creditor will come after you .
The creditor does not have to try to collect from the relative .
If you do not pay it , and it will looks just as bad on your credit as if it were a loan to you .
Cosign for friends .
It is said that the fastest way to lose a friend is to loan the friend money .
Cosigning may be even faster .
Imagine how you will feel about your friend if you get a call from the creditor telling you that your friend has not made a payment in several months and now the full balance of the loan is due -- which you must now pay .
Imagine how your friend will feel when you try to make him or her pay you back for the outrageous interest charges and collection fees that you have had to pay .
Borrow from 401k and retirement plans to pay off credit card debt .
These plans are there for your retirement .
If you borrow from them while you are working -- with more income than you will have when you retire -- how will you pay your bills when you retire ?
If you do not repay these loans , you will pay income tax on the money you have withdrawn , plus an early withdrawal penalty .
In addition , since these kinds of benefits are usually protected in bankruptcy , borrowing on them reduces the assets you will be able to keep should you have to file .
Take out a second mortgage to pay off credit card debt .
Equity in your home is one of the few possessions protected from creditors in Arizona and many other states .
In most cases this equity is protected even through bankruptcy .
If you borrow on you home , you will increase the monthly cost to stay in your home which could result in its loss if your financial circumstances worsen .
In addition , you will be converting short term debt -- debt which should be paid off in a matter of months -- into long term debt which will take years , or even decades to pay off .
Even worse , you may be tempted to again run up the charge cards which you have been paid off so that you have lost your equity in your home for nothing .
Sell your car to someone who will be making the payments .
Unless the financing on your car is paid off , you remain liable on the loan .
If you sell the car expecting the buyer to make your payments you take the risk that the buyer will default , or even skip town with the car .
You will still have to pay the loan .
Just ask yourself , " Why ca n't the person that is buying your car ca n't get his or her own financing ? "
Maybe the banks do n't think he or she will be able to make the payments .
Another question to ask yourself , " Do you have more money to risk than the bank ? "
Lease a car .
A lease is often the most expensive way to " buy " a car .
Of course , you are not really buying anything .
You are just renting the car , and when the lease is up you have to return it in good condition with no more miles on it the agreement states .
Consumer Reports tells us that most dealers actively push leasing -- and that leasing offers " far more opportunities for dealers to make money . "
1
Some simple math will illustrate one pitfall .
You have to pay for every mile you put on the vehicle over the mileage allowance specified in the lease .
Typically leases specify a maximum of 15,000 miles , but sometimes this can be as low as 10,000 miles per year .
2
If you put just 5,000 miles more per year than a 36 month lease allows , and you have to pay 18 cents per excess mile , you will owe $ 2,700 when the lease ends .
In addition , you have to return the car in good condition .
One fourth of leased customers that Consumer Reports surveyed reported that " they faced lease - end charges , paying as much as $ 1,500 to replace worn - out parts , including brakes and tires , and up to $ 1077 for so - called excess wear and tear , including dents , scratches , and burns . "
3
If you have an accident during the lease it only gets worse .
If the car is gets stolen or totaled , your insurance will only reimburse you for the car 's market value .
If that does not pay off the lease and all of its charges , you will still owe the difference .
Sell a home on an assumption or wrap .
Just like the sale of a car without paying off the loan , the sale of a home on an assumption leaves you on the hook for the loan .
Although Arizona 's anti-deficiency statute on home trust deeds may prevent you from having personal liability on the first mortgage , it may still affect your credit -- and you probably will not be released from liability from a second mortgage or a loan guarantee .
Let car insurance lapse .
If you have a financed or leased vehicle , the contract requires that you maintain comprehensive insurance on the vehicle .
If you let it lapse , the secured creditor may purchase insurance and charge you for it .
The insurance which the lender places on the vehicle is much more expensive that that you can buy , so expect a sizable charge .
Do n't forget , you will be paying interest on the insurance too .
The insurance the creditor purchase is designed to protect the creditor and not you , so you may have no liability insurance .
Take cash advances on credit cards to make payments .
This is a sure sign of impending disaster .
Since you are increasing your debt , next month 's payments will be even higher .
Sell your car to a company that will lease it back to you .
If you need some quick cash and have a vehicle that has been paid off , you might be enticed by advertisements offering you that cash for your car but allow you to keep the car .
Under this scheme , you sell your car for 10 to 20 % of its value , and lease the car back .
You get title back when you buy the car back before the end of the lease .
Arizona Republic reporter Pat Kossan investigated those kind of quick cash advertisements in Valley newspapers .
He found that interest for the quick cash averaged 214 % over 1 year , compared with 29.9 % which high - risk , high - interest finance companies might charge .
If the interest rate sounds outrageously high , it 's only the beginning .
He also found that borrowers could be horrified to learn that they lost a car valued at $ 7,000 or $ 9,000 for a $ 1,500 loan .4 1 Consumer Reports , April , 1998 , p. 20 .

Voter turnout is reported to be steady Hillary Clinton has beaten Barack Obama in West Virginia 's Democratic presidential primary by a large margin , US media outlets have projected .
Senator Clinton held a big opinion poll lead over Mr Obama ahead of the vote .
Mr Obama remains the clear frontrunner in the overall contest to become the party 's nominee , having garnered more support and cash .
Correspondents say even a big Clinton win in West Virginia will do little to alter the race .
In the primaries and caucuses so far , Mr Obama has won more of the delegates who will choose the party 's nominee at the Democratic National Convention this summer .
An additional two dozen super - delegates - party and elected officials - have declared their support for him in the past week , according to the Associated Press news agency , swelling his lead .
Pressure
In an email to her supporters , Mrs Clinton made it clear that she had no intention of dropping out of the race .
" It 's clear that the pundits declaring this race over have it all wrong , " she wrote .
" The voters in West Virginia spoke loud and clear - they want this contest to go on ...
I 'm going to carry the energy of tonight 's victory into the next contests in Kentucky and Oregon . "
Mrs Clinton campaigned hard in West Virginia , although only 28 delegates were at stake .

She hopes this big win will bolster her argument that she is stronger than Mr Obama in the kind of states likely to be key battlegrounds in November 's general election , analysts say .
The state 's demographics were in her favour , with a population that is 95 % white , largely blue collar and culturally conservative , groups which have tended to support Mrs Clinton in previous primary elections .
Exit polls indicated that Mrs Clinton maintained her strength with these groups in West Virginia .
White voters without college degrees - who made up two - thirds of the electorate - backed Mrs Clinton three to one , according to surveys conducted by the AP news agency .
West Virginians ' attitudes to race may also have helped Mrs Clinton , the surveys suggested .
Of the 20 % of voters who said that race had influenced their choice ( one of the highest proportions so far during the primaries ) , 80 % supported the New York senator .
She also led Mr Obama among groups who have tended to back him in previous contests , including voters under 30 , college graduates and independents .
US TV networks were able to call the race for Mrs Clinton as soon as the polls closed at 1930 local time ( 2330 GMT ) .
Mrs Clinton has resisted pressure to bow out of the race , despite Mr Obama 's growing advantage in terms of delegates and her rapidly dwindling campaign war chest .
Campaigning on Monday , she said : " I would n't be doing this if I did n't believe that I could be the best president for West Virginia and America and that I was the stronger candidate to take on John McCain in the fall . "
After West Virginia , only a handful of primary contests remain before the Democratic Party officially declares at its August convention who will take on presumptive Republican candidate John McCain in November .
The next primaries will be in Oregon and Kentucky on 20 May .
Shift of focus Mr Obama appeared in Charleston , West Virginia , on Monday but appears to have largely switched his focus to a potential general election campaign against Mr McCain .
Hillary Clinton is trailing rival Barack Obama in the overall Democratic race
His only public appearance on the evening of the West Virginia result was in Missouri , a state that has already held its Democratic primary , but which will be a key battleground in the general election this November .
Speaking at a factory in the state , Mr Obama made no reference to the West Virginia contest , and focused almost all of his remarks on Mr McCain .
In the coming days he will also visit Michigan and Florida - both expected to be general election battleground states - as well as remaining primary states South Dakota and Oregon , his campaign said .
In Nebraska , both parties are holding primary elections to choose their nominee to compete in November for the Senate seat of retiring two - term Republican Chuck Hagel .
A Republican presidential primary is also taking place , although Mr McCain is already the effective nominee .
Nebraska 's Democrats held their presidential caucus on 9 February .
Congressional contests are also taking place in West Virginia and Mississippi .

What are these ?
Except that Hungarians lobbying to preserve the Ghetto district insist that anti-Semitism has n’t been a problem for their effort at all .
To the contrary , they said the other day , the real trouble comes from developers , several of whom are Israelis , in cahoots with district politicians .
It was coincidental , they maintained , that all the core members of their preservation group happen to be Jewish .
One of them is Janos Ladanyi , a sociologist specializing in the Roma , or Gypsies .
We met one morning at an outdoor cafe near the Buda Castle .
He described two currents of Hungarian anti-Semitism , one cultural , the other political .
Culturally speaking , “ there is a general belief that anti-Semitism , or racism , is a denial of the right to be different , ” he said .
“ In Hungary it is all right today if you behave as a religious Jew .
The Ghetto is fine for that reason .
It ’s a distinct historical entity .
But what is now being denied here is the notion that Jews , no matter how we behave , are the same as non-Jews .
The problem comes when we say we are like them . ”
Maybe .
The other day , at the Orthodox Synagogue in the Ghetto district , an Art Nouveau masterpiece from 1912 , Gabor Zoltan , an elfin , 60 - something guide who offered to show a visitor around , said that for the first time he could recall he was openly mocked on the street , not long ago , for wearing a yarmulke .
A professor who often appears on television , and has never made an issue of being Jewish , said that recently a driver stopped to let him cross the street , then rolled down his car window to announce that ordinarily he would run over a Jew but , recognizing the professor , decided against it .
The professor preferred not to be identified .
So did a middle - aged Hungarian who has spent years investigating discrimination here .
Lately he has been taken aback by his parents , whom he had never heard utter a word against Jews during the Communist years as he was growing up .
Suddenly they ’ve started to make little anti-Semitic remarks .
Loyal Hungarians all , these unnerved people cautioned against overstating the problem , which , while pervading the culture , is nothing like discrimination against the Roma ( as if that ’s any consolation ) .
They suggested anti-Semitism may be no worse here than in other eastern and central European countries .
Tibor Frank , a Hungarian historian , described the situation in the context of longstanding prejudices that link Jews with national debacles like the Bolshevik revolt of 1919 and the years of Communist rule , when many leaders were Jewish .
Today those associations have passed on to the troubled Socialists .
“ The Jewish issue , ” he said , “ is part of a larger reassessment of our history . ”
Kyle McSlarrow , chief of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association , the lobbying arm for the cable industry , has raised over $ 100,000 for Mr. McCain .
He and others in the cable industry recently butted heads with Mr. McCain over a proposal that would allow customers to pick and choose which channels they received .
Image Senator John McCain has campaigned on curbing the influence of money in politics .

Lawrence Jackson / Associated Press
In an interview Sunday , Wayne Berman , who is deputy finance chairman of the McCain campaign and a veteran lobbyist whose clients include Verizon and Verizon Wireless , dismissed the notion that some lobbyists might be raising money for Mr. McCain to curry influence .
“ When it comes to McCain , ” Mr. Berman said , “ there ’s just absolutely no concern whatsoever that he is going to be influenced by lobbyists .
He takes on issues as he sees them .
It does n’t matter whether his best friends are on the other side or not . ”
But the McCain campaign , which struggled over much of the past year in raising money , is now seeking to emulate the record - setting money machine that powered George W. Bush to victories in 2000 and 2004 , bestowing special titles upon bundlers who exceed certain financial targets .
Instead of “ Pioneers ” and “ Rangers , ” as President Bush ’s top fund - raisers were called , Mr. McCain is dubbing the 73 people so far who have brought in $ 100,000 or more “ Trailblazers , ” while the 33 who brought in $ 250,000 or more are being called “ Innovators . ”
Campaign finance watchdogs criticized the Pioneer and Ranger system for establishing an elite class of donors , many of whom went on to ambassadorships and other political appointments .
But Mr. McCain ’s advisers believe the system offers the best chance for the campaign to encourage as many people as possible to raise large amounts of cash for him .
Mr. McCain has badly trailed both Mr. Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in fund - raising  in March , for example , he brought in $ 15 million , compared with Mr. Obama ’s $ 40 million and Mrs. Clinton ’s $ 20 million .
While Mr. McCain ’s Democratic counterparts , especially Mr. Obama , have enjoyed much success in harvesting small - dollar donations over the Internet , Mr. McCain has not built an effective Internet fund - raising machine , forcing him to depend on a circle of wealthy donors .
REDMOND , Washington ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp said on Wednesday it launched a new “ cashback ” search service that pays users a rebate for buying products they found through the company ’s Windows Live search engine .
Microsoft Corp Chairman Bill Gates speaks during a news conference in Tokyo May 7 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Yuriko Nakao
Live Search cashback is the latest attempt by the world ’s largest software maker to draw users to its online search engine , which is a distant third behind market leader Google Inc and Yahoo Inc .
“ This is giving you a reason why you should use a particular search engine , ” Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said at the company ’s Advance 08 advertising conference .
Microsoft sees online search as a critical component to establishing an online advertising powerhouse .
By placing text - based ads next to results from its ubiquitous search engine , Google has become the leader in Web advertising .
A product search on Windows Live will call up links to online retailers offering that item .
The user who buys that item from the retailer ’s site will get 2 percent to 30 percent of the purchase price back as a rebate .
Consumers would have to sign up for a free Windows Live cashback account to participate in the program .
Rebates would be issued after a 60 - day waiting period to make sure there are no returned products .
Microsoft ’s Gates said it will partner with more than 700 retailers including eBay Inc , Barnes & Noble , Sears and Home Depot Inc .
Redmond , Washington - based Microsoft will offer advertisers a cost - per- acquisition model of payment , meaning that they only pay for ads that lead to purchases .
The current cost - per - click model charges advertisers for every click on a sponsored link associated with certain keywords .
“ If you knew the user and watched their behavior you could do a lot better for them in terms of taking them directly to the information or presentation they want .
Search can be dramatically better , ” said Gates .
“ We think we ’re entering a period where there ’ll be quite a bit of change ( in search ) . ”
The company ’s effort to gain more market share in Web search led to its unsolicited offer to buy Yahoo Inc earlier this year .
It withdrew a sweetened $ 47.5 billion offer a few weeks ago , but said on Sunday it had re-approached Yahoo with an alternative deal .
A source familiar with the talks said Microsoft had offered to buy Yahoo ’s search business and take a minority stake in the rest of the company after selling off its Asian assets .
Microsoft executives did not address the Yahoo issue directly at the conference .
Microsoft also launched Live Search Farecast , based on the airfare - predicting technology that the company bought in April through its acquisition of travel site Farecast .
Microsoft also said it will consider cash rebates for flights booked through the search .
Shares of Microsoft fell 51 cents , or 1.77 percent , to $ 28.25 on Nasdaq .
The Moral Scales
WASHINGTON --
How much do seven members of the U.S. Senate weigh ?
Eyeing them -- Tom Coburn , Jim DeMint , Jeff Sessions , Saxby Chambliss , David Vitter , Jim Bunning , Richard Burr --
I 'd guess they probably come in at about 1,300 pounds .
These are the Republicans who have signed a hold letter , preventing action on the reauthorization of the President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) .
Now , how much do 3 million HIV / AIDS - infected people -- the treatment goal of a reauthorized PEPFAR -- weigh ?
This is a more difficult calculation .
Adults with advanced forms of the disease can weigh about 60 pounds .
Children with AIDS are like a shadow falling on a scale .
Maintaining weight becomes difficult with vomiting and diarrhea , with tuberculosis and fungal infections , with cancers such as Kaposi 's sarcoma and lymphoma .
Even so , you 'd think that a few million of these wasting bodies would weigh more on the moral balance than seven senators .
But so far , you 'd be wrong .
It is the nature of the Senate that the smallest of minorities can impede the work of the majority .
But it takes a conscious choice -- an act of tremendous will and pride -- for members to employ these powers against an AIDS bill with overwhelming bipartisan support .
The seven , led by Coburn , complain that the reauthorization is too costly .
They object to " mission creep " -- the funding of " food , water , treatment of other infectious diseases , gender empowerment programs , poverty alleviation programs " -- as though people surviving on AIDS treatment do not need to eat , work or get their TB treated .
And the senators are concerned that AIDS funds might be used for things such as abortion referrals and needle distribution , though the legislation does n't mention these possibilities .
So they are pushing for the extension of a superfluous spending mandate requiring that at least 55 percent of PEPFAR resources be used for treatment , on the theory that this will starve " feckless or morally dubious " prevention programs .
For all of conservatism 's evident virtues , it can have one furtive , seedy vice : A justified suspicion of government can degenerate into an anti-government ideology -- rigid , stingy and indifferent to human suffering .
Conservative concerns on family planning and abstinence in the PEPFAR reauthorization are not imaginary , but they could be resolved through good faith negotiations , as they were in the House of Representatives .
A generalized hostility to AIDS prevention , however , is destructive .
Given that there are about 2.5 new HIV infections for every person starting on AIDS drugs , there is no way to control the pandemic through treatment alone .
And because treatment is less expensive than it used to be , PEPFAR is meeting its treatment goal for less money .
The 55 percent treatment floor would force the program to waste money in pursuit of an arbitrary , nonsensical spending target -- the worst kind of congressional earmark .
Other members of the Senate Republican conference seem content to stand by and watch Coburn undermine the bill , since they have their own , quiet concerns about PEPFAR 's price tag .
But the legislation is an authorization , not the appropriation ( which comes later ) , so the $ 50 billion figure means little .
These Republicans are objecting to a placeholder , taking a baseball bat to a vapor .
President Bush has yet to push for PEPFAR 's reauthorization as his top legislative priority , so Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell feel little pressure to roll over Coburn 's objections -- which they could do , since there are more than 60 " yes " votes .
Reid supports the legislation but seems uninterested in scheduling floor time without assurances from Republicans that the debate will be short and the number of amendments limited .
If it passes , after all , President Bush will get much of the credit .
The political calculation must be tempting :
Why not allow seven , white Republicans to discredit their party by blocking a lifesaving bill for Africa ?
And there is an added bonus : Coburn is an adviser on health issues to John McCain .
Given these obstacles , supporters of the PEPFAR reauthorization now estimate a 50 percent chance it will be shelved until next year .
Without a five - year U.S. commitment on AIDS funding , other countries would be reluctant to put new people on treatment .
And lives would be lost .
Each of the Coburn Seven counts himself pro-life .
If a bill came to the Senate floor that would save millions of unborn children , one assumes that pro-life members would push to improve it , accept a few necessary compromises , and then enthusiastically support the legislation .
It is difficult to imagine why pro-life legislation involving millions of Africans should be viewed differently .

土井さん実験、宇宙でもブーメラン戻る！という記事より。
宇宙滞在中の土井隆雄さんが、微小重力の国際宇宙ステーション内でブーメランを投げる実験をし、地球と同様に手元に戻ったと大阪の実験発案者に報告したことが２０日、分かった。
スポンサードリン ク
ブーメラン、宇宙空間で戻ってくる？というエントリーを少し前に書いていました。
ブーメラン国際大会で優勝したことがある栂井（とがい）靖弘氏の発案により、宇宙空間でブーメランを投げる実験があると聞き「どうなるのかな？」と思っていたのでした。
ちなみに栂井氏は 「らせんを描いて上昇して戻ってこない」と予想していました。
宇宙空間だと地上と違い、重力がないですからね。なんとなくそのまま普通には戻らないような気が‥‥
していたんですが ！
なんと！ ！
飛び方の詳細は不明だが、狭い船内で飛ばすために工夫した紙製のブーメランは、地上と同様に手元に戻ったという。
ワオォォォォ ！
この結果に栂井氏は 「ブーメランだから戻ってきてほしいと思っていた。貴重な時間を割いて夢をかなえてもらい、驚きと喜びで感無量です」とコメントしています。
ブーメランだから戻ってきて欲しいというのは、確かに分かる気がしますね。当たり前のように飛んで、戻ってきたブーメランです。
それにしても、投げてみるまで分からないというのは、実に面白い話です。

Want to harness the power of snowflaking in your own life , but ca n’t seem to manage to keep track of the details ?
Here are ten ideas to help turn the most detail - adverse person into a passionate snowflaker in their own right :
Start now .
That ’s the most important one .
Whatever it is your goal is , write it on a piece of paper , stick it on the corner of your computer screen , and look hard at it .
No debt ?
More savings ?
The ability to do whatever you want ?
Yes , I said now – go get some tape and stick it up there .
Identify one purchase that you spent less money on than you thought you would .
Whatever the difference was between what you thought you would spend and what you did spend , take that amount and snowflake it to debt or savings .
This is the action that started me on the path to snowflaking .
Carry a notebook with you .
Every time you spend money , write it down .
Write three simple things – item , amount , and essential or non-essential .
Every week review it , and total up the “ non-essential ” category .
You might be surprised .
Start picking up all the change you come across .
When you have change in your pockets , put it in a jar .
Give your house a thorough cleaning , and put all that change in the jar .
Once a month , throw that change into savings or at debt .
Pick one small luxury you indulge in that you can do without for a month .
Whatever it is , put that amount into savings or pay down debt with it for the month instead .
If it is something you do daily , multiply it by 30 .
If it is weekly , multiply it by 4 .
The size is n’t the issue , it ’s the action .
Declare one week the “ No Impulse Week ” .
Every time you spend money impulsively that week ( that is , without having a plan to do so in advance ) immediately throw an equal amount into savings or debt repayment .
This is the Paid Twice philosophy and it is how I started really paying attention to the details , and it continually reinforced my snowflaking habit ( and kept me from many impulse purchases ! ) .
Purge your stuff .
Less is the new more !
Go through collections and purge 10 % of them .
Go through rooms and identify two things you have n’t used in so long , you forgot you had them .
Now have a yard sale , list things on craigslist or eBay , or sell things to a consignment shop .
Donate the rest .
Put your proceeds towards debt or savings .
Earn an extra dollar or three .
Find something you can do – and spend two hours a week doing it for pay .
Can you play an instrument ?
Give lessons .
Do you know a school subject inside and out ?
Become a tutor .
Like to babble on and on about your life ?
Start a blog ( although this takes longer to “ pay ” ) .
Like answering questions ?
Fill out some surveys .
Like kids ?
Become a babysitter .
Once you have those extra dollars – put them towards debt or savings .
Gratification comes in actions not in things .
Instead of focusing on monetary rewards , start giving yourself praise .
Pat yourself on the back ( yes , really ) .
Recognize when you have taken a positive step .
Be proud of what you accomplish .
Just not necessarily with a latte .
Keep track .
Keep track of the balances .
Keep track of the payments .
Set a goal for a month that you will really pay attention so you can see the results .
Watch your debt balance go down , your savings balance go up , and the little pile of snowflakes become a huge flurry .
Some of these will be easy , some not quite as easy .
Start small .
Get that piece of paper .
Write down your goal .
Stick it up in the corner .
Smile to yourself and say “ I can do this , one penny at a time . ”
And start .
All it takes is a single action to initiate an avalanche .

地元の間抜けな市会議員よりも自分の方が賢いと思っているのなら、わざわざ市議会選に出馬しなくても、元祖都市シミュレーションゲームのおかげでそれを証明することができる。今月Electronic Arts（EA）がSimCityのソースコードをGPLv3の下で公開した。この新たなフリーのゲームは「
Micropolis 」と名付けられ、主要なLinuxディストリビューションのほとんどでプレイすることができる。
最初 のSimCity は1989年にリリースされた。それ以来、何十という拡張や続編とともに、18種類（現在も増加中）の派生ゲームが生まれている。SimCityは何年間にも渡ってPC用ゲームのベストセラーであり続け、最終的にその座を譲ったのもSimCity自身の派生ゲームであるThe Simsだった。SimCityは非暴力的で教育的なゲームであるため、OLPC（One Laptop Per Child）プロジェクトによってXOノートPC上に含まれることになったのもごく自然なことだった。
コードは 、SimCityの作者であるWill Wright氏と、リリースはされていないがSimCityのUnix版を開発したプログラマのDon Hopkins氏とが協力して修正し、XOのSugarインターフェース上に移植された。そして今月初め、両氏によってそのコードがリリースされた。
XO版は正式に「 SimCity 」 （EAの商標）と呼ばれているが、一般向けにリリースされたコードは「Micropolis」と呼ばれている。この名称は1980年代にまだSimCityが開発中だった時に仮称として使用されていたものだ。
MicropolisのソースコードはHopkins氏のサイトからダウンロードすることができる。Tcl/Tk GUIツールキットが必要となるが、広く標準的に使用可能になっているので手元のディストリビューションのパッケージ管理システムを確認してみよう。あるいは少しでも早く使いたいという場合には、使用しているディストリビューション用のパッケージを探せばおそらく見つけることができるだろう。これまでのところ私はDebian、Fedora、Ubuntu用のバイナリパッケージを見つけた。他のディストリビューション用のパッケージも今後きっと現われるだろう。
歴史ある都 市Micropolisを今、訪ねよう
今回リリースされたバージョンは初代のSimCityに基づくもので、その後のアップデートや拡張版に基づくものではない。したがって実行してみると、見掛けが2D的であり画像やサウンドもシンプルで、レトロな感じがする。Tcl/Tkインターフェースも古風だが、しかしそれが気に障るというほどではない。
熱心なSimCityファンであれば、実際にプレイしてみるとさらに多くの違いに気付くかもしれない。このバージョンには、3つの地域区分（居住地、商用地、工業用地）と、1つの未開発地域（公園）しかない。交通機関の種類も2つ（道路と鉄道）だけで、特殊目的の建物はちょうど7つ（交番、消防署、野球場、海港、空港、火力発電所、原子力発電所）だけになっている。
Micropolis
ゲームの開始時には、前もって定義されている24種類の都市マップから好きなものを選んでロードすることもできるし、追加の8つの歴史シナリオ（1906年サンフランシスコ地震や、1967年東京怪獣襲撃など）から一つを選んでプレイすることもできるし、地域マップをランダムに生成して一から始めることもできる。歴史シナリオの場合はそれぞれ特定の都市状況下にある特定の年から始まるが、それ以外のゲームはどれも1900年から始まって、都市を開発するための固定額として20,000ドルが割り当てられている。
ゲームのプレイ方法は簡単で、プレイヤは都市の一律の税率を調整する。そしてこの税率によって、建設、保守、サービスに当てることのできる予算が左右されることになる。プレイヤは、シミュレーションの進行にともなって居住者や企業が都市に出入りするのをリアルタイムで見ることができる。また、都市がどれほど成功しているのかを把握するための、人気投票、統計、折れ線グラフ、オーバーレイ、状況情報などの複数の方法が提供されている。また場合によっては時間が進むスピードを変化させたり、大規模な建設に挑戦するために時計を一時停止することもできる。
ゲームは非常に面白く、視覚的な効果や飾りよりもゲーム内容の方が重要だということを改めて気付かせてくれる。2D的で8ビット的な見掛けにも関わらず、どのプレイヤもMicropolisに夢中になってしまうことに、私の市長室を賭けても良い。Micropolisは何度やってもまたやりたくなるタイプのゲームだ――必ず成功する法則というものはなく、また2度目になると古く感じてしまうような起承転結もない。またどんなにうまくなったと思っても、もう一度やればまたちょっとうまくなる（と私は思っている……）。
今回Micropolisの最初のリリース（正確に言うとUbuntu用パッケージ）を試してみたところ、1つのバグに気付いた。年間予算設定用のポップアップダイアログを出さないようにするAuto Cancel（自動キャンセル）機能が、何もしていないのにも関わらず時々勝手に無効になってしまっていた。なお、1900年に空港や原子力発電所を建設することができるという点をバグだとみなす厳格な人もいるかもしれないが、私自身はこれは希望的歴史観だと受け取っている。
Micropolisが使用するシステム資源は驚くほど少ない。CPUの使用率は常に低く、また3日間バックグラウンドで実行したままにしておいた後でも、使用していた仮想メモリはたったの3.7MBに収まっていた。最近ではパネルアプレットでも、この10倍の資源を使用するものもある。
未来の都 市
Micropolisが今になってようやく公開されたということに関して先行きの不安を感じる人もいるかも知れない。というのも、オープンソースのクローンもすでにいくつか存在していて、それらには新しい独自の内容に加えて、EAのシリーズでもより新しいバージョンで初めて導入された機能やゲーム内容がすでに取り込まれているからだ。
オープンソース のMicropolisが今後進む可能性のあるいくつかの異なる方向について、Hopkins氏が自身の考えをブログに書いている。コードの改良やバグ修正はメインのコードに統合されて、OLPC XO用のアップデートに反映されるようになる可能性が高いようだ。またTcl/TkからPythonなどのよりパワフルな言語に移行することも考えているので、拡張が簡単になり見た目も向上することになるだろう。
しかしHopkins氏によると 「 長期的な目標は 、Micropolisをタイルエンジン、スプライトエンジンなどの再使用可能なコンポーネントに分離することだ。そうすれば子供たちはそれらのエンジンを使って自分のゲームを作ったり、SimCityの画像や振る舞いを変更するプラグインを作成したりすることができるだろう」とのことだ。さらにHopkins氏は、XOのメッシュネットワーキング機能や日記などの記事執筆機能を利用して、友だちと一緒にゲームを楽しむこともできるようにSimCityを変更することもできるかもしれないとしている。
今回、フリーソフトウェアの都市シミュレーションゲームLinCity-NGの開発者であるWolfgang Becker氏に、初代SimCityのソースコード公開についての意見を聞いてみた。LinCity-NGはSimCityシリーズにそのルーツを持つ3Dシミュレーションゲームだが、ゲーム内容、シミュレーションの仕組み、複雑さと言った点で独自の方向性を持っている。
Becker氏はま だMicropolisを試していないとしたものの、コードの古さにも関わらず、やはり非常に興奮していると述べた。「SimCityは素晴らしいゲームだった（おそらく今でもそうだろう）。Atari ST上でよくプレイした。続編のSim City 2000は複雑さが非常に増したが、その分楽しさも増えたかというと、そうでもないような気がする」。
開発者コミュニティにとっては、大成功したゲーム――たとえそれが古いものであっても――の中身を知ることができるということは価値があることだとBecker氏は述べた。「優れたバランスのゲーム内容を持つ、実際に動かすことのできるゲームがあるということは素晴らしいことだ。もちろん最新のユーザインターフェースであればそれも良いが、難しいのは、プレイして楽しいゲームを作るという点だ。最高の都市シミュレーションゲームであるSimCityがオープンソースでリリースされたというニュースを聞いたときは、忙しくて時間がなかったのだが、早く中身を覗きたくて仕方がなかった」。

I 've recently spent a considerable amount of time rectifying problems caused by SVN externals .
In one of the codebases I work on , it had been developed with a heavy number of Rails plugins as SVN externals .
In general , it was a good approach as these were external code , or shared code , etc .
This I think is at least better than directly checking the code in , as you have a more precise record of where it 's from , etc .
I should also note that our externals were all set to specific tags or branches specific to our code ( i.e. not to trunk , where you 'd be getting updates without your control ) .
Sounds good , what about this " evil " ?
The problem comes in when you need to make changes to the code of an external .
You might think , well , go change the root code and then adjust your tag , etc .
In some cases you can't do that - maybe it's not code you have commit rights to , or you 're making a change that 's specific to your app and can't be done another way , or , as was often in the case I had , we were on a much older version , and the trunk and other tags had major differences that I did n't want to integrate .
Thus , what I needed to do was remove this as an external , and check the code in directly .
Another approach would be to branch it from where you were and modify that , etc .
I was n't able to do that due to various Subversion permissions ( probably not a common case , but I had no choice ) .
This action itself ( remove external , add code ) is not a real problem in SVN .
But , it IS a problem when you go to update .
A simple " svn up " on other machines failed .
That is pathetic .
Instead , what I had to do was go delete the existing ( svn externaled ) directories , then do " svn up " .
This of course broke our continuous integration server , and I also had to go manually fix this up on machines I was deploying to .
Crappy , but if that was the end of it , I 'd probably not be as unhappy ...
When it comes to merging these kinds of changes into branches , watch out !
This is where SVN just flails .
First if you happen to use svnmerge .py to manage your branch merging , forget it .
It just can't deal with it , and will leave you with a partially complete merge .
Doing it manually , even with things like -- ignore - ancestors , does not work either .
I had to do something similar as to the " svn up " fix : I had to go in and delete all the directories that were previously svn externals , and then do my merge .
And note , do NOT delete the parent directories .
For example , if all of your Rails app 's plugins were externals , do go and nuke " vendor / plugins " .
It will then be totally confused and just not do anything , and fail .
Nope , you need to specifically delete each offending svn external directory .
I make extensive use of branches ( I do most work on a branch for daily work ) , so you can multiply these problems across the number of branches you might need to be merging to , etc .
Having said all that , this problem is n't really all that illogical .
I do n't know how SVN works internally , but the whole svn:externals thing seems a bit like a hack , or at least not a first class citizen in SVN land .
SVN merge or update , should be able to see : hey , you were up to date ( for your current revision ) on directory X , but this update is going to replace that with new code with the same dir name .
But , it does n't , maybe because it does n't look at the externals properly in relation .
I do n't know , and I do n't care , since it 's broken , and my fix is that I 'm moving to Git soon enough :)
Also , as another point of view , I know Perforce handles this kind of thing just fine ( we used remote mounted Perforce depots all the time at Adobe , and made seriously extensive use of branches ( in fact , we required working on a branch ) ) .
Now that I 've spent entirely too much time on the build - up , what 's the solution ?
Simple : use Piston ( or Braid if using Git ) .
What Piston does , is to not use svn:externals , and instead check the code in directly , yet maintain linkage to the external it came from .
My take is this is really probably how svn:externals should 've worked ( I presume that constantly updating an external is actually a rarely desired trait ) .
You import an svn external using Piston , and it will pull the latest code from whatever SVN URL you supply .
In this case , you could use trunk , or you could as usual use a tag or branch .
But then it 's fixed - it will not update that anytime you do " svn update " .
Instead , it is up to you to explicitly tell it to update .
This avoids svn externals as far as your daily operations go , and also causes zero problems for merges .
It does more though .
The second benefit of Piston is that you can then modify the external code , but still bring down updates from the external , allowing a synergy between using external code and your app 's specific needs .
This is exactly what I needed on a couple of plugins we use , where those plugins ' code had deviated significantly from our codebase so I could n't use a newer version , but I needed to make some changes .
To summarize , the evil is SVN itself not handling changing of externals ( i.e. to / from an external ) in basic operations like updates and merges , which may cause a lot of manual work on your end , and break automated builds or similar .
The solution : use Piston or Braid and get the best of everything .

The rumble will finally return to the land of PlayStation next week when the DualShock 3 controllers shake their way onto shelves .
About 30 titles will support the the $ 55 wireless controllers at launch , including Uncharted , Devil May Cry 4 , Burnout Paradise and Condemned 2 .
A handful of games , like Heavenly Sword , Warhawk and Resistance : Fall of Man , will require a patch to work with the DualShock 3's rumble .
If your PS3 is online , the patch should download automatically .
So what happens if you 're not hooked up to the 'net ?
Good question .
Sony suggests you consult its Knowledge Center for the answer .
Perhaps the information is n't there yet , or maybe my Knowledge Center searching skills suck , but I could n't find the solution .
You can find a complete list of the rumble - supporting games at the PlayStation Blog .
Update :
The press release we just received says the DualShock 3s will be out this week , so keep an eye out .

An herb used in traditional medicine by many Middle Eastern countries may help in the fight against pancreatic cancer , one of the most difficult cancers to treat .
Researchers at the Kimmel Cancer at Jefferson in Philadelphia have found that thymoquinone , an extract of nigella sativa seed oil , blocked pancreatic cancer cell growth and killed the cells by enhancing the process of programmed cell death .
While the studies are in the early stages , the findings suggest that thymoquinone could eventually have some use as a preventative strategy in patients who have gone through surgery and chemotherapy or in individuals who are at a high risk of developing cancer .
According to Hwyda Arafat , M.D. , Ph.D. , associate professor of Surgery at Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University , nigella sativa helps treat a broad array of diseases , including some immune and inflammatory disorders .
Previous studies also have shown anticancer activity in prostate and colon cancers , as well as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects .
Using a human pancreatic cancer cell line , she and her team found that adding thymoquinone killed approximately 80 percent of the cancer cells .
They demonstrated that thymoquinone triggered programmed cell death in the cells , and that a number of important genes , including p53 , Bax , bcl - 2 and p21 , were affected .
The researchers found that expression of p53 , a tumor suppressor gene , and Bax , a gene that promotes programmed cell death , was increased , while bcl - 2 , which blocks such cell death , was decreased .
The p21 gene , which is involved in the regulation of different phases of the cell cycle , was substantially increased .
She presents her findings May 18 at the Digestive Disease Week in San Diego .
Dr. Arafat and her co-workers also found that thymoquinone caused " epigenetic " changes in pancreatic cancer cells , modifying the cells ' DNA .
She explains that these changes involve adding acetyl groups to the DNA structure , specifically to blocks of proteins called histones .
This " acetylation " process can be important for genes to be read and translated into proteins .
In this case , it could involve the genes that are key to initiating programmed cell death .
" We looked at the status of the histones and found surprisingly that thymoquinone increased the acetylation process , " Dr. Arafat says .
" We never anticipated that . "
At the same time , adding thymoquinone to pancreatic cancer cells reduced the production and activity of enzymes called histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) , which remove the acetyl groups from the histone proteins , halting the gene transcription process .
Dr. Arafat notes that HDAC inhibitors are a " hot " new class of drugs that interfere with the function of histone deacetylases , and is being studied as a treatment for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases .
Finding that thymoquinone functions as an HDAC inhibitor , she says , " was very remarkable and really exciting . "
Pancreatic cancer , the fourth - leading cause of cancer death in this country , takes some 34,000 lives a year .
The disease frequently is detected after it has spread and only 4 percent of individuals with pancreatic cancer live for five years after diagnosis .

I would like to thank everyone who submitted articles to the 15th Humanist Symposium .
There were many great articles submitted to the Symposium , and I found it painful to winnow them down to a mere ten that I think the best .
( I intend to refer to some that did n’t make the Symposium in my “ From Around the Net ” feature , for there was some really great writing that , nevertheless , had very little to do with Humanism . )
Here are the guidelines for the Symposium :
Submissions should touch on one or more of the following categories , or on topics similar to them :
The happiness and freedom of life as an atheist , or other positive aspects to living a life without religious belief
Efforts to evangelize for atheism , and stories of people who have recently deconverted from religion
How to find meaning and purpose in a godless life
How non-religious people deal with weddings , child - raising , deaths , and other significant life events
Posts that stir up the human sense of awe and wonder
The ethics and moral philosophy of the non-religious
How nonbelievers can foster and nourish a sense of community
So , without further background , here are the ten articles I ’ve selected for this issue of the Humanist Symposium :
As Humanists , how can we make our lives meaningful ?
Each of has — or will — face that question at one time or another .
In a well - written post , Professor V. N. K. Kumar systematically lays out three sound strategies for making our lives meaningful .
His article should help anyone sort through their thoughts about meaning .
The article is hosted at Daylight Atheism and can be found here .
Perhaps one of the more exciting areas of science these days is the research being done into the nature and origin of human morality .
Over at The Picket Line , David Gross takes a look at one of the questions raised by the new research :
What , if anything , is the relationship between the morals we evolved and the morals we choose ?
That question , or something like it , is only going to become more important as the science of morality progresses .
Check out his article here .
Sometime ago , my friend Don and I discovered the local chapter of Freethinkers and attended a couple meetings .
We lost interest , however , when we found the meetings were largely for people who ’d been religiously abused as children .
Nothing wrong with that , but Don and I wanted something more — something like a support group to help us deal with current challenges — rather than the problems of childhood .
At The Atheist Revolution , VJack proposes precisely such a support group atheists , freethinkers and the like .
He writes , “ I ’d like to learn something from others about dating , raising children , dealing with religion in the workplace , and many other topics . ”
Is this an idea whose time has come ?
Check it out here .
Alonzo Fyfe , over at The Atheist Ethicist , lays out an entirely logical and insightful argument against the notion that “ only atheists can be moral ” .
Alonzo is one of the best ethicists I ’ve found on the net , and his article — which can be found here — is alone worth reading as an example of how to reason well about ethics .
But also take a look at Alonzo ’s brilliant essay on the nature of lying and why we should condemn liars .
Greta Christina is both a fiery atheist and someone sensitive to the humanity we all share — believers and non-believers alike .
She has often tried to bridge the “ belief gap ” between believers and non-believers by appealing to our common humanity .
For instance , in her recent review of the book , Mistakes Were Made ( But Not By Me ) , she writes :
If I ’m right , and religion really is ( among other things ) an elaborate rationalization for hanging on to a mistaken belief … well , that does n’t make believers ridiculous and atheists superior .
It puts us all in the same human boat .
It puts religion in the same category as hanging onto ugly clothes and shoes that gave me blisters , for years , because I did n’t want to admit that I ’d made a mistake when I bought them .
It puts it in the same category as going through with a disastrous marriage , because I did n’t want to admit I ’d made a mistake when I got engaged .
It puts religion into a particular category of human fallibility … a fallibility that we all fall prey to , every day of our lives .
It ’s an interesting thesis and well worth noting because there is a tendency to demean or even demonize those who believe differently than us .
You can find that tendency everywhere these days and it ’s an ugly one .
Moreover it is decidedly anti-humanist .
Check out Greta ’s article here .
Are there any practical suggestions for living life as a Humanist ?
Ebonmuse — at Daylight Atheism — shares nine practical things you can do to have a richer , more fulfilled life here .
The suggestions include such things as “ exercise regularly ” and “ volunteer and give to charity ” .
He ties each suggestion into Humanist principles in an interesting and often inspiring way .
Over at Elliptica , Lynet writes about finding meaning in self - expression — especially ( but not exclusively ) through art .
Her post is found here .
Mindfulness training has been demonstrated to help adults with reducing stress , reducing depression , and increasing health and happiness .
Now , there ’s a new movement to include mindfulness training in school curriculums .
Jill Suttie writes about it here .
In “ Test Your Sense of Natural Wonder ” , Christian notes that “ a sense of natural wonder ” is important to our quality of life , and he proposes a simple thought experiment that anyone can do to determine whether that sense of natural wonder is best brought about by regarding the world as a creationist or as a scientist .

For ages , some religionists have from time to time found it expedient to claim a false dichotomy between morals “ anchored in God and scripture ” and moral nihilism .

6 Comet the Super - Horse , from the Superman comics
Creepy Because : Bestiality .
Comet is Supergirl 's pet horse .
At first this sounds really cute , because girls love horses .
Although , there is this book we once read in the Cracked offices called The Naked Ape that teaches us that girls like horses because riding them is the closest activity to non-threatening sex they can have .
Not so cute anymore ?
Yeah , wait until you read how creepy it becomes with a stalker Super - Horse involved .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
You see , according to the comic , Comet was once a centaur called Biron back in ancient Greece .
He was turned into a full horse by a witch , though as a small consolation , he gained superpowers and kept his humongous horse penis .
Also , Comet periodically turns into a full human , at which point he does what any horse would do :
Try to get laid with Supergirl before she can figure out he is really her horse .
You see , the horse is in love with the girl who , while he's in horse mode , dry humps his back as a means of transport .
Comet never makes his feelings known and thus allows this arrangement to continue , much like those " nice guys " who orbit around a girl every day doing her favors , while complaining endlessly in their LiveJournals because the girl does n't pay back their niceness with a blowjob .

That 's right , Comet !
The court 's orders are meaningless !
And to make the whole thing even more unsettling , he is a super - horse , which zoologists tell us adds at least six inches in length and one in girth .
Congress subpoenas Cheney 's chief of staff on torture John Byrne
Published : Wednesday May 7 , 2008

Print This Email This House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) today issued a subpoena to David Addington , Chief of Staff to Vice President Dick Cheney , compelling him to testify before the Subcommittee on the Constitution , Civil Rights and Civil Liberties on June 26 for any knowledge of harsh interrogation techniques employed at Guantanamo Bay approved by the Bush Administration .
" This subpoena should not be controversial  as an institutional matter , all members should support our effort to learn the facts and to exercise responsible oversight in this area , " Conyers said in a written statement Tuesday .
" Furthermore , the proposed subpoena to Vice President Cheneys aide David Addington is being considered at the express request of the Counsel to the Vice President , " he continued .
" In view of the many reports that Mr. Addington played a key role in shaping interrogation policy , and in drafting legal memos on this subject , it is very important that we hear from him .
I urge all members to support this authorization , which again the Counsel to the Vice President has stated would be accepted 'as a matter of comity . ' "
The subpoena , and its cover letter , follows .
Cheney 's office , through his attorney Kathryn Wheelbarger , have suggested they will seek to keep Addington from testifying by employing executive privilege .
A PoC exploit has been published by Google and it revealed detailed about a vulnerability that affected Broadcom chipsets in iOS 10 and earlier .
It appears that this vulnerability was related to the Wi-Fi firmware .
The name given to it was CVE - 2017 - 11120 and it appears that it corrupted memory .
Attackers needed only the iPhone ’s MAC address or network - port ID .
Here is what we know from the bug report :
“ Attaching exploit for this issue .
The exploit gains code execution on the Wi-Fi firmware on the iPhone 7 .
The password for the archive is “ rrm_exploit ” .
The exploit has been tested against the Wi-Fi firmware as present on iOS 10.2 ( 14C92 ) , but should work on all versions of iOS up to 10.3.3 ( included ) .
However , some symbols might need to be adjusted for different versions of iOS , see “ exploit / symbols.py ” for more information . ”
Gal Beniamini was the one who discovered this vulnerability and he managed to discover a similar one back in April in the Broadcom WiFi SoC .
In this case , the vulnerable devices are the ones packaged with iOS 10.2 , up to 10.3.3 .
The ones with the firmware version BCM4355C0 are vulnerable as well .
Solutions .
When it comes to this Apple vulnerability , Beniamini managed to insert a backdoor to the firmware .
Upon successful execution of the exploit , a backdoor is inserted into the firmware , allowing remote read / write commands to be issued to the firmware via crafted action frames ( thus allowing easy remote control over the Wi - Fi chip ) ” he explained .
Apple reacted and it came with a solution as soon as possible .
This vulnerability was fixed in the security update that came with the iOS 11 release .
Therefore , the best way to be safe would be to upgrade your device to iOS 11 .
WASHINGTON  Senator Larry E. Craig was admonished by his colleagues on Wednesday for conduct that reflected poorly on the Senate as the result of his arrest and guilty plea last summer in an undercover sex sting in a men ’s bathroom at the Minneapolis airport .
The reprimand handed down by the Senate Ethics Committee said that Mr. Craig ’s conduct in the bathroom was improper and that his actions after his arrest appeared to be an effort to evade the legal consequences in violation of the code of ethics for government service .
Committee members also raised questions about Mr. Craig ’s conversion of over $ 200,000 in campaign money to pay legal fees , noting that he had not cleared that action as required with the committee .
The panel said it would consider further use of campaign money without approval as showing a continuing disregard for ethics rules .
The committee finding stopped short of recommending a more serious punishment , like expulsion , but it was another public blow to Mr. Craig , an Idaho Republican .
His political career has been shattered  and his case has become a staple of late - night television comics  since disclosure of his arrest by an officer who claimed Mr. Craig had solicited him for sex from an adjoining bathroom stall .
Al Gore , elevated to almost prophetic status for his campaign against global warming , on Sunday night unveiled a new $ 300 m advertising blitz intended to force a debate on climate change during the presidential elections .
The Nobel laureate , who appeared with his wife , Tipper , on the CBS programme 60 Minutes to roll out the effort , is to donate a share of his personal fortune to the campaign .
The couple told 60 Minutes that they would donate his Nobel prize money as well as a matching sum in addition to their profits from the book and the movie of An Inconvenient Truth .
The movie brought the issue of global warming home to millions of Americans , as well as winning Gore an Oscar .
In this latest campaign , Gore said he hopes to persuade Americans that protecting the planet transcends the usual political divisions .
" We all share the exact same interest in doing the right thing on this , " he told CBS .
" Are we destined to destroy this place that we call home , planet earth ?
I can't believe that that 's our destiny .
It is not our destiny .
But we have to awaken to the moral duty that we have to do the right thing and get out of this silly political game - playing about it .
This is about survival . "
The first television advertisements , which are to begin airing on broadcast networks as well as cable starting on Wednesday , will pair up the most unlikely partners in the movement to address global warming .
A clip aired on CBS showed the Reverend Al Sharpton sharing a sofa with the conservative preacher Pat Robertson .
The two men acknowledge they agree on almost nothing - barring the need to deal with global warming .
Other spots will feature the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives , Nancy Pelosi , alongside New Gingrich , the conservative Republican who once held the same post .
The support from such conservative figures as Gingrich and Robertson marks a victory for Gore in his efforts to make global warming a cause for all Americans : evangelical Christians and fiscal conservatives as well as those on the left .
The recognition for his work in the Nobel prize and the Oscar had helped overcoe scepticism about whether climate change is man-made .
By this point , Gore argued , the doubters - which include the vice - president , Dick Cheney - had been isolated as a fringe group .
" I think that those people are in such a tiny , tiny minority now with their point of view , " he told CBS .
" They 're almost like the ones who still believe that the moon landing was staged in a movie lot in Arizona and those who believe the earth is flat .
That demeans them a little bit , but it 's not that far off . "
The 60 Minutes segment marked a rare appearance from Gore in the presidential race .
After the crushing experience of losing the White House to George Bush despite winning the popular vote in the 2000 elections , Gore has become a cult hero for his passionate advocacy on the environment .
A swathe of Democrats continue to hope that Gore will return to politics - despite his protestations - or that he will weigh in to bring an end to the bruising contest between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
Gore , despite his eight years as Bill Clinton 's vice - president , has so far remained neutral in the race .
He also made it clear he has no intention of intervening to bring the contest to a close .
" I 'm not applying for the job of broker , " he told CBS .
The advertising campaign is being created by an advertising agency whose work is familiar to American television viewers .
The same agency produced advertisements for Geico car insurance using talking lizards and spoof of Planet of the Apes .
Gore acknowledged that so far Clinton and Obama have devoted relatively little time to discussing their platforms on climate change .
But , as he told CBS : " I 'm not finished yet . "
OTTAWA ( Reuters ) - A Canadian man who asked his lover to carve a heart - shaped symbol on his chest during a rough sex game almost died when she accidentally pressed too hard and punctured his heart , a newspaper said on Thursday .
The Winnipeg Free Press said the 25 - year - old woman had been sentenced to three years ’ probation after she pleaded guilty to assaulting the man in February 2007 .
The 24 - year - old man was initially given little chance of survival but made a full recovery and is backing the woman .
Both had been drinking heavily and engaging in rough sex when he asked the woman to carve the symbol , the paper said .
“ People tell me time and time again that they see their basic needs as being more than food , clothing and shelter , ” said the sergeant , whose team is attached to Company B , First Battalion , 14th Infantry Regiment .
“ They include electricity , water and sewage .
And until the Iraqi government provides them with such basic services , they wo n’t trust them . ”

Residents have complained to American soldiers about a lack of basic services .

Indeed , the Mahdi Army , the militia founded by Moktada al - Sadr , the anti-American cleric who holds sway here , has long used the delivery of aid and basic services as a means of building political influence .
“ Through a ‘ Hezbollah - like ’ scheme , the Shiite Sadrist movement has established itself as the main service provider in the country , ” notes a recent report by Refugees International , an advocacy group .
“ As a result of the importance of nonstate actors in the delivery of assistance and security , civilians are joining militias . ”
Sadr City is so large and poor that large swaths have been in chronic disrepair , but the fighting inflicted further damage .
Residents have repeatedly asked American troops during patrols why the garbage cannot be removed and basic repairs made in the areas the Americans control , especially since the most intense fighting appears to be over in these sectors .
The soldiers have stressed that they are not standing in the way of such efforts , and would also like them to begin .
But while the government has been willing to fix water , sewage and electrical lines in the past , officials say that it was still too dangerous for work to begin .
The Iraqi government held a joint news conference with the American military on Sunday to promote their plans to help Sadr City , including $ 150 million to bolster the area ’s infrastructure .
But when pressed on the timetable for reconstruction , an Iraqi spokesman for the Baghdad security plan refused to estimate a starting date .
“ We ’re not saying we ’re going to disperse supplies today , but once it ’s stabilized we will work on these projects , " said Tahseen al - Sheikhly , the security plan spokesman .
“ Because of security , there will not be any projects for a while . ”

What little information provided in the CIA videotape concerning the destruction of the purported Syrian reactor only provokes more questions .
The alleged reactor is described , because of its dimensions and shape , as a duplicate of the North Korean reactor at Yongbyon .
The reactor at Yongbyon is a rough copy of an old British design .
It is graphite - moderated and cooled with gaseous carbon dioxide .
Its core is composed of a large number of highly - purified graphite blocks .
For example , each of the first two Magnox reactors at Windscale in the UK used 2,000 tons of graphite .
Even if this purported Syrian reactor vessel were half the size of one of the original UK reactors , it would require roughly 1,000 tons of graphite .
That ’s 14,400 cubic feet of highly - purified graphite .
Would all official entities fail to notice the production and transfer of that amount of highly - refined graphite to Syria ?
The voice - over on the CIA videotape asserts that the reactor in Syria was “ nearly completed . ”
If the plant were “ nearly completed , ” those graphite blocks would have been substantially in place .
Bombing and fire would have spread bits of carbon all over the site , or scattered whole blocks of graphite around the site .
The “ after ” photos did n’t seem to indicate that this happened .
If the reactor were substantially complete , neutron - absorbing boron - 10 carbide ( or possibly cadmium alloy ) control rods would have been installed .
Had those been burned or exploded in the bombing , those , too , would have left a chemical signature on the hills surrounding the site and in the prevailing winds .
As far as I know , this has n’t been discussed .
Then , too , there is the matter of fuel rods .
Syria is reported not to have uranium yellowcake stocks in appreciable quantities .
( One particularly large phosphorite field , the Charkiet formation , is known to contain uranium , but the phosphate fertilizer plant built to process that ore was done by a Swedish company which would certainly alert the IAEA if there were non-compliant diversion .
Moreover , Syria has cooperated with the IAEA in the past to develop its commercial uranium extraction processes , but those have not progressed , according to SIPRI . )
There ’s no evidence presented that Syria has built fuel processing and fuel rod assembly facilities .
That would suggest production elsewhere , and such production can be tracked .
So , if it was almost complete , where are the fuel rods ?
The primary weapons benefit of such a reactor is its ability to be refueled on the fly , so to speak ( it ’s necessary to get the fuel rods out of the reactor before the optimum quantity of plutonium - 239 is degraded by neutron capture to less suitable isotopes ) , so , why does U.S. intelligence say they have “ low confidence ” that the plutonium that might be produced is for nuclear weapons ?
It must be that Syria does not have the necessary fuel processing , fuel rod assembly and spent fuel reprocessing plants , and there ’s no evidence of bomb - manufacturing facilities ( all this infrastructure should ideally go forward concurrent with fuel production to produce a bomb in the shortest period of time ) ; does this suggest that the purpose of the facility might not be nuclear in nature , or that it was nuclear , but would have had a non-weapons purpose ?
If there ’s no evidence for the existence of the rest of a weapons - making complex , how credible is the claim of “ near completion ” of a reactor which is well - suited for producing plutonium ?
So far , the government ’s primary evidence seems to be a photo of a North Korean who is reputed to be NK nuclear scientist Chon Chibu , standing next to someone “ believed to be his Syrian counterpart ” ( quote from the London Times ) .
That photo , as well as others , likely was provided by the Mossad , so its provenance is in question .
Given that the Israelis bombed the site , one can’t evade the reality that they ’re an interested party in the matter .
What is shocking in this assertion is the lack of physical evidence available for independent inspection , and the apparent complete failure of U.S. authorities to seek international inspection via the IAEA before the Israelis bombed the site in question , despite the fact that the U.S. was apparently aware of Israeli intentions well ahead of time .
Syria has been a ratified signatory of the NPT since 1969 , making it obligated to accept inspections .
If , as the CIA asserts , the Syrian facility has been under construction since 2001 , there was more than ample time to inform the IAEA of a signatory ’s possible failure to abide by the treaty .
Repeated unannounced overflights of Syrian territory by Israeli jets in recent years indicates long - term planning of this mission .
Possibilities ?
The Bush administration might prefer to use this event to imply nuclear weapons production on Iran ’s part , because it is an ally of Syria , or the claims of North Korean assistance might provide cover for eventually abandoning the six-nation talks involving North Korea and provoking them in some way .
Suggestions that the Israelis wanted to use the bombing raid to penetrate and compromise Syria ’s Russian - built air defenses preparatory to a future attack on Iran are not wholly out of the realm of possibility .
It ’s possible that the Syrians were building a bomb - fuel reactor with North Korean assistance , and imagined , wrongly , that they could escape detection .
Certainly , North Korea ’s economy is so awful that they would be desperate for revenues .
But , there ’s no physical evidence of such activity which has been independently verified , and the Bush administration ’s record on this sort of thing is , well , dubious , at best .
Nor can one discount Syria ’s previous cooperation with the IAEA , and the necessary evidence would have come from an IAEA inspection .
It ’s also possible that the Syrians were building something military in nature that they wanted kept secret , and which had nothing to do with a nuclear program , but which alarmed the Israelis , anyway , such as an early warning facility , ground - based laser , something along those lines .
The CIA video depends heavily upon computer models , and those models add substantial pieces of equipment not shown in the photos of the “ nearly completed ” facility .
Remember that Colin Powell depended upon artists ’ renderings of “ mobile bioweapons labs ” instead of physical evidence , and that Rumsfeld used cartoonish illustrations to show lavish al - Qaeda complexes , replete with living quarters , office space , truck parking and ventilating systems , like the Islamist equivalent of Cheyenne Mountain , buried inside Tora Bora .
Those , too , were never found .
One more final consideration : the Yongbyon reactor , from the descriptions by inspectors in 1994 , is a real hunk of junk , by contemporary standards .
The inspectors could tell from the condition of the spent fuel rods that there were many operating problems and shutdowns because of problems .
Nuclear safety at the site was marginal to non-existent .
The bomb test using plutonium from it was very likely a fizzle yield .
If the Syrians got a duplicate copy of the Yongbyon reactor , as the CIA claims , they were very likely wasting their money .

March 28 , 2008  --
A student strip - searched for drugs when she was in eighth grade took her case to a federal appeals court on Wednesday , arguing through a lawyer that school officials had violated her constitutional rights by overzealously enforcing a strict policy against alcohol , narcotics – and , in her case , Ibuprofen .
Savana Redding says she was " confused " and " ashamed " after the officials in Safford , Ariz. , suspected her in 2003 of giving other students prescription Ibuprofen pills and ordered her to expose her breasts and pelvic area during a search in the school nurse 's office .
She denied having any pills , and none were found .
Her mother later filed on her behalf a federal lawsuit claiming the search was unreasonable and therefore illegal .
" A strip search , particularly of an adolescent , is a grave invasion of privacy and should be reserved for emergency situations , " Andrew Petersen , one of Redding 's lawyers , said in a written statement .
" The misguided actions of these school officials must not become the status quo in our nation 's schools . "
But a lawyer for the school district insisted that there were ample grounds for the search .
" When it comes to drugs and weapons , " Matthew Wright said , " school districts just can't take the chance of not going forward and being sure . "
The case is one of dozens that have recently challenged public schools on where to draw the line between the privacy rights of students and the need to keep drugs and violence out of the classroom .
Courts have generally upheld school strip searches only when they were necessary to avoid a severe health or safety threat .
But laws banning or strictly limiting such searches exist in seven states : California , Iowa , Missouri , New Jersey , Oklahoma , Virginia and Wisconsin , according to the American Civil Liberties Union .
Wednesday 's argument was the third round in a legal fight that has been going on since 2004 .
On March 15 , 2005 , a U.S. district judge ruled in favor of the school district without a trial .
Last year , a three - judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld that ruling by a vote of 2 - 1 .
In January , the full court of appeals agreed to review the case , and it heard oral arguments Wednesday .
A decision is not expected for at least several months .
According to court documents , the dispute started in October 2003 , when a student at Safford Middle School in Safford , Ariz . , told the vice principal that Redding , then 13 , and her friends were bringing drugs to school .
A week later , the student showed the vice principal a pill that he said was from Redding 's friend .
The pill turned out to be prescription - strength Ibuprofen .
A recently adopted school policy prohibited all drugs on school grounds , including any " prescription or over - the - counter drug " like Ibuprofen , except when specifically permitted by the school .
The vice principal asked Redding 's friend about the pill , and she said Redding had given it to her .
The vice principal then hauled Redding out of class for questioning .
After she denied knowing anything about the pills , he asked if she would agree to be searched , and she said she would .
The vice principal looked in her backpack , found nothing and then sent her to the nurse 's office .
" I was just like , did I do something wrong ? "
Redding recalls .
" I was thinking , if I do n't do this [ go to the nurse 's office ] , they 're going to think that I did do something wrong , and I 'll get into more trouble . "
While the nurse watched , a female secretary had Redding strip to her underwear , pull her bra to the side and her panties out at the crotch and expose her breasts and pelvic area .
After no pills appeared , Redding got dressed .
Redding says she did n't return to class but sat in the vice principal 's office and called her mother to pick her up .
She was afraid to tell her mom on the phone what had happened , she recalls , because " the secretary was listening " and " I was like really ashamed , like it was my fault . "
A friend later spilled the beans about the search , and Redding says her mom " was more mad than I was .
I felt really stupid . "
The incident was so humiliating that Redding says she could n't return to school for months .
" Everyone knew what had happened , and they were talking about me , " she recalls .
" I got really nervous , developed ulcers and started puking . "
Eventually , Redding transferred to another school , and today , at age 17 , she is still trying to make up for lost time at what she describes as an alternative high school .
" I remember how much I enjoyed school , " she says .
" I won all kinds of certificates , I was on the honor roll , I was doing pretty good .
And I had never been in trouble before . "
" I would have felt better if they had called my mom " before doing the strip search , she says .
Wright , the lawyer for the school district , says the school 's strict drug policy is still in effect .
He is not aware of any specific rules on strip searches but stresses the duty of schools " to closely supervise students and provide a safe environment . "
As for the strip search of Redding , he says it was based on " reasonable grounds . "
" Remember , " he says , " this was prescription strength Ibuprofen . "

Amidst all the hoopla over whether the surge in Iraq has been a success , Americans might have missed the latest development in the Iraq mess � Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad�s historic and much - acclaimed visit to Iraq , one in which the presidents of Iraq and Iran even held hands .
That �s right �
I said , Iraq � and Iran .
Iraq , as in the country that the U.S. government invaded six years ago and has occupied ever since .
And Iran , as in the country that the U.S. government might yet invade before President Bush leaves office .
As some of us have long been pointing out , the real winner of the Iraq War was Iran , not the United States .
The U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq succeeded in installing a radical , Islamic , Shiite regime in Iraq , one that aligned itself with Iran , a country that President Bush and Vice President Cheney are sanctioning and still might even bomb .
Now , if that �s not a perverse outcome of an invasion of a country that never attacked the United States and which has killed hundreds of thousands of people , I don�t know what is .
It means that U.S. troops have killed and died for the sake of an Islamic regime � one that they continue to kill and die for as part of their indefinite occupation of Iraq .
One irony , of course , in this perversity is that many supporters of the invasion and occupation still justify the intervention on the grounds that Islam presents a dire threat to the United States .
Well , what in the world do they think is the guiding religion of the regime that now governs Iraq ?
It was Saddam Hussein�s regime that was secular , not the regime that the U.S. invasion and occupation ended up installing in Iraq .
Fortunately , the anti-Islamic neo-con crowd here in the United States hasn�t yet started calling for the bombing of the radical Islamic regime that now governs Iraq and that has aligned itself with Iran .
My hunch is that this discomforting fact � i.e. , the partnership between Iraq and Iran � has still not settled into the consciousness and conscience of the American people , in large part because they generally don�t like to hear or read bad news about Iraq .
Think about it : 4,000 American troops dead .
Thousands more wounded .
A million Iraqis dead .
Countless more wounded .
The entire country destroyed .
Museums ransacked .
Suicide bombers .
Millions of Iraqis fleeing the country .
Torture .
Gangs .
Arbitrary searches , seizures , and arrests .
Indefinite incarcerations .
And all for what ?
So that a brutal pro-Iran regime could rule Iraq rather than Saddam Hussein .
In case you missed it , here�s a link to Reuter�s account of Ahmadinejad�s visit to Bhagdad :
" Pomp and ceremony greeted Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on his arrival in Iraq on Sunday , the fanfare a stark contrast to the rushed and secretive visits of his bitter rival U.S. President George W. Bush .
Ahmadinejad held hands with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani as they walked down a red carpet to the tune of their countries ' national anthems , his visit the first by an Iranian president since the two neighbours fought a ruinous war in the 1980s .
His warm reception , in which he was hugged and kissed by Iraqi officials and presented with flowers by children , was Iraq 's first full state welcome for any leader since the U.S. - led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein in 2003 .
His visit not only marks the cementing in ties between the neighbours , both run by Shi'ite majorities , but is seen as a show of support for the Iraqi government and an act of defiance against Iran 's longtime enemy , the United States , which has over 150,000 troops Iraq .
A line of senior Iraqi political leaders welcomed Ahmadinejad when he arrived at Talabani 's palatial home . "
According to the Chicago Tribune , Ahmadinejad promised a $ 1 billion loan to Iraq and " the two countries negotiated seven deals on economic and cultural cooperation . "
Oh well , faced with an indefinite occupation of Iraq , a continually crashing dollar , ever - rising prices , and devalued homes , Americans can console themselves with , " At least we�re rebuilding Iraq ! "
Let�s just hope that President Bush doesn�t try to save his legacy by starting a war against Iran before he leaves office because there�s little doubt that Iraq would align itself with Iran in such a war , leaving American troops to fight enemies in front , in back , and in the middle of them .
And think how much time , money , and lives it would take to rebuild Iraq again !

Val Thomas : Dead Woman Comes Back to Life ( Photo )
Val Thomas , 59 , stopped breathing at 1:30 a.m. on Saturday , May 17 , and her family called paramedics .
While they waited for help to arrive , they tried to revive her while others prayed .
They estimate that she was without a heartbeat or oxygen for 15 - 20 minutes before she was put on a ventilator and transported to a Charleston , West Virginia hospital .
Doctors put her on a machine to lower her body temperature , in effect inducing hypothermia .
Her heart stopped three times causing doctors to estimate that her chance of survival was less than 10 % .
She was kept on life support of nearly 18 hours while the family considered organ donation , prayed and said their final goodbyes .
While they gathered around the bedside of Val Thomas , a nurse removed her breathing tube and disconnected her from various machines .
Ten minutes into the process she moved her arm and started to speak to the nurse .
The miraculous recovery of a woman who had no neurological function for 18 hours is baffling to the woman 's attending physicians .
They performed a ' heart cath ' on the patient on Wednesday , May 21 , to determine the level of damage to Val 's heart .
They found no blockage or damage .
She has been sent on to the Cleveland Clinic to further investigate what appears to be an electrical problem within her heart .
Val Thomas said , " I know God has something in store for me , another purpose .
I do n't know what it is but I 'm sure he 'll tell me . "

President Ortega is a leftist ally of Ecuador 's President Correa
The move comes amid a growing crisis over a Colombian raid into Ecuador to kill leftist Farc rebels .
Venezuela and Ecuador have already broken off diplomatic ties and moved troops to their borders with Colombia .
Mr Ortega said " we are breaking off relations because of the political terrorism " carried out by Colombian President Alvaro Uribe .
He made the announcement in his capital , Managua , with Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa at his side .
Mr Correa is on a tour of Latin American capitals to rally opposition to Colombia 's cross - border raid on Saturday .
The situation shows that everyone needs to be vigilant about the use of border areas by terrorist organisations like the Farc
Condoleezza Rice
Pride fuels tensions Borders a sensitive issue
Senior Colombian Farc rebel leader Raul Reyes was killed along with at least 16 other people at a jungle camp just inside Ecuador 's border .
Tensions have risen in the region since the raid .
Venezuela says 9,000 soldiers have been moved to the border with Colombia , while Ecuador says 3,200 of its forces have been deployed .
Latin American leaders have urged calm and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has called for a " diplomatic resolution " to the crisis .
" The situation shows that everyone needs to be vigilant about the use of border areas by terrorist organisations like the Farc , " Ms Rice told a news conference in Brussels after a meeting of Nato foreign ministers .
' War crime '
Colombia has apologised to Ecuador but said the raid was necessary .
Ecuador has moved soldiers towards its border with Colombia
An opportunity for talks could arise in the Dominican Republic , where regional leaders are gathering for a meeting of the Rio Group .
Latin American presidents , including those from Colombia , Venezuela and Ecuador , are expected to meet on Friday .
The presidents of Ecuador and Venezuela have called for clear international condemnation of Colombia 's actions .
The Organisation of American States ( OAS ) on Wednesday unanimously approved a resolution saying that Colombia had violated the " principles of international law " by crossing into Ecuador , but stopped short of an outright condemnation .
The 34 OAS member states agreed to set up a commission of inquiry led by OAS head Jose Miguel Insulza to investigate the incursion and scheduled a meeting of OAS foreign ministers for 17 March .
Colombia has waged a four - decade conflict with Farc rebels who finance themselves through the cocaine trade and by kidnapping hostages for ransom or political gain .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez had become involved in mediation efforts to free Farc - held hostages in Colombia , securing the release of six this year .
He branded the Colombian raid a " war crime " , adding that Bogota , which receives billions of dollars in aid from Washington to fight drug - trafficking , was just a " lackey of United States imperialism " .
He dismissed Colombian claims that a laptop found during its raid on the rebel camp in Ecuador held files indicating that Venezuela had given the Farc $ 300 m ( £ 150 m ) .
( CNN ) -- Sen. Edward Kennedy was hospitalized in Boston , Massachusetts , after suffering an apparent seizure Saturday morning , his family said .
Sen .
Ted Kennedy , shown in May 2007 , was rushed to a hospital Saturday morning .
" Preliminary tests have determined that he has not suffered a stroke and is not in any immediate danger .
He 's resting comfortably , and watching the Red Sox game with his family , " said Dr. Larry Ronan , a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital .
" Over the next couple of days , Sen .
Kennedy will undergo further evaluation to determine the cause of the seizure , and a course of treatment will be determined at that time , " said Ronan , who is Kennedy 's primary care physician .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Saturday he spoke to the wife of the Massachusetts Democrat , Victoria Reggie Kennedy , and she told him her husband is going to be fine .
" Everyone knows he is a strong fighter , " Reid said , speaking at the Nevada state Democratic Party convention .
Kennedy was transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston for evaluation after initial treatment at Cape Cod Hospital , an earlier statement from his office said .
The senator spent less than an hour in the Cape Cod facility , hospital spokesman David Reilly said .
Earlier , a Democratic source in Massachusetts said the 76 - year - old senator had " symptoms of a stroke " at the Kennedy family compound in Hyannisport .
An official with the Hyannis Fire Department said it received a 911 call from the Kennedy compound at 8:19 a.m. and transported a male patient to the hospital , arriving at 8:50 a.m.
Watch how paramedics ' fast response time may have saved Kennedy 's life »
The patient was subsequently transferred to the hospital 's municipal airport , and a Boston Med Flight helicopter flew the man to Massachusetts General , Lt. Bill Rex said .
Family members reported that Kennedy was well enough later in the morning to call to say he would not be able to join them for lunch .
They said they were guardedly optimistic he would make a full recovery .
Watch what lies ahead in Kennedy 's recovery »
Kennedy had surgery in October to clear his carotid artery in hopes of preventing a stroke .
Colleagues said he had recovered quickly and was working energetically recently .
Watch
He suffers chronic back pain from injuries suffered in a plane crash in 1964 .
Kennedy has represented Massachusetts in the Senate since 1962 .
He is one of only six senators in U.S. history to serve more than 40 years .
He is known as a liberal champion of social issues such as health care , family leave and the minimum wage .
Take a closer look at Kennedy 's life »
He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1980 .
He has endorsed Illinois Sen. Barack Obama for the 2008 nomination .
Obama said that his " thoughts and prayers " are with Kennedy .
" We are going to try to find out as quickly as possible what is going on , " Obama said , and added that he would call Kennedy 's wife .
" He is one of my favorite people , " Obama said .
The presumptive Republican presidential nominee , Sen. John McCain of Arizona , said in a statement he was " very sorry to hear that Sen .
Kennedy has taken ill and , like millions of Americans , Cindy and I anxiously await word of his condition . "
The two senators are close friends despite differing political ideologies .
They co-sponsored a comprehensive immigration bill that has stalled in the Senate .
" He is a legendary lawmaker , " McCain said .
Presidential candidate Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - New York , said : " My thoughts and prayers are with Ted Kennedy and his family today .
We all wish him well and a quick recovery . "
John Kerry , the junior senator from Massachusetts , was seen arriving at Massachusetts General Hospital on Saturday afternoon .
Kennedy is the youngest of nine children in the famous family of Joseph and Rose Kennedy .
His oldest brother , Joe , died in World War II ; two other brothers , President John F. Kennedy and Sen.
Robert Kennedy , were assassinated in the 1960s .
CNN's John King , Josh Levs , Dana Bash , Ed Henry , Mike Roselli and Dan Lothian contributed to this report .

I 'm not talking about putting out your fire of righteous anger .
Keep that anger alive and channel it into defeating the lies and bringing the bad guys to justice .
We need your righteous anger !
But anger without love turns into hatred , which weakens you .
Anger plus love turns into power , effectiveness and success .

You 're in the midst of a war : a battle between the limits of a crowd seeking the surrender of your dreams , and the power of your true vision to create and contribute .

The problem is n’t that we ’re powerless .
The problem is that we have allowed those with agendas in government and the media and organized religion to CONVINCE us that we ’re powerless .
They 've confused us , belittled us , distracted us and made us feel like we barely have the power to get out of bed in the morning , let alone challenge those with the biggest arms , megaphones , or pulpits .
The truth is that EVERY one of us has tremendous untapped strength , intelligence and resourcesinto us .
The truth -- shown by millions of examples throughout history -- is that people can thrive in the worst imaginable circumstances .
Individuals can dig deep and get creative and think of ways to turn things around even when all seems lost .
People can succeed against overwhelming odds if they are committed .
The human spirit is powerful , flexible , creative , intelligent and resourceful .
It is there within each of us . . . lying dormant .
Wake up your inner hero , your inner genius , your inner leader .
It is there . .
. just under the surface .
And the truth is that , when we come together to talk about what is really happening , and what we want , and how to obtain it , we create a very powerful dynamic and we set powerful forces in motion .
The truth is that , together , we are unstoppable .
In a speech focused on fostering compassion in children , the Dalai Lama urged those gathered in a pro football stadium Saturday to support not only nuclear disarmament , but an “ inner disarmament . ”
Speaking to an estimated 65,000 people in the packed stadium , Tibet ’s exiled spiritual and political leader said that nuclear weapons have provided a deterrent at times , but they may no longer be useful .
“ Nobody dares to use nuclear weapons , ” he said .
“ Now I think we should think seriously about elimination of all nuclear weapons . ”
Genuine disarmament will require willpower , he said , and dissolution of hatred , jealousy and fear .
Mostly sidestepping the issue of political turmoil in Tibet , the 72 - year - old Tibetan Buddhist monk delivered an upbeat message of compassion , equality , humanity and happiness .
His appearance is part of a five - day Seeds of Compassion campaign that continues through Tuesday in Seattle .

The Dalai Lama ’s tour came as protests along the Olympic torch route over Chinese treatment of Tibetans were being staged in several countries .
He arrived in Seattle a day after demonstrators disrupted the torch run in San Francisco .
The long - planned Seattle visit has been virtually without controversy .
The Dalai Lama planned to make remarks this morning concerning the situation in Tibet , which has seen recent violence and rioting .
The Buddhist leader fled to India in 1959 after a Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule failed .
In Seattle on Saturday , Qwest Field -- regarded by many as the loudest outdoor stadium in the National Football League -- took on a contemplative tone for the day .
The Dalai Lama spoke of having a “ genuine sense of compassion toward your enemy ” and said compassion could transform the world .
He playfully extolled the virtues of cultivating inner strength .

In a scene patterned after the opening of the Olympics , a procession of 1,000 people representing the cultures of the state of Washington entered the stadium , passed before the main stage and then moved into the stands .
Children carried the flags of Tibet and more than a dozen countries and peoples .
The sound of dozens of drums filled the air .
The Dalai Lama watched the procession from a red upholstered chair on a stage set with yellow pillars and a white canopy .
At the center of the field was a bright yellow circle with a heart shape inside a flower -- the logo of Seeds of Compassion .
“ It gives me goose bumps to see all these people here , ” said Seattle resident Ethelyn Abellanosa , 38 .
She had come to see the Dalai Lama , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 , because “ he sets an example ” and has devoted his life to “ peace and love . ”
“ It ’s all about faith in humanity and faith and love , ” she said .

A friendship bracelet exchange ceremony and 1,800 - member choir of parents and children ended the program .
The Seeds of Compassion events started Friday with scientists , psychologists , neurologists and others focusing on the theme “ The Scientific Basis for Compassion : What We Now Know . ”
That was followed by a concert by Dave Matthews , Tim Reynolds and Death Cab for Cutie .
In an onstage conversation before his performance , Matthews , the Dalai Lama and NBC news anchor Ann Curry exchanged ideas on topics including war , peace , music and motherhood .
Asked Matthews : “ How can you know what your enemy understands if you do n’t talk to them ? ”

The Dalai Lama responded that enemies can become friends through respect and respectful dialogue .
Compassion can be extended to enemies , he said .
Later , he said that compassion can be elevated through practice .
He spoke of cultivating inner strength , inner calm , less fear and more contemplation .
“ Knowledge does not solve our problems , ” he said .
“ Knowledge must combine with warmheartedness .
Compassion is needed .
The time has come .
We must place more emphasis on compassion . ”
In all , more than 150,000 people are expected to attend the Seeds of Compassion events .
Nearly 15,000 students from schools throughout Washington are expected to participate in an event Monday .
Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels will present the Dalai Lama with the key to the city .
On Tuesday , Archbishop Desmond Tutu will join in a discussion about how spiritual communities can foster compassionate action .
Seeds of Compassion is funded primarily through mobile technology entrepreneur Daniel Kranzler ’s Kirlin Charitable Foundation .
The group describes itself in conference materials as bringing “ world attention to the importance of nurturing kindness and compassion beginning with children and extending to all who touch their lives . ”

The only sign of protest over the Dalai Lama ’s visit arose when a group of Chinese students urged the University of Washington to ensure that he did not have a “ political agenda ” or “ arouse anti-Chinese sentiments ” on campus .
When the Dalai Lama opened the conference Friday morning at the university , he told 8,000 students that “ problems happen because of wrong views and wrong action . ”
But he did not directly address the political turmoil in Tibet .
In brief remarks before the Dalai Lama spoke , his emissary Lama Tenzin Dhonden called for autonomy rather than independence for Tibet , which he said faces real and growing danger .
“ Autonomy would be good for Tibet and for China , ” he said .
“ It would require Chinese commitment to serious dialogue . ”
In Tibet , recent protests have been the loudest and most sustained in nearly five decades of Chinese rule .

On a stopover in Japan en route to Seattle , the Dalai Lama told reporters that he supports the Olympic Games .
He denied using the prelude to the Olympics to foment unrest .
The Dalai Lama last visited Seattle in 1993 .
Raj Manhas , executive director Seeds of Compassion and former superintendent of Seattle schools , said he hoped the region could leverage the event to “ become a leader in the science of compassion . ”
Conference backer Kranzler said he hoped the event would “ reconnect our hearts with our brains , ” adding that “ when we give of our hearts , we can re-create a powerful and sustained change in our society . ”

Like other speakers , he underscored an urgent need for compassion : “ This is really important , given where we are in this world .
When we plant seeds of compassion in our world , we can really make a change . ”

Students in public schools learn as much or more math between kindergarten and fifth grade as similar students in private schools , according to a new University of Illinois study of multi-year , longitudinal data on nearly 10,000 students .
The results of the study appear in the May issue of the influential education journal Phi Delta Kappan .
“ These data provide strong , longitudinal evidence that public schools are at least as effective as private schools in boosting student achievement , ” according to the authors , education professor Christopher Lubienski , doctoral student Corinna Crane and education professor Sarah Theule Lubienski .
The new study is the first published study to show that public schools are at least as effective as private schools at promoting student learning over time , they say .
Combined with other , yet - unpublished studies of the same data , which produced similar findings , “ we think this effectively ends the debate about whether private schools are more effective than publics , ” said Christopher Lubienski , whose research has dealt with all aspects of alternative education .
This is important , he said , because many current reforms , such as No Child Left Behind , charter schools and vouchers for private schools , are based on that assumption .
The debate essentially began three years ago with the publication in Phi Delta Kappan of a previous study by the Lubienskis , which challenged the then - common wisdom – supported by well - regarded but dated research – that private schools were superior .
In that 2005 study , they found that public school students tested higher in math than their private school peers from similar social and economic backgrounds .
In another , more - extensive study in early 2006 , they built on those findings , and also raised similar questions about charter schools .
Both studies were based on fourth - and eighth - grade test data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress ( NAEP ) .
The conclusions of the husband - and - wife team seemed “ crazy radical ” at the time , Sarah Lubienski said , and generated significant controversy .
They were supported , however , later in 2006 , with similar findings in U.S. Department of Education studies comparing public schools with privates and with charters , which looked at NAEP test data on both math and reading .
( Unlike literacy , math is viewed as being less dependent on a student ’s home environment and more an indication of a school ’s effectiveness , Sarah Lubienski said . )
Critics of these previous studies , however , have cited the lack of longitudinal data showing the possible effect over time of different types of schooling .
The studies of NAEP data were only snapshots , they said , showing student achievement at a single point in time .
The studies did not address the possibility that some students may have entered private school at a lower level of achievement .
The new study was designed , in part , to address that issue , the authors say in their PDK article .
The data for the new study came from the database produced by the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study , Kindergarten Class of 1998 - 99 ( or ECLS-K ) , administered by the National Center for Education Statistics ( NCES ) , part of the U.S. Department of Education .
The ECLS -K database includes both student achievement and comprehensive background information drawn from a nationally representative sample of more than 21,000 students , starting with their entry into kindergarten in the fall of 1998 .
The most recent data available for the U. of I. study was gathered in 2004 , in the spring of the students ’ fifth - grade year .
The sample used for the study included 9,791 students in 1,531 schools ( 1,273 public , 140 Catholic and 118 other private schools ) .
To better determine the effects of attending different types of schools , the sample included only students who had stayed in the same type of school – though not necessarily the same school – throughout the years covered .
As in the previous studies , the researchers used a statistical technique known as hierarchical linear modeling to control for demographic differences between students , as well as schools .
Among the demographic variables included in looking at students were measures of socioeconomic status ; race and ethnicity ; gender ; disability ; and whether the child spoke a language other than English at home .
Among the variables included in looking at schools was the average socioeconomic level of its students , its racial or ethnic composition , and its location ( urban or rural ) .
The NAEP data had included similar information , but its quality and controls on its collection were not as strong as for ECLS -K , according to Sarah Lubienski , who studies math education and specializes in statistical research .
“ It ’s one reason this study feels more definitive than the NAEP studies , ” she said .
After controlling for demographic differences among students and schools , the researchers ’ found that public school students began kindergarten with math scores roughly equal to those of their Catholic school peers .
By fifth grade , however , they had made significantly greater gains , equal to almost an extra half year of schooling .
Part of the explanation , Sarah Lubienski said , might lie in the fact that Catholic schools have fewer certified teachers and employ fewer reform - oriented mathematics teaching practices – something they found in research for another study , accepted for publication in the American Journal of Education .
Public school students also “ rivaled the performance of students in other ( non-Catholic ) private schools , ” the researchers wrote .
After adjusting for demographics and initial kindergarten scores , they found that achievement gains between kindergarten and fifth grade were roughly equal .
The number of private schools in the study did not allow for drawing conclusions about other subcategories of private schools , such as Lutheran , conservative Christian or secular , Sarah Lubienski said .
In their earlier NAEP research , they found that Lutheran schools , for instance , performed on par with publics , while conservative Christian schools performed lower than all other school types .
“ It is worth noting , ” the researchers write in analyzing their results , “ how little variation school type really accounts for in students ’ growth in achievement …
Specifically , while all of the variables in our model together explained 62 percent of the achievement differences between schools , school type alone accounted for less than 5 percent of these differences , with demographic considerations accounting for a much greater share . ”
Put another way by Sarah Lubienski , “ school type alone does n’t explain very much of why these scores vary … in truth , whether the school is public or private does n’t seem to make that much difference . ”
The researchers go on to write that they “ personally see private schools as an integral part of the American system of education ” and “ there are many valid reasons why parents choose private schools and why policymakers may push for school choice . ”
Academic achievement , however , may no longer be one of those reasons , they write .
“ Claims that simply switching students from one type of school to another will result in higher scores appear to be unfounded . ”
They suggest “ moving away from a simple focus on school type and instead examining what happens within schools . ”

New Delhi :- Smarting under a correcting realty market and sluggish buying sentiments , real - estate players are scrambling to raise end - user demand through offers that promise to ease Equated Monthly Instalments burden until possession .
So , while realty companies together with Parsvnath Developers are broadcasting ‘ No Equated Monthly Instalments until possession ’ , others such as BPTP and Gaursons are offering 2 - yrs Equated Monthly Instalments holiday on specific projects .
“ For those who are presently living on rent , the scheme makes logic as the Equated Monthly Instalments load kicks - off only after possession , ” says Mr Amit Raj Jain .
BPTP ’s group housing project , ‘ Resort ’ , in Faridabad offers a 2 - yr ‘ Pre-Equated Monthly Instalments interest ’ to the bank on behalf of buyers .
Dr B.P. Dhaka , COO told that Parsvnath ’s Sonepat project , ‘ Parsvnath Preston ’ , reimburses the Monthly Instalments paid prior to possession .
“ Such value - addition is gaining popularity as the customer is motivated to make the down payment and can then relax till possession .
From the point of view of the developer , it ensures timely completion of the project as the fund flow is assured .
KDP Infrastructure has announced that ‘ No pre- Equated Monthly Instalments for 18 months ’ upon payment of fifteen per cent of the booking amount on its ‘ Grand Savanna ’ project in Ghaziabad ; Gaursons India makes a ‘ No Equated Monthly Instalments till 24 months ’ offer to buyers of ‘ Gaur Grandeur ’ at Noida ; and JMD Gardens ’ project in Gurgaon promises that Equated Monthly Instalments payment would start ‘ only after house entry .
Ten Ways to MakeYour Lifestyle Age Younger
1. Reduce stress
2. Stop smoking and ovoid passive smoking
3 . Take regular exercise
4 . Be an ideal weight
5 . Eat low fat
6. Reduce alcohol consumption
7 . Eat more fruit and vegetables
8. Drink more water
9 . Sleep well
10 . Learn to think positive
In really stressful times your ' lifestyle1 age can rocket upwards .
Adopting stress - reducing strategies to help you through the dif­ficult times can make a big difference .
Exercise is a fantastic stress - buster , so try to incorporate more physical activity into your life .
Seek help from others , including therapists , if stress is a major problem for you .
A smoker 's skin wrinkles and dehydrates much more quickly than a non-smoker 's due to the deprivation of oxygen caused through smoking .
And that 's what 's showing on the outside .
But what goes on in the inside is far more destructive and damaging , so it is not surprising that it adds to the ageing process .
If you want to live to a good age , stopping smoking is a high priority .
We know so much now about the physical benefits of exercise .
It will significantly help reduce symptoms of heart disease , aid dia­betics , reduce stress , and keep us leaner and fitter .
It really is a win / win situation .
If you find formal exercise sessions difficult to fit in , then just be more active generally in your everyday life .
Park further away from your destination , and use the stairs instead of the lift .
Walk rather than drive to the shops , take up a sport or activity you used to enjoy when you were younger .
Just get moving as it all adds up !
The effects of being overweight can be hugely damaging to the body .
Your whole system is in overdrive trying to cope with car­rying the excess weight and causes you to age much more quickly .
Overloading your joints , your heart and your whole body has serious health risks .
Buying this book means that you have decided to do something , so let 's start turning back the clock right now .
It is never too late .
Eating a healthy , low - fat diet really helps you lose weight .
Eating less fat stops the whole system getting clogged up , which causes high blood pressure and high choles­terol levels .
Not only is it high in calories , alcohol is also very toxic and dam­ages major organs such as the liver .
Alcohol also increases your appetite and dilutes your willpower , so be careful !
However , a moderate consumption of one alcoholic drink per day is known to have health benefits - so it 's not all bad news !
Fruit and vegetables are packed with vitamins and minerals and eating plenty of these will ensure you have a great immune system to ward off illness and disease .
Try to have as many dif­ferent colours on your plate as you can .
This will ensure you are taking in the whole range of vitamins and minerals .
Aim to eat your five portions a day .
Dehydration is extremely ageing and nothing hydrates better than plain water .
Avoid fizzy drinks , which can be full of chemi­cals .
We know that if we have had a good night 's sleep we feel better .
Make it a rule to go to bed at a reasonable time on most nights of the week and you will wake up refreshed and ready to cope more easily with what life throws at you !
If you have a really late night , balance it out with an earlier one .
Lack of sleep can be harmful to health .
A positive outlook on life , and smiling a lot , is good for us and helps us to live longer .
Look back at this list and see how many things you can manage to do or improve .
Start with one or two and gradually add some more .
Be positive and make a commit­ment to those changes and you will soon reap tremendous ben­efits .
If there is one message that comes through clearly from every successful slimmer that I meet , it is the increase in their confidence and self - esteem .
And yes , you are worth it !
Bush Hits New Low as ' Wrong Track ' Rises Eighty - two percent of Americans say the country 's off on the wrong track .
May 12 , 2008  --
Public disgruntlement neared a record high and President Bush slipped to his career low in the latest ABC News / Washington Post poll .
Eighty - two percent of Americans now say the country 's seriously off on the wrong track , up 10 points in the last year to a point from its record high in polls since 1973 .
And 31 percent approve of Bush 's job performance overall , while 66 percent disapprove .
The country 's mood -- and the president 's ratings -- are suffering from the double whammy of an unpopular war and a faltering economy .
Consistently for the last year , nearly two - thirds of Americans have said the war in Iraq was not worth fighting .
And consumer confidence is near its lowest in weekly ABC News polls since late 1985 .
Bush 's approval rating has been extraordinarily stable -- before today 's 31 percent it had been 32 percent or 33 percent in nine ABC / Post polls from July through last month .
In presidential approval polls by Gallup since 1934 , just three presidents have gone lower : Jimmy Carter , who bottomed out at 28 percent approval in July 1979 ; Richard Nixon , 24 percent in July and August 1974 ; and Harry Truman , 22 percent in February 1952 .
Bush now has gone 40 months without majority approval , beating Truman 's record ( also during economic discontent and an unpopular war ) of 38 months from 1949 - 52 .
This poll also covers 2008 election politics ; check back for those results at 6:30 p.m .
STRENGTH and PARTISANSHIP --
Beyond the president 's overall rating , intensity of sentiment is heavily against Bush .
Fifty - two percent of Americans not only disapprove of his work but do so strongly , matching the high in ABC News / Washington Post polls set in July .
Just 15 percent strongly approve .
These views remain highly partisan : Sixty - nine percent of Republicans approve of Bush 's job performance , while just 9 percent of Democrats agree .
His ratings , on average , have been more partisan than any president 's since ABC and the Post began polling in 1981 .
The swing group , as usual , is the third of Americans who define themselves as independents .
Just 24 percent approve of the president 's work , a career low .
Republicans , while still behind the president , are less emphatically so : Just 39 percent strongly approve of his performance , while 56 percent of independents and 78 percent of Democrats strongly disapprove .
Among other groups , Bush does best with conservatives -- 57 percent approve -- and evangelical white Protestants , another core Republican group , in which 49 percent approve , a point from the low in this group .
DIRECTION --
Views on the nation 's overall direction are sour across the board , again with a partisan and ideological slant :
While 95 percent of Democrats and 86 percent of independents say the country 's off on the wrong track , this eases to 62 percent of Republicans and 66 percent of conservatives .
These views directly relate to the president 's ratings .
Among people who say the country 's headed in the right direction , 83 percent approve of Bush 's work .
His problem is that they constitute just 16 percent of the population .
Among the 82 percent who say the country 's off on the wrong track , Bush 's approval rating is a dismal 21 percent .
METHODOLOGY --
This ABC News / Washington
Post poll was conducted by telephone May 8 - 11 , 2008 , among a random national sample of 1,122 adults , including an oversample of blacks ( weighted to their correct share of the national population ) , for a total of 206 black respondents .
The results from the full survey have a 3 - point error margin .

Bush admits he approved torture
Last updated May 1 , 2008 4:32 p.m. PT
By HELEN THOMAS - HEARST NEWSPAPERS
Â© 1998 - 2008 Seattle Post - Intelligencer
Copyright 2008 Hearst Newspapers .
WASHINGTONÂ – The American people have heard President Bush and his spokespeople say many times that the U.S. government does not engage in torture .
Whether Bush was believed or not is another story – especially in light of the photographic evidence of the abuse of prisoners in Abu Ghraib .
It ’s understood that many of the photos are too sadistically graphic to be made public .
Still , the official U.S. denials of torture continued until earlier this month when Bush acknowledged in an interview with ABC - TV that he knew about and approved “ enhanced interrogation ” of detainees , including “ waterboarding ” or simulated drowning .
“ As a matter of fact , ” Bush added , “ I told the country we did that .
And I told them it was legal .
We had legal opinions that enabled us to do it . ”
The president added , “ I did n’t have any problems at all trying to find out what Khalid Sheik Mohammed knew . ”
“ He was the person who ordered the suicide attackÂ – I mean , the 9/11 attacks , ” Bush said .
“ And back then , there was all kind of concern about people saying , ‘ Well , the administration is not connecting the dots . ’
You might remember those – that period . ”
Bush said .
Bush also said in the interview that he had been aware of several meetings his national security advisers held to discuss “ enhanced interrogation ” methods .
Surely he is aware of the U.S. commitment to international treaties barring “ cruel and inhumane ” treatment of prisoners .
What is startling is that he feels no remorse about the cruel image he has created for usÂ – and the damage done to our credibility and probity .
In referring to the legality of torture , Bush apparently was thinking of a 2002 - 2003 memo by John Yoo , a Justice Department official who argued military interrogators could subject detainees to harsh treatment as long as it did n’t cause “ death , organ failure or permanent damage . ”
The memo was rescinded .
Bush , who has insisted “ we do not torture , ” also recently vetoed legislation that explicitly banned torture .
Sen .
John McCain , whose whole political persona has been defined by the fact that he had been tortured while a prisoner of war during the Vietnam era , supported Bush ’s veto .
For both Bush and McCain , I recall the words of Joseph Welch , the special counselor for the Army during the 1954 Army - McCarthy hearings when Welch asked Sen. Joseph McCarthy , R - Wis. : “ Sir , have you no sense of decency ? ”
We expected the usual cast of characters including Vice President Dick Cheney to be in on the sinister torture - planning sessions .
But it came as a shock that Gen. Colin Powell , then secretary of state , sat in on the meetings and went along with the planning .
Powell had been on record warning against U.S. torture policies on the basis that if we mistreat our prisoners , foreign countries will feel no qualms about abusing American captives in wartime .
Once revered for his integrity , Powell has lost his halo .
Now we have this week ’s testimony of Air Force Col .
Morris Davis , a former chief prosecutor , who took the witness stand at Guantanamo Bay on behalf of a prisoner .
Davis told how top Pentagon officials had pressured him on sensitive prosecutorial decisions for political reasons .
He said he was told that the charges against well - known detainees “ could have real strategic value ” and that there could be no acquittals .
Davis also testified Brig .
Gen .
Thomas Hartmann reversed a decision he made and insisted prosecutors proceed with evidence they obtained through waterboarding and other methods of torture .
Davis also testified he was told to speed up the cases to give the system legitimacy before a new president takes over in January .
Is Congress so cowed that it accepts the statements of a president who has little regard for the truth ?
Is there no lawmaker who is appalled about the tarnishing of our image in world opinion ?
And where are the voices of the other presidential candidates who will inherit the Bush legacy of torture ?
Why the silence ?
I count on the American people to refuse to be shamed any more .

Bisphenol A ( BPA ) is a ubiquitous compound in plastics .
First synthesized in 1891 , the chemical has become a key building block of plastics from polycarbonate to polyester ; in the U.S. alone more than 2.3 billion pounds ( 1.04 million metric tons ) of the stuff is manufactured annually .
Since at least 1936 it has been known that BPA mimics estrogens , binding to the same receptors throughout the human body as natural female hormones .
And tests have shown that the chemical can promote human breast cancer cell growth as well as decrease sperm count in rats , among other effects .
These findings have raised questions about the potential health risks of BPA , especially in the wake of hosts of studies showing that it leaches from plastics and resins when they are exposed to hard use or high temperatures ( as in microwaves or dishwashers ) .
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) found traces of BPA in nearly all of the urine samples it collected in 2004 as part of an effort to gauge the prevalence of various chemicals in the human body .
It appeared at levels ranging from 33 to 80 nanograms ( a nanogram is one billionth of a gram ) per kilogram of body weight in any given day , levels 1,000 times lower than the 50 micrograms ( one millionth of a gram ) per kilogram of bodyweight per day considered safe by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and the European Union 's ( E.U. ) European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) .
Studies suggest that BPA does not linger in the body for more than a few days because , once ingested , it is broken down into glucuronide , a waste product that is easily excreted .
Yet , the CDC found glucuronide in most urine samples , suggesting constant exposure to it .
" There is low - level exposure but regular low - level exposure , " says chemist Steven Hentges , executive director of the polycarbonate / BPA global group of the American Chemistry Council .
" It presumably is in our diet . "
BPA is routinely used to line cans to prevent corrosion and food contamination ; it also makes plastic cups and baby and other bottles transparent and shatterproof .
When the polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins made from the chemical are exposed to hot liquids , BPA leaches out 55 times faster than it does under normal conditions , according to a new study by Scott Belcher , an endocrine biologist at the University of Cincinnati .
" When we added boiling water [ to bottles made from polycarbonate ] and allowed it to cool , the rate [ of leakage ] was greatly increased , " he says , to a level as high as 32 nanograms per hour .
A recent report in the journal Reproductive Toxicology found that humans must be exposed to levels of BPA at least 10 times what the EPA has deemed safe because of the amount of the chemical detected in tissue and blood samples .
" If , as some evidence indicates , humans metabolize BPA more rapidly than rodents , " wrote study author Laura Vandenberg , a developmental biologist at Tufts University in Boston , " then human daily exposure would have to be even higher to be sufficient to produce the levels observed in human serum . "
The CDC data shows that 93 percent of 2,157 people between the ages of six and 85 tested had detectable levels of BPA 's by - product in their urine .
" Children had higher levels than adolescents and adolescents had higher levels than adults , " says endocrinologist Retha Newbold of the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences , who found that BPA impairs fertility in female mice .
" In animals , BPA can cause permanent effects after very short periods of exposure .
It does n't have to remain in the body to have an effect . "
But experts are split on the potential health hazards to humans .
The Food and Drug Administration has approved its use and the EPA does not consider it cause for concern .
One U.S. National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) panel agreed , but another team of government scientists last year found that the amount of BPA present in humans exceeds levels that have caused ill effects in animals .
They also found that adults ' ability to tolerate it does not preclude damaging effects in infants and children .
" It is the unborn baby and children that investigators are most worried about , " Newbold says , noting that BPA was linked to increased breast and prostate cancer occurrences , altered menstrual cycles and diabetes in lab mice that were still developing .
Fred vom Saal , a reproductive biologist at the University of Missouri–Columbia , warns that babies likely face the " highest exposure " in human populations , because both baby bottles and infant formula cans likely leach BPA .
" In animal studies , the levels that cause harm happen at 10 times below what is common in the U.S. " says vom Saal , who also headed the NIH panel that concluded the chemical may pose risks to humans .
Amid growing concern , Rep. John Dingell ( D–Mich . ) chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce , has launched an investigation into BPA , sending letters last month to the FDA and seven manufacturers of infant products sold in the U.S. requesting information on any BPA safety tests as well as specific levels in the baby goods .
The companies that make Similac , Earth 's Best and Good Start have already responded , confirming that they coat the inside of their cans with BPA but that analyses did not detect it in the contents .
They also emphasize that FDA has approved BPA for such use .
" Based on the studies reviewed by FDA , adverse effects occur in animals only at levels of BPA that are far higher orders of magnitude than those to which infants or adults are exposed , " says FDA spokeswoman Stephanie Kwisnek .
" Therefore , FDA sees no reason to ban or otherwise restrict the uses now authorized at this time . "
FDA first approved BPA as a food container in 1963 because no ill effects from its use had been shown .
When Congress passed a law — the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 — mandating that the EPA conduct or review safety studies on new chemicals before giving them the nod , compounds like BPA were already on the market .
Therefore , they were not subject to the new rules nor required to undergo additional testing unless specific concerns had been raised ( such as in the case of PCBs ) .
" The science that exists today supports the safety of BPA , " ACC's Hentges says , based largely on research his organization has funded .
But other studies since 1976 have shown that small doses ( less than one part per billion ) of estrogenlike chemicals , such as BPA , may be damaging .
" In fetal mouse prostate you can stimulate receptors with estradiol at about two tenths of a part per trillion , and with BPA at a thousand times higher , " vom Saal says .
" That 's still 10 times lower than what a six - year - old has . "
In other words , children six years of age were found to have higher levels of BPA 's by - product glucuronide in their urine than did mice dosed with the chemical that later developed cancer and other health issues .
Further complicating the issue is the stew of other estrogen - mimicking chemicals to which humans are routinely exposed , from soy to antibacterial ingredients in some soaps .
The effects of such chemical mixtures are not known but scientists say they may serve to enhance the ill effects of one another .
" The assumption that natural estrogens are somehow immediately good for you and these chemicals are immediately bad , " Belcher says , " is probably not a reasonable assumption to make . "
The chemical industry argues that unless BPA is proved to have ill effects it should continue to be manufactured and used , because it is cheap , lightweight , shatterproof and offers other features that are hard to match .
" There is no alternative for either of those materials [ polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins ] that would simply drop in where those materials are used , " Hentges says .
Not so , says vom Saal , who notes that there are plenty of other materials , such as polyethylene and polypropylene plastics , that would be fine substitutes in at least some applications .
" There are a whole variety of different kinds of plastic materials and glass , " he says .
" They are all more stable than polycarbonate . "
Concern over BPA is not confined only to the U.S. Japanese manufacturers began to use natural resin instead of BPA to line cans in 1997 after Japanese scientists showed that it was leaching out of baby bottles .
A subsequent study there that measured levels in urine in 1999 found that they had dropped significantly .
A new E.U. law ( Registration , Evaluation , Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances , or REACH ) , which took effect last year , requires that chemicals , such as BPA , be proved safe .
Currently , though , it continues to be used in Europe ; the EFSA last year found no reason for alarm based on rodent studies .
European scientists cited multigenerational rat studies as reassuring and noted that mouse studies may be flawed because the tiny rodent is more susceptible to estrogens .
For now , U.S. scientists with concerns about BPA recommend that anyone sharing those worries avoid using products made from it : Polycarbonate plastic is clear or colored and typically marked with a number 7 on the bottom , and canned foods such as soups can be purchased in cardboard cartons instead .
If canned goods or clear plastic bottles are a must , such containers should never be microwaved , used to store heated liquids or foods , or washed in hot water ( either by hand or in much hotter dishwashers ) .
" These are fantastic products and they work well … [ but ] based on my knowledge of the scientific data , there is reason for caution , " Belcher says .
" I have made a decision for myself not to use them . "
The violin was made by Matteo Goffriller in Venice in 1698 A £ 10,000 reward is being offered for the return of a valuable 17th Century violin which was left on a train .
Robert Napier , from Wiltshire , had just had the 1698 Venice - made Goffriller valued by a London dealer at £ 180,000 .
He got off a Paddington to Taunton train at Bedwyn on 29 January with the family heirloom still on board .
" It was just one of those terrible moments when I realised , as the train was steaming off , that I had left it on the train , " he said .
Moment relived Despite raising the alarm soon after and a search being made of the train at Taunton station , the violin has not been found .
" I put it on the luggage rack above my seat and when I got to Bedwyn , got off the train and I simply left it .
I had my briefcase and coat , how I normally travel , " said Mr Napier .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" I 've relived the moment .
I think when I put it on the luggage rack I thought I could n't possibly forget it , and I did n't want to appear different .
I was trying to behave normally . "
Mr Napier jointly owns the instrument with his two brothers and two sisters , who inherited it from their mother , Elizabeth Hunt , from Wellington , Somerset .
During WWII , she performed with it entertaining troops as a member of an ensemble called the Ebsworth Quartet .
Later , she took the violin on travels abroad to India , Africa and Germany .
The missing Goffriller , together with a bow stamped R Sartory , were in a rectangular case with a brown cover .
Insurance company Allianz has offered a reward of up to £ 10,000 for the return of the instrument .

What are these ?
( CNN ) -- World Vision , one of the world 's largest humanitarian organizations , announced Tuesday that it cannot feed 1.5 million of the 7.5 million people it fed last year and made an urgent appeal for international donors to step in .
The price of wheat flour went up an average of 60 percent across Afghanistan last year .
The cutback could affect donations to 35 of the 100 countries in which the agency works , said Rachel Wolff , media relations manager for disaster response .
The cutbacks are occurring across the developing world .
Some of World Vision 's food aid programs have been cut altogether , such as those in East Timor and Sri Lanka , while others have been reduced , such as those in Burundi , Niger , Cambodia , North and South Sudan .
The cuts affect people in nearly every region of the world .
In Haiti , where food riots forced a change in government last week , the next major food shipment is not expected before June , and that will not meet the need , Wolff said .
" Though we 're able to feed people , we 're not feeding people as we would like , and those people we are feeding are getting less than we would like . "
She cited two primary , interconnected causes : an increase in food prices and an increase in the need for food .
Wolff said the magnitude of the shortfall is unprecedented and predicted that the situation " probably will get worse as the year progresses . "
" What 's unique about this is that it 's happening all over the world , " she said .
Among the causes is the diversion of corn to the production of ethanol rather than food , she said .
The spiraling price of fuel has aggravated the problem by boosting the cost of fertilizer and transporting food .
Wolff said child health experts worry that the impact of even a short period of malnutrition will endure for years .
" If the world community does n't invest this now , everybody will pay for it later , " she said .
" You will have massive economic implications for these countries .
Their work force wo n't have developed properly .
Not to mention that it 's horrific from a humanitarian standpoint .
Those are the things we 're sounding the alarm on . "
The cutbacks have already begun , said Dean Hirsch , president of World Vision International , in a written statement .
" Despite our best efforts , more than a million of our beneficiaries are no longer receiving food aid . "
More than half of them are children , he said .
He predicted the crisis will take at least two years to stabilize , " far too long for the millions of children who need sufficient levels of nutrition now to develop properly . "
The World Bank has also expressed dismay .
" Based on a very rough analysis , we estimate that a doubling of food prices over the last three years could potentially push 100 million people in low - income countries deeper into poverty , " World Bank President Robert B. Zoellick said in Washington last week .
" This is not just a question of short - term needs , as important as those are ; this is ensuring that future generations do n't pay a price , too . "
He has called for a " New Deal for Global Food Policy " to meet the crisis , as well as $ 500 million -- about half of which has been met -- from donor governments to close a gap identified by the United Nations ' World Food Programme .
But World Food Programme spokeswoman Bettina Luescher said Monday that the estimate had risen to $ 750 million over the past few weeks .
" We 're in the middle of a perfect storm here , " she said .
" There are food riots going on in scores of countries . "
She said the cost of rice in Cambodia has doubled in the past year , meaning that World Food Programme school lunch programs there may also end soon .
Taking away that safety net " can totally change their lives . "
Such programs run on as little as 25 cents per child per day , meaning that even private individuals can have some effect , she said .
" You can do it ; I can do it ; everybody can do it . "
Those countries most affected face more than a humanitarian crisis .
" It 's also a peace and security issue , " Wolff said .
" That is why it is so important . "
Malnutrition contributes to the deaths of more than 3.7 million children under 5 every year , according to World Vision , which began its work in 1950 by helping orphans of the Korean War .
Lack of food has also stunted the development of 147 million preschoolers in developing countries , the 31,000 - member agency said .
Malnourished children are also more likely to suffer and die from diseases like pneumonia , malaria and measles .

All About United Nations World Food Programme
Speaking at the one - day forum at UN Headquarters in New York , Mr. Kerim said it was a time “ for a holistic approach focused on people , their protection and empowerment ” and one that moves beyond the understanding of security as state security only .
The 2005 World Summit referred to the concept of human security , noting that “ all individuals , in particular , vulnerable people , are entitled to freedom from fear and freedom from want , with an equal opportunity to enjoy all their rights and fully develop their human potential . ”
The President said at today ’s debate that the international community should enhance its cooperation given the interconnectedness of people ’s insecurities .
“ As the global food crisis illustrates , a well - coordinated and integrated response by the international community is needed to address both the prevention stage as well as the full range of factors that affect people ’s well - being . ”
He called for a “ new culture of international relations ” with the principle of human security as its foundation .
Speaking to reporters later , Mr. Kerim said : “ It was stressed today that human security is relevant in many , many critical areas , important parts of the activities of people and of the global challenges of today . ”
The debate ’s keynote speaker , Prince El Hassan bin Talal of Jordan , also said the issue must be reframed to include the concepts of survivability and resilience .
Global imbalances in the realms of population growth , poverty , food , resources , ecology , migration , energy , money , peace and cultural understanding are “ multipliers ” of human security , in that they can exponentially affect lives by either providing stability or instability , he observed .
The Prince noted that “ States have not relinquished their sovereignty to cooperate with one another more effectively , and market - driven solutions have proven incapable of addressing the systemic problems that transcend national borders . ”
In his speech , he also said that representatives from all sectors – government , business and civil society – must establish a global programme of action to bring about an end to poverty and ensure adequate food supplies , a clean environment and stable purchasing power , among others .
“ When we say we are looking at human security , what we mean is that we want to alleviate the present situation by creating a system so that , as the future keeps arriving , it arrives in the form of better and better present situations , ” he said .
“ The consequences of what we do now must bring about a better present moment in which to live . ”
In 2006 , an open - ended forum comprising Member States from all regions called Friends of Human Security – of which the Prince is a member – was established to encourage collaboration among nations on the topic .
WASHINGTON , May 22 : A top American general on Thursday endorsed a US intelligence assessment that the next 9/11 - type attack on the US soil would come from Al Qaeda bases in Pakistan ’s tribal region but urged the United States to increase its security assistance to the country to help it deal with the threat .
Gen David Petraeus , a top US military commander nominated to lead the Central Command , told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Pakistan would be the first country he would visit , if confirmed , to assess its desire and capability to fight terrorism .
During the hearing , Senator Jack Reed , a Democrat , reminded the general that soon he would be in charge of US military operations for the region that included Pakistan .
He then recalled that a recent US intelligence assessment suggested that Al Qaeda had reconstituted itself in Fata and that the next 9/11 - style attack on the US soil might come from Pakistan .
“ Do you agree with those intelligence assessments ? ” asked the senator .
“ I do , Senator , ” said Gen Petraeus .
“ Clearly , Al Qaeda ’s senior leadership has been strengthened in the Fata , even as though their main effort still is assessed to be in Iraq by them , as well as by us .
But the organisation of an attack , if you will , would likely come from the Fata . ”
“ What does that say about our strategy ? ” asked Senator Reed , blaming the Bush administration for failing to engage the Pakistan military in effective counter - insurgency operations .
He reminded the general that recently , the government of Pakistan had entered into another “ stand - down ” agreement with the tribal leaders in Fata .
“ It seems to me that we have not made ( this ) existential threat , the main effort in our campaign plan for your theatre of operations .
What ’s your thought ? ” the senator asked .
“ Senator , clearly we have to provide additional assistance to the new Pakistani government , ” the general responded .
He noted that Islamabad ’s new rulers were “ still solidifying ” their coalition , developing a counter - insurgency strategy and an approach for dealing with Fata .
The new Pakistani government , he noted , inherited this problem , which “ was causing extraordinary violence in their country before they were elected ” .
Gen Petraeus said that two weeks ago he had “ a very long ” conversation with the US ambassador in Islamabad and others during a visit to Qatar and was convinced that the US had very substantial programmes for Pakistan .
“ But I think that the key need is to assess whether the overall concept that is guiding those on the Pakistani side , in particular , of course , is adequate or not , ” he added .
“ And one of the first trips that I would make , if confirmed as Centcom commander , would be to Pakistan , to sit down with a fellow US Army Command and General Staff College graduate , General Kayani , to talk at some length about that and , obviously , to do the same with the leaders of the Pakistani government . ”
He said the problem of terrorism in Fata had global implication and not just local extremist implications , for Pakistan .
Gen Petraeus advocated providing additional equipment and training facilities to the Pakistani troops to help them stop cross - border infiltrations into Afghanistan that were having “ a destabilising influence ” on the entire region .

I really like this game , because it shows how much you can accomplish when you do n't have much of a budget .
Granted , I guess that term does n't really apply to flash games .
What I mean is that it looks like it was n't made with a particularly high tech program but still turned out great .
This really goes to show you can make something simple but still enjoyable .
I guess it 's just because it 's something we 're all familiar with .
Every person has experienced ants taking over their food .
We really envision ourselves as exterminators when we take them out .
I think the sounds and music are pretty cute too .
My only complaint is that it is pretty hard to tell where those ants will go next .
Well , the general path is usually the same .
I love how funny the pizza slices look as they float around .
Daily Show : Do n't piss off Bush , let him override the Constitution David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday February 1 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This With its award - winning writing staff AWOL due to the writers ' strike , the Daily Show has had to rely more on Jon Stewart 's mugging and exaggerated takes .
But the show 's ratings are higher than before the strike began , and one blog suggests that the politicians may be funny enough to make up the difference .
For example , Stewart reported on Thursday 's Daily Show that " 9/11 fetishist " Rudy Giuliani has dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Sen.
John McCain .
" But what effect will Rudy 's presence have on the McCain campaign ? "
Stewart asked .
" I , like all Americans , will never forget the defining moment of recent American history , the tragedy of 9/11 , " McCain stated , with Giuliani at his side .
" How did Giuliani get him to do that ? " whispered Stewart apprehensively .
Stewart then went on to note that Congress recently passed a military spending bill , as is their constitutional duty .
" They get to raise and support armies , " Stewart stated .
" It 's in the Constitution , the funding and stuff . "
However , President Bush added four signing statements overriding various provisions of the bill .
" The passed and signed law says you can't spend taxpayer money to build permanent military bases in Iraq , " Stewart explained .
" And the president , I guess , is saying , ' Uh , yeah , no , I think I can . ' "
Stewart then asked Senior Correspondent Rob Riggle , " If there is any power explicitly granted to Congress , it would be allocating the budget .
...
But the president now is claiming he has the constitutional right to override them .
...
He 's done this for 1100 laws .
... How can he do this ? "
" It 's crazy , " agreed Riggle .
" But at this point , really , I 'd just let it go .
...
This guy has n't listened to anyone for seven years .
He 's got a year to go .
You 're just going to make him madder . "
Riggle then raised the analogy of a dumb and obnoxious student he knew in grade school , whose behavior his classmates kept trying to correct up until eighth grade , when they stopped bothering because they 'd realized that the next year they'd be going to high school while he'd be going to votech .
Riggle concluded , " Come inauguration day of ' 09 , George W. Bush is Platte County Tech 's problem . "
" And you 're our senior political correspondent ? "
Stewart asked incredulously .

I have a problem .
I ’m an introvert .
I ’m not shy .
I ’m not afraid of being in public .
But I am horrible at chit - chat and gossip .
If I spend an evening at a social function with people I do n’t know or do n’t like , I get home and feel like I ’ve spent all day at the ocean .
It ’s that fighting - the - waves and drained - by - the - sun kind of tired .
I would rather spend four hours with my head stapled to the carpet .
I would be more comfortable that way .
In engineering school , I was fine .
Engineering classes are n’t particularly interactive , and in study groups , we only spoke when needed .
In business school … well that was tough .
I tried to sit in the back most of the time so as not to participate .
But it was a mistake not to go to all the social functions .
There are probably people from my classes in high places now , and they wo n’t remember me and I do n’t know what they do .
For better or for worse , connections make the world go round .
Just this week I was reading about the importance of networks in the VC industry .
It applies to all of business though .
Knowing lots of people reduces your headaches by a factor of 10 when you need to get something done .
Requests from strangers do n’t get filled as quickly as requests from acquaintances or friends .
If you do n’t network , you find yourself in situations ( particularly as an entrepreneur or business owner ) where you need someone with a certain skill set and you do n’t even know where to start looking .
Then you have to advertise a position or opportunity , and weed through the applicants to find the 5 % that are actually worth talking to .
Over the last 7 years I ’ve made a lot of progress .
Here ’s what I ’ve learned about networking as an introvert .
Networking is an investment , not a nuisance .
Imagine if you could always find what you needed in just 1 or 2 phone calls .
If you are well networked , you probably can .
By putting in the time to build your network , you save time when you need to get things done .
Well networked people do n’t have to waste time firing off random emails to people they do n’t know , buying leads or industry lists , or hunting through hundreds of resumes for the right candidate .
Pick your poison .
Do you want to put in the time now , or later ?
At first , you have to kiss a lot of frogs .
Sometimes you have to start by picking events at random .
You spend an hour in a very uncomfortable setting , but you learn what to go to and what to skip .
Eventually you find a few people or events that you like .
Do n’t spend too much time on it .
If you wear yourself out , you wo n’t ever want to do it .
Accept your limitations and just do 1 or 2 events a month .
It takes a long time to build these relationships , so it ’s better to stick with a few groups over the long haul than 10 groups for two months .
Do cool things .
Introverts typically do n’t like to talk about themselves – we prefer to talk about ideas .
Force yourself to discuss some of the things you ’ve done .
Do n’t brag , make sure they are relevant to the conversation .
Then the extroverts can talk about you and pass your achievements along .
It gives you credibility in some circles .
Yes , I realize you would rather be accepted for what you think and know , but the truth is that the world measures you by what you do .
Invite people to lunch .
Or invite them to coffee or for a beer after work .
If you meet a fellow introvert , he / she is unlikely to do the inviting , so you have to do it .
Go regularly to things you like .
When I was living on the Space Coast , I went to a group called Founders Forum .
It was for entrepreneurs and investors .
I learned a lot at the meetings , but it took about 6 months for people to start recognizing me and saying hi .
It was uncomfortable , being 23 in a room of mostly middle aged people .
You just have to keep showing up , month after month .
Analyze your results .
Introverts are intuitive and analytical .
Use that skill .
What is working ?
What is n’t ?
Where do you get the most bang for your buck ?
Find the key nodes in the network .
Do n’t find a marketing person , find someone who knows lots of marketing people and then invite that person to lunch .
If networking wears you out , you will be better off finding the ten key people who all know lots of other people , than finding and maintaining fifty relationships .
This takes a long time because it is hard to find the right person .
Look for introverts that , for whatever reason , are in jobs that force them to be well connected .
Extroverts that share one of your core passions are also a good match .
Do n’t network just for the sake of networking .
There is a book called “ Never Eat Alone ” .
That ’s all fine and good for extroverts , but we introverts ca n’t network just to network .
As you meet more people , focus on spending your time with the ones that are the best fit , and focus less on meeting new people .
The hardest part for me was the first few events .
I sometimes feel like I do n’t know what to say when I meet new people .
I would be soooo much more comfortable if someone started a conversation by asking me what I thought of utilitarianism as a way to make ethical decisions , or whether Sarbanes - Oxley has encouraged companies to list on other exchanges .
Ideas usually seem so much more interesting than people .
But , by sticking it out , month after month , I ’ve slowly learned some good things to say , and grown more comfortable meeting strangers .
So trust me when I say it gets easier .
The majority gets to set the rules , and the majority of people are extroverts ( 70 % I think ) .
Networking is an important key to unlocking your own potential .
So play by the rules of the game the best that you can , or do n’t sit and complain when you have a great idea and no one to help you launch it .
I hope you can learn from my experiences , so that you do n’t waste as much time as I did fighting the inevitable .

Good luck and good coding !
On a cold Saturday in New York City , the world ’s largest train terminal came to a sudden halt .
Over 200 Improv Everywhere Agents froze in place at the exact same second for five minutes in the Main Concourse of Grand Central Terminal .
Over 500,000 people rush through Grand Central every day , but today , things slowed down just a bit as commuters and tourists alike stopped to notice what was happening around them .
Enjoy the video first and then go behind the scenes with our mission report and photos .
The Main Concourse before we arrive
Back in 2006 we had around 200 people shop in slow motion at a Manhattan Home Depot .
For part two of that mission everyone froze in place .
As it turned out the slow motion was subtle , but the freezing in place was absolutely striking .
I wanted to recreate the frozen idea , but this time in a larger , more open space .
Home Depot had many aisles and multiple floors so you could never see more than a handful of frozen people at a time .
At Grand Central ’s enormous Main Concourse , we would be able to see everyone simultaneously .
We met in nearby Bryant Park and synchronized our watches .
We would freeze at exactly 2:30 PM .
A nice mix of people of all ages and races showed up , so we would look like any random sample of New Yorkers before we froze .
The room starts to fill up moments before go time
The clock strikes 2:30
Another thing we learned at the Home Depot mission is that it ’s really tough to convey this idea through photographs .
Everyone is frozen in place in a photo .
Our chief photographer Chad Nicholson toyed with his exposure a bit to help compensate .
Those not frozen are blurry .
We filmed this mission discreetly from the upper balcony and with a roaming agent on the floor with a camera sticking out of a cart of luggage .
Agent Hurn films
At one point a guy driving some type of maintenance cart entered the concourse and was stopped in his tracks by our frozen agents .
Fortunately there were just a few seconds left in the mission .
We unfroze before he got too frustrated .
We got great reactions from the folks who encountered us .
Strangers started talking to each other , trying to figure out what was going on .
With wireless microphones hidden in our shirts , a few agents and I struck up conversations with folks .
I convinced one guy to grab a cell phone from a frozen woman ’s hand .
He did it , laughing uncontrollably as he gently put it back in her hand .
My favorite reaction was from a female cop who witnessed the whole thing from behind her NYPD recruitment booth :
Me : Do you know what that was ?
Cop : I have no idea !
That is the craziest shit I ’ve ever seen in my life , AND I ’M A COP !
Me : Ha .
Yeah , it was weird .
Cop :
You wanna sign up to be in the NYPD ?
Me : No thanks .
Folks gawk and smile
It was fun to see all the different choices people made for their frozen moment .
I did n’t give any instructions in advance .
I just told everyone to be doing something realistic and not jokey .
One guy dropped an entire briefcase full of papers the second before he froze , leaving his papers scattered before him for five minutes .
Many froze midway through eating or drinking .
A few froze while taking off a jacket .
One couple froze kissing .
I ’ve put together some animations of a few of my favorite moments .
It ’s fun to watch each one through multiple times , focusing on different parts of the image .
You can try to figure out how many people in each image are actually frozen .
Agent Nicholson was not shooting from a tripod , so on some of these the image shifts slightly from frame to frame .
I ’ve spaced them out so you can focus on one at a time .
Notice the agent spilling the papers left center , and the agent taking his jacket off right center ( this animation may not work in all browsers , get Firefox . )
Several agents froze looking at maps and train schedules
I love this woman ’s expression
These agents froze taking a photo , complete with “ bunny ears ”
A five - minute kiss

Who dreams up a car that runs on wood or coffee grounds or a way to turn road traffic into energy ?
Technology is always unpredictable and no one knows for sure what the future holds .
Some of these ideas are brilliant and some are bizarre but at least these folks are thinking way outside of the box .
The truck above , for example , runs on a strange combination of vegetable oil and ammonia .
Fueling your vehicle with coffee sounds like a strange alternative use for caffeine but it gets better : you do n’t have to waste your favorite roast , you can simply use your remnant grounds .
Through through process of gasification the reused grounds are carefully converted into a burnable fuel .
Using leftover alcoholic beverages as fuel is actually nothing new – they have been doing it with banned booze in some countries for years !
All the same it is a ‘ local ’ way to take leftovers you are n’t using ( like that bottle of vermouth you seem to never go through ) and make something useful out of it .
Powering a car with wood may not be the most ecological power innovation in this list but it is at least an example of thinking of ways to run vehicles on anything but fossil fuels – a step in the right direction .
All the same , emissions are of course still a major issue to be considered .
Using cars to create power is brilliant but also a bit puzzling : the process takes energy from one of the most wasteful energy consuming activities in the world and at least salvages a portion of that energy in a clean fashion .
So far this is in prototype stages but in essence pressure is used by plates beneath roads to compress hydraulic fluid .
The bigger the truck , the more power it uses but the more it generates as well !
Best of all , you could turn around and funnel this energy into hybrid fueling stations – essentially getting a second round of energy out for the same vehicular use .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Foreclosure filings in the first three months of 2008 rose more than 112 % over last year , according to a study released Tuesday .
Real estate information firm RealtyTrac reported that nearly 650,000 foreclosure filings - which include notices of default , auction sales and bank repossessions - were issued in the first quarter .
That represents 1 of every 194 households and marks a 23 % increase from the last quarter of 2007 .
So far this year 156,463 families have lost their homes to repossessions .
" Foreclosure activity has n't slowed down yet , " said Rick Sharga , spokesman for Realty Trac .
" But I was a little surprised that foreclosure filings more than doubled since last year . "
Foreclosures increased in 46 states and in 90 of the nation 's 100 largest metro areas .
Some regions that had been only marginally hurt by the mortgage meltdown recorded large increases in filings .
In Connecticut , for instance , filings tripled compared with the first three months of 2007 .
Massachusetts recorded a 260 % increase .
Nevada : Hardest hit
The worst hit states are still clustered in the Southwest ; Nevada , California and Arizona lead the nation in foreclosure filings .
Prices ran up rapidly in these areas during the bubble years as speculators snapped up single - family homes and condos as investments .
In the first quarter , 1 of every 54 homes in Nevada received some type of foreclosure filing - more than any other state .
Its largest city , Las Vegas , had 1 out of every 44 homes go into foreclosure .
Stockton , Calif. , had the highest foreclosure rate out of any U.S. metro area , with 1 out of every 30 homes receiving a notice - nearly seven times higher than the national average .
The Riverside / San Bernardino region had the second highest rate in the quarter , with one of every 38 homes in default .
Only two metro areas in the ranks of the 20 hardest hit were outside the Sunbelt - Detroit , which ranked sixth in the nation with 1 in every 68 households in default , and Cleveland which saw 1 in every 105 homes go into foreclosure .
The news comes despite increased foreclosure prevention efforts by lenders and community organizations .
Hope Now , the coalition of mortgage lenders , servicers investors and community groups , announced Monday that it helped over a half a million home owners avoid foreclosure during the first three months of the year .
And some local governments have stepped up their programs to help borrowers , according to RealtyTrac CEO James Saccacio .
" For example , in late March Philadelphia issued a temporary moratorium on all foreclosure auctions for April , " he said .
" The city has since adopted a program that will delay foreclosure proceedings on owner - occupied properties until the owners have met face - to - face with lenders to attempt to create a loan workout plan that would prevent foreclosure . "
More trouble ahead
Additionally , lawmakers in Washington , D.C. are at work on several plans that would deliver foreclosure relief to distressed borrowers .
All of these foreclosure prevention efforts may not be able to stand up to the tsunami of foreclosures on the way .
Sharga says that a record number of hybrid adjustable rate mortgages ( ARMs ) - worth $ 362 billion - will reset in 2008 .
These so - called " exploding ARMs " usually have low introductory interest rates that reset much higher after two or three years , and then re-adjust as often as every six months after that .
Unless these loans can be reworked , many will fail .
" We expect to see another foreclosure peak in the late third or fourth quarter of the year , " said Sharga , " because of the record number of resets coming . "
Introduction
Can you write a command line tool ?
Maybe you can , but can you write a really good command line tool ?
This articles covers making a robust command line tool in Python , complete with built - in help menus , error handling , and option handling .
For some strange reason , it is not widely known that the standard library in Python® has all of the tools necessary to make incredible powerful * NIX command line tools .
Arguably , Python is the best language for making * NIX command line tools , period , due to its batteries - included philosophy , and its emphasis on readable code .
Just a warning , though ; these are dangerous ideas , when you find out how easy it is to create a command line tool in Python , you might be spoiled for life .
To my knowledge , there has never been an article published in this detail on creating command line tools in Python , so I hope you enjoy it .
Setup
The optparse module in the Python Standard Library does most of the dirty work of creating a command line tool .
Optparse was included in Python 2.3 , so this module will be included on many NIX Operating Systems .
If for some reason , the operating system you are on does not include a module you need , it is a great comfort to know the latest versions of Python have been tested and compiles on just about any NIX Operating Systems .
Python support includes IBM ® AIX® , HP - UX , Solaris , Free BSD , Red Hat Linux® , Ubuntu , OS X , IRIX , and even a Nokia phone or two .
Creating a Hello World command line tool
The first step to writing a great command line tool is to define the problem you wish to solve .
This is critical to the success of your tool .
It is also important to solve the problem in the simplest way possible .
The KISS principle , Keep It Simple Stupid , definitely applies here .
Add options and increased functionality only after the planned functionality is implemented and tested .
Let ’s get started by creating a Hello World command line tool .
Following the advice above , let ’s define the problem in the simplest possible terms .
Problem Definition : I would like to create a command line tool that prints Hello World by default , but takes an option to print the name of a different person .
Given that description , this is one possible solution that comes in at just a handful of lines of code .
Hello World command line interface ( CLI )
#!/usr/bin/env python import optparse def main ( ) : p = optparse .
OptionParser ( ) p.addoption ( '‑‑person ' , ' ‑p ' , default = " world " ) options , arguments = p.parseargs ( ) print ' Hello %s ' % options .
person if name == ' __main ' : main ( )

If we run this code , we get the expected output of :
Hello world Show more
Show more icon
Our handful of code does quite a bit more than that , though .
We get a help menu for free :
python hello_cli.py ‑‑help Usage : hello_cli.py options Options : ‑h , ‑‑help show this help message and exit ‑p PERSON , ‑‑person=PERSON
Show more Show more icon
We can see from the help menu that we have two ways to change the output of Hello World :
python hello_cli.py ‑p guido Hello guido
Show more
Show more icon
We also get error handling for free :
python hello_cli.py ‑‑name matz Usage : hello_cli.py options hello_cli.py : error : no such option : ‑‑name Show more
Show more icon
If you have not used the optparse module in Python , you might be jumping out of your seat right now , thinking about all of the incredible tools you can write in Python .
If you are new to Python , it might surprise you know that everything is this easy in Python .
There is a funny comic about this very subject of “ how easy Python is , ” by “ xkcd ” that I have included in the Related topics .
Creating a useful command line tool
Now that we have the basics out of the way , we can move onto creating a tool to solve a specific problem .
For this example , we will be using a Python network library and interactive tool called Scapy .
Scapy works on most * NIX systems , can send packets on layer 2 and layer 3 , and allows you to create incredibly sophisticated tools in just a few lines of Python .
If you would like to follow along from home , make sure you have the proper prerequisites installed .
Let ’s define a new problem to solve .
Problem : I would like to create a command line tool takes an IP address or a subnet as an argument , and return a MAC address or a list of MAC addresses with their respective IP address to standard out .
Now that we have a clearly defined problem , let ’s try to separate the problem in the simplest possible pieces , and solve those pieces individually .
For this problem I see two separate pieces .
The first piece is to write a function that takes an IP address or a subnet range , and returns a MAC address or MAC addresses .
We can worry about integrating this into a command line tool after we solve this problem .
Solution Part 1 : Creating a Python function to determine MAC addresses from IP addresses
arping
from scapy import srp , Ether , ARP , conf conf.verb=0 ans , unans=srp( Ether(dst=" ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff " ) / ARP( pdst=" 10.0.1.1 " ) , timeout =2 ) for snd , rcv in ans : print rcv.sprintf(r " %Ether.src % % ARP.psrc % " )
Show more

The output of the command is :
sudo python arping .
py 00:00:00:00:00:01 10.0.1.1
Show more
Show more icon
Note that doing operations with scapy requires escalated privileges , so we must use sudo .
I also change the real output to include a fake MAC address for the purpose of this article .
Now that we have proven we can find out a MAC address from an IP address .
We need clean up this code to take an IP address or subnet and return a MAC address and IP address pair .
arping function
#!/usr /bin/env python from scapy import srp , Ether , ARP , conf def arping ( iprange = " 10.0.1.0/24 " ) : conf.verb=0 ans , unans=srp( Ether(dst=" ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff " ) / ARP ( pdst=iprange ) , timeout =2 ) collection = for snd , rcv in ans : result = rcv.sprintf( r " %ARP.psrc % % Ether.src % " ) .split( ) collection.append( result ) return collection # Print results values = arping ( ) for ip , mac in values : print ip , mac Show more Show more icon
As you can see , we have a function that takes an IP address or network and returns a nested list of IP / MAC addresses .
We are now ready for part two , which is creating a command line interface for our tool .
Solution Part 2 : Creating a command line tool from our arping function
In this example , we combine ideas from the previous portions of the article to make a complete command line tool that solves our original specification .
arping CLI
#!/usr /bin/env python import optparse from scapy import srp , Ether , ARP , conf def arping ( iprange = " 10.0.1.0/24 " ) : " " " Arping function takes IP Address or Network , returns nested mac / ip list " " " conf.verb=0 ans , unans=srp( Ether(dst=" ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff " ) / ARP ( pdst=iprange ) , timeout =2 ) collection = for snd , rcv in ans : result = rcv.sprintf( r " %ARP.psrc % % Ether.src % " ) .split( ) collection.append( result ) return collection def main ( ) : " " " Runs program and handles command line options " " " p = optparse .
OptionParser ( description= ' Finds MAC Address of IP address ( es ) ' , prog= ' pyarping ' , version= ' pyarping 0.1 ' , usage= ' % prog [ 10.0.1.1 or 10.0.1.0/24 ] ' ) options , arguments = p.parseargs ( ) if len( arguments ) == 1 : values = arping ( iprange=arguments ) for ip , mac in values : print ip , mac else : p.printhelp ( ) if name == ' __main ' : main ( )
Show more
Show more icon
A few points of clarification on the script above might help our understanding of how optparse works .
First , an instance of optparse .
OptionParser ( ) must be created and it takes the optional parameters shown above :
description , prog , version , and usage Show more Show more icon
These should be self explanatory for the most part , but I want to make sure that it is understood that while optparse is incredible , it is not magic .
It has a clearly defined interface that enables rapid creation of command line tools .
Second , in the line :
options , arguments = p.parse_args ()
Show more
Show more icon
this is where values for options and arguments get divided into distinct bits .
In the above code , there will be exactly one argument that we expect , so I have specified that there must be only one argument value , and that value gets passed into our arping function .
if len( arguments ) == 1 : values = arping ( iprange=arguments )
Show more
Show more icon
To clarify even further , let ’s run the command and see how this works :
sudo python arping .
py 10.0.1.1 10.0.1.1 00:00:00:00:00:01
Show more
Show more icon
In the above example , the argument is 10.0.1.1 and because there is only one argument , as I specified in the conditional statement , it is passed into the arping function .
If we had options , they would be handed to options in the options , arguments = p.parse_args ( ) idiom .
Let ’s look at what happens when we break the intended use case of our command line tool and assign it two arguments :
sudo python arping .
py 10.0.1.1 10.0.1.3 Usage : pyarping 10.0.1.1 or 10.0.1.0/24 Finds MAC Address or IP address ( es ) Options : ‑‑version show program 's version number and exit ‑h , ‑‑help show this help message and exit Show more Show more icon
Because of how I structured the conditional statement for arguments , it will automatically bring up a help menu if the number of arguments is below one or greater than one :
if len( arguments ) == 1 : values = arping ( iprange=arguments ) for ip , mac in values : print ip , mac else : p.print_help ()
Show more
Show more icon
This is an important way to control how your tool works as you can use the number of arguments , or name of a specific option as the mechanism to control the flow of your command line tool .
Since we have covered creating options in the very first Hello World example , let ’s add a couple of options to our command line tool by changing the main function slightly :
arping CLI main function
def main ( ) : " " " Runs program and handles command line options " " " p = optparse .
OptionParser ( description= ' Finds MAC Address of IP address ( es ) ' , prog= ' pyarping ' , version= ' pyarping 0.1 ' , usage= ' % prog [ 10.0.1.1 or 10.0.1.0/24 ] ' ) p.add_option ( '‑m ' , ' ‑‑mac ' , action =' store_true ' , help=' returns only mac address ' ) p.add_option ( '‑v ' , ' ‑‑verbose ' , action =' store_true ' , help=' returns verbose output ' ) options , arguments = p.parse_args ( ) if len( arguments ) == 1 : values = arping ( iprange=arguments ) if options.mac : for ip , mac in values : print mac elif options .
verbose : for ip , mac in values : print " IP : %s MAC : %s " % ( ip , mac ) else : for ip , mac in values : print ip , mac else : p.print_help ( )
Show more
Show more icon
The main thing to take away from the changes is that we have created conditional statements based on whether an option has been specified or not .
Notice , unlike the Hello World command line tool , we are only using the options as a true / false signal to our tool .
In the case of the –MAC option , if it is specified , our conditional elif statement only prints the MAC address .
Here is the output of the new options :
arping output
sudo python arping2.py Password : Usage : pyarping 10.0.1.1 or 10.0.1.0/24 Finds MAC Address of IP address ( es ) Options : ‑‑version show program 's version number and exit ‑h , ‑‑help show this help message and exit ‑m , ‑‑mac returns only mac address ‑v , ‑‑verbose returns verbose output [ ngift@M ‑6 ] [ H:11184 ]
J:0 10.0.1.1 00:00:00:00:00:01 [ ngift@M‑6 ] [ H:11185 ] J:0 00:00:00:00:00:01 [ ngift@M‑6 ] [ H:11186 ]J:0 IP : 10.0.1.1 MAC : 00:00:00:00:00:01

Here are a few more ideas for further study .
They will be covered in great detail in the book I am co-authoring on Python for * NIX Systems Administration , which is due out in mid-2008 .
Using subprocess module in a command line tool
The subprocess module is included with Python 2.4 or greater and is a unified interface for dealing with system calls and processes .
You could easily replace the arping function above to use an arping tool available to your specific * NIX operating system .
Here is a rough example of what that could look like :
Subprocess arping
import subprocess import re def arping ( ipaddress = " 10.0.1.1 " ) : " " " Arping function takes IP Address or Network , returns nested mac / ip list " " " # Assuming use of arping on Red Hat Linux p = subprocess .
Popen ( " /usr/sbin/arping ‑c 2 %s " % ipaddress , shell = True , stdout=subprocess .PIPE ) out = p.stdout.read ( ) result = out.split( ) pattern = re.compile ( " : " ) for item in result : if re.search ( pattern , item ) : print item arping ( )
Show more
Show more icon
Here is the output of this function run standalone : [ root@localhost ] ~ # python pyarp.py [ 00:16 :CB:C3:B4:10 ]
Notice the use of subprocess to grab the output of the arping command , and the use of a compiled regular expression match to the MAC address .
Note , if you are on Python 2.3 , you could use the popen module instead of subprocess , which became available in Python 2.4 or greater .
Using an Object Relational Mapper , such as SQLAlchemy or Storm with SQLite , in a command line tool
Another potential option for a command line tool is to use an ORM , or Object Relational Mapper , to store records for data generated by a command line tool .
There are quite a few ORM ’s available for Python , but SQLAlchemy and Storm happen to be two of the most popular .
I flipped a coin and decided to use Storm for this example :
Storm ORM arping
#!/usr/bin/env python import optparse from storm.locals import * from scapy import srp , Ether , ARP , conf class NetworkRecord ( object ) : storm_table = " networkrecord " id = Int( primary = True ) ip = RawStr ( ) mac = RawStr ( ) hostname = RawStr ( ) def arping ( iprange = " 10.0.1.0/24 " ) : " " " Arping function takes IP Address or Network , returns nested mac / ip list " " " conf.verb=0 ans , unans=srp( Ether(dst=" ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff " ) / ARP ( pdst=iprange ) , timeout =2 ) collection = for snd , rcv in ans : result = rcv.sprintf( r " %ARP.psrc % % Ether.src % " ) .split( ) collection.append( result ) return collection def main ( ) : " " " Runs program and handles command line options " " " p = optparse .
OptionParser ( ) p = optparse .
OptionParser ( description= ' Finds MACAddr of IP address ( es ) ' , prog= ' pyarping ' , version= ' pyarping 0.1 ' , usage= '% prog [ 10.0.1.1 or 10.0.1.0/24 ] ' ) options , arguments = p.parseargs ( ) if len( arguments ) == 1 : database = createdatabase ( " sqlite : " ) store = Store ( database ) store.execute ( " CREATE TABLE networkrecord " " ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY , ip VARCHAR , \ mac VARCHAR , hostname VARCHAR ) " ) values = arping ( iprange=arguments ) machine = NetworkRecord ( ) store.add ( machine ) # Creates Records for ip , mac in values : machine .mac = mac machine .ip = ip # Flushes to database store .
flush ( ) # Prints Record print " Record Number : %r " % machine .id print " MAC Address : %r " % machine.mac print " IP Address : %r " % machine .ip else : p.printhelp ( ) if _name == ' __main ' : main ( )

The main thing to look at in this example is the creation of a class called NetworkRecord that maps to an “ in memory ” SQLite database .
In the main function , I changed the output of our arping function to map to our record objects , flushed them to the database , then pulled them back out again to print the results .
This is obviously not a production tool , but an instructive example of the steps involved in using an ORM with our tool .
Integrating config files into the CLI
Python INI config syntax
[ AIX ] MAC : 00:00:00:00:02 IP : 10.0.1.2 Hostname : aix.example.com [ HPUX ] MAC : 00:00:00:00:03 IP : 10.0.1.3 Hostname : hpux.example.com [ SOLARIS ] MAC : 00:00:00:00:04 IP : 10.0.1.4 Hostname : solaris.example.com [ REDHAT ] MAC : 00:00:00:00:05 IP : 10.0.1.5 Hostname : redhat.example.com [ UBUNTU ] MAC : 00:00:00:00:06 IP : 10.0.1.6 Hostname : ubuntu.example.com [ OSX ] MAC : 00:00:00:00:07 IP : 10.0.1.7 Hostname : osx.example.com
Show more Show more icon
Next we need to parse this using the ConfigParser module :
ConfigParser function
#!/usr/bin/env python import ConfigParser def readConfig( file= " config.ini " ) : Config = ConfigParser.ConfigParser ( ) Config.read ( file ) sections = Config.sections ( ) for machine in sections : #uncomment line below to see how this config file is parsed # print Config.items ( machine ) macAddr = Config.items ( machine ) [ 0 ] `` [ 1 ] print machine , macAddr readConfig ( )
Show more
Show more icon
The output of this function is :
OSX 00:00:00:00:07 SOLARIS 00:00:00:00:04 AIX 00:00:00:00:02 REDHAT 00:00:00:00:05 UBUNTU 00:00:00:00:06 HPUX 00:00:00:00:03
Show more
Show more icon
I will leave the rest of the problem solving as an exercise to the reader .
What I would do next is to integrate this config file into my script such that I could compare an inventory of machines kept in my config file against the actual inventory of MAC addresses that appear in the ARP cache .
An IP address or a hostname is only so useful in tracking down a machine , but our potential tool could be a very useful way to track the hardware address of a machine on your network and determine if it was on the network .
Conclusion
We started with a few lines of code to create a very basic but powerful Hello World command line tool .
We then moved on to create a sophisticated network tool using a Python Networking Library .
Finally , we proceeded to look at more advanced areas of study for the motivated reader .
In the advanced research section , we looked at integrating the subprocess module , Object Relational Mappers , and finally configuration files .
Although it is apparently a secret , anyone with an IT background can create a command line tool with Python with a little effort .
I hope this article has inspired you to go out on your own and create the next revolutionary command line tool .
After years in the shadows , the open source Python programming language is becoming increasingly mainstream .
There are more users and more tools .
Backers of Python now argue that Python is ready for the enterprise .
But in a programming world already filled with languages such as Java , .NET , PHP and Ruby competing for share , is Python getting a bite ?
Its backers think so .
" Python is already being used at the enterprise level in many areas , and has been for years , " said David Goodger , the director of the Python Software Foundation .
" It 's amazing to see the uses that Python is being put to , in Web services , commercial applications , and in - house projects , " he told InternetNews.com .
Originally created back in 1991 by Guido van Rossum ( who is now employed by Google ) , the Python development language is now overseen by the non-profit Python Foundation .
Goodger estimates that 80 to 90 percent of software development is done in - house , such as ultra-specialized mission - critical applications that are only used by one organization .
" Python lowers the bar to the point where it 's possible for the users to tweak their own software , " he said .
" The source code is easy to understand , the basic tools are all free , and there 's no arcane build process to go through .
Users can fix bugs and instantly react to changes .
Python is ideal for in - house development . "
Kevin Dangoor , co-author of " Rapid Web Applications with TurboGears : Using Python to Create Ajax - Powered Sites , " thinks Python is already a mature technology -- and ready for its close - up in the enterprise .
TurboGears is a Python framework that has become increasingly popular in recent years .
Dangoor noted that Python is used by many large sites , including YouTube , and even as part of software used to manage rendering jobs , such as for director George Lucas 's films .
Michael Foord , Senior Software Engineer at Resolver Systems and author of " IronPython in Action , " thinks Python has reached a critical mass of adoption within the past few years , and , in his view , is seen as a legitimate language to use in an enterprise .
" The good news for Python programmers is that demand seems to be exceeding supply , but that will correct itself with time , " Foord told InternetNews.com .
While Python can stand on its own merits , Foord noted that particularly important for Python adoption is the fact that both Jython ( Python on the Java VM ) and IronPython ( Python on . NET ) are now both in a good state .
" This means that where the standard technologies are built on Java and .NET , Python is still a viable choice of programming language , " Foord said .
While there is certainly competition among development languages , Python Foundation Director Goodger noted that the Python community tends to take a low - key approach though .
" Python does n't have a huge marketing machine behind it , " Goodger said .
" We use grass - roots methods , word of mouth .
Python is not a fad , and there are no gimmicks . "
There are some significant challenges facing Python , not the least of which are the large numbers of developers currently using Java and PHP .
Dangoor who is also a Product Manager at Web application developer SitePen , commented that for Java programmers , the barrier is likely that Python is dynamically typed whereas Java is statically typed .
" I am firmly in the camp that believes that static typing does not buy you much safety and that you need good automated tests to help ensure that your code is correct and stays correct , " Dangoor stated .
" However , it is also true that static typing gives IDEs more information that they can use in helping out the user .
Ultimately , though , Python 's language features make your code so much simpler that you very quickly get over some of the IDE extras that you get from static typing . "
PHP developers face an entirely different challenge .
Dangoor noted that early on in TurboGears ' days , he heard from PHP programmers that were looking for more structure .
" The greatest barrier for adoption by PHP people is likely the completely different deployment model and organizational structure for programs , " Dangoor explained .
" Python uses namespaces heavily , and PHP is just now getting namespaces .
To deploy PHP programs , you just drop the files on the server and hit reload in your browser .
Everything is loaded entirely on each request in PHP , which is both a blessing and a curse . "
For Python Foundation Director Goodger the principal barriers to adoption for Python come down to three things : inertia , misconception , and awareness .
" Many businesses see the software development world in terms of Visual Basic , Java , and C/C++/C# .
Some simply are n't aware of Python , yet , " Goodger argued .
" Any competent programmer can easily learn Python and be productive within a few hours or days at most . "
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - A barrage of about a dozen rockets struck near Baghdad ’s fortified Green Zone diplomatic and government compound on Sunday evening in what appeared to be one of the biggest strikes in weeks .
The rockets could be heard whistling past from the east of the Iraqi capital as they flew in the direction of the riverside compound and exploded , Reuters correspondents on the opposite river bank said .
The strikes took place during a heavy sandstorm .
U.S. forces normally use helicopters to retaliate against fighters who target the Green Zone , but sandstorms prevent the helicopters from flying , letting fighters strike with impunity .
U.S. and Iraqi forces say Shi’ite militiamen have fired more than 700 rockets and mortars over the past month , many aimed at the Green Zone and most fired from the capital ’s Sadr City slum , stronghold of the Mehdi Army militia of Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr .
U.S. forces have occupied the part of Sadr City closest to the centre in an effort to reduce the rocket attacks , but have not moved further into the slum .
Over the weekend Stuart Hicks emailed the OSI about an odd statement made by McAfee in its white paper on botnets [ PDF ] :
Taking the bot controller ofﬂine may kill a botnet .
As a result , many bots use a Dynamic Domain Name System ( DDNS ) or have a list of backup IP addresses to survive such an event .
Bot technology is rapidly evolving , often aided and abetted , unfortunately , by the open - source movement .
[ Emphasis mine . ]
Huh ?
No justification is made for this statement .
No follow - on , explanatory comments are made .
Someone at McAfee thinks that the correlation between botnets and open source is clear , but I am struggling to grasp any connection between the two .
Perhaps this is just one more example of McAfee 's dubious grasp on reality when it comes to open source .
Remember its statement that open - source licensing is a threat to its business ?
Consider the definition of a botnet :
While the term " botnet " can be used to refer to any group of bots , such as IRC bots , the word is generally used to refer to a collection of compromised computers ( called zombie computers ) running programs , usually referred to as worms , Trojan horses , or backdoors , under a common command and control infrastructure .
The majority of these computers are running Microsoft Windows operating systems , but other operating systems can be affected .

( CNN ) -- U.S. Marine Cpl. Mario Ramos - Villalta put on his freshly pressed uniform early Thursday as a citizen of El Salvador .
By the end of the day , he would be a citizen of the United States of America .
Mario Ramos - Villalta earned U.S. citizenship Thursday after two combat tours in Iraq .

" I am an American , " he said with a smile moments after his paperwork cleared .
" It means a lot to me after so many years and two combat deployments , I finally get it , being an American .
We are happy about it . "
" It 's all thanks to CNN -- my news coming out , my story .
That helped me out a lot , " he said , referring to a story about his plight run March 20 by CNN.com .
See up - close photos of Ramos - Villalta »
Ramos - Villalta , with his father at his side , went to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in downtown Los Angeles , California , where dozens of other immigrants were crowded in hopes of becoming American citizens .
Soon , Ramos - Villalta , 22 , was called into an office where he answered some questions before his citizenship was finally cleared .
A few hours later , he was sworn in at a naturalization ceremony with another Marine , Lance Cpl. Jose M. Tress , 23 , of Mexico , and a sailor , Cpl. Marco A. Guzman , 28 , of the Phillipines .
For Ramos - Villalta 's dad , it was a lifelong dream :
His son is the first family member to become an American citizen .
" I 'm very proud of him , as is his mother , and all his brothers and sisters , " Mario Ramos said .
The father came to the United States from El Salvador in the 1980s .
He said his son wanted to be a member of the U.S. military since he was very young .
Watch a smiling Ramos - Villalta describe " I finally got it " »
His family has always supported him , but his father said they constantly worry about him when he's in a war zone , and they do n't want him to get deployed again .
" It 's what he wants , but his mother and I worry about him all the time .
We 're always watching the news wondering if he 's safe or if anything happened to him . "
But Ramos - Villalta is about to deploy to Afghanistan , his third combat tour .
He twice served in Iraq , where he earned a Purple Heart .
Ramos - Villalta said that finally getting citizenship lifts a huge burden , ahead of his deployment next month .
" It feels way better now .
There 's no more stress , " he said .
" I really get to fight for my country now . "
Ramos - Villalta fled El Salvador 's civil war in 1989 with his family as a young boy and lived in the United States for a time .
Though he returned to El Salvador with his mother while his father stayed in California to work , he eventually made it back to Southern California and got his green card when he was 13 .
He graduated from Santa Ana High School in Santa Ana , California , in 2004 , becoming the first in his family to graduate from high school .
He then joined the Marines , becoming one of an estimated 20,500 " non-U.S. citizens " -- dubbed " green - card warriors " -- currently serving in the military .
The path to citizenship has been all the more difficult because he 's been at war and wounded in action , with little time to deal with the paperwork and lawyers needed to file for citizenship .
But his new citizenship gives him hope for others in his position .
" I just hope that everybody else in the same situation gets citizenship real fast and the government can speed up the process . "
The United States has tried to make it easier for foreigners serving in the military to become citizens .
After the September 11 terrorist attacks , President Bush signed into law a measure allowing active - duty non-citizens who have served honorably in war on or after September 11 , 2001 , " to file for immediate citizenship , " according to the Defense Department .
Since that time , nearly 37,000 non-citizens of the U.S. armed forces have gotten citizenship , according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services .
Another 7,300 have requests still pending .
It typically takes seven to 10 months to process an application .
As of Thursday , there 's at least one request that is no longer pending .
" I finally get to wear the uniform of my country , " he said .
" I do n't feel left out . "

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
In late January , Jim Sims , the president and CEO of the Western Business Roundtable , an industry trade group that represents mining and energy interests , told his colleagues to prepare for the worst :
The polar bear was almost certain to receive “ threatened ” status under the Endangered Species Act .
“ The negative implications of this to business and industry [ are ] breathtaking , ” he wrote in an email , obtained by Mother Jones .
But , he said , his and other groups had devised a plan to fight and “ quite possibly reverse ” the imminent ruling .
Part of that strategy involved a legal challenge to the listing .
On that score , Sims promised they had “ secured a truly extraordinary plaintiff for this effort : one of America ’s most prominent civil rights leaders of the four past decades . ”
That prominent plaintiff was Roy Innis , the longtime chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality .
A civil rights group that dates back to the 1940s , CORE ’s agenda has taken a distinct rightward tilt under Innis ’ leadership , aligning itself with conservative activists opposed to the environmental movement .
Speaking in March at a conference of global warming skeptics sponsored by the Chicago - based Heartland Institute , which has received more than $ 600,000 in funding from ExxonMobil since the late ’90s , Innis announced that his organization , itself a recipient of Exxon funding , would sue the Bush administration if the polar bear were listed .
He cast the issue as one of economic justice , if not civil rights , saying that the pending ruling would “ result in higher energy prices across the board which will disproportionately be borne by minorities , ” causing “ countless families in our country in winters ahead to choose between food on the table and fuel in the furnace . ”
Should the polar bear receive ESA protection in a decision expected by early next week , legal challenges , full - press lobbying , and media campaigns designed to portray the listing as a devastating financial blow to a country already in economic turmoil are just the tip of the proverbial iceberg .
“ You ’re going to start seeing lawsuits like dandelions in a field the day after the regulations are filed , ” Sims told me .
Innis says , “ I will join anyone who wants to fights this thing .
There is nothing that ’s impacting us more than $ 4 gasoline .
It ’s going to impact so heavily minorities and poor people .
This should be the major talking point in the presidential campaign . ”
Since 2005 , when the Arizona - based Center for Biological Diversity petitioned the Fish and Wildlife Service to list the polar bear as a threatened species , a broad coalition of industry and conservative groups have watched , with increasing dread , as the petition slowly worked its way through the Interior Department , helped along by lawsuits filed by environmental groups .
Almost since the ink dried on the ESA more than thirty years ago , conservatives have bridled at its strictures , viewing the law as an affront to free - market principles and an impediment to businesses seeking to develop land or extract natural resources .
But , even in this context , the polar bear ’s possible ESA listing has elevated the debate to a fever pitch .
“ Compared to this decision , the Spotted Owl and Snail Darter cases were pimples on an elephant , ” Chuck Cushman , the founder of the American Land Rights Association , told recipients of his email list this winter in an “ all out call to action ” that implored supporters to “ deluge the White House and Interior Department with calls , faxes and emails . ”
By this he meant that , unlike typical ESA listings , protections for the polar bear could extend well beyond its natural habitat in the US , along the Beaufort and Chukchi seas of northern and western Alaska .
Based on scientific studies showing that global warming is rapidly deteriorating the Arctic sea ice that polar bears call home , the CBD ’s endangered species petition was among the first to tie greenhouse gas emissions to the fate of a species .
It was no accident .
If the petition succeeds , it could prompt a wholesale shift in federal climate - change policy , potentially forcing a wide array of industries nationwide , and the energy sector in particular , into compliance with the ESA .
Under this scenario , says Kassie Siegel , the CBD attorney who coauthored the organization ’s polar bear petition , “ If you have an action that ’s going to lead to a major amount of greenhouse gas emissions , you also need to consider the cumulative impact of those emissions on polar bears and look at ways to reduce those emissions . ”
Cushman , who says he is not opposed to protecting the polar bear or even reducing greenhouse gases , told me he believes that bringing emissions under the purview of the ESA could result in turning small industrial enclaves into ghost towns .
“ We have to keep in mind that people are an important species too , ” he says .
“ Instead of a radical regulatory regime , we have to have a moderate , gradual swing . ”
But to environmental activists like Siegel , the time for swift action is now .
“ Behavior needs to change , ” she says .
“ And litigation changes behavior .
It ’s a good thing if we have fewer coal - fired power plants and less offshore oil and gas development .
To say that it ’s going to shut down the economy , that ’s just incorrect .
It ’s mumbo jumbo . ”
The Bush administration has kept the polar bear petition in limbo for more than three years and , overall , has resisted taking steps to address global warming — even going so far as to suppress climate - change research and other studies by government scientists deemed out of step with the White House ’s agenda .
Among the officials discovered to be playing politics with science was Julie MacDonald , a former deputy assistant secretary at the Interior Department , and , for five years , the person in charge of overseeing the Fish and Wildlife Service ’s ESA program .
Last March , an investigation of MacDonald by the Interior Department ’s inspector general reported that she had “ been heavily involved with editing , commenting on , and reshaping the endangered species program ’s scientific reports from the field , ” despite her lack of a “ formal educational background in natural sciences . ”
Though she resigned last May , amidst news that she had passed internal agency documents to industry lobbyists , the pace of the listing process did not pick up .
In January , the Fish and Wildlife Service missed its deadline for issuing a decision , while the Interior Department ’s Minerals Management Service almost simultaneously announced plans to auction off oil - and gas - exploration leases in the Chukchi Sea , the very heart of polar bear country .
This move was seen as no accident by environmentalists , and was sharply criticized by Barbara Boxer , the chair of the Senate ’s environment and public works committee .
At this point , however , the administration has put off the ruling as long as it can .
Last week a federal judge ordered the Interior Department to weigh in on the polar bear petition once and for all by May 15 , leaving conservative opponents to the ESA listing bracing for the worst — and strategizing their counterattack .
Sims , of the Western Business Roundtable , whose members include Shell , Marathon Oil , and the API ( formerly the American Petroleum Institute ) , says it ’s possible that the administration may take a middle road , conferring ESA protection but not linking the polar bear ’s decline with global warming — effectively declawing the listing of its full regulatory impact .
This outcome would be unlikely to please either side in this debate .
“ That does n’t mean that the next administration , starting in January 2009 , wo n’t redo the listing , and link the two , ” Sims explains .
“ In my mind , it ’s only a matter of time .
One way or another we ’re going to be in the soup . ”
While the groups opposed to the polar bear ’s ESA listing have argued that it will result in a flood of environmental lawsuits , these same groups are readying for their own legal onslaught .
According to Sims ’ January email , the lawsuit by Roy Innis , of the Congress of Racial Equality , will be central not only to the legal campaign conservative groups plan to wage against the polar bear listing , but to their media offensive as well .
“ Our plaintiff ’s action will give us a very high visibility national media platform on day one , ” he wrote in his message .
Sims went on to say that plans were in the works for a 15 - city bus tour to promote the litigation and that Fox News ’
Sean Hannity “ has committed to me that he will put our plaintiff and this issue front and center on his radio and television shows when we launch . ”
He continued , “ We should be able to very quickly take over this issue from the radical enviro groups and place it squarely where it belongs : on the negative impacts this decision will have on the poor . ”
A longtime energy lobbyist who once served as the communications director for the controversial energy task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney , Sims told me that part of his organization ’s campaign would entail educating the public on the “ weakness of the science underscoring this petition . ”
Yet scientists have been fairly clear about the plight of the polar bear and its root causes .
Among other studies showing that the polar bear and its habitat are in peril , government researchers with the US Geological Survey reported in September that due to melting sea ice caused by climate change , two - thirds of world ’s polar bear population could die off by 2050 .
Nevertheless , during our conversation Sims told me that the “ polar bear population is at one of its highest levels in nearly four decades ” ; that polar bears are actually “ doing well ” ; and that the species has lived “ quite nicely through periods , thank you very much , when there ’s no polar ice . ”
As it happens , it ’s prime polar bear watching season , and many of the top experts in the field have decamped to the Arctic to study them .
Among them is the University of Alberta ’s Andrew Derocher , who ’s currently in Tuktoyaktuk , on the Beaufort Sea in Canada ’s Northwest Territories .
“ It ’s looking to be one of the worst years I ’ve seen up here in a long time , ” he says .
“ It ’s probably an extension of the low ice year we saw last year in the Beaufort Sea , actually throughout the Arctic .
We have n’t done anywhere near what we ’d normally do .
We ’re just not seeing many bears here .
I know from talking on email with Alaskan colleagues they ’re seeing something very similar this year as well . ”
Derocher , a leading polar bear ecologist , first traveled to Tuktoyaktuk to study the bears more than 20 years ago .
“ It looks nothing , nothing like it did back then , ” he says .
“ It was heavy , thick ice ; it was cold ; there were bears everywhere . ”
Derocher estimated that he and his colleagues are only able to cover about 20 percent of the ground they used to .
The rest is open water and thin , broken ice too treacherous for the researchers to venture onto via helicopter .
There ’s even a possibility that Derocher and his colleagues may depart the Arctic early this year .
“ If we shut down this program early , it ’s going to be because there are no bears around here , which is highly unusual .
And there really is no ice for them to be on , so any bears that are in this area are really far away on the drifting pack ice . ”
When I asked him what he made of the current debate over the polar bear in the US , he told me that he was yet to be convinced that listing the bear would “ have any major change on current policies on a global basis that deal with the root factor of habitat loss , which is human - induced climate change . ”
That said , he believes the campaign to win the bear ESA protection is worthwhile if only as a means of putting a face on the climate crisis .
“ Polar bears as a species are something that people can relate to .
It acts as a motivational factor for people to consider at least whether or not there are things they can do to change their behaviors to reduce their impact . ”
The conservative activists and industry reps on the other side of this debate are well aware of the polar bear ’s power to tug at the heart strings and make the environmental effects of climate change tangible .
If the polar bear does receive ESA protection , it ’s precisely this image that they plan to target .
“ Up until now , polar bears have been iconic for the environmental community , ” says Sims .
“ I think once it becomes widely known how this polar bear listing is actually going to hurt average Americans and not help the polar bear , I think that iconic image is going to shift .
And frankly , we ’re going to help do that . ”

Former prosecutor testifies that Guantánamo military commissions are show trials
By Richard Phillips
6 May 2008
In a damning exposure of the US military trials of Guantánamo Bay detainees , Air Force Colonel Mo Davis , the former chief prosecutor at the American prison camp , told a pre-trial hearing on April 28 that senior government and Pentagon officials had corrupted US military justice and that former Australian prisoner David Hicks should never have been charged .
Davis was appearing as a defence witness for Yemeni prisoner Salim Admed Hamdan , who has spent six years in Guantánamo , mostly in solitary confinement .
His testimony further highlights the criminal conspiracy between Washington and Canberra to demonise and incarcerate Hicks for almost six years and the lack of basic legal rights for hundreds of other detainees .
Davis has made similar statements to the media before but his latest comments were the first made under oath .
One of the reasons he quit his position as chief prosecutor last year was in protest over the backroom deal organised between Washington and Canberra to secure the release of Hicks before the 2007 Australian federal election .
Davis told the hearing that deputy defence secretary Gordon R. England and other top Pentagon officials wanted the highest - profile detainees put on trial before this year ’s US election because they thought it would have “ strategic political value ” .
Davis testified that he told Defence Department general counsel William J. Haynes III that some defendants could be acquitted .
Haynes , according to Davis , responded by declaring : “ Wait a minute , we ca n’t have acquittals .
If we ’ve been holding these guys for so long , how can we explain letting them get off ? ...
We ’ve got to have convictions . ”
Under questioning by Hamdan ’s defence lawyers , Davis also explained that Air Force Brigadier General Thomas W. Hartmann had sanctioned the use of evidence obtained from water - boarding , a well - known torture technique .
“ To allow or direct a prosecutor to come into a courtroom and offer evidence they felt was torture , puts the prosecutor in an ethical bind , ” Davis said .
But Hartmann dismissed the concerns , stating that “ everything was fair game — let the judge sort it . ”
Hartmann reports directly to Susan Crawford , who is the Convening Authority for the Guantánamo commissions .
Crawford is a protégé of US Vice President Dick Cheney and was appointed to the position by him .
She was principally responsible for organising the plea - bargain deal with Hicks ’s defence lawyers .
Davis said that while he was chief prosecutor he was pressured to impose charges on David Hicks even though , contrary to the claims of Washington and Canberra , the Australian was not dangerous or a high profile figure .
“ The seriousness of what he did , ” he told the hearing , “ would not have met my minimum threshold . ”
Contrary to standard plea - bargaining practice , Davis was not involved in any way with the deal made with Hicks ’s lawyers .
As he told the Australian newspaper last October : “ I think it is a disgrace to call it a military commission — it is a political commission . ”
An unnamed senior US military officer also told Harper ’s Magazine last year : “ One of our staffers was present when Vice President Cheney interfered directly to get Hicks ’s plea bargain deal .
He did it , apparently , as part of a deal cut with Howard .
I kept thinking : this is the sort of thing that used to go on behind the Iron Curtain , not in America .
And then it struck me how much this entire process had disintegrated into a political charade . ”
A day after Davis ’s accusations , army prosecutor Lieutenant - Colonel William Britt said in a sworn statement that Hartmann chose who would be put on trial in Guantánamo according to whether they would “ seize the imagination of the American public ” or not .
In other words , the decisions were made on a political , not a legal basis , to suit the Bush administration ’s propaganda requirements .
Michael Berrigan , deputy chief defence lawyer for Hamdan , testified that Hartmann was a bully who refused lawyers ’ requests for experts and facilities to help prepare their cases .
Berrigan told the hearing that the current charges against six Guantánamo prisoners , who have been accused of involvement in the September 11 terror attacks and could be executed , were drafted by civilian lawyers working for Hartmann .
Berrigan said that Hartmann had copies of the charges two weeks before military prosecutors had signed them .
These comments are not only an indictment of the lawlessness of the Bush administration but also of the Howard government which waged a protracted campaign of slander and vilification against Hicks .
Canberra provided the Bush administration with a blank cheque to do what it wanted to Hicks , justifying the denial of legal representation for more than a year and other violations of his basic rights as necessary for the “ war on terror ” .
Likewise , Labor Party politicians , state and federal , refused to lift a finger to assist Hicks .
Only after a nation - wide movement emerged demanding Hicks ’s release did a few Labor officials began to timidly criticise the Howard government .
Elected to power last November , the Rudd Labor government refused to demand Hicks ’s immediate release from the South Australian prison , where he had been moved to serve out his last nine months under the plea-deal .
And when Hicks was eventually released in late December 2007 , Labor supported a federal police demand for a 12 - month control order on the still traumatised young man .
The measure involves a midnight to 6 a.m. curfew , the monitoring of all his communications and compels
Hicks to report to police three times a week .
South Australian state Labor premier Mike Rann has continued to vilify the young man and passed special legislation to confiscate any money earned by Hicks for media interviews or for any publication about his treatment in Guantánamo .
Not surprisingly , the Rudd government has not issued any statement on Davis ’s sworn testimony exposing the nature of the Guantánamo military commissions .
The Australian media , which played a filthy role in slandering Hicks , has said virtually nothing about Davis ’s comments .
Terry Hicks , David ’s father , and lawyer David McLeod told the World Socialist Web Site that Mo Davis ’s testimony vindicated their long and difficult struggle .
“ Mo Davis , who is out of the system , can now say what he really thinks and that he would n’t have even charged David , ” Terry Hicks said .
“ This shows what we ’ve been saying over the years is right — that David was being used for political purposes and that the military commission system was established for political gains , both in the US and here .
It was a system set up to crucify people .
“ I heard state premier Mike Rann still going on the other night on television about how David was a self - confessed terrorist because he signed the paper work .
I just laughed .
How the hell can people like this stand up straight ?
Howard , Rann and others — they ’ve all told lies about David and so I guess they have to keep doing it .
Eventually though they back themselves into a corner , which is what John Howard found out , ” Hicks said .
David McLeod was asked at a recent legal conference if the Rudd Labor government was any different from the former Howard government in relationship to its treatment of David Hicks .
McLeod did n’t mince words : “ The whole area of politics , once you have been involved in it as I have , ” he replied , “ is a teeming morass ; it is rotten , filled with maggots .
“ You can trust nobody or anything anybody tells you — even if there are 12 bibles in front of you and the body of their dead grandmother that has been sworn on — which is why the government in every respect would have to be just like the previous government . ”
Despite Davis ’s statement , little will change for those incarcerated in the American prison hellhole .
Guantánamo commissions allow hearsay and coerced evidence ; defendants are not allowed to make habeas corpus petitions to force a review of their detention ; and guilt or innocence is decided by a majority vote by panels of serving military officers .
Yemeni prisoner Salim Admed Hamdan , who could be subjected to a full military trial in May , the first one held in Guantánamo since it was established , is suffering from severe mental health problems .
According to his lawyers he is suicidal , hears voices , has flashbacks and talks to himself .
He is kept in solitary confinement in a 2.4 metre - by - 3.7 metre ( 8 feet - by - 12 feet ) cell for at least 22 hours per day .
Pentagon officials , however , deny that such conditions are producing mental health problems and cynically claim that Guantánamo does not have solitary confinement but only “ single - occupancy cells ” .
In 2002 the Department of Defense stopped reporting suicide attempts in Guantánamo and redefined them as “ self - injurious behavior ” .
According to human rights organisations , there were 350 self - harm incidents in 2005 and four prisoners committed suicide between 2006 and 2007 .

The beginning ...
08/15/1995 : I decided to take the plunge : attempt to convert a gas powered automobile into an Electric Vehicle ( EV ) .
I 'd read about it in books and magazines , and had followed other folks on the web exchanging their experiences and technology news .
It should be noted that I am not a professional EV person , nor do I represent any or play one on TV .
I learned as I went : making mistakes , back - tracking , skinning knuckles , and doing some prettly lame ( in retrospect ) things .
Still , I thought it would be fun to document this journey even if it ran in fits and starts and took all winter .
Read : Electric Car Conversion Welcome !
With the increasing cost of gas , more and more folks have been visiting this EV conversion chronicle .
I 've also seen an increase in email feedback : " will my car make a good EV ? " , " what batteries should I use ? " , " why do n't you put solar panels on it ? " , and so forth .
Last fall my EV was in need of new batteries , four new tires , and a fair amount of rust repair .
Instead of investing money into that vehicle I decided that it was time to start looking for a new donor and start a new conversion .
All of the parts from the old EV are still in great shape ( except the batteries , of course ) so now all I need to find is a nice , small ( two door ? ) donor ( bonus points if it has same bell housing as a Mazda 626 ) and some garage space to do the conversion .
This means I 've also started looking at batteries again and surveying the rest of the EV landscape .
To better document and share my findings ( and eventual re-conversion ) I 've created an all - new website .
New layout , new code underneath , and even it 's own domain : www.evconvert.com.
I invite you to join me .
If you are starting a conversion , selling EV parts , even building EVs commercially please feel free to drop me an email so I can include you on the new website .
“ Multi - tty support ” is a feature that is currently in Emacs CVS for what will eventually become Emacs 23 .
It lets different Emacs windows ( “ frames ” ) share the same session .
This means that you ’ll always have all your buffers , and Emacs starts faster .
Emacs has had this “ emacsclient ” feature for a long time now , where you can edit new files in an Emacs instance that is running as “ server ” , but what is new is that you no longer have to hunt for where you had started Emacs first — you can simply edit in a new frame .
For example , if you had originally started Emacs under X , and you log in remotely , you can reuse the running Emacs process by starting a new “ frame ” in the terminal .
Instead of explaining better what it does , I ’ll let you see for yourselves :
video by EnigmaCurry
Note that it is not necessary that all ( or any ) of them be in a terminal — you can have multiple GTK Emacs windows too .
Also , note that every new window starts with the * scratch * buffer , not necessarily the same buffer as the one on top in other windows .
Installing :
Multi-tty Emacs used to be maintained separately ( which is why older posts have complicated instructions ) , but it has been merged into the main Emacs CVS branch for a long time now .
This means that it is available on Ubuntu by simply installing the emacs - snapshot package ( this has been true since 2007 - 09 - 02 ) .
On other distributions / platforms , use whatever it takes to get Emacs from CVS .
Using :
To use it , start one Emacs session , and , if you do n’t have ( server - start ) in your .emacs already , do M-x server - start .
Once done , you can either leave this Emacs window hanging around , or hide it , or whatever .
Now to start subsequent Emacs instances , use emacsclient -c .
The “ - c ” stands for “ - ­ - create - frame ” , and means that a new Emacs “ frame ” is started instead of using the old one .
( Emacs calls windows frames and what it calls “ windows ” is closer to “ frames ” in a web browser . )
Use emacsclient -t if you want to start it in the terminal .
It appears that you can quit each individual instance the normal way with C-x C-c ; it is not necessary to use C-x 5 0 ( that ’s delete - frame ) .
Further :
Some things you can do to make life easier .
Put ( server - start ) in your .emacs if you have n’t done so already .
Michael Olson suggests using ( unless ( string - equal " root " ( getenv " USER " ) ) ( server - start ) ) , but I do n’t recall having ever needed that .
in your .emacs if you have n’t done so already .
Michael Olson suggests using , but I do n’t recall having ever needed that .
Automatically start an Emacs session at login and hide it , so that it runs like a “ daemon ” and you can simply use emacsclient -c consistently and forget about it .
You can use screen -d -m emacs - nw , or use the more lightweight dtach : dtach -n /tmp/ emacs emacs -nw
, or use the more lightweight dtach :
Do the above with some “ name ” for your emacs server .
You can give your server a name by using ( setq server - name " asdf " ) before ( server - start ) , then you can can connect to it with emacsclient -s asdf -c ( or -t ) .
I do n’t entirely see the utility of this ; it might be so that you do n’t start extra servers by mistake and always use the same one .
There are scripts to do this .
before , then you can can connect to it with ( or ) .
I do n’t entirely see the utility of this ; it might be so that you do n’t start extra servers by mistake and always use the same one .
There are scripts to do this .
You could probably combine all the above by writing a wrapper that checks if a server exists , connects to it if it does , else starts one , etc. , and use that wrapper as your default system editor .
That is what the wrapper script “ ec ” at EnigmaCurry does .
It would be nice if Emacs made this the default , though : Starting Emacs would by default work as multi-tty and share session with whatever previous Emacsen had been started , unless one explicitly told it not to do so .
Why not ?

Visit our newly re-purposed MondoGlobo Network to get more involved with this idea and / or in a social network for people who question authority .
This proposal is meant to be considered alongside , or in conjunction with my other recent Open Source Party proposal .
They can both be discussed within active , dedicated groups at the new MondoGlobo social network , along with related issues .
We 've witnessed , in recent years , the death of many of our constitutional rights and liberties .
We 've also seen increasingly authoritarian trends in daily life and culture .
Those of us who would prefer to keep our freedoms have been relatively powerless as the events of 9/11 have created an atmosphere of fear and acquiescence .
Everybody knows the litany : the virtual death of habeas corpus , the legalization of surveillance against all Americans , the lawlessness and usurpation of powers by the executive branch , ad infinitum .
It is time for all those who oppose this gathering trend towards the worst type of authoritarian governance and culture to put aside their differences and join together in a coalition that can act as a counterforce to this gathering threat to our liberties .
It is time for QuestionAuthority ( QA ) .
QuestionAuthority is an educational and advocacy project dedicated to defending and extending personal and civil liberties and encouraging free expression .
Our goal is to create a broad - based coalition of non-authoritarian groups and individuals who may currently be working in relative isolation on single issues , for political organizations and candidates , or in relatively isolated ideological cohort groups .
As a cohesive force , we can do more than just stem the tide one issue — or one court case — at a time .
We can exercise political and cultural influence by uniting the vast numbers of Americans who believe that the country has taken a radical turn in an authoritarian direction .
We ask you to please endorse the QA Platform below .
You can demonstrate your endorsement of the QA Platform by joining the dedicated group on the MondoGlobo Network , and by so joining , you 'll send a message to the nation and the world .
We call for the resurrection of all basic liberties and protections – including protections against pervasive surveillance – taken away by the federal government and by the executive branch of the Federal Government resulting directly , or obviously , as the result of reactions to the events of 9/11 We call for maximum state transparency ( an end to excesses in state secrecy ) .
This would include a generous and resilient usage of the Freedom of Information Act ; procedural oversight that can bring sane boundaries into the process of classifying materials ; and a movement towards the greatest possible realistic use of open source information - sharing and problem - solving in areas related to defense and intelligence .
We call for the restoration of a robust system of checks and balances and separation of powers , meant by the Founders to keep concentrated growths of political malfeasance shaken and unable to take root .
We are particularly concerned about centralized power within the Executive Branch of government .
In this context , we emphasize a return to active use of " The War Powers Act " in which substantive military campaigns have to be approved by the US Congress .
We call for an end to the so - called " war on drugs . "
This drug war has resulted in frequent violations of limits against search and seizure and an abhorrently large prison population , among other forms of abuse by authorities .
( There is room within QA for those who would like an outright end to prohibition as well as for those who prefer more cautious approaches like reform and medicalization to bring to an end the more draconian aspects of the " drug war . " )
We call for continued vigilance in the defense of free expression , both in the technical legal sense and in a broader socio-cultural sense .
There must be a vibrant , vital dialogue around possible contemporary threats to free expression that might not strictly fall under the rubric of censorship .
Issues worthy of dialogue and debate include excesses in copyright , hypersensitivity , pressures wrought by corporate media consolidation , state intimidation ( such as Congressional hearings ) and intimidation of discourse during times of war or during the buildup towards war .
The action agenda for the QA is simple .
We will monitor , inform about , and coordinate public educational responses against any further assaults on the basic constitutional liberties of Americans , and will organize information and educational responses to civil liberties already lost to the " war on terror .
" Imagine every authoritarian absurdity and outrage carefully explored and catalogued on a single website .
Imagine networked groups that can spring into action to alert and educate the public the next time authorities savage the Bill of RightsWe will do everything in our power to bring non-authoritarian and anti-authoritarian thinkers and speakers before the public and particularly before youth .
Imagine a QA publicity / speakers bureau that would get a wide variety of QA types onto college campuses , on the various media talk shows ( let 's change the dialogue from Right v. Left to Authoritarian v. Non-Authoritarian ) and before various civic groups .
We will encourage , initiate , and provide an online place for a wide - ranging discussion among supporters of the QA principles .
We envision a QA virtual library of various " question authority " texts , videos , audio files , blogs and other media forms that give expression to diverse non-authoritarian and anti-authoritarian views .
We envision QA members organizing meetups , regional meetings , local forums and perhaps an annual or semi-annual QA conference .
We envision QA members and supporters expressing these concepts in their own style through their own websites , wikis , blogs , videos , podcasts , and through other forms of communication directed towards those who are not online .
What is the difference between QA and other organizations and candidates that fight for our rights ?
First of all , our goal is to create a broad - based coalition of non-authoritarian groups and individuals who may currently be working in relative isolation on single issues , for political organizations and candidates , or in relatively isolated ideological cohort groups .
Also , in cases where civil liberty types of issues are involved , people tend to sit back and let them be fought out in the court .
As a cohesive force , we can do more than just stem the tide one issue — or one court case — at a time .
We can exercise political and cultural influence by uniting the vast numbers of Americans who believe that the country has taken a radical turn in an authoritarian direction .
Secondly , look again at what we promise to do in terms of organizing informational and educational materials .
If these things were being done by anyone else , we would n't need to do them .
QA proposes to be dynamic and participatory in ways that other organizations are not .
Why should non-authoritarians want to unite in a big centralized organization ?
They should unite only to the extent that it 's necessary to show our numbers to the nation and amplify our influence as a way to counteract the influence of well - organized authoritarians .
How many times , in recent years , have you heard folks wonder why people do n't " do something " when major , fundamental outrages against basic constitutional liberties are committed by the state ?
Now imagine a large , networked group of " question authority " types who can spring into action the next time something of this sort occurs to educate and advocate .
Next time , do something !
Additionally , the " myth " of a grand QA with a large membership filled with both influential and diverse people could have power to influence media and political discourse .
How will the QA be organized ?
QA will seek tax - deductible non-profit status .
We imagine a very minimal centralized " bureaucracy . "
Everything about the actions of the QA as an organization , including its use of funds , will be open and transparent .
For a brief period , QA decisions will be made by a Board of Directors .
It will be comprised of people representing a wide variety of political ( and perhaps " anti-political " ) views .
We would hope to move quickly towards making decisions via open source , democratic processes .
We also imagine that many QA activities , right from the start , will be decentralized and taken by local and cohort groups .
This document calls for action to educate and alert the pubic about basic losses of essential liberties .
Is n't it time to move beyond education and into activism ?
The rules guiding the creation of an educational organization and the rules around activism are subtly different .
There is room for activist types of activity in an educational context , and those kinds of responses can be discussed and debated by the group .
Also , some people will be more comfortable joining an informational / educational project than an activist project and we want a big fat sassy coalition .
Who will join the QA ?
We hope everybody who agrees with our platform ( or who agrees , but with minor quibbles ) will join us , so that our numbers and influence will act as a powerful counterforce against the authoritarian activists .
Let 's let them know we 're here .
But let 's be blunt .
It 's obvious that many of those who agree with this platform will tend to be people who are labeled " liberal " and " libertarian . "
Beyond that , we believe that this coalition will appeal to an even larger disenfranchised group of Americans who believe in questioning authority , but who have very few ideological certainties .
Finally , let 's be excessively blunt .
We want all the nation 's most influential anti-authoritarian individuals and organizations to join in this coalition .
We want the ACLU and the Cato Institute ; Bob Barr and Mos Def ; the EFF and the People for the American Way ; MoveOn.org and AntiWar.com ; Hitchens and Chomsky ; Penn Jillette and George Carlin , Reason magazine and Harpers magazine ; Howard Stern and Amy Goodman ; Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich ; Paris and Nicole… ( OK , maybe not . )
Anyway , by now , you get the point .
These days , those of us who question authority find ourselves shocked and astonished by the actions of the state – both small and large – on nearly a daily basis .
As individuals , we find ourselves wondering , " Why is n't there mass outrage ?
" Of course , there is quite a bit of outrage .
It 's distributed all over the web and all over the culture , but this sense of outrage does not have the coherence it needs to be perceived as a player on America 's political stage .
We can no longer afford to let that be the case .
We need to act now .
Over more than 10 years of contracting as an IT Business Analyst , I ’ve learned there are two main reasons companies hire contractors .
Either they ’re running some huge sprawling project and want to throw more bodies at it or they do n’t have the in house expertise for a particular project so they want to bring in an outsider who does .
Although the big , sprawling projects are a major source of employment , I really do n’t like working on them .
The main reason for my dislike is that most of these massive projects are disasters .
The company is trying to do too much with too little idea of how to do it .
The classic nightmare for IT staff is to be stuck in a project that ’s date driven .
By “ date driven ” I mean that the only way the project is measured is by whether or not is it delivered by some totally arbitrary date .
It ’s bad enough when you have to deal with a project manager who wants you to bow down before their Gantt chart as if it ’s Holy Scripture .
But I have actually worked on multi-million dollar projects where all activity is driven by the fact that someone in senior management has said it should be done by a certain date .
There ’s nothing that fills a development team with horror quite so much as something along the lines of “ the new financial system wil be in place before the end of the financial year . ”
And when you ask how that date was arrived at you get little more than “ that should be enough time . ”
As an analyst I find that sort of crap particularly galling because people who think this is a good way to run a project usually get pissed off when I start actually doing my job .
They get pissed off because my job is to ask questions and arbitrarily set dates usually do n’t hold up well to questioning .
Here ’s an approximation of fun conversations that happen on projects like this
BOSS : The project has to be completed by the end of the year
ME : What ’s actually involved ?
B : A new CRM system has to be installed .
It will replace thee old stand alone systems and make us more efficient .
M : But what ’s actually involved ?
B : I just told you , we ’re implementing a new CRM system .
M : But what has to happen for that to be installed ?
You said it ’s replacing three existing systems , what happens to the data stored in those systems ?
There ’s no way we ’ll be lucky enough that the new system handles data exactly the same way .
Can it be configured to handle existing data somehow or will that require programming changes ?
Or is that not even possible which means we ’ll have to convert the existing data to a usable format ?
Can we do that via an automated process or will it have to be done manually ?
And what about other systems that had interfaces to the systems being replaced ?
How many interfaces to the new system are required and how long will it take to develop all of them ?
And what about the users ?
Have you checked that the new system can actually meet all of their requirements ?
Are they going to have to change any existing processes in order to use the new system ?
Have you allowed enough time for training ?
And how does it affect external suppliers ?
( At about this point I can see the boss is making a mental note that I ’m a troublemaker .
I can see it in his eyes . )
B : We do n’t know the answers to any of those questions but we ’ve committed to meeting the delivery date .
I ’m sure if we all get on board and make a commitment as a team we can make it happen .
( At this point I ’m making a mental note that the boss is a fucking moron .
I hope he ca n’t see it in my eyes . )
M : But you have n’t even defined what “ it ” is .
You made a commitment to deliver the project by a set date without even quantifying what work has to be performed .
How can you possibly commit to a date when you do n’t even know what you have to do ?
B : If we discover that the volume of work is too much for the existing team to handle then we ’ll add more people to the team .
M : Have you ever read “ The Mythical Man Month ” ?
B : Never heard of it .
M : That does n’t surprise me .
The book “ The Mythical Man Month ” was written more than 30 years ago by a manager at IBM .
The single most important point in the book can be summarised as “ adding people to a project that is already behind schedule will make it later ” .
The main reason for this is that the more people you add , the more convoluted lines of communication become until it gets to the point where communication takes more time than the work itself .
There ’s also the fact that when a project becomes severely behind schedule resourcing usually is n’t the main problem .
An utter lack of direction from clueless management is usually the bigger issue .
Software development is one of the fastest changing industries in the world .
But even after 30 years this book is regarded as one of the fundamental classics in the field .
The author jokes that it is referred to as the software development “ bible ” because of the number of people who say they believe in it but do n’t follow its teachings in their day to day life .
I have often considered bringing it in to work to show particularly clueless managers .
I think that maybe if I brought a really nice hard bound edition in , I might be able to beat them to death with it .
And then I realise why I ’ve never moved into management .
I like to be able to face myself in the mirror .
Michelle Vetoes Hillary
WASHINGTON , D.C. -- Close - in supporters of Sen. Barack Obama 's presidential campaign are convinced he never will offer the vice presidential nomination to Sen.
Hillary Clinton for one overriding reason : Michelle Obama .
The Democratic front - runner 's wife did not comment on other rival candidates for the party 's nomination , but she has been sniping at Clinton since last summer .
According to Obama sources , those public utterances do not reveal the extent of her hostility .
A footnote : Support is growing in Democratic ranks for Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland as vice president .
He would bring to the ticket maturity ( 66 years old ) , experience ( six terms in Congress ) and moderation ( rated " A " by the National Rifle Association ) .
He is very popular in Ohio , a state Republicans must carry to elect a president .
Dissing Bolton ?
John Bolton , who as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 2005 - 2006 became a conservative icon , has not connected with Sen .
John McCain 's presidential campaign , though he desires to help out .
Friends say Bolton was puzzled when his offers of assistance got no response from the McCain campaign .
He did receive a late request to be a spokesman for McCain Tuesday in Winston - Salem , N.C. , where the candidate addressed selection of federal judges .
However , Bolton got the impression that he was merely being asked to attend the event and declined the invitation .
Bolton 's treatment did not appear to signify disrespect for him by McCain but rather disorganization at the candidate 's headquarters .
Penalize Lieberman
Even strong support from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid may not save the Homeland Security Committee chairmanship for Sen. Joseph Lieberman if he goes through with plans to address the Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Minn .
Reid opposes trying to kick Lieberman out of the Senate Democratic caucus ( which would cost him his chairmanship ) because he has endorsed Republican John McCain for president .
But other Democratic senators complain Lieberman would go a step too far if he addresses the Republican convention .
Elected as an independent in 2006 , Lieberman now designates himself an " Independent Democrat . "
A footnote : Lieberman recently approached one prominent supporter of Hillary Clinton with a suggestion that he consider supporting McCain if Barack Obama is nominated .
McCain's Manager
Republican insiders were surprised when Paul Manafort , prominent in national Republican circles for over 30 years , was passed over as John McCain 's national convention manager in favor of a relatively unknown p.r. executive .
Doug Goodyear , CEO of the Washington - based DCI Group public relations firm , has not been an active political player in recent years .
He ran the disastrous 1988 U.S. Senate campaign in New Jersey for Gen. Pete Dawkins , who lost to Democrat Frank Lautenberg .
Manafort has been a major operative at every Republican National Convention , starting as an aide for President Gerald Ford in 1976 .
He is a lobbying partner of McCain national campaign manager Rick Davis , but McCain does not want to hire a heavy contingent of lobbyists to give Barack Obama an easy target .
Manafort also is in disfavor at the State Department for representing the pro-Russian former Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych .
Paul Still Running
Not only has Rep. Ron Paul 's ongoing presidential candidacy continued to record a substantial vote against John McCain in primary elections , but Paul advocates also forced an unprepared Nevada Republican Party establishment to abruptly adjourn last month 's state convention in Reno selecting delegates to the national convention .
The meeting has not yet been reconvened .
With a majority at the state convention supporting Paul , several national convention delegates pledged to the insurgent candidate were ready to be elected .
State Sen. Bob Beers , the state convention chairman , abruptly adjourned the session .
He later explained , " We were overtime on our contract for our convention space " and " were paying our stagehands and audio - video technicians overtime . "
A footnote : Paul has made clear on several occasions there is no chance that he ever will endorse McCain for president .

BEIJING 
A team of climbers trudged through snow and ice to carry the Olympic torch to the summit of Mount Everest on Thursday , fulfilling a long - held goal of the Chinese government to have the Olympic flame lit on top of the world ’s highest mountain .
Overseas groups opposed to Chinese rule in Tibet quickly denounced the event , saying the Chinese government was simply using the torch relay to bolster claims of sovereignty over what should be an independent country .
The ascent of the north face of Mount Everest , whose icy summit is more than 29,000 feet high , was the most ambitious leg of the Olympic torch relay .
The torch that climbers carried to the top at 9:18 a.m. on Thursday was a side torch ; the main torch is making its way through the southern province of Guangdong and will continue through every province of China before arriving in Beijing in early August .
The Chinese government has tried to maintain tight control over every aspect of the Everest climb .
Officials brought a group of journalists to the base camp to help publicize the ascent while barring foreign climbing groups from any summit attempts for fear of Tibet - related protests further marring the torch relay , which has already been beset by anti-China demonstrations in foreign cities .
Nepal , prompted by Chinese leaders , has also kept climbing groups away from the mountain .
What 's New Developer Preview Release Soon
Hey everyone ,
We 're about to release an update to the developer preview with some fixes and an exciting new feature : New Feature : Metrics Metrics are computationally expensive filters .
Since metrics take much longer to compute , we are handling them differently from normal filters .
As you fold , Foldit will be computing these metrics in the background .
Once the metrics catch up to the current state of your protein , your score will update .
Until they catch up , your score will be invalid , but you can still use Foldit like normal without things slowing down to a crawl .
In practice , your score will catch up shortly after you finish using a tool .
In recipes , we 're adding a function that waits for the full metric score if you need that value .
Keep an eye out for an upcoming blog post on metrics !
General :
* Updated logging to provide more useful information .
This will help us debug better , and will also help us track down rogue logfile output and remove it .
Recipes :
* Added lua functions for metrics .
Bug Fixes :
* Remix results are now more reproducible .
* Removed some rogue logfile output .
* Fixed some issues with tutorial tips .
* Added more info to the Windows crash reports .

Hey everyone ,
We 're releasing a new update with the following fixes and changes : BUNS Filter :
* Only sidechains with BUNS will be automatically shown when the filter is enabled .
* Some symmetric puzzles may now penalize BUNS across every asymmetric unit .
* When enabled , the filter will show every bondable atom without enabling any HBonds .
This is new behavior for the ' show bondable atoms ' view option as well , as clicking it will show all bondable atoms regardless of what particular HBond types are visible .
* Enabling the filter will not change the view options boxes .
Changes to ( ' show bondable atoms ' and ' show hydrogens ' ) will only take effect after the filter is disabled .
Bug Fixes :
* Fixed an issue where LUA errors would freeze Mac and Linux clients .
* Fixed a problem which caused the log file to become inflated with meaningless characters .
We 're actively working on this to solve any remaining issues .
* To improve script speed , Lua functions of the form filter .* now ignore DDG , Sasa , and shape complementarity .
Functions to access these will come at a later date .
As always , thank you to our players in the develop preview for finding the bugs and helping us fix them !

Here are some rules for being a good citizen .
They date back to the American Revolution , but most Americans today have forgotten them .
Rule No. 1 is that people given power will tend to abuse it .
This applies to everyone from local government to national government .
It applies to Democrats and to Republicans .
The reason it is so universal is because it originates in human nature , which is the same today as it was 10,000 years ago .
That ’s why the Founding Fathers labored so hard to devise a basically weak national government .
Not only does the Constitution divide power between the three separate and equal branches of the federal government , it also divides power between the federal and state governments .
Unfortunately , we have removed many of these safeguards .
Not everyone in government abuses power , and one of the duties of a citizen is to recognize those who do n’t and to reward them .
Rule No. 2 is that politicians have an inclination to lie .
The Bush administration lied us into a war .
There were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
The regime of Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with al - Qaida or with the attack on the U.S.
It is also a lie that " everyone believed Saddam had weapons of mass destruction . "
The U.N. weapons inspectors had never said , after 1995 , there were weapons .
They said there was a paper discrepancy .
One part of the government said x amount had been destroyed ; another branch said it was y amount .
You will find paper discrepancies in practically every government in the world .
Witness , for example , the numerous weapons and large amounts of money our own government cannot account for in Iraq .
Nor , it should be added , did Saddam pretend to have weapons of mass destruction .
The Iraqi government said repeatedly that it did not have them .
Lying by American politicians has become so pervasive , it is the rule rather than the exception .
Lies destroy credibility , but because they are so pervasive today , few people get punished when they are caught lying .
Citizens should consider a lie a mortal sin in the realm of civics , for lies are an attempt to deceive the people about very important matters .
Lies are a direct attack on the American system of self - government , which is based on the premise that if the people know the truth , they can make the right decisions .
Rule No. 3 is to always oppose excessive government secrecy .
Common sense tells us that government is entitled to some secrecy , primarily military in time of war .
Recent governments , however , have gone overboard and promiscuously classify practically any piece of paper that comes across their desk .
Usually the only thing they are protecting is our own government from embarrassment or possibly criminal prosecution .
National - security letters are a good example .
These are demands by the FBI for information about citizens for which there is no search warrant .
The institutions receiving them are threatened by criminal prosecution for revealing to anyone that they have received one .
These warrantless searches went from 8,500 in the year 2000 to 47,000 by 2005 .
The current government conducts all kinds of " data sweeps " that involve our use of the Internet , including Web pages we visit and e-mails we write or receive , along with telephone calls , our spending habits , the flights we take and our bank records .
The right to privacy for all practical purposes is as dead as a beached whale .
But are you being spied upon ?
Sorry , that ’s classified .
Thus , invasion of privacy and secrecy go hand in hand .
The only remedy I can see for this is to vote out of office the politicians who have tolerated it and to avoid electing anyone who might reasonably be expected to continue these practices .
They are all done , of course , in the name of security , but Benjamin Franklin said it well when he wrote that those who prefer security to freedom deserve neither .
Charley Reese [ send him mail ] has been a journalist for 49 years .
The Best of Charley Reese
Scot McKnight wants you to have your golf bag fully equipped — theologically speaking .
That 's the controlling metaphor of McKnight 's 2007 study of soteriology , A Community Called Atonement ( 4 stars ) .
Here 's how the metaphor works .
Each " theory " of the Atonement is , like a particular golf club , better suited to some situations than others .
Ministering the gospel is like playing a round of golf .
Just as a golfer knows when to use a driver , a wedge , or a putter , the way we proclaim , teach , or share the Good News should be adapted to the situation .
You can hit the ball out of a sand trap with your driver , but why would you if you had a wedge available ?
The strength of the golf - bag metaphor is that it asks us to stop being partisan toward one particular theory of the Atonement and to minister with the best tools at hand .
McKnight is a peacemaker and a bridge builder , which makes his book welcome .
Plenty of discussion recently ( some of it acrimonious ) sounds like people are saying that all the other clubs are better than your putter — and that your putter is inherently defective .
Meanwhile , others defend the putter as the only club needed , since each round ends on the green .
Indeed , penal substitution is like a putter , and it should be used often in connection with other Atonement metaphors .
But there are still those divinely ordained " hole - in - one " situations , where some theological driver or iron does it all .
The Undivided God
Penal substitution , a biblically grounded , 16th - century Reformation development of Anselm 's 11th - century " satisfaction theory " of the Atonement , has been the main target of criticism .
In penal substitution , God the Son bears the penalty for our sins on the Cross .
The Son having paid our debt , God ...

Bush 's Endless Hypocrisy on Terror
Is a government guilty of terrorism if it harbors known terrorists ?
What should one say about a country that permits open fund - raising on behalf of a terrorist implicated in the mass killing of civilians ?
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly
What about a government that secretly arms a guerrilla army that wantonly kills and abuses civilians while seeking to overthrow an elected government ?
If your answer to those questions is to recite George W. Bush ’s dictum that a government that harbors or helps terrorists should be punished just like the terrorists , then you must turn your wrath on the U.S. government and the Bush family -- guilty on all the above points .
But the U.S. political / media system continues to view the world through a cracked lens that focuses outrage on “ enemy ” regimes while refracting away a comparable fury from similar actions by U.S. officials .
So , while President Bush ponders whether to add Venezuela to the terrorist list – because of a captured Colombian guerrilla computer that appears to implicate Hugo Chavez ’s government in weapons smuggling – Bush would broach no criticism of Ronald Reagan who armed Nicaraguan contra guerrillas in the 1980s .
Reagan continued that covert war even after the ruling Sandinistas won an election in 1984 that most outside observers praised as free and fair and even after the facts of the contras ’ human rights abuses – kidnapping , torturing and murdering civilians – became widely known and were acknowledged by some senior contra leaders .
Though Reagan was well aware of the contras ’ cruelty ( he privately called them “ vandals ” ) , he hailed them publicly as “ freedom fighters ” and equated them with America ’s “ Founding Fathers . ”
Reagan kept arming the contras even after Congress ordered him to stop and the World Court ruled against the CIA ’s secret mining of Nicaragua ’s harbors .
Reagan also backed vicious rebel forces in Angola and Afghanistan ( including foreign Islamic fundamentalists who later coalesced into al - Qaeda ) and supported state terror against civilian populations in Guatemala , El Salvador and Honduras , claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands .
By any stretch of the imagination – if any other country had so brazenly violated international law and human rights standards – that government would be condemned by civilized nations and would be treated as a terrorist pariah .
However , the vast majority of Republicans and many Democrats view Reagan as a political icon deserving of honors , such as having Washington ’s National Airport renamed Ronald Reagan National Airport .
To suggest that the late President was a war criminal or a sponsor of terrorism is unthinkable within the U.S. political mainstream .
[ For details on Reagan ’s war crimes , see Robert Parry ’s Lost History . ]
Bush Family Terrorism Similarly , it is unacceptable to note how the Bush family has protected Cuban - American terrorists – from 1976 when George H.W. Bush ran the CIA to the present when George W. Bush balks at an extradition request for Luis Posada Carriles , wanted on Venezuelan terrorism charges for blowing up a Cubana airliner and killing 73 people in 1976 .
On May 2 , 2008 , more than six years into President Bush ’s “ global war on terror , ” there was a remarkable scene in Miami as Posada , now 80 , was feted at a gala fundraising dinner .
Some 500 supporters chipped in to his legal defense fund as he remains free facing half - hearted U.S. government litigation on a minor immigration charge .
Posada , who has had plastic surgery to repair damage to his face from a shooting in the late 1980s , arrived to thundering applause .
Then , in a bristling speech against the Castro regime in Cuba , Posada told his supporters , “ We ask God to sharpen our machetes . ”
Venezuela ’s Ambassador the United States , Bernardo Alvarez , protested the Bush administration ’s tolerance of the dinner .
“ This is outrageous , particularly because he kept talking about [ more ] violence , ” the ambassador said .
Posada , a naturalized Venezuelan citizen who worked for Venezuela ’s intelligence agency in the 1970s , masterminded the 1976 Cubana airline bombing , according to evidence compiled by the U.S. government and in South America .
Despite Posada ’s record – and despite the strong evidence against him in U.S. government files – Florida Gov. Jeb Bush made little effort to capture Posada when he sneaked into Miami in 2005 .
Posada was detained only after he held a news conference .
Then , instead of extraditing Posada to Venezuela , the Bush administration engaged in a lackadaisical effort to have him deported for lying on an immigration form .
During a 2007 court hearing in Texas , Bush administration lawyers allowed to go unchallenged testimony from a Posada friend that Posada would face torture if he were returned to Venezuela .
The judge , therefore , barred Posada from being deported there .
After that ruling , Ambassador Alvarez accused the Bush administration of applying “ a cynical double standard ” in the “ war on terror . ”
As for the claim that Venezuela practices torture , Alvarez said , “ There is n’t a shred of evidence that Posada would be tortured in Venezuela . ”
Different Standards
The kid -glove treatment of Posada and other right - wing Cubans stands in marked contrast to President Bush ’s tough handling of Islamic militants .
While Posada is afforded all U.S. legal protections and then some , suspected Islamic terrorists are locked away without trial at the U.S. military base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and face “ alternative interrogation techniques . ”
On May 15 in a speech to the Israeli Knesset , Bush even denounced Western political leaders who advocate negotiations with “ terrorists and radicals , ” likening the idea to Neville Chamberlain ’s appeasement of Adolf Hitler .
But Bush ’s hard - line stance does n’t apply to terrorism that ’s in line with U.S. foreign policy or that connects to Bush ’s family .
In those cases , opposite standards apply .
For instance , even as Posada ’s record for terrorism was relevant to his immigration case , the Bush administration sat on evidence implicating him in a series of 1997 hotel bombings in Havana that killed an Italian tourist .
The Associated Press reported that an FBI document , belatedly filed with the court , revealed that a confidential source had planted a listening device in a Guatemalan utility company office , picking up conversations about smuggling a “ putty - like explosive ” into Cuba in the shoes of operatives posing as tourists .
The source added that another employee of the utility company found 22 plastic tubes in a closet in August 1997 labeled " high - powered explosives , extremely dangerous . "
The explosives were being mixed into shampoo bottles , the employee said .
According to the AP , the confidential source provided the FBI with a fax about wire transfers from individuals in New Jersey that was signed Solo , one of Posada ’s aliases .
The FBI concluded that at least $ 19,000 in wire transfers connected to the hotel bombings were sent from the United States to El Salvador and Guatemala to a " Ramon Medina , " the code name used by Posada in the 1980s when he worked on Oliver North ’s operations .
[ AP , May 4 , 2007 ]
In 1998 , in interviews with a New York Times reporter , Posada admitted a role in the Havana bombings , citing a goal of frightening tourists away from Cuba .
But Posada later denied making the admissions .
He also has denied masterminding the 1976 airliner bombing in collusion with another notorious Cuban exile , Orlando Bosch , who moved to Miami , too , with the help and protection of the Bush family .
Not only did the Bush administration take a dive during Posada ’s deportation hearing by letting the Venezuela torture claim go unchallenged , but also it ignored Bosch ’s statement a year earlier , when he justified the 1976 mid-air bombing in a TV interview with reporter Manuel Cao on Miami ’s Channel 41 .
When Cao asked Bosch to comment on the civilians who died when the Cubana plane crashed off the coast of Barbados , Bosch responded , " In a war such as us Cubans who love liberty wage against the tyrant [ Fidel Castro ] , you have to down planes , you have to sink ships , you have to be prepared to attack anything that is within your reach . ”
“ But do n’t you feel a little bit for those who were killed there , for their families ? ”
Cao asked .
“ Who was on board that plane ? ” Bosch responded .
“ Four members of the Communist Party , five North Koreans , five Guyanese . ”
[ Officials tallies actually put the Guyanese dead at 11 . ]
Bosch added , “ Four members of the Communist Party , chico !
Who was there ?
Our enemies … ” “ And the fencers ? ” Cao asked about Cuba ’s amateur fencing team that had just won gold , silver and bronze medals at a youth fencing competition in Caracas .
“ The young people on board ? ” Bosch replied , “ I was in Caracas .
I saw the young girls on television .
There were six of them .
After the end of the competition , the leader of the six dedicated their triumph to the tyrant . …
She gave a speech filled with praise for the tyrant .
“ We had already agreed in Santo Domingo , that everyone who comes from Cuba to glorify the tyrant had to run the same risks as those men and women that fight alongside the tyranny . ”
[ The comment about Santo Domingo was an apparent reference to a meeting by a right - wing terrorist organization , CORU , which took place in the Dominican Republic in 1976 and which involved a CIA undercover asset . ]
“ If you ran into the family members who were killed in that plane , would n’t you think it difficult ? ”
Cao asked .
“ No , because in the end those who were there had to know that they were cooperating with the tyranny in Cuba , ” Bosch answered .
Venezuela Case Beyond Bosch ’s incriminating statements about the Cubana Airlines bombing , other evidence of his and Posada ’s guilt is overwhelming .
Declassified U.S. documents show that soon after the Cubana Airlines plane was blown out of the sky on Oct. 6 , 1976 , the CIA , then under the direction of George H.W. Bush , identified Posada and Bosch as the masterminds of the bombing .
But in fall 1976 , Bush ’s boss , President Gerald Ford , was in a tight election battle with Democrat Jimmy Carter and the Ford administration wanted to keep intelligence scandals out of the newspapers .
So Bush and other officials kept the lid on the investigations .
[ For details , see Robert Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ]
Still , inside the U.S. government , the facts were known .
According to a secret CIA cable dated Oct. 14 , 1976 , intelligence sources in Venezuela relayed information about the Cubana Airlines bombing that tied in anti-communist Cuban extremists Bosch , who had been visiting Venezuela , and Posada , who then served as a senior officer in Venezuela ’s intelligence agency , DISIP .
The Oct. 14 cable said Bosch arrived in Venezuela in late September 1976 under the protection of Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez , a close Washington ally who assigned his intelligence adviser Orlando Garcia “ to protect and assist Bosch during his stay in Venezuela . ”
On his arrival , Bosch was met by Garcia and Posada , according to the report .
Later , a fundraising dinner was held in Bosch ’s honor .
“ A few days following the fund - raising dinner , Posada was overheard to say that , ‘ we are going to hit a Cuban airplane , ’ and that ‘ Orlando has the details , ’ ” the CIA report said .
“ Following the 6 October Cubana Airline crash off the coast of Barbados , Bosch , Garcia and Posada agreed that it would be best for Bosch to leave Venezuela .
Therefore , on 9 October , Posada and Garcia escorted Bosch to the Colombian border , where he crossed into Colombian territory . ”
In South America , police began rounding up suspects .
Two Cuban exiles , Hernan Ricardo and Freddy Lugo , who got off the Cubana plane in Barbados , confessed that they had planted the bomb .
They named Bosch and Posada as the architects of the attack .
A search of Posada ’s apartment in Venezuela turned up Cubana Airlines timetables and other incriminating documents .
Posada and Bosch were charged in Venezuela for the Cubana Airlines bombing , but the case soon became a political tug - of - war , since the suspects were in possession of sensitive Venezuelan government secrets that could embarrass President Andres Perez .
After President Reagan and Vice President George H.W. Bush took power in Washington in 1981 , the momentum for fully unraveling the mysteries of anti-communist terrorist plots dissipated .
The Cold War trumped any concern about right - wing terrorism .
Iran -Contra Role
In 1985 , Posada escaped from a Venezuelan prison , reportedly with the help of Cuban exiles .
In his autobiography , Posada thanked Miami - based Cuban activist Jorge Mas Canosa for providing the $ 25,000 that was used to bribe guards who allowed Posada to walk out of prison .
Another Cuban exile who aided Posada was former CIA officer Felix Rodriguez , who was close to Vice President Bush .
Rodriguez was handling secret supply shipments to the Nicaraguan contra rebels , a pet project of President Reagan .
After fleeing Venezuela , Posada joined Rodriguez in Central America and began using the code name “ Ramon Medina . ”
Posada was assigned the job of paymaster for pilots in the White House - run contra -supply operation .
When one of the contra-supply planes was shot down inside Nicaragua in October 1986 , Posada alerted U.S. officials and shut down the operation ’s safe houses in El Salvador .
Even after the exposure of Posada ’s role in the contra-supply operation , the U.S. government made no effort to bring the accused terrorist to justice .
By the late 1980s , Orlando Bosch also was out of Venezuela ’s jails and back in Miami .
But Bosch , who had been implicated in about 30 violent attacks , was facing possible deportation by U.S. officials who warned that Washington could n’t credibly lecture other countries about terrorism while protecting a terrorist like Bosch .
But Bosch got lucky .
Jeb Bush , then an aspiring Florida politician , led a lobbying drive to prevent the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service from expelling Bosch .
In 1990 , the lobbying paid dividends when Jeb 's dad , President George H.W. Bush , blocked proceedings against Bosch , letting the unapologetic terrorist stay in the United States .
In 1992 , also during the first Bush presidency , the FBI interviewed Posada about the Iran - Contra scandal for 6 ½ hours at the U.S. Embassy in Honduras .
Posada filled in some blanks about the role of Bush ’s vice presidential office in the secret contra operation .
According to a 31 - page summary of the FBI interview , Posada said Bush ’s national security adviser , Donald Gregg , was in frequent contact with Felix Rodriguez .
“ Posada … recalls that Rodriguez was always calling Gregg , ” the FBI summary said .
“ Posada knows this because he ’s the one who paid Rodriguez ’ phone bill . ”
After the interview , the FBI agents let Posada walk out of the embassy to freedom .
[ For details , see Parry ’s Lost History . ]
More Plotting Posada soon returned to his anti-Castro plotting .
In 1994 , Posada set out to kill Fidel Castro during a trip to Cartagena , Colombia .
Posada and five cohorts reached Cartagena , but the plan flopped when security cordons prevented the would - be assassins from getting a clean shot , according to a Miami Herald account .
[ Miami Herald , June 7 , 1998 ]
The Herald also described Posada ’s role in a lethal 1997 bombing campaign against popular hotels and restaurants inside Cuba .
The story cited documentary evidence that Posada arranged payments to conspirators from accounts in the United States .
“ This afternoon you will receive via Western Union four transfers of $ 800 each … from New Jersey , ” said one fax signed by SOLO , a Posada alias .
Posada landed back in jail in 2000 after Cuban intelligence uncovered a plot to assassinate Castro by planting a bomb at a meeting the Cuban leader planned with university students in Panama .
Panamanian authorities arrested Posada and other alleged co-conspirators in November 2000 .
In April 2004 , they were sentenced to eight or nine years in prison for endangering public safety .
Four months after the sentencing , however , lame - duck Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso – who had a home in Key Biscayne , Florida , and had close ties to President George W. Bush ’s administration – pardoned the convicts .
Just two months before Election 2004 , three of Posada ’s co-conspirators – Guillermo Novo Sampol , Pedro Remon and Gaspar Jimenez – arrived in Miami to a hero ’s welcome , flashing victory signs at their supporters .
While the terrorists celebrated , U.S. authorities watched the men – also implicated in bombings in New York , New Jersey and Florida – alight on U.S. soil .
Washington Post writer Marcela Sanchez noted in a September 2004 article about the Panamanian pardons that “ there is something terribly wrong when the United States , after Sept. 11 ( 2001 ) , fails to condemn the pardoning of terrorists and instead allows them to walk free on U.S. streets . ”
[ Washington Post , Sept. 3 , 2004 ]
Posada reportedly sneaked into the United States in early 2005 and his presence was an open secret in Miami for weeks before U.S. authorities did anything .
The New York Times summed up Bush ’s dilemma if Posada decided to seek U.S. asylum .
“ A grant of asylum could invite charges that the Bush administration is compromising its principle that no nation should harbor suspected terrorists , ” the Times wrote .
“ But to turn Mr. Posada away could provoke political wrath in the conservative Cuban - American communities of South Florida , deep sources of support and campaign money for President Bush and his brother , Jeb . ” [ NYT , May 9 , 2005 ]
Only after Posada called a news conference to announce his presence was the Bush administration shamed into arresting him .
But even then , the administration balked at sending Posada back to Venezuela where the Chavez government – unlike some of its predecessors – was eager to prosecute .
The next Bush move was to bungle the immigration case and thus let Posada live out his golden years as a hero in Miami .
The handling of the Posada - Bosch cases – when they are put next to Bush ’s tough - guy attitude toward Islamic terrorism – point to one unavoidable and unpleasant conclusion : that the Bush family regards terrorism – defined as killing civilians for a political reason – as justified or at least tolerable in cases when their interests match those of the terrorists .
A principled rejection of terrorism only applies to the other guys .

In the capsule version of the Barack Obama story , his mother is simply the white woman from Kansas .
The phrase comes coupled alliteratively to its counterpart , the black father from Kenya .
On the campaign trail , he has called her his " single mom . "
But neither description begins to capture the unconventional life of Stanley Ann Dunham Soetoro , the parent who most shaped Obama .
Kansas was merely a way station in her childhood , wheeling westward in the slipstream of her furniture - salesman father .
In Hawaii , she married an African student at age 18 .
Then she married an Indonesian , moved to Jakarta , became an anthropologist , wrote a dissertation on peasant blacksmithing in Java , worked for the Ford Foundation , championed women 's work and helped bring microcredit to the world 's poor .
She had high expectations for her children .
In Indonesia , she would wake her son at 4 a.m. for correspondence courses in English before school ; she brought home recordings of Mahalia Jackson , speeches by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr .
And when Obama asked to stay in Hawaii for high school rather than return to Asia , she accepted living apart - a decision her daughter says was one of the hardest in her mother 's life .
" She felt that somehow , wandering through uncharted territory , we might stumble upon something that will , in an instant , seem to represent who we are at the core , " said Maya Soetoro - Ng , Obama 's half sister .
" That was very much her philosophy of life - to not be limited by fear or narrow definitions , to not build walls around ourselves and to do our best to find kinship and beauty in unexpected places . "
Soetoro , who died of ovarian cancer in 1995 , was the parent who raised Obama , the Illinois senator running for the Democratic presidential nomination .
He barely saw his father after the age of 2 .
People who knew Soetoro well say they see her influence unmistakably in Obama .
Writing a different book
They were close , her friends and his half sister say , though they spent much of their lives with oceans or continents between them .
He would not be where he is today , he has said , had it not been for her .
Yet he has also made some different choices - marrying into a tightly knit African American family rooted in the South Side of Chicago , becoming a churchgoing Christian , publicly recounting his search for his identity as a black man .
" I think sometimes that had I known she would not survive her illness , I might have written a different book - less a meditation on the absent parent , more a celebration of the one who was the single constant in my life , " he wrote in the preface to his memoir , " Dreams From My Father . "
He added , " I know that she was the kindest , most generous spirit I have ever known , and that what is best in me I owe to her . "
" She was a very , very big thinker , " said Nancy Barry , a former president of Women 's World Banking , an international network of microfinance providers , where Soetoro worked in New York City in the 1990s .
" I think she was not at all personally ambitious , I think she cared about the core issues , and I think she was not afraid to speak truth to power . "
Her parents were from Kansas .
Stanley
Ann ( her father had wanted a boy , so he gave her his name ) was born on an Army base during World War II .
The family moved to California , Kansas , Texas and Washington in restless pursuit of opportunity before landing in Honolulu in 1960 .
Both marriages faded
In a Russian class at the University of Hawaii , she met the college 's first African student , Barack Obama .
They married and had a son in August 1961 , in an era when interracial marriage was rare in the United States .
Her parents were upset , Obama learned years later from his mother , but they adapted .
The marriage was brief .
In 1963 , Obama left for Harvard University , leaving his wife and child .
She then married Lolo Soetoro , an Indonesian student .
When he was summoned home in 1966 after the turmoil surrounding the rise of Suharto , she and young Barack followed .
Those choices were not entirely surprising , said several high school friends of Soetoro , whom they remembered as unusually intelligent , curious and open .
She never dated " the crew - cut white boys , " said one friend , Susan Blake : " She had a worldview , even as a young girl .
It was embracing the different , rather than that ethnocentric thing of shunning the different .
That was where her mind took her . "
Her second marriage faded , too , in the 1970s .
She wanted to work , one friend said , and Lolo Soetoro wanted more children .
By 1974 , she was back in Honolulu , a graduate student raising Barack and Maya , nine years younger .
Barack was on scholarship at a prestigious prep school , Punahou .
When Soetoro decided to return to Indonesia three years later for her fieldwork , Barack chose not to go .
" I doubted what Indonesia now had to offer and wearied of being new all over again , " he wrote in his memoir .
" More than that , I 'd arrived at an unspoken pact with my grandparents : I could live with them and they 'd leave me alone so long as I kept my trouble out of sight . "
During those years , he was " engaged in a fitful interior struggle .
I was trying to raise myself to be a black man in America . "
Painful separation
Soetoro - Ng recalled her mother 's quandary .
" She wanted him to be with her , " she said .
But , she added , " Although it was painful to be separated from him for his last four years of high school , she recognized that it was perhaps the best thing for him .
And she had to go to Indonesia at that time . "
That time apart was hard for both mother and son .
" She longed for him , " said Georgia McCauley , who became a friend of Soetoro in Jakarta .
Barack spent summers and Christmas vacations with his mother ; they communicated by letters , his illustrated with cartoons .
Her first topic of conversation was always her son , her female friends said .
As for him , he was grappling with questions of racial identity , alienation and belonging .
" There were certainly times in his life in those four years when he could have used her presence on a more daily basis , " Soetoro - Ng said .
" But I think he did all right for himself . "
Fluent in Indonesian , Soetoro moved with Maya first to Yogyakarta , the center of Javanese handicrafts .
A weaver in college , she was fascinated with what Soetoro - Ng calls " life 's gorgeous minutiae . "
That interest inspired her study of village industries , which became the basis of her 1992 doctoral dissertation .
She became a consultant for the U.S. Agency for International Development on setting up a village credit program , then a Ford Foundation program officer in Jakarta specializing in women 's work .
Later , she was a consultant in Pakistan , then joined Indonesia 's oldest bank to work on what is described as the world 's largest sustainable microfinance program , creating services like credit and savings for the poor .
Broad view of the world
Soetoro - Ng , who herself became an anthropologist , remembers conversations with her mother about philosophy or politics , books , esoteric Indonesian woodworking motifs .
One Christmas in Indonesia , Soetoro found a scrawny tree and decorated it with red and green chili peppers and popcorn balls .
" She gave us a very broad understanding of the world , " her daughter said .
" She hated bigotry .
She was very determined to be remembered for a life of service and thought that service was really the true measure of a life . "
Seattle , 1990
Bob leaned back , stretched his arms and took in the view from his window .
It was a lazy Sunday , and he'd just finished reading his messages on his favorite BBS .
An aging Amiga decorated with pink stickers courtesy of Bob 's daughter sat at his feet .
His sleek new home phone was perched prominently on the corner of the desk , the cord snaking its way to the wall by way of a splitter shared with his modem .
As Bob surveyed the scene , his phone started to ring .
Pausing a moment , he smiled , enjoying the harmonic ring of the new phone that he lovingly customized earlier that morning before answering .
" Hey Bob , it 's Alice ! "
Alice , a co-worker , was one of Bob 's closest friends .
They had both graduated from the computer science program at the same school , managing to stay in touch over the years , usually by trading " war stories " .
Recently , Alice had joined Bob 's group from another company .
To the chagrin of Bob and his co-workers , she was brought in directly as a lead programmer .
" Bah , it 's just a title " , Bob was fond of saying .
He hid his resentment well when interacting with Alice socially .
" Bob , my life just changed forever . "
Bob 's eyebrow slowly began to raise .
His mind raced through the possibilities .
Had she been promoted again ?
Was she moving on to another opportunity ?
I wonder if I 'll make lead if she does !.
On the verge of Bob 's moment of imagination turning into an uncomfortable pause , Bob snapped out of it .
" Alice , my goodness , I 've never heard you so excited . "
" Okay , you know I 'm not normally ahead of the technology curve , " Alice continued .
" But today , I just got a cellular telephone ! " .
Bob 's eyes narrowed .
A cellular phone ?
He 'd recently seen a story about them on the evening news , and thought they were the most ridiculous thing he 'd ever seen .
Who on earth needs to make phone calls in the middle of the street ? , Bob had thought to himself when he saw the story .
Bob responded forcefully .
" A cellular phone ?
Those crazy looking things with the huge antennas ?
Alice , you 've got to be kidding me . "
Bob admiringly moved his hand across the smooth plastic shell of his phone 's handset .
" I 'm serious !
I know they 're a bit different from what you 're used to , but to be honest I kind of like the styling .
I did n't realize how much fun it could be to be on the cutting edge of technology .
You should have seen the looks I got in the park down the street this morning ! "
Bob rolled his eyes and interrupted .
" Look , I 'm sure it 's fun to be mistaken for an FBI agent , but you can't possibly think this is rational .
When the heck would you need to make a phone call in the middle of the street ?
I have two phones at home , and another at work .
What else could I possible need ? "
" I can see where you 're coming from .
I 'm sure that to you it does n't sound that different from your home phone .
I mean , you pick up the phone , dial the numbers , and it connects to the other side .
Nothing groundbreaking there .
But it 's so freeing to be able to talk anywhere .
I can completely understand how this might seem like a novelty .
To be honest , listening to myself explain it to you , it does n't really sound that compelling .
But imagine the possibilities !
I 'm always connected .
I can have meetings in my car , and I can leave the office for a long lunch on a sunny day without worrying about missing out on anything important . "
Bob chuckled , making sure he drew it out long enough to suggest that he'd heard enough .
As the final note of his chuckle diminished , Bob tried to finish the conversation .
" Okay , Alice , I guess I can sort of see how that might be nice .
But learning a whole new speed dial system , and working with a phone I do n't understand just does n't seem worth it for those few situations where it might be useful .
I 'm glad your happy with your purchase , in any case . "
Alice shook her head slowly , and put in a last word before hanging up .
" You 'll see , Bob , just wait . "
Seattle , Present Day
Bob was crouched beneath his desk , reaching for the mini-USB cable attached to the back of his computer .
He plugged the other end into his battery - drained Blackberry , and its bright welcome screen came to life .
Come on , come on he urged .
After a brief delay , the phone 's LCD dimmed and the network connected .
A high pitched bell ring alerted him to a new message , and Bob quickly pressed the " Read " button .
She remembered ! , Bob thought to himself excitedly .
His daughter had sent the text message announcing her SAT results , just as promised .
I knew it ! , thought Bob , proudly inspecting the score .
She 's smarter than her old man after all .
As Bob turned to his computer , he heard the familiar sound of his favorite classical melody .
He had only last week taken an MP3 of the song and made a custom ring tone , something that impressed his daughter far more than his last promotion .
Who 's calling me during lunch ? , he thought .
Leaning back , Bob peered under the lip of his desk , eyeing the blazing white LCD screen of his phone , now perched atop his computer chassis .
Recognizing the name on caller ID , he immediately grabbed the phone and answered .
It had been several months since Bob last spoke to Alice .
The time between their phone conversations had grown progressively longer of late , and Bob was happy to hear her voice .
It had been five years since Alice left for Silicon Valley to run the software group at a small search startup .
Having moved his way up to middle management , he was always excited to hear from someone who still had their finger on the pulse of technology .
Alice got right to the point .
" Bob , I am about to change your life . "
Bob sensed excitement in her voice .
In the two decades they had known each other , Alice had embraced the role of technology evangelist , and Bob that of technology skeptic .
They each enjoyed their roles , and Bob could tell immediately that Alice could n't wait to tell him about the next big thing .
He gathered up as much feigned skepticism as he could in a feeble attempt to mask his genuine curiousity , and offered a response .
" Alright , what is it this time ? "
" DVCS . Distributed Version Control Systems " , Alice responded .
" We just migrated our entire source control system to Mercurial .
I think in the first week using it we 've already gained 100 hours of productivity .
The developers love it .
I 've made it my mission to tell everyone I know . "
Bob pursed his lips .
She 's got to be kidding , he thought , this is what she 's so excited about ?
Bob announced his skepticism .
" Alice , Alice , Alice .
I 've been around a long time , and it's not quite so easy these days to put one past me .
What are you really so excited about ? " .
Alice laughed long and hard .
" Oh you old curmudgeon , here we go again .
Look , we 've gone through this before , and I am going to convince you that distributed version control is serious stuff .
Why are you so skeptical already ?
What have you heard about it ? "
" To be honest " , he started , " I first started hearing about distributed version control when we hired on a new developer who'd been working on an open source project .
He was almost as excited as you about it .
He had some trouble explaining what was so great about it , so he sent the entire team a link to a video where the presenter bashed our current version control system for an hour .
The guy who manages our VCS server was really offended .
So as far as I can tell , distributed version control is only relevant in open source projects run by opinionated bullies who see diff & patch as a perfectly acceptable source control system .
I 'm an old corporate soul -- I have n't used patch since college , Alice , and I do n't miss it . "
" Ah , I know the video you 're talking about , " Alice said .
" Forget about that .
I 'm going to make the DVCS case for you , right here , right now .
Pretend you 've never heard of it . "
" You 've got your work cut out for you .
To be honest with you , nobody has ever really bothered to tell me what problem this thing solves for me . "
" That 's always the first question ! " , Alice said .
" I 've actually practiced this speech on a few other ex-colleagues , and everybody asks that question .
Unfortunately , that 's the wrong question to be asking .
Instead of asking what problem it solves , you should be asking what new possibilities it offers .
That 's been the real win for us . "
Bob leaned as far back as his chair would allow , and propped his feet up on his desk .
He had been through this many times before , and he knew he was in for a long ride .
He gave Alice her opening : " Alright , I 'll admit to being slightly intrigued .
But we 're really happy with our current VCS , everybody here knows how to use it , and it handles everything we need without any issues . "
Alice smiled widely .
She normally had to work much harder than this to get Bob on the hook .
She knew that beneath the curmudgeon , he still had a passion for technology .
It was her job to make sure that he did n't lose that , and she embraced it proudly .
" Okay , I 'm going to ask you a very important question , and I expect an honest answer .
Has your source control server ever had any downtime ? "
Bob thought for a moment .
" I suppose , sure , but nothing more than the usual .
I mean , our server is up all the time , really .
We plan all our maintenance for the weekends , so other than the occassional hiccup ... "
Before he could finish his sentence , Alice interrupted .
" Yes !
The hiccups !
Those 15 minutes of downtime because of the urgent security patch , the 10 minutes of slowness when two machines are pulling down copies of the repository !
They happen , and you shrug them off because it 's just the way it is .
But do you know how much productivity you lose when somebody loses their train of thought because the server is n't available for their ' annotate ' command ? "
" Look , I get what you 're saying .
But really , these hiccups are n't very common " , Bob retorted .
" I mean , even if they were , you have to compare them against the cost of having everybody switch over to a whole new system .
The last time we did that was a total nightmare .
One of our developers even quit over it !
And that did n't involve explaining to everyone this crazy new distributed source control model .
I 'd have a revolution on my hands . "
Alice responded reassuringly .
" I completely understand .
I had my own reservations until very recently .
One of our developers had been trying to get us to adopt a distributed source control system for a few months .
She liked DVCS so much that she had found some way to use it on her local system and still interoperate with our centralized system .
I was skeptical for the same reasons as you , though , Bob .
I convinced myself that the server was more reliable than it was , and I tried to forget that our VPN would sometimes be down all weekend , forcing developers to come into work to make fixes .
Like you , I did n't really think it was worth it . "
Bob interjected impatiently .
" OK , so what changed your mind ? "
" Last week our system administrator told us they were going to be rebooting the server during lunch time .
This was n't a big deal at the time .
Everybody had advance warning , and they made all of their checkins before lunch , just in case something went wrong .
When we returned , we found our source control system in pieces , its parts splayed all over the desk .
The admin had installed a few security patches , and the server was n't booting .
He said he thought it might be bad memory , but he was n't really sure . "
Alice 's horror story had reminded Bob of a similar situation a year ago when something remarkably similar happened at his own company .
They expected the server to be repaired in 30 minutes , but it dragged to 60 , 90 , then 120 minutes .
By 3:30 PM most of the office had cleared out , leaving a few frustrated developers emailing files to each other as they raced towards the important deadline which was now in jeopardy .
" Bob , are you still there ? "
Bob was growing increasingly nervous as he enumerated in his mind the many things that can go wrong with a server .
" Yes , yes , sorry , you just reminded me of something .
Please , go on . "
" Okay , so the admin could n't give us an ETA on the repair .
We were feeling really helpless , and called a team meeting to decide on a protocol for getting work done while the server was down .
Fortunately , one of our team members had a plan .
You remember that developer I told you about earlier who was using the DVCS on her own system ? "
Alice was talking excitedly now , and did n't bother to wait for Bob 's answer .
" So , she immediately took control of the meeting , and laid out the plan .
She had created a complete copy of the source system just before it went down , you know , just in case of emergency , and it was checked into the DVCS repository on her system .
She gave the group some brief instruction on how to copy the repository , and in less than thirty minutes our entire team was back to work with their own copies of the source . "
" Wait a second , " Bob interrupted .
" You 're telling me that you temporarily switched your entire source control system over in a half hour in the middle of an emergency ?
Forgive me for being skeptical , but I 'm not buying it .
For starters , what happens to your revision history ? "
" When she took a backup of the centralized system , she had done it via a script that preserved the entire revision history .
She said that migrating from centralized systems was common , and writing the script was a breeze since most of the ' heavy lifting ' was built into Mercurial . "
Bob made no attempt to mask his skepticism .
" Okay , I get that , and it's all very impressive , really .
But what about all the work you did while the server was down ?
How did you get it back to the main repository once it was revived ? "
" That 's the best part .
We did n't . "
Alice heard a squeak on the other end of the phone , and knowing that Bob was about to ask her if she was crazy , continued without hesitation .
" The admin kept working on the server throughout the day .
During this time , after everybody had their servers up ... "
Bob cut her off .
" Wait , what ?
Servers ?
I thought they just checked out the source code from their co-worker 's machine ?
Where did all of these servers come from ? "
" That 's exactly the difference between DVCS and a centralized system .
You do n't check out the source code from the server , you clone the repository from the server to your local machine .
Once you 've made the copy , you 're a server too . "
Bob was finding this DVCS concept more and more ridiculous as Alice went on .
" Wait , wait , wait .
Last I checked you had a team of 20 developers . "
" We 're up to 25 now " , Alice corrected .
" And you 're telling me that in response to a temporary server outage , you created 25 separate source control servers , and that 's somehow a good thing ?
How on earth does anybody know what state the source code is in ?
Please tell me I 'm missing something .
I 'm starting to believe you 've gone mad . "
" I know , it sounds like chaos .
And frankly , it could be if we let it .
That 's where process comes in .
In this case , everybody initially cloned the repository from the same server .
So , we designated that as the official server where everybody shared their changes during the downtime . "
" Aha ! " Bob was sure that by the end of this conversation , he 'd would bring Alice back down to earth .
" So you 're taking this confusing and complicated distributed system , and making it act just like a centralized system !
What happens when that server goes down ?
You 're no better off ! "
Alice let out a slightly annoyed chuckle .
" Not exactly .
If the server we 've designated as our central server goes down , which it surely will at some point , so what ?
That 's yet another wonderful feature of a distributed system .
We 've got backups of the code all over the place , without even trying .
Every developer 's server contains a backup copy of most or all of the code from the shared repository .
So , if the main server goes down , we can designate another server as the central server temporarily , or we can not worry about it , since developers can make checkins to their own servers , only sharing changes when needed . "
" Wait a second ! " , Bob interrupted .
" If everybody is making checkins to separate servers , how do you get those changes back together in the so - called central server once it's back up ? "
" That , my skeptical friend , is called a merge . "
" Oh , great , " Bob murmered , " you mean like merging branches ? "
" That 's exactly what I mean .
In fact , repositories and branches are pretty much the same thing in Mercurial .
Whether or not there is a central server , everybody commits changes to their own servers .
Period .
That 's the only place you can commit to .
When you want to combine your changesets with those from your repository , you need to merge them . "
Bob groaned .
" Yuck !
Branches are such a huge pain .
And you 're seriously suggesting that making people merge branches every single time they want to share changes is a good thing ?
I 'm serious , Alice , if you need some help , I know some really good people . "
" You actually have a point there .
We used to think branches were a pain too .
In fact , we only kept a single branch aside from our main repository because merging branches was such a pain .
This is another huge difference between distributed and centralized systems .
Because you merge branches all the time , distributed version control systems make it incredibly easy .
Easy to create branches , easy to share them .
Flexibility , Bob , that 's what it 's all about . "
" I do n't see what 's so flexible about chaos .
All this complexity , just to compensate for a few minor blips of downtime ?
I 'm not buying it . "
" Yes , initially it was just a response to the downtime . "
Alice sensed that she was losing Bob , a phenomenon she was quite familiar with .
She softened her tone .
" On the day we started using Mercurial , it was going to be a temporary thing .
My thought was the same as yours , that it was handy as a temporary crutch , but too complex to keep around .
However , our temporary outage ended up being not - so - temporary . "
" What a nightmare . "
Bob said .
As Alice spoke , he had been working hard trying to convince himself that this was an incredibly uncommon scenario .
Geez , I guess I 'd better confirm that we 're backing our server up daily , Bob thought .
And I wonder if I can get budget for a backup source control server ?
Bob had neglected to mention that he had only a year ago spent $ 25,000 on licenses for his company 's source control software .
While he was proud to now be using the same source control system as big companies like Google and Microsoft , it left him with very little budget for hardware .
As a result , their source server was running on an underpowered machine , and it was not uncommon to hear complaints about its sluggishness .
Bob had also recently received the bill to renew his yearly contract for support and upgrades .
That was going to take another $ 5,000 out of his budget , at the cost of some much needed upgrades to his developers ' machines .
Alice continued .
" It turned out that our source server 's RAID card had died , and we were going to be down for three more days before the part could be delivered .
It was in these three days that we discovered the great value of DVCS , not before .
One group of our developers , for example , had previously been trying to do ' buddy builds ' , where they share their changes with each other before committing to the main repository .
They had initially tried to coordinate this work on a separate branch , but the pain of merging so frequently was killing them , not to mention the fact that they often forgot to make their changes on the branch .
Then they started emailing each other patches , but this , too was prohibitively cumbersome .
To get around this , they ended up sharing their source directories to each other directly , and emailing the names of files that needed to be copied over .
Changes got lost all the time , it was a total mess . "
Alice was talking quickly now , hoping to stop Bob from interrupting .
" The afternoon we started using Mercurial , however , all this stopped .
Each developer would finish their work , commit the relevant changes to their own servers , and then make the changesets available for their colleagues to pull and merge into their repositories . "
Alice had said the magic word .
" Ack ! More merging ! "
" Yes !
More merging !
I 'm making it sound too complicated though .
You only have to actually merge files if the changes you 're pulling overlap with your own changes .
When you do inevitably have to merge , though , you do so after you 've checked in your own changes .
Thus , even if the merge goes awry , you never lose your work because of it , something that is extremely important to us .
Regardless , merging is so simple and fast that it does n't even matter . "
" Well , my source control system supports branches , " Bob replied , " why could n't we do this ? "
" Many of the new and interesting workflows enabled by DVCS are possible in centralized systems , but are simply too much of a pain in practice to have any chance of adoption .
Plus , they can grow organically .
You do n't need to explicitly decide to start working on a branch for buddy builds , you can just make some checkins and choose where to send them .
You 're always working on a branch , in effect , since your local repository is a branch .
Not to mention the fact that you do n't need to ask a server administrator for permission to create a branch . "
" Okay , so you can do buddy builds " , protested Bob , " and if the server hiccups it 's not that big of a deal .
But so what ?
Those things are n't very useful for us .
People around here just come in and do their work .
Even if these benefits are as profound as you suggest , I really do n't think it 's worth training my entire team on some complicated new source control system . "
Alice had n't expected to sway Bob in only a single conversation , but she was nonetheless growing a bit frustrated with her progress .
She had used the same sales pitch on others to great effect , but there was something missing .
It just was n't having the same effect on Bob .
She continued with her defense .
" The things I 've mentioned so far are ' big deals ' .
Having a server down even for only a minute or two is a huge deal , in fact .
Developer time is expensive , and knocking a developer out of the zone because of a server hiccup is , in my mind , totally and completely unacceptable .
Heck , even a bit of server latency can ruin a developer 's ability to stay in the zone . "
" One thing I think you 're forgetting is that we 're using the best centralized system money can buy , " Bob said .
" I 'm sure our server is significantly more speedy and reliable than your free , open source centralized server was .
Everybody here is really happy with it .
I 've even heard them bragging about it to friends at other companies . "
" Okay , " said Alice .
" I 'll play by your rules , even though it 's unfair .
Let 's assume that your server is up 100 % of the time , never any downtime , never a hiccup , never a bit of slowness .
Oh , and everybody has constant access to it .
DVCS still offers advantages beyond simply not needing live server access to get work done . "
" Oh ? Like what ? " , queried Bob , now feeling proud of his progress towards the goal of dragging Alice back into reality .
" Like no more ' check - in races ' , for starters .
It 's a common complaint every place I 've worked .
The first person to commit their changes to the central server avoids having to be the one who merges changes .
Thus , the next committer is forced to perform the merge , whethero r not they are the best person to merge the changes .
I 've actually seen people switch workstations for ten minutes so the changes could be merged by the proper resource .
How ridiculous is that ?
With DVCS , because changes are committed locally , nobody is ever denied the ability to do so because of someone else 's changes .
And once they are committed , anyone can pull the changes together and merge them .
If you had two developers racing towards a deadline , another less busy developer could volunteer to do all of the change merging . "
" Yeah , well , " Bob smirked , " I guess our needs are n't quite as sophisticated as yours .
Do n't get me wrong , some of the stuff you 're talking about sounds interesting , and hey , if we were n't using the best centralized system that money can buy , I might be more interested .
Really , whatever flaws there are in our current system , we 've made the necessary adjustments .
People here are happy .
We 're doing great work , the team gets along well .
I just do n't see the case for DVCS . "
Alice realized that there was no more she could do .
She bit her lip , resisting the urge to respond defensively .
Planting the seed , she realized , was the best she could hope for with Bob .
She leaned back in her chair , shook her head softly , and ended the conversation .
" You 'll see , Bob , just wait . "

I can see the ads now :
Hillary ’s husband pardoned a pair of cop -killer terrorists .
Sure , it was never proven that the people Bill Clinton pardoned were actually cop killers ( they were “ only ” terrorists ) .
I mean , yeah , they were found unloading 740 pounds of dynamite and a submachine gun from their car , and they were members of a domestic terrorist group that bombed the US Congress , the Pentagon , and the State Department , and also killed two cops and a security guard – but it was never really PROVEN that they DIRECTLY killed the two cops and the security guard , so no harm no foul , right ?
Boy , when Hillary said she embraces America ’s gun culture , she was n’t kidding .
Hillary now says that she knows nothing of her husband ’s pardon .
That ’s a lie , and one of the more egregious ones coming from Hillary of late , and that ’s saying something .
The case of the two terrorists Bill pardoned is from New York .
It was a huge controversy right when Hillary was running to be the Senator from NY .
We ’re to believe that the Clinton political people did n’t bother telling Hillary that they were thinking of pardoning a pair of terrorists from the state she was trying to represent as a Senator ?
Right .
She ’s lying , again .
Putting Hillary ’s serial lies aside for a moment , what ’s most troubling about this story is that Hillary now knows that her top surrogate , the man who will be her co-president , is soft on terrorists , and Hillary does n’t seem to care .
I mean , when a top Obama surrogate called Hillary a “ monster , ” Hillary went crazy and the Obama surrogate was forced to resign .
But now Hillary ’s top surrogate embraces actual monsters , and sets them free while America is at war against terrorists , and Hillary shrugs and confesses ignorance ( not exactly the answer of someone who ’s “ fully vetted ” ) .
She ’s not ignorant now .
Now she knows the story .
So why has n’t she done anything about it ?
Imagine had Obama kept his top surrogate after it was revealed that the surrogate freed two cop-killing terrorists – oh I ’m sorry , two terrorists who were members of an organization that killed two cops and bombed numerous federal buildings .
Oh the fun Hillary ( and the media ) would have with that story .
And just imagine the fun the Republicans will have in the fall , branding us as the party that has more sympathy with cop-killing terrorists than with the widows of the cops they killed ( you know the GOP will get those women in TV ads that will be the war on terror version of Willy Horton ) .
It ’s time that Hillary showed Democrats , and all of America , that she is n’t soft on crime , soft on terrorism , soft on cop-killers .
Because as it stands , her indifference to the death of two police officers , and the bombing of US federal buildings , while America is at war is writing the Republicans ’ own script for their attack ads in the fall .
What ’s worse , Hillary had no problem criticizing Bill ’s offer to pardon even more terrorists in 1999 ( what is it with him ? ) , but now when it comes to people who kill cops and bomb federal buildings , Hillary is mum about pardoning their members :
Although Hillary Clinton publicly disputed her husband ’s offer of clemency to Puerto Rican nationalists in 1999 because they had not sufficiently renounced violence , she is not known to have objected to his freeing of Rosenberg and Evans in 2001 .
Does n’t look good .
And not sounding awfully vetted .

せっかく面白い話なのに、proof carrying codeとかC言語の形式的意味論とかの各論に、論理の飛躍やテクニカルな誤り（単によく知らないだけ？）が多いせいで「暴言」になっていてもったいないです…。" Computer Science " と自然科学と数学の対比や、TAPL / ATTAPLに関する下りはちょっと同意します。というかBenjaminも「もう書きたくない」と言っていました。:-)
それはともかく、全体として提起されている問題意識ですが、自然科学や数学では確立している、基礎研究と応用の（「つながり」よりもむしろ）「すみわけ」が計算機科学では成熟していないせいじゃないか、と私は思ってます。たとえば相対性理論やフェルマーの大定理が「ユーザの役に立たない」とか「税金の無駄遣いだ」とか文句を言う人は（あまり）いないですよね。

物事に価値があるかどうかを客観的な視点から評価することができるのは，ユーザーだけだ。ユーザーがいなければ，物事に価値など与えることはできない。これは極論だと思うけれど，もしその極論を受け入れるなら，純粋にアカデミックな研究――つまり，研究者を相手にした研究などは，とうてい無意味なものであるという結論に辿り着くだろう。
この論理もちょっとよくわかりません…。普通は「基礎研究 」 →「 応用研究 」 →「実用」のようなユーザのレイヤーがあるので（実際にはもっと何層もあると思います）、「研究者相手の研究」にユーザがいない、というのは事実ではありませんし、そういう意味ではユーザからきちんと評価されていると思います。（もし「まだエンドユーザがいない、あるいは評価できないものは価値がない」という仮定だったら極論としても明らかに偽なので、それを「受け入れ」ても意味のある結論は得られないように思います。）
物事の進歩は小さな改良の積み重ねによって起こるものなのに，新たな価値が創出される瞬間というのは，そういった加算的な進歩の流れからは外れた飛躍が発生する。というか，発生しなければならない。ただそれは，必然的に発生する進歩とは別で，大いに偶然性の絡むものであるように感じられる。ダメなときはダメってことを受け入れなきゃならないってことだよ。
ある程度の偶然は確かにあると思いますが、私は「小さな改良の積み重ね」に基づかない「飛躍」を寡聞にして知りません。「ダメなとき」＝「うまくいかない科学的理由が明白になったとき」（また例が悪いかもしれませんが、錬金術と質量保存則とか）ならばわかりますが、単に「今現在、役に立たないからダメ」と（数年や数十年で）諦めてしまっては、小さな改良も、飛躍も起こらないのではないかと思います。
むしろ、 「現在の計算機科学（ないしプログラミング言語理論）は永久に役に立たない」と思っている人がいるから、元エントリのような話が出るのではないかと思うので、「なぜ永久に役に立たないと（その人は）考えるのか」という部分に興味があります。ひょっとしたら現在の研究の本当の問題が明らかになるかもしれませんし、あわよくば:-)解決に結びつくかもしれません。あるいは単に、やはり基礎研究と応用のすみわけが成熟していないせいで、まだ実用化には時間のかかる研究を「役に立つ」と研究者が宣伝しすぎている反動かもしれません。

O'Reilly : Rev. Wright ' came very close to bringing Obama down ' David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Wednesday March 26 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Fox host Bill O'Reilly called columnist and author Roland S. Martin the " chief apologist " for Sen .
Barack 's embattled ex-pastor , Rev. Jeremiah Wright , leading Martin to an animated response at his website .
Speaking with former award - winning CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg , well - known for his scathing attacks on what he perceives as liberal bias in the media , O'Reilly described Martin as " a race guy " and sought Goldberg 's opinion on the Wright fracas , which Fox has focused on heavily in recent weeks .
Said Goldberg of Martin , " We can see that [ he ] is a black man , but many white liberal journalists take the exact same position .
...
The reason white liberals want to downplay this kind of stuff is because they want to say , ' Look at me , I 'm one of the good white guys .
I will ignore black racism , I will ignore stupid remarks by a black person ... because I want to show you my racial decency . ' "
He termed such behavior as " white liberal paternalism . "
Goldberg continously referred to snippets of Wright 's controversial sermons , saying matter - of - factly that Wright fingered " white people " as being the causes behind AIDS and drugs in blacks neighborhoods .
In fact , Wright repetitively placed blame for these and other ills on the U.S. government .
O'Reilly agreed with Goldberg , adding , " I think you 're right , but I think there 's a political component here as well .
I think the Rev. Wright story came very close to bringing Barack Obama down . "
In response to O'Reilly 's remarks , Martin ( who was not present to respond ) wrote this post at his personal blog :
You tell your audience that I'm a Wright apologist , but you do n't even bother to tell your audience what I even said on the issue .
Dude , that 's Journalism 101 .
You offer no facts , no analysis , just a weak opinion .
You paraphrased me saying that I did n't think the issue is no big deal .
WRONG . ...
If you want to tell your audience that I 'm an apologist , do me the favor and say what I said , as opposed to show a photo of me and offer no facts whatsoever .
...
For someone who has done your show eight to 10 times , and who has actually defended you from the folks who think you are to the right of Hitler , I 'm terribly disappointed that you [ were ] so weak with the facts .
Had you worked under me at the three papers I 've run , as well as website and radio station newsroom , you would have gotten verbally smacked down for such weak journalism ...
Attacks on US soldiers had dropped since last summer 's troop surge
Three other troops and an Iraqi interpreter were also injured in the blast , an army statement said .
The attack is one of the deadliest against US forces in the Iraqi capital since last summer 's US troop surge .
It came hours after a leader of a Sunni tribal alliance fighting al - Qaeda in Iraq was killed in a suicide bomb attack at his home in northern Iraq .
Thaer Ghadban al - Karkhi died when a woman detonated an explosives vest as he answered the door at his home in Baquba .
His daughter and two guards also died .
Mr al - Karkhi was a member of the mainly Sunni Arab Awakening councils , allied with the US military against al - Qaeda in Iraq .
Sunni militias have been credited with helping to bring down the level of violence in Iraq in recent months .
Most vulnerable
The US military told the BBC that the attack on its troops took place in the Mansour district of the capital .
" Five soldiers paid the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of the Iraqi and American people , " said Col Allen Batschelet , chief of staff of US forces in Baghdad .
" We remain resolute in our resolve to protect the people of Iraq and kill or capture those who would bring them harm . "
The strike takes the number of US troops killed since the US - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 close to 4,000 , says the BBC's Hugh Sykes in Baghdad .
RECENT US TROOP DEATHS 9 February : Four killed by roadside bomb north - west of Baghdad 28 January : Five killed by roadside bomb in Mosul 9 January :
Six killed entering a booby - trapped house north - east of Baghdad
As the invasion 's five - year anniversary approaches , many Baghdad neighbourhoods have witnessed security improvements , with the number of attacks on American soldiers significantly down from last year .
The bomber had targeted the US military at their most vulnerable , as military patrols around the Iraqi capital are often conducted in armoured vehicles , our correspondent says .
But the US troops cannot function unless they get out of their armoured vehicles and engage with the people , he adds .
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexico City on Thursday banned cigarette smoking in all public places , from bars to office buildings , to reduce the amount of carcinogens inhaled by residents of the smog - filled capital .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The city , home to some 18 million people in the metropolitan area , is the latest large city around the world to pass a smoking ban to improve public health and protect nonsmokers from secondary smoke .
But not all Mexicans are happy about the prospect of smoke - free cantinas where tequila and cigarettes are traditionally enjoyed hand - in - hand .
“ Right now I ’m fine , but later tonight -- after a couple of drinks -- I ’m going to really want one , ” said 26 - year - old Rodrigo Nunez , a smoker and government office worker playing a game of pool in a bar in the fashionable Condesa neighborhood on his lunch break .
The law to ban smoking in all enclosed areas , from sidewalk cafes to public transportation to elevators and schools , was passed by the city assembly in November .
Smokers who violate the ban can be fined between $ 50 and $ 300 , with higher penalties for bar and restaurant owners who allow smoking .
The fines will not be applied until next week , giving restaurant and bar owners time to post large no -smoking signs to let people know about the change .
Major U.S. cities like New York and Los Angeles as well as countries across Europe have enforced similar bans .
The Dutch government is even planning a cigarette smoking ban in Amsterdam that would apply to coffee shops where patrons can legally smoke marijuana .
But in Mexico , where businessmen still often smoke in meetings and most restaurants lack nonsmoking sections , the habit will be hard to break .
“ The young people will accept it because they will realize that it ’s a step forward ... it ’s the old people who will be upset , ” resident Jose Manuel Ogando said .
It ’s the starting and stopping , the opening and closing , that can make microwaving annoying .
But Ms. Kafka is right : if you err on the side of undercooking , you ca n’t go far wrong .
So if you ’re using an older recipe , start by cutting either the time or the power in half .
Take notes ; they will help you the next time you make a recipe from the same source .
One of the real beauties of the oven is that when the timer goes off , the thing stops heating .
You can set your asparagus for two minutes and go for a walk ; when you come back it ’ll be “ parboiled . ”
Try that on top of the stove !
I was starting to think the microwave needed a new name that would reflect the thing it does best .
Something like “ the whiz - bang steaming oven . ”
Reinvigorated and inspired , I reviewed the reader suggestions I ’d asked for on Bitten .
Most , not surprisingly , were for vegetables .
Some went farther afield , and these I pursued with mixed and mostly unconvincing results .
Toasting nuts and spices : yes , but not easier than stovetop .
Poaching or scrambling eggs : fast , but unreliable beyond belief .
( I have never had a harder scrambled egg . )
Melting butter or chocolate : yes , but if your timing is off , you ’ll make a mess and possibly burn the chocolate .
“ Baked ” apple : a nice snack .
The microwave does a fine job on rice , saving you a pot because you can do it in your serving dish , as long as you can figure out how to set your oven so that the water does n’t boil over , meaning you have to wash the carousel .
( One - and - a - half times as much water as rice , salt , plastic wrap with a vent slit cut in it , about 12 minutes at full power . )
But risotto , no , at least not for me ; all the stirring makes it more trouble than it ’s worth .
It ’s the same for chicken stock , which I ’d rather make by the gallon than by the quart , thank you .
My conclusion to that point was , if you can steam it , you can microwave it .
But only with vegetables was the improvement clear .

Two reader suggestions opened my eyes .
A young woman from Riverdale named Mee-Lise Robinson suggested flourless chocolate cake , and a number of other readers suggested puddings .
With both of those dishes , you want low heat and no crust : what would make normal cakes a failure are just what the microwave is good at .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Former Beatle Paul McCartney is urging the world to go vegetarian in a bid to fight global warming and is surprised more green groups do n’t promote it .
In an interview with the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) , McCartney said the global meat industry was a major contributor to global warming .
A transcript of the PETA interview was given to Reuters .
“ The biggest change anyone could make in their own lifestyle would be to become vegetarian , ” McCartney , a longtime vegetarian and advocate of vegetarianism , said .
“ I would urge everyone to think about taking this simple step to help our precious environment and save it for the children of the future . ”
McCartney says the amount of land and water used to maintain the meat industry makes it a major contributor to climate change and complains that most environmental groups do not list vegetarianism as one of their top priorities .
“ It ’s very surprising that most major environmental organizations are leaving the option of going vegetarian off their lists of top ways to curtail global warming , ” he said .
A 2006 United Nations report found that cattle - rearing generated more greenhouse gases than transportation .
Medical gauze has n't changed much since World War I : Medics can only stuff it into a gushing wound and pray .
Now chemists have infused cotton gauze with nanoparticles , giving it a vastly improved ability to halt blood loss – even in tight spots like the neck or groin where it 's hard to apply pressure .
The new material could help save lives on the battlefield and in civilian situations , where trauma victims often bleed to death before they can be transported to a hospital or other medical facility .
" We are currently testing bandages because hemorrhage is a leading cause of death in military trauma patients , " says Richard McCarron , head of trauma and resuscitative medicine at the Naval Medical Research Center in Silver Spring , Md. " The recent tests with Combat Gauze indicate that it decreased blood loss and improved survival . "
In this video , researchers test Combat Gauze on an anesthetized pig .
The pig 's aorta is slit , then the gauze is applied for a brief time , which stops the flow of blood .
Warning : Content may be disturbing to some viewers .
For more , visit wired.com / video .
The lifesaving fabric McCarron refers to is made by Z - Medica , a medical products company based in Connecticut .
According to Z- Medica CEO Ray
Huey , the new product has already saved two lives .
" In 2002 , following the September 11 attacks , the military was looking at new technologies to stop bleeding , " Huey says .
When the Navy conducted a test of high - tech medical products , Huey says the clear winner was Z - Medica 's first product , QuikClot , a grainy powder that can be dumped into gushing wounds to stanch bleeding .
Shortly thereafter , the military started sending it to troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Unfortunately , the soldiers reported some problems : QuikClot would get hot when it came into contact with blood or water , and in some instances it caused serious burns .
While burns are better than bleeding to death , it still was n't an optimal solution .
The Navy turned to Galen Stucky , one of the top names in inorganic materials research , to work out the kinks .
Stucky and several graduate students were able to solve the heating problem , file several patents , and form a business relationship with Z - Medica .
Ironically , the solution to the heating problem lay in replacing QuikClot with a material that has been used in medical tests for more than 50 years .
The key ingredient in the new gauze is kaolin clay , which is often used to make pottery and happens to be rich in aluminosilicate nanoparticles – which trigger blood clotting .
" Kaolin clay has been used since the 1950s as an activating agent for a clotting test that medical doctors routinely perform , " says graduate student April Sawvel , who worked on the project .
" We tested it against the original granular QuikClot and discovered that it worked just as well , but without the large heat release associated with the original QuikClot formulation . "
Although researchers have raised concerns about the safety of nanoparticles , the aluminosilicates found in kaolin clay have been used on the human body , and introduced into it , for eons .
Furthermore , by triggering blood clotting , the nanoparticles should effectively trap themselves at the site of the injury – so they do n't wind up wandering deep into the body .
Immediately following the researchers ' discovery , Z - Medica quickly moved to combine the clay with gauze , making it much easier to use .
" We immediately started looking at ways to impregnate gauze with this material , " Huey says .
" We very quickly prototyped some material .
When I say very quickly , I mean within less than two weeks . "
Less than a year later , QuickClot Combat Gauze is in the hands of Special Forces operators , the Coast Guard and emergency - room doctors .

Disgusting video footage of New York cops clubbing and arresting peaceful Tibetan protesters who were merely walking down the street has gone relatively ignored beyond Youtube .
While stories emerge out of China every day of police beating and killing Tibetan protestors in the streets , the same sort of behavior by cops in America tells its own story .
The footage was shot at a free Tibet peaceful assembly in New York on the 14th of March .
It shows the protestors holding flags and signs and peacefully walking down the street towards the UN building in the Turtle Bay neighborhood only to be accosted by police officers with batons .
One officer identified as " Delgado " is seen in the video pushing people as the group crosses the street .
Another officer , identified as " Serano " is caught threatening to kill two protesters as the cameraman passes .
He later admits to the threat and apologizes for it .
As the group nears the UN building , cop cars and vans screech onto the sidewalks , cops pour out and begin to beat the protesters with clubs as UN security guards observe without becoming involved .
A non uniformed officer , who seems to be directing the entire operation , then orders the cameraman to step back and move away .
" Look at these cops , clubbing people in front of the UN , unbelievable , protesting to free Tibet , cops clubbing people in their legs on the sidewalk , in front of the UN in America , unbelievable , this is not China . " the American cameraman announces in disbelief .
The officer identified as Serano then forces the cameraman away from the melee , telling him to shut the camera off and that he will not talk to him because he may be a reporter .
Several officers then follow the cameraman asking him about his recording of the incident .

If you were a hyper advanced alien civilization , rather then mucking about with noisy electromagnetic waves , perhaps you would try to make contact with other intelligent life forms by sending your messages via neutrinos .
First detected in 1953 , neutrinos pass easily through most matter making it possible for your signal to pass through the Milky Way without being blocked by stars and interstellar dust .
They are also not subject to the " noise " of optical and radio waves traveling alongside them through space .
Aliens with access to abundant power ( one neutrino production technique requires 3 % the output of our sun , another is within range of earthly thermonuclear power plants ) could send pulsed and directional neutrino messages to us .
Luckily we are building elaborate neutrino detectors already ( they must be very large and built deep underground or water to shielded from cosmic rays and other background radiation ) .
The United States is building a neutrino detector called IceCube in Antarctica ( seen above ) to detect naturally occurring neutrinos for scientific research .
If they were to detect neutrinos at 6.3 petaelectron - volts ( PeV ) it could be a tell - tale sign of an artificially constructed signal , since there is no known natural process that would create neutrinos of that energy level .
Researchers on earth however have identified two ways that such neutrinos could be created in the lab .
Maybe we will soon be smart enough to be able to hear from more advanced civilizations .

My Salon column is out : Blowback from the GOP ’s holy war :
The 2008 Republican race has left a bitter legacy of sloganeering against Muslims .
It may well haunt the party this November .
Excerpt :
‘ Giuliani complained that during their debates , Democratic rivals “ never mentioned the word ‘ Islamic terrorist , ’ ‘ Islamic extremist , ’ ‘ Islamic fascist , ’ ‘ terrorist , ’ whatever combination of those words you want to use , [ the ] words never came up . ”
He added , “ I ca n’t imagine who you insult if you say ‘ Islamic terrorist . ’
You do n’t insult anyone who is Islamic who is n’t a terrorist . ”
But people are not “ Islamic , ” they are Muslim .
And one most certainly does insult Muslims by tying their religion to movements such as terrorism or fascism .
Muslims perceive a double standard in this regard : Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols would never be called “ Christian terrorists ” even though they were in close contact with the Christian Identity Movement .
No one would speak of Christofascism or Judeofascism as the Republican candidates speak of Islamofascism .
Muslims point out that persons of Christian heritage invented fascism , not Muslims , and deny that Muslim movements have any link to the mass politics of the 1930s in Europe .
Giuliani ’s pledge to take the United States on an offensive against Islamic fascism , which he also said would be a long - term battle , failed to excite the imagination of voters .
It may well have alarmed them in a way different from what Giuliani intended : If , by Giuliani ’s logic , the United States is only on the “ defensive ” now , with wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , what would being on the offensive look like ?
Would Giuliani have started four wars ?
Interestingly , Giuliani did especially poorly in Florida among retired and active - duty military personnel . ‘
Oh bum bot .
We remember when you were fresh out of the hands of creator Rufus Terrill .
Now look at you -- featured on the Colbert Report .
You may have seen photos of this vagrant - deterring robot before , but you have n't lived till you 've seen the hard - hitting , in - depth coverage that Stephen Colbert delivers on it .
Take a look at the video after the break to see a defender of America ( and bot ) on the front lines of battle .

US Anti-War Leaders Said Being Sent To CIA Torture Bases
By : Sorcha Faal , and as reported to her Western Subscribers ( Traducción al Español abajo )
Disturbing reports from the United States are emerging today that their War Leaders have ordered a crackdown on all opposition to their Mideast wars , to include the sending of American Anti-War leaders to CIA torture bases in Romania and Egypt .
Though not being reported by the US propaganda media organs , Western reports are stating that , so far , nearly 200 American antiwar activists have been attacked and arrested by black helmeted paramilitary police forces , with over 140 being reported captured in San Francisco alone .
FSB reports are further stating that as many as 12 of the American antiwar protest leaders have been ‘ removed ’ from the United States and sent to CIA torture bases , and which appears to be confirmed by Ireland ’s Limerick Leader News Service who are reporting that the CIA has , indeed , resumed its torture flights , and as we can read :
" Four CIA jets , two of which were identified last year in a special EU report into the practice of extraordinary rendition , have landed at Shannon Airport in recent days , leading to renewed calls for the Government to ban aircraft suspected of participating in the practice .
Extraordinary renditions are operations to apprehend terrorists abroad and transport them to another state for interrogation , usually without the knowledge of the host government .
The procedure was developed by the CIA in the mid-1990s . "
Not being understood by the people of the United States is that their government does have the power to remove , imprison and torture any of them , for any reason , and as established by the case of Jose Padilla , an American citizen jailed and tortured for over 4 years by the US Military .
Most frightening , however , about the Jose Padilla case , is the US Federal Court Ruling regarding the holding of American citizens without rights or trials , and as we can read :
" On September 9 , 2005 , a three - judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that President Bush does indeed have the authority to detain Padilla without charges , in an opinion written by judge J. Michael Luttig .
In the ruling , Luttig cited the joint resolution by Congress authorizing military action following the September 11 , 2001 attacks , as well as the June 2004 ruling concerning Yaser Hamdi . "
Even more horrific for these American ’s future are their War Leaders support of the use of torture , and as we can read as reported by the Associated Press News Service :
" Passed by both the House and the Senate , HR 2082 would have required the CIA to obey the Geneva Conventions and stay within the interrogation techniques found in the US Army Field Manual .
The Army Field Manual and the Military Code of Justice forbid torture .
However , last week George Bush vetoed this bill over the objections of countless retired Admirals and Generals to allow the CIA to continue to interrogate under its own classified guidelines which allow the use of torture . "
It is interesting to note , too , that one of the United States most respected literary giants , Naomi Wolf , has , likewise , attempted to warn her fellow American citizens about the growing dangers they are facing with the publication of her book , “ The End of America : A Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot ” , and which details the ‘ 10 Steps ’ all Fascist governments use to create their police state nations , and which are :
1. Invoke a terrifying internal and external enemy
2. Create a gulag
3. Develop a thug caste
4 . Set up an internal surveillance system
5. Harass citizens ' groups
6 . Engage in arbitrary detention and release
7 . Target key individuals
8. Control the press
9 . Dissent equals treason
10 .
Suspend the rule of law
Sadly , however , there remains no evidence that the American people are heeding the warnings of the dangers they are facing with the destruction of their Nation , and which eerily echo ’s the words of warning of German Pastor Friedrich Martin Niemöller , and who attempted to warn his people of the danger the Nazi ’s posed for their once great country with his famous poem ‘ First They Came ’ , and whose words are as relevant today to the Americans as they were prophetic to the Germans , and are worth our attention again :
" In Germany , they came first for the Communists , And I did n’t speak up because I was n’t a Communist ;
And then they came for the trade unionists ,
And I did n’t speak up because I was n’t a trade unionist ;
And then they came for the Jews , And I did n’t speak up because I was n’t a Jew ;
And then . . . they came for me . . .
And by that time there was no one left to speak up . "

SE DICE LIDERES MOVIMIENTO ANTI - GUERRA ESTAN SIENDO ENVIADOS A BASES DE TORTURA DE LA CIA .
Por : Sorcha Faal como lo informa a sus suscriptores occidentales
Inquietantes informes están saliendo hoy desde los Estados Unidos de que sus
jefes guerreros han ordenado una represión a toda la oposición a sus guerras
del Medio Oriente que incluirán el envío de líderes de movimiento
anti -guerra a las bases de tortura de la CIA en Rumania y en Egipto .
Aunque no es informado por los medios de propaganda Estadounidenses , los
informes occidentales están señalando que , hasta ahora , casi 200 activistas
Estadounidenses anti-guerra han sido atacados y arrestados por policía
paramilitar con cascos negros , reportándose 140 capturados nada más en San
Francisco .
Los reportes de la FSB señalan además que tantos como 12 de los líderes de
protesta anti-guerra Estadounidenses han sido " retirados " de los Estados
Unidos y enviados a centros de tortura de la CIA y que parece estar esto
confirmado por el servicio noticioso de Irlanda , Limerick Leader que está
publicando que la CIA , de hecho , ha reanudado sus vuelos de tortura como lo
podemos leer :
" Cuatro jets de la CIA , dos de ellos identificados el año pasado en un
informe especial de la Unión Europea de ser utilizados en la práctica de
entrega extraordinaria , han aterrizado en el Aeropuerto de Shannon hace
pocos días , llevando esto a nuevos llamados al gobierno de prohibir las
aeronaves sospechosas de participar en esa práctica .
Las entregas extraordinarias son operaciones para aprehender terroristas en
el extranjero y transportarlos a otro país para su interrogatorio ,
generalmente sin el conocimiento del gobierno anfitrión .
El procedimiento
fue desarrollado por la CIA a mediados de los 1990's " .
Lo que no es comprendido por el pueblo de los Estados Unidos es que su
gobierno no tiene la autoridad para retirar , aprisionar ni torturar a
ninguno de ellos , por ninguna razón , como lo estableció el caso de José
Padilla , un ciudadano Estadounidense encarcelado y torturado por casi 4 años
por el ejército Estadounidense .
Lo más aterrador sobre el caso de José Padilla , es la Resolución de la Corte
Federal de los Estados Unidos con relación a la retención de ciudadanos
Estadounidenses sin derecho a juicio , como lo podemos leer :
" El 9 de septiembre de 2005 , un panel de tres jueces de la Cuarta Corte de
Circuito de Apelaciones decidió que el Presidente Bush sí tiene , de hecho ,
la autoridad para detener a Padilla sin cargos , en una opinión escrita por
el juez J. Michael Luttig .
En la decisión , Luttig citó la resolución
conjunta por parte del Congreso que autoriza la acción militar subsiguiente
a los ataques del 11 de septiembre de 2001 , así como la decisión de junio de
2004 relacionada con Yacer Hamdi "
Todavía más aterrador para el futuro de estos Estadounidenses es el apoyo de
sus jefes guerreros para el uso de la tortura , como lo informa la Associated
Press :
" Aprobada tanto por los Diputados como por el Senado , la Iniciativa HR 2082
habría requerido que la CIA obedeciera las Convenciones de Ginebra y se
atuviera a las técnicas de interrogatorio que contiene el Manual de Campo
del Ejército Estadounidense .
El Manual de Campo y el Código Militar de
Justicia prohíben la tortura .
Sin embargo , la semana pasada George Bush vetó esta iniciativa sobre las
objeciones de un sin fin de Almirantes y Generales retirados por permitir
que la CIA continúe sus interrogatorios bajo sus propias pautas que permiten
el uso de la tortura "
Es interesante señalar , también , que una de las gigantes literarias más
respetadas de los Estados Unidos , Naomi Wolf , igualmente , intentó advertir a
sus compatriotas Estadounidenses sobre los crecientes peligros que están
enfrentando con la publicación de su libro " El Fin de los Estados Unidos :
Una Carta de Advertencia a un Joven Patriota " y que detalla los " 10 Pasos "
que todos los gobiernos fascistas crean para sus países estado - policía y que
son :
1.- Invocar a un enemigo aterrador interno y externo
2.- Crear un Gulag
3.- Desarrollar una casta de matones .
4.- Establecer un sistema interno de vigilancia
5.- Hostigar a los grupos de ciudadanos
6.- Practicar la detención y liberación arbitraria
7.- Hacer objetivo a individuos clave
8.- Controlar a la prensa
9.- Comparar el disentimiento con la traición
10 .- Suspender el estado de derecho
Tristemente , no hay evidencia de que el pueblo Estadounidense esté haciendo
caso de las advertencias de los peligros que tienen enfrente con la
destrucción de su país , y que pavorosamente , hace eco de las palabras de
advertencia del Pastor de origen Alemán , Friedrich Martín Niemöller y que
trató de advertir a su pueblo del peligro que representaban los Nazis para
su otrora gran país con su famoso poema " Primero Vinieron " y cuyas palabras
son tan relevantes hoy para los Estadounidenses como lo fueron proféticas
para los Alemanes y que vale la pena ponerles atención de nuevo :
" En Alemania , primero vinieron por los Comunistas , y yo no hablé porque yo
no era Comunista ,
Y luego vinieron por los sindicalistas y yo no hablé porque yo no era
sindicalista ,
Y luego vinieron por los Judíos y yo no hablé porque yo no era Judío ,
Y luego , vinieron por mí ... y para entonces ya no había nadie que pudiera
hablar " .

For rancher Randy Petrich , the removal of gray wolves from the endangered species list — a move that would open up the animals to hunting in the Northern Rockies for the first time in decades — could n't come soon enough .
On the same land where it was once rare to see the animal , Petrich has seen fresh wolf tracks almost every morning this fall — close enough to threaten his cattle .
" I believe that any wolf on any given night , if there happens to be a calf there , they will kill it , " Petrich said .
" In reality , to help us now , we need to be trapping them , shooting them — as many as possible . "
Just 12 years since the wolves were reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park after years of near - extinction , federal officials say the sharp rise in the wolf population in the region justifies removing them from the endangered species list .
Critics , however , say the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is moving too fast , and could be setting the stage for a slaughter that would push wolves back to the brink in the Rockies .
For cattle ranchers like Petrich in the Paradise Valley north of Yellowstone , who already have the right to kill predators threatening their stock , the killing of wolves who established new territories outside the park has already begun .
Seven times in the last five years , Petrich , a third - generation rancher , has shot a wolf for killing or harassing cattle .
It took $ 24 million of federal funds and more than two decades to bring wolves back from near - extinction in the northern Rocky Mountains — the result of a government eradication program in the mid-1900s that included widespread poisoning of wolves .
After years of debate , an initial 66 wolves were transplanted into the park from Canada beginning in 1995 .
Now , an estimated 1,545 roam Idaho , Montana and Wyoming — more than enough , federal official say , to justify removing them from the endangered species list .
" The more of something you have , the less valuable each individual piece becomes , " said Ed Bangs , the Fish and Wildlife Service 's wolf recovery project leader .
" If you have more wolves than you have now , it 's really going to start causing a lot of problems . "
Environmentalists fighting the plan argue that at least 2,000 to 3,000 wolves are needed in the region to keep them from again disappearing from the American West .
" This is all about wolf killing , " said Doug Honnold , an attorney for the environmental group Earthjustice .
" This approach of managing wolves to the knife - edge where they say the population would be at risk of extinction is simply crazy . "
In recent years , as the wolf population re-established itself , the number of cattle , sheep and other domestic animals killed by wolves has soared from 123 in 2000 to 330 this year through early October .
The number of wolves killed in response — by ranchers and federal wildlife agents acting on their behalf — increased sevenfold in the same period , from 20 to 146 .
Under the plan to delist the animal , hunters and trappers would be allowed to obtain permits to kill wolves .
As long as at least 450 wolves survived , the animal would remain fair game .
Any fewer and hunting and trapping would be curtailed .
If their numbers dropped below 300 , they would go back on the endangered list .
Several environmental groups are promising lawsuits to halt delisting .
Anticipating court delays , the Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing a backup plan that would keep wolves on the endangered list but loosen restrictions on when they could be killed to protect game animals such as elk — the wolves ' natural prey .
Federal wildlife officials offer a paradoxical reasoning for their bid to remove the animal from the endangered list .
To survive in the Rockies , they say , wolves must be hunted and killed .
By reclassifying them as " big - game , " wolves could emerge from centuries of persecution and find a niche along other regularly hunted predators such as mountain lions and black bears .
Those predators , too , were once at risk of disappearing but rebounded after their status changed from predators that could be shot on sight to big - game animals with limits on how many can be hunted .
Similarly , if wolves are removed from the endangered list , proponents argue , states could tailor the number of wolf hunting permits around target population levels .
But some wolf experts say managing wolves is not so simple .
David Mech , a University of Minnesota researcher considered one of the world 's leading experts on wolf behavior , predicted populations in the Northern Rockies could hold steady or keep expanding , even with hunting permitted , if the wily animals prove too smart for hunters .
Since reintroduction , wolf numbers have increased 20 % to 30 % a year as the animals thrived in a habitat flush with elk , moose and other prey .
Even where entire packs were taken out to curb livestock kills , new packs have quickly filled the gap .
Petrich 's tale offers testimony to that resiliency .
The seven he killed — plus another taken out by a fellow rancher and two more shot by federal wildlife agents — were all from a single pack .
Each time , the pack 's numbers quickly rebounded and the killing of livestock resumed , according to federal data .
Although his wolf kills have earned praise from fellow ranchers , Petrich shrugs off the attention , saying he shot the wolves out of necessity , to protect his ranch and his family .
" This is something we 're going to have to keep doing , " he said .
" I did n't ask for this .
...
We 're just going to have to cope with it however we can . "

Many people do n’t know what to expect when they go to a dentist for denture care for the first time .
Some people think that these clinics will take all of the teeth you have left out , and that ’s not really what happens .
While there are some places that only take care of dentures , they are uncommon .
Some of them are regular dental practices that have dentists who specialize in dentures , whereas others are denture clinics that also help with other things .
These services are , of course , on top of denture home care that you may be doing when you get your dentures .
Going to a dentist for dentures near me torrance does n’t have to be stressful ; many times , it ’s just like going to get something else done .
You ’ll sign in , go to the back when you ’re called , and start your appointment off with a dental assistant or dental hygienist .
You may still need to get imaging ( x - rays ) done , and if you still have some of your natural teeth , you may also get a cleaning .
Dentures do not necessarily only include full sets of teeth .
Specializing in dentures can include bite plates that have several fake teeth in them , or even implants that replace one or two teeth .
In general , going to a denture clinic is no different than the appointments that you ’ve had with your regular dentist for your entire life .
Talk to your dentist to see what they have to say about the whole thing .
They can talk to you about the steps that you should be taking and let you know how you want to work toward your goals without a lot of stress and pressure at the same time .

Rainy weather and poor logistics thwarted efforts by relief troops who walked for hours over rock , debris and mud on Tuesday in hopes of reaching the worst - hit area of an earthquake that killed nearly 10,000 in central China , state - run media reported .
Setting out from Maerkang in Sichuan Province at 8 p.m. Monday , the 100 or so troops had to travel 200 kilometers ( 124 miles ) to go before reaching Wenchuan , the epicenter of the quake , also in the province , Xinhua reported .
After seven hours , they still had 70 kilometers ( 43 miles ) to go .
" I have seen many collapsed civilian houses , and the rocks dropped from mountains on the roadside are everywhere , " the head of the unit , Li Zaiyuan , told Xinhua .
Added CNN Correspondent John Vause : " The roads here are terrible in the best of times ... right now they 're down right atrocious .
They 've resorted to going in one man at a time on foot . "
Nearly all the confirmed deaths were in Sichuan Province , but rescuers were hindered because roads linking it to the provincial capital , Chengdu , were damaged , Xinhua reported .
Local radio quoted disaster relief officials as saying a third of the buildings in Wenchuan collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged .
The earthquake was powerful enough to be felt throughout most of China .
Many children were buried under the rubble of their schools .
The Chinese government said the death toll was sure to rise .
An expert told CNN the 7.9 - magnitude quake at about 2:28 p.m. Monday ( 6:28 a.m. GMT ) was the largest the region has seen " for over a generation . "
Residents as far as Chongqing -- about 200 miles from the epicenter in Sichuan Province -- spent the night outdoors , too afraid of aftershocks to sleep indoors .
Local radio in Sichuan quoted disaster relief officials as saying a third of the buildings in Wenchuan collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged .
Watch as the death toll rises »
The state - run Zhongxin news agency reported that a survivor who escaped Beichuan county in Sichuan Province described the province as having been " razed to the ground . "
The Red Cross Society of China , coordinating some of the international aid efforts , encouraged financial donations because of the difficulty of getting supplies to those most in need .
At least six schools collapsed to some extent in the quake or aftershocks that followed , Xinhua reported .

At one school , almost 900 students -- all eighth - graders and ninth - graders , according to a local villager -- were believed to be buried .

At least 50 bodies were pulled from the rubble by Monday night at Juyuan Middle School in Juyuan Township of Dujiangyan City , Sichuan Province , Xinhua reported .
" Some buried teenagers were struggling to free themselves from the ruins while others were calling for help .
Eight excavators were working at the site .
Devastated parents watched as five cranes worked at the site and an ambulance waited , " Xinhua reported .
" A tearful mother said her son , ninth - grader Zhang Chengwei , was buried in the ruins . "
Meanwhile , 2,300 people were buried in two collapsed chemical plants in Sichuan 's Shifang city , and 80 tons of ammonia leaked out , Xinhua reported .
Six hundred people died there .
The plants were among a series of buildings that collapsed , including private homes , schools and factories .
The local government has evacuated 6,000 civilians from the area and was dispatching firefighters to help at the scene , Xinhua reported .
Much of the nation 's transportation system shut down .
Xinhua reported there were " multiple landslides and collapses along railway lines " near Chengdu .
Quake victims have been sleeping outside in Chengdu »
Sichuan Province sits in the Sichuan basin and is surrounded by the Himalayas to the west .
The Yangtze River flows through the province and the Three Gorges Dam in the nearby Hubei Province controls flooding to the Sichuan -- though there were no reports of damage to the world 's largest dam .
Monday 's quake was caused by the Tibetan plateau colliding with the Sichuan basin , Zhigang Peng , an earthquake expert at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta , Georgia , told CNN .
" Earthquakes in this part of China are infrequent but not uncommon , " he said .
The last major earthquake in the region occurred in the northwestern margin of the Sichuan basin when a 7.5 - magnitude quake killed more than 9,300 people on August 25 , 1933 .
President Hu Jintao ordered an all - out effort to help those affected , and Premier Wen Jiabao traveled to the region to direct the rescue work , Xinhua reported .
" My fellow Chinese , facing such a severe disaster , we need calm , confidence , courage and efficient organization , " Wen was quoted as saying .
" I believe we can certainly overcome the disaster with the public and the military working together under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the government . "
Peter Sammonds , professor of geophysics at University College London , called the earthquake " tremendous . "
" Particularly in the more remote , the more mountainous part where this has taken place , a lot of the buildings are built on sediments that are quite unstable .
They 're probably liquifying , causing the buildings to collapse .
You might expect landslides to occur , which could actually stop the relief efforts going through on the roads , so this could be very grim in the remoter , more mountainous parts of this province . "
While many of the most immediate efforts were focused on Sichuan Province , Xinhua also reported dead and injured in Gansu , Chongqing and Yunnan provinces .
A provincial government spokesman said they feared more dead and injured in collapsed houses in Dujiangyan City in Wenchuan County .
A driver for the seismological bureau said he saw " rows of houses collapsed " in Dujiangyan , Xinhua reported .
Bonnie
Thie , the country director of the Peace Corps , told CNN she was on a university campus in Chengdu about 60 miles from the epicenter , in the eastern part of China 's Sichuan province , when the first quake hit .
" You could see the ground shaking , " Thie told CNN .
The shaking " went on for what seemed like a very long time , " she said .
Bruce Presgrave , a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey , said this quake could cause major damage because of its strength and proximity to major population centers .
Also , it was relatively shallow , and those kinds of quakes tend to do more damage near the epicenter than deeper ones , Presgrave said .
An earthquake with 7.5 magnitude in the northern Chinese city of Tangshan killed 255,000 people in 1976 -- the greatest death toll from an earthquake in the last four centuries and the second greatest in recorded history , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
Tangshan is roughly 995 miles ( 1,600 km ) from Chengdu , the nearest major city to the epicenter of Monday 's quake .

After the quake struck Monday , the ground shook as far away as Beijing , which is 950 miles ( 1,528 km ) from the epicenter .
Residents of the Chinese capital , which hosts this year 's Olympic Games in August , felt a quiet , rolling sensation for about a minute .
See CNN 's interview with an American in Chengdu »
Thousands of people were evacuated from Beijing buildings immediately after the earthquake .
At least seven more earthquakes -- measuring between 4.0 and 6.0 magnitudes -- happened nearby over the four hours after the initial quake at at 2:28 p.m. local time , the USGS reported .
A spokesman for the Beijing Olympic Committee said no Olympic venues were affected .
The huge Three Gorges Dam -- roughly 400 miles east of the epicenter -- was not damaged , a spokesman said .
The earthquake was also felt in Hong Kong , Shanghai , Taiwan , and as far away as Hanoi , Vietnam , and Bangkok , Thailand , according to the Hong Kong - based Mandarin - language channel Phoenix TV .

The gunmen came at night to drag Mohammed Halim away from his home , in front of his crying children and his wife begging for mercy .
The 46 - year - old schoolteacher tried to reassure his family that he would return safely .
But his life was over , he was part - disembowelled and then torn apart with his arms and legs tied to motorbikes , the remains put on display as a warning to others against defying Taliban orders to stop educating girls .
Mr Halim was one of four teachers killed in rapid succession by the Islamists at Ghazni , a strategic point on the routes from Kabul to the south and east which has become the scene of fierce clashes between the Taliban and US and Afghan forces .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The day we arrived , an Afghan policemen and eight insurgents died during an ambush in an outlying village .
Rockets were found , primed to be fired into Ghazni City during a visit by the American ambassador a few days previously .
But , as in the rest of Afghanistan , it is the civilians who are bearing the brunt of this conflict .
At the village of Qara Bagh , the family of Mr Halim are distraught and terrified .
His cousin , Ahmed Gul , shook his head : " They killed him like an animal .
No , no .
We do not kill animals like that , it would be haram .
They took away a father and a husband , they had no pity .
We are all very worried .
Please go now , you see those men standing over there ?
They are watching .
It is dangerous for you , and for us . "
Fatima Mushtaq , the director of education at Ghazni , has had repeated death threats , the notorious " night letters " .
Her gender , as well as her refusal to send girls home from school , has made her a particular source of hatred for Islamist zealots .
" I think they killed him that way to frighten us , otherwise why make a man suffer so much ?
Mohammed Halim and his family were good friends of ours and we are very , very upset by what has happened .
He came to me when the threats first began and asked what he should do .
I told him to move somewhere safe .
I think he was trying to arrange that when they came and took him , " she said .
The threats against Ms Mushtaq also extend to her husband , Sayyid Abdul , and their eight children .
" When the first letters arrived , I tried to hide them from my husband , " she said .
" But then he found the next few .
He said we must stand together .
We talked , and we decided that we must tell the children .
So that they can be prepared , but it is not a good way for them to grow up . "
Ms Mushtaq is familiar with the ways of the Taliban .
During their rule she and her sister ran secret schools for girls at their home .
The Taliban beat them for teaching the girls algebra .
James Randi is a stage magician and scientific skeptic best known as a challenger of paranormal claims and pseudoscience .
In this list we see 10 of his best psychic debunking ( and have a bonus clip of a lecture of his ) .
These are all extremely damning to the practitioners of these magic arts and Randi makes no apologies for his tough approach ; in fact he is offering a reward of $ 1 million to anyone who can demonstrate evidence of any paranormal , supernatural or occult power or event , under test conditions agreed to by both parties .
As of this time , no one has claimed this prize .
10 Graphology
According to Randi , a large number of European businesses uses graphology ( the ability to determine a person ’s traits by their handwriting ) to help in their hiring process .
In this clip , Randi tests a professional graphologist to determine whether they actually do have the ability to recognize certain traits , or whether their results are determined entirely by chance .
9 Astrology
Astrology is the ability to forecast a person ’s life based upon the positions of the stars and other heavenly bodies .
In this clip we see a very prolific astrologer giving a reading for a selected person in the audience .
The best part of this clip is the series of witty comments at the end made by Stephen Fry .
Excuse the sound quality at the start – it does improve .
8 Psychometry
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvVftFZHXSI
Psychometry is the ability to determine information about a person through their personal possessions .
In the clip above , James Randi sets up a test for a woman claiming to have psychometry abilities .
Unfortunately for her , the test did not go well .
7 Crystal Power
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDTuoXygZKk
Crystal power is the idea that certain crystals effect a person in a particular way .
For this reason they are used for healing and psychic readings .
In the test above , a professional crystal healer was tested .
This is definitely one of the best clips .
Despite the result , the “ psychic ” took it all very well .
6 Aura Reading
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39PM03iVbqE
Aura reading is the ability to see the aura ( a field of color that radiates from an object ) around people .
In this clever test , James Randi has the reader see the auras of 5 people and then has them stand behind a thin wall .
The reader then determines where each person is standing behind the wall based on their auras .
5 Telekenesis
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlfMsZwr8rc
Telekenesis is when a person is able to move objects with the mind .
In the 1980s , James Hydrick developed a cult like following due to his abilities .
In this clip , we see James Randi debunk him on television .
Some years later Hydrick was exposed as a criminal and he confessed his psychic fraud .
He admitted that he learnt his trick whilst in jail .
I am not sure what he spent time in jail for , but it may well have been crimes against fashion .
4 Clairvoyance
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxvPJFv6X94
Clairvoyants claim to have the ability to communicate with the dead .
In this clip we see a reading performed by Maureen Flynn which is analyzed and tested by James Randi .
He exposes the various tricks used psychics of this variety .
3 Dowsing
Dowsing is the ability to locate water , oil , minerals , objects , locations , missing persons etc. using such objects as a metal rod , a pair of bent wires , a forked stick , a pendulum or the open hands .
2 Thought Transference
In this clip , a special device is used to determine whether a person is receiving thoughts sent by a second person .
The most interesting comment of the clip is when James asks the man responsible for the device whether he would consent to electricians looking inside he exclaims “ I most certainly would not ! ” Pseudo - science at its best .
1 Faith Healing
This clip demonstrates that psychic abilities and supposed gifts from God are often coupled with fraud and financial gain for the psychic .
Peter Popoff , the evangelist seen here , should have done prison time for the web of lies and deceit he wove .
At the height of his career ( just prior to being exposed by James Randi , he was earning over 4 million dollars a year ) .
After declaring bankruptcy , Popoff is back at work defrauding thousands of people .
For more information , see the wikipedia article .
+ Homeopathy
I realize that homeopathy is not related to psychic abilities ( though it is about as credible ) but this last video had to be included .
In this clip , James Randi explains how homeopathic medicine works ( or rather , how it does n’t ) .
An excellent lecture that any person considering using homeopathic medicine should hear .
Survey shows higher prices for organic products are turning off budget - conscious shoppers .

Good
Bad

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
While many companies are now rushing to " go green , " recent surveys show American consumers are getting turned off by the organic hype for three reasons : price , skepticism and confusion .
The percentage of consumers who believe organic products are good for them is down to 45 % , while those who believe they 're good for the environment has fallen to 48 % , according to the latest survey from consulting firm WSL Strategic Retail .
Both measures stood at a 54 % approval rating two years ago .
Higher cost of organic products versus mass market alternatives is a primary deterrent to many consumers , especially during a period when families are already struggling to stretch the household budget .
On average , organic products still sell for a hefty premium , as much as 50 % to 100 % more than non-organic alternatives , according to Ronnie Cummins , national director of Organics Consumer Association , a consumer advocacy group .
For example , the national retail price average for a gallon of whole milk is $ 3.78 , according to the Department of Agriculture , while a gallon of the Organic Valley milk that 's sold at Whole Foods ( WFMI , Fortune 500 ) costs $ 6.99 .
And the store price for a 32 - ounce bottle of the popular " natural " detergent brand Seventh Generation is about $ 12 at Whole Foods compared to $ 8.99 for a 50 - ounce Tide High Efficiency Detergent sold at Walgreen ( WAG , Fortune 500 ) .
( An earlier version of this story omitted the reference to Whole Foods .
CNNMoney.com regrets the error . )
" The No. 1 complaint over the past five years is that organic products are expensive , " Cummins said .
" People are getting much more serious about food prices this year , and that will extend to organics as well in a recession year . "
To that end , Cummins estimates that 20 % of organic shoppers are already switching away from grocery store purchases of organic items to buying locally from farmers markets .
" It 's a lot cheaper to buy directly from farmers and I expect that trend to continue , " he said .
Also , over the past two years , there 's been a plethora of companies touting organic or natural products .
" This has complicated the picture for shoppers , " said Wendy Leibmann , president of consulting firm WSL Strategic Retail .
Reflecting that , 42 % of those polled said they are skeptical and do n't trust that products labeled as " organic " actually are organic .
Organic , natural or green ?
" The interest in personal health and the environment is growing , but there 's also so much confusion about what ' organic ' means , " Leibmann said .
" This is causing people to pull back . "
Industry experts say any product that is labeled " organic " has to go through a Department of Agriculture certification process .
" Natural " products usually do n't have any certification , but contain fewer chemicals , toxins and preservatives .
" Green , " or " eco , " products are similar to natural products , but could also be biodegradable .
Michelle Barry , senior vice president with the Hartman Group , said she 's aware of a backlash that 's building .
The firm has tracked the organic product industry for more than 20 years
As of 2008 , the Hartman Group 's own study of organic product usage showed 69 % , or 154 million Americans , claimed to occasionally use organic products .
That 's down from 73 % who made the same claim in 2005 .
The firm said the moderate decline indicates that usage of organic products was leveling off .
" The challenge for the industry is that consumers have already gone through a period of experimenting with organic and natural products , " Barry said .
" Now the interest has plateaued and they are back to their routine behavior for a variety of products . "
Price does act as a barrier to adoption .
" We think about 24 % of the population is influenced by the price issue , " said Barry .
Some categories will face a steeper drop - off than others , such as organic milk versus organic cereals .
" Consumers are more concerned about ingesting hormones and steroids than eating non-organic oats , " she said , adding that she also expects steeper drop - offs in purchases of organic snacks and personal care items " where the value for money " proposition may not be as strong .
As a result , she said companies have to try even harder to find a compelling reason for consumers to switch to organics , particularly beyond the basic categories of milk , fruits and vegetables .
If companies want " eco " purchasing in the United States to flourish and catch up to trends in Europe and elsewhere , the WSL's Leibmann said it 's up to corporations to also invest educating consumers about both the personal and environmental benefits of " organic " or " green " products .
She said the best example is the energy - saving lightbulb .
" Yes , these are more expensive , but they last longer , they use less electricity and they are better for the environment , " Leibmann said .
" That type of efficient messaging now needs to be passed through all other product categories . "
The “ jump ” is the place in a newspaper story where the story moves from page A1 to , say , page A23 .
Numerous studies show that the overwhelming majority of readers do not bother to follow the story past the jump line .
Although you do n’t see it when you read newpapers on the internet , most people read newpapers in the print form – and savvy editors use the power of the jump to their advantage .
Humorously used by the blogosphere to indicate information that will be added in later .
POLICE are hunting this man in connection with a sex attack on a woman in a York street .
The terrified victim was sexually assaulted by a stranger in Bishophill Senior , near Skeldergate , in the early hours of Sunday , April 6 .
She has now helped police to put together this e-fit of the man they want to speak to in connection with the incident .
PC David Clark , who is investigating the attack , said the woman was assaulted in the street by the man between 4.10 am and 4.20 am .
Officers are now trying to trace the man who attacked her and want to hear from anyone who knows someone matching his description .
He is described as foreign , white , aged between 26 and 37 , between 5ft 5ins and 5ft 6in tall , and of thin build .
He is said to have a small head and pointed features , with distinctive curly or wavy hair which stood up on the top .
He was wearing large , black rimmed glasses at the time of the attack , and spoke with broken English accent .
A York Police spokesman said : " The man has a distinctive appearance so we are hoping someone will recognise him from the e-fit .
" The incident took place not far from Micklegate , in the early hours of Sunday morning , so there may still have been people around in the area , possibly making there way home after a night out .
" We would urge anyone who may have seen this man to contact us . "
Anyone who recognises this man or has any information about the incident is asked to contact PC Clark , at York Police , on 0845 60 60 247 and quote reference number 1080970152 .
What is toybox ?
Toybox combines many common Linux command line utilities together into a single BSD - licensed executable .
It 's simple , small , fast , and reasonably standards - compliant ( POSIX - 2008 and LSB 4.1 ) .
Toybox 's main goal is to make Android self - hosting by improving Android 's command line utilities so it can build an installable Android Open Source Project image entirely from source under a stock Android system .
After a talk at the 2013 Embedded Linux Conference explaining this plan ( outline , video ) , Google merged toybox into AOSP and began shipping toybox in Android Mashmallow .
Toybox aims to provide one quarter of a theoretical " minimal native development environment " , which is the simplest Linux system capable of rebuilding itself from source code and then building Linux From Scratch and the Android Open Source Project under the result .
In theory , this should only require four packages : 1 ) a set of posix - ish command line utilities , 2 ) a compiler [ 1 ] , 3 ) a C library , and 4 ) a kernel .
This provides a reproducible and auditable base system , which with the addition of a few convienciences ( vi , top , shell command line history ... ) can provide a usable interactive experience rather than just a headless build server .
Why is toybox ?
The 2013 toybox talk at ELC was devoted to this question , and has the following sections :
A more recent talk from 2019 compares BusyBox vs toybox and explains the design decisions behind both .
( A 2015 toybox talk was part of the channel accidentally deleted off youtube by the Linux Foundation , but the outline is still available . )
What context was toybox created in ?
The toybox maintainer 's previous minimal self - hosting system project , Aboriginal Linux , got a native development environment down to only seven packages in its 1.0 release ( busybox , uClibc , gcc , binutils , make , bash , and linux ) and then built Linux From Scratch under the result .
That project was the reason toybox 's maintainer became busybox maintainer , having done so much work to extend busybox to replace all the gnu tools in a Linux From Scratch build that the previous maintainer handed over the project ( to spend more time on buildroot ) .
Despite the maintainer 's history with busybox , toybox is a fresh from - scratch implementation under an android - compatible license .
Busybox predates Android , but has never shipped with Android due to the license .
As long as we 're starting over anyway , we can do a better job .
Toybox 's current minimal native development environment builder is a new tiny implementation integrated into the toybox source .
The " make root " target will create a simple toybox chroot ( by default in the root / host directory ) , and adding a LINUX= argument to the make command line pointing to Linux kernel source code creates a tiny bootable system with a wrapper script to run it under the emulator qemu .
The list of commands remaining before we can build Linux From Scratch under the result ( with an appropriate compiler ) is tracked in the roadmap , and doing so is one of the main goals for toybox 's 1.0 release .
Building LFS requres fewer commands than building AOSP , which has a lot more build prerequisites .
In theory some of those can be built from source as external packages ( we 're clearly not including our own java implementation ) , but some early prerequisites may need to be added to bootstrap AOSP far enough to build them ( such as a read - only version of " git " : how does repo download the AOSP source otherwise ? ) [ 2 ]
What commands are planned / implemented in toybox ?
The current list of commands implemented by toybox is on the status page , which is updated each release .
There is also a roadmap listing all planned commands for the 1.0 release and the reasons for including them .
In general , configuring toybox with " make defconfig " enables all the commands compete enough to be useful .
Configuring " allyesconfig " enables partially implemented commands as well , along with debugging features .
Relevant Standards
Most commands are implemented according to POSIX - 2008 ( I.E. The Single Unix Specification version 4 ) where applicable .
This does not mean that toybox is implementing every SUS v4 utility : some such as SCCS and ed are obsolete , while others such as c99 are outside the scope of the project .
Toybox also is n't implementing full internationalization support : it should be 8 - bit clean and handle UTF - 8 , but otherwise we leave this to X11 and higher layers .
And some things ( like $ CDPATH support in " cd " ) await a good explanation of why to bother with them .
( POSIX provides an important frame of reference , but is not an infallable set of commandments to be blindly obeyed .
We do try to document our deviations from it in the comment section at the start of each command under toys / posix . )
The other major sources of commands are the Linux man pages , the Linux Standard Base , and testing the behavior of existing command implementations ( although not generally looking at their source code ) , including the commands in Android 's toolbox .
SUS v4 does not include many basic commands such as " mount " , " init " , and " mke2fs " , which are kind of nice to have .
For more on this see the roadmap and design goals .
Download
This project is maintained as a git archive , and also offers source tarballs and static binaries of the release versions .
The maintainer 's development log and the project 's mailing list are also good ways to track what 's going on with the project .
What 's the toybox logo image ?
It 's carefully stacked soda cans .
Specifically , it 's a bunch of the original " Coke Zero " and " Pepsi One " cans , circa 2006 , stacked to spell out the binary values of the ascii string " Toybox " , with null terminator at the bottom .
( The big picture 's on it 's side because the camera was held sideways to get a better shot . )
No , it 's not photoshopped , I actually had these cans until a coworker who Totally Did Not Get
It tm threw them out one day after I 'd gone home , thinking they were recycling .
( I still have two of each kind , but Pepsi One seems discontinued and Coke Zero switched its can color from black to grey , presumably in celebration .
It was fun while it lasted ... )
Footnotes
[ 1 ]
Ok , most toolchains ( gcc , llvm , pcc , libfirm ... ) are multiple packages , but the maintainer of toybox used to maintain a fork of tinycc ( an integrated compiler / assembler / linker which once upon a time did build a bootable linux kernel before its original developer abandoned the project ) , and has vague plans of trying again someday .
The compiler toolchain is _conceptually_ one package , implementable as a single multicall binary acting like make , cc , as , ld , cpp , strip , readelf , nm , objdump , and so on as necessary .
It 's just the existing packages that do this kinda suck do n't .
( In theory " make " belongs in qcc , in practice llvm has n't got its own make so toybox probably needs to add it after 1.0 to eliminate another gpl build prerequite from AOSP . )
[ 2 ]
The dividing line is " Is there an acceptably licensed version Android can ship , or do we have to write one ? "
Since android is not " GNU / Linux " in any way , we need to clean out all traces of gnu software from its build to get a clean self - hosting system .
The tangle of wires was ridiculous .
The same thing could have been done without half of that mess .
But seriously , who does n't use a DVD drive ?
Hello , movies ?
Yes , I have movies backed up that I transfer over to my laptop .
But that solution has serious limitations .
It means that I had to take the time prior to my trip to conduct the transfer , and that I have storage space available for movies .
DVD's , for all the talk of an end of physical media , are still remarkably versatile .
They take moments to load , are available at your local blockbuster , and do n't add too much to your backpack size .
Also , I still load most of my purchased software via DVD .
Yes , freeware and patches are loaded via the net , but CS3 , Office , OS 's , these all require a DVD drive ( in my non-cutting edge world ) .
The lack of a DVD drive is a serious limitation for me , sorry Air .

The following exchange between atheist activist Rob Sherman of Buffalo Grove and Ill.
Rep. Monique Davis ( D - Chicago ) took place Wednesday afternoon in the General Assembly as Sherman testified before the House State Government Administration Committee .
I know from experience that many of you will side with Davis ( update -- apparently I was wrong ! ) , but I ask you to consider what the outcry would have been if a lawmaker had launched a similar attack on the beliefs of a religious person .
Davis : I do n’t know what you have against God , but some of us do n’t have much against him .
We look forward to him and his blessings .
And it ’s really a tragedy -- it ’s tragic -- when a person who is engaged in anything related to God , they want to fight .
They want to fight prayer in school .
I do n’t see you ( Sherman ) fighting guns in school .
You know ?
I ’m trying to understand the philosophy that you want to spread in the state of Illinois .
This is the Land of Lincoln .
This is the Land of Lincoln where people believe in God , where people believe in protecting their children . …
What you have to spew and spread is extremely dangerous , it ’s dangerous -- Sherman :
What ’s dangerous , ma’am ?
Davis :
It ’s dangerous to the progression of this state .
And it ’s dangerous for our children to even know that your philosophy exists !
Now you will go to court to fight kids to have the opportunity to be quiet for a minute .
But damn if you ’ll go to [ court ] to fight for them to keep guns out of their hands .
I am fed up !
Get out of that seat !
Sherman :
Thank you for sharing your perspective with me , and I ’m sure that if this matter does go to court --- Davis :
You have no right to be here !
We believe in something .
You believe in destroying !
You believe in destroying what this state was built upon .
Sherman did n't budge , continued his testimony related to Gov. Rod Blagojevich 's oddly misdirected $ 1 million grant intended for Pilgrim Baptist Church , ( story ) and later told me he " felt like Rosa Parks . "

UPDATE -- Daily
Kos readers have hundred of comments on this story .
Boing Boing is covering as well .
So is the Huffington Post .
The Council for Secular Humanism in Amherst , NY is calling upon Davis to resign .
Capturing the beauty of the world beneath the oceans is a challenge , but the rewards are worth it .
The excitement comes not only from the idea of capturing an underwater scene on film or on a digital camera ’s sensor , but also from being in a completely different environment .
Since it is a specialized area that relatively few photographers attempt , the opportunities for new and different images are many .
It is no surprise that underwater photography is a favorite pastime for scuba divers .
The idea could have come from those few people that were able to experience the joys and beauty of underwater life and a desire to share that beauty with others .
The fundamentals of photography remain the same wherever you are taking pictures , but when the medium that light travels through is water – not air – special techniques and equipment are needed in order to capture good images .
Here are some beautiful underwater pictures ; which might give you some inspiration , when you are going for your next adventure .

The Pros And Cons Of Manual Mode And Auto Mode In Cameras !
Building robots with anything akin to human intelligence remains a far off vision , but European researchers are making progress on piecing together a new generation of machines that are more aware of their environment and better able to interact with humans .
Making robots more responsive would allow them to be used in a greater variety of sophisticated tasks in the manufacturing and service sectors .
Such robots could be used as home helpers and caregivers , for example .
As research into artificial cognitive systems ( ACS ) has progressed in recent years it has grown into a highly fragmented field .
Some researchers and teams have concentrated on machine vision , others on spatial cognition , and on human - robot interaction , among many other disciplines .
All have made progress , but , as the EU - funded project CoSy ( Cognitive Systems for Cognitive Assistants ) has shown , by working together the researchers can make even more advances in the field .
“ We have brought together one of the broadest and most varied teams of researchers in this field , ” says Geert - Jan Kruijff , the CoSy project manager at the German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence .
“ This has resulted in an ACS architecture that integrates multiple cognitive functions to create robots that are more self - aware , understand their environment and can better interact with humans . ”
The CoSy ACS is indeed greater than the sum of its parts .
It incorporates a range of technologies from a design for cognitive architecture , spatial cognition , human - robot interaction and situated dialogue processing , to developmental models of visual processing .

“ We have learnt how to put the pieces of ACS together , rather than just studying them separately , ” adds Jeremy Wyatt , one of the project managers at the UK ’s University of Birmingham .
The researchers have made the ACS architecture toolkit they developed available under an open source license .
They want to encourage further research .
The toolkit has already sparked several spin - off initiatives .
Overcoming the integration challenge
“ The integration of different components in an ACS is one of the greatest challenges in robotics , ” Kruijff says .
“ Getting robots to understand their environment from visual inputs and to interact with humans from spoken commands and relate what is said to their environment is enormously complex . ”
Because of the complexity most robots developed to date have tended to be reactive .
They simply react to their environment rather than act in it autonomously .
Similar to a beetle that scuttles away when prodded , many mobile robots back off when they collide with an object , but have little self - awareness or understanding of the space around them and what they can do there .

In comparison , a demonstrator called the Explorer developed by the CoSy team has a more human - like understanding of its environment .
Explorer can even talk about its surroundings with a human .
Instead of using just geometric data to create a map of its surroundings , the Explorer also incorporates qualitative , topographical information .
Through interaction with humans it can then learn to recognise objects , spaces and their uses .
For example , if it sees a coffee machine it may reason that it is in a kitchen .
If it sees a sofa it may conclude it is in a living room .
“ The robot sees a room much as humans see it because it has a conceptual understanding of space , ” Kruijff notes .
Another demonstrator , called the PlayMate , applied machine vision and spatial recognition in a different context .
PlayMate uses a robotic arm to manipulate objects in response to human instructions .
In Wyatt ’s view the development of machine vision and its integration with other ACS components is still a big obstacle to creating more advanced robots , especially if the goal is to replicate human sight and awareness .
“ Do n’t underestimate how sophisticated we are … , ” he says .
“ We do n’t realise how agile our brains are at interpreting what we see .
You can pick out colours from a scene , look at a bottle of water , a packet of cornflakes , or a coffee mug and know what activities each of them allows .
You recognise them , see where to grasp them , and how to manipulate them , and you do it all seamlessly .
We are still so very , very far from doing that with robots . ”
Robotic ‘ gofers ’
Fortunately , replicating human - like intelligence and awareness , if it is indeed possible , is not necessary when creating robots that are useful to humans .
Kruijff foresees robots akin to those developed in the CoSy project becoming an everyday sight over the coming years in what he describes as ‘ gofer scenarios ’ .
Already some robots with a lower level of intelligence are being used to bring medicines to patients in hospitals and could be used to transport documents around office buildings .
Robotic vacuum cleaners are becoming increasingly popular in homes , as too are toys that incorporate artificial intelligence .
And the creation of robots that are able to interact with people opens the door to robotic home helpers and caregivers .
“ In the future people may all be waited on by robots in their old age , ” Wyatt says .
TALLAHASSEE , Fla . --
Recent additions to the premier collection of Southern Ocean sediment cores at Florida State University 's Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility will give international scientists a close - up look at fluctuations that occurred in Antarctica 's ice sheet and marine and terrestrial life as the climate cooled considerably between 20 and 14 million years ago .
FSU 's latest Antarctic sediment core acquisition was extracted from deep beneath the sea floor of Antarctica 's western Ross Sea , the Earth 's largest floating ice body .
The new samples -- segments of a drill core that measures more than 1,100 meters in length -- offer an extraordinary stratigraphic record of sedimentary rock from the Antarctic continental margin that documents key developments in the area 's Cenozoic climatic and glacial history .
By correlating that stratigraphic record with existing data and climate and ice sheet models , scientists from FSU and around the world expect to learn how local changes in the Southern Ocean region relate to regional and global climate events .
" Such knowledge will significantly increase our understanding of Antarctica 's potential responses to future global - scale climate changes , " said Sherwood W. Wise , Jr. , an FSU geological science professor and co-principal investigator at the Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility .
" This is critical for low - lying regions such as Florida that could be directly affected by the future behavior of the Antarctic Ice Sheets and any resulting sea - level changes .
By studying these glacial records of the past , geologists and climatologists seek to better predict the future . "
The new cores came to FSU compliments of ANDRILL ( ANtarctic geological DRILLing ) , an international collaboration among more than 120 scientists -- plus drillers , engineers , educators and technicians -- from Germany , Italy , New Zealand and the United States .
FSU 's Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility and its staff and associated geological science faculty play a key ANDRILL role , providing both on - the -ice curatorial services during the drilling season and a permanent repository for the core samples recovered during the project .
In fact , from April 29 through May 3 , some 100 ANDRILL scientists and educators , including seven from the FSU " on-ice " curatorial team , will converge at the Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility core repository .
They will re-examine the latest core acquisitions to refine their descriptions of the material and take additional samples for tests to extract even more information about their history and the conditions under which the sediments were deposited .
Those hard - won , deep - sea sediment cores may be millions of years old , but the scientists will find them in mint condition at FSU .
The Antarctic research facility carefully curates the samples in its large , 6,000 - square - foot refrigerated " Cold Room , " which is maintained at 34 F. ( i.e. , sea - bottom temperatures ) .
" The sediment cores recovered during this year 's successful ANDRILL expedition have filled in a major gap in the most direct record of the ice activity yet recovered from the period of about 20 to 14 million years ago , " said Wise , who serves ANDRILL as a participating ( off- ice ) scientist and member of its U.S. advisory committee .
" The 1,139 meters of core retrieved , 98 percent intact , records the critical transition from times warmer than today to the onset of major cooling between about 14 to 13 million years ago when a semi- permanent ice sheet formed across most of Antarctica . "
That record was created , said Wise , because sediments deposited close to or beneath grounded glaciers alternate with marine sediments , providing clear evidence of cyclical ice advances followed by substantial retreats and reflecting variations in sea - level , glacial and climate fluctuations .
The new stratigraphic section housed at FSU will allow scientists to devise more accurate models of the timing of past ice - sheet movements , volume changes and variability , and paleotemperature fluctuations , and will enable a better understanding of the development of Antarctica 's terrestrial and marine life .
The Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility was established at FSU in 1963 through the National Science Foundation 's Office of Polar Programs and now serves as the national repository for geological material from the Southern ocean .
It functions as one of the university 's two user facilities ( the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is the other ) for visiting researchers from around the globe .
ANDRILL 's meeting April 29 - May 3 will take place throughout FSU 's Carraway Building -- home to the Department of Geological Sciences and the annex that houses the Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility .
During the workshop one of the two chief scientists of the second ANDRILL expedition , David M. Harwood , an FSU master 's graduate ( 1982 ) and a geology professor at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln , will be honored with a special alumni award .
Visiting ANDRILL researchers who attended last May 's inaugural post - drilling workshop at FSU will notice that since then the Antarctic research facility 's core repository has undergone a major renovation to make room for recent acquisitions and future ones .
Funding for those improvements to one of the coolest places on campus came from the National Science Foundation .

The A123 conversion makes barely any changes to the car .
Electrically speaking , it sits between the original battery of the Prius and the car ’s computer , serving as a buffer for the factory - installed battery .
Mostly what it does is tell the Prius that there is still lots of charge remaining , and thus no need to start the car ’s engine to recharge the battery .
Driving around Washington last week , the Prius engine started up as normal whenever the combination of the accelerator pedal position and the grade of the road demanded more torque than the electric motor could deliver .
Stomp on the gas , so to speak , and the Prius drew energy from both the internal combustion engine and the combined battery pack .
Maximizing the value of the extra watt - hours requires the same expert touch that driving a stock Prius does .
So I recruited a self - described Prius geek , Charlie Richman , who lives in Bethesda , Md. , and drives to his job in the District of Columbia municipal planning department in a Prius that is still equipped as Toyota built it .
“ Very cool , ” said Mr. Richman , test - driving the battery - equipped 2007 Prius .
Mr. Richman said that the car “ handles just like a Prius . ”
But there is a difference .
In his own car , when he accelerates gently and drives for extended periods at just below the level that causes the gasoline engine to kick in ( though eventually it will to re-charge the battery ) .
With the A123 pack installed , the gas engine never had to do that , at least not in the 10 miles or so that he cruised along North Capitol Street and then New Hampshire Avenue N.W. , four or six - lane city streets with a few straightaways and frequent traffic lights .
The Prius comes with an instantaneous fuel economy gauge that runs up to 99.9 miles per gallon , but A123 installs another with an extra digit .
After I drove the Prius for a distance the gauge said my mileage was in the 80’s , but Mr. Richman quickly moved the average back up over 100 .
( The test car was covered with decals proclaiming 120 miles per gallon . )
A123 uses a battery technology it calls lithium ion nanophosphate , developed at M.I.T .
It stores 5,000 watt - hours in a 140 - pound module .
In comparison , Toyota ’s nickel metal - hydride battery weighs about 100 pounds and holds 1,300 watt - hours .
All Things Pythonic
Python 3000 and You

Summary
I 've posted the slides from my PyCon 2008 keynote on python.org .
Here are the URLs , plus a warning against the temptation of changing your APIs at the same time as porting to Py3k .
This is really important !
Advertisement
The slides of my keynote are now up on python.org .
There 's both a PowerPoint and a PDF file .
I 'd like to take this opportunity to remind you of a really important issue that I neglected to mention in the talk :
Do n't change your APIs incompatibly when porting to Py3k .
Yes , you heard that right : even though Python 3.0 is changing incompatibly , I implore you ( especially if you 're maintaining a library that 's used by others ) not to make incompatible changes to your API .
If you have make API changes , do them before you port to 3.0 -- release a version with the new API for Python 2.5 , or 2.6 if you must .
( Or do it later , after you 've released a port to 3.0 without adding new features . )
Why ?
Think of your users .
Suppose Ima Lumberjack has implemented a web 2.0 app for managing his sawmill .
Ima is a happy user of your most excellent web 2.0 framework .
Now Ima wants to upgrade his app to Py3k .
He waits until you have ported your framework to Py3k .
He does everything by the books , runs his source code through the 2to3 tool , and starts testing .
Imagine his despair when the tests fail : how is he going to tell whether the breakage is due to your API changes or due to his own code not being Py3k - ready ?
On the other hand , if port your web 2.0 framework to Py3 k without making API changes , Ima 's task is much more focused : the bugs he is left with after running 2to3 are definitely in his own code , which ( presumably :-) he knows how to debug and fix .
The same recommendation applies even more strongly if your library is a dependency for other libraries -- due to the fan - out the pain caused to others multiplies .
If one of those packages gives up ( even temporarily ) its Py3 k porting effort , this may prevent many other libraries and apps from being ported at all !
So , once more for emphasis :
Do n't change your APIs at the same time as porting to Py3k !
Update : Martijn Faassen borrowed the time machine and wrote the same blog entry two weeks ago .
PS .
The 3.0 final release is now scheduled for September 3 , 2008 .
See PEP 361 .

US - backed crackdown in Basra paves way for opening up Iraq ’s oil and gas
By James Cogan
25 April 2008
The Iraqi government is following up its US - backed campaign of terror against the Shiite Sadrist movement and its Mahdi Army militia in Basra with moves to open up the country ’s oil and gas resources for exploitation by transnational conglomerates .
On April 16 , Oil Minister Hussain al - Shahristani announced that four undeveloped oil fields in southern Iraq will be tendered to international companies in coming months — three in Basra province .
The massive Akkaz natural gas field in the western province of Anbar and an untapped oil field near the northern city of Kirkuk are to be offered up as well .
Earlier this month , the Oil Ministry published the names of the first 35 companies — out of 120 that applied for licenses to operate in the Iraqi oil industry — that will be permitted to make bids .
The Akkaz gas field , which is believed to hold seven trillion cubic feet of natural gas , will be developed from start - up production of 50 million cubic feet per day to as much as 500 million cubic feet per day .
The long - term plan is to extend an existing pipeline to Syria into Turkey , and sell gas on the lucrative European Union markets .
The supply of Iraqi gas to the EU was one of the main agenda items during a two - day visit to Brussels by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki in mid-April .
The aim of the southern oil projects is to increase Iraqi production by at least 500,000 barrels to close to three million barrels per day .
Longer term , the opening up of dozens of other untapped fields is anticipated to enable production to be pushed to between six million and 10 million barrels per day .
Iraq has estimated oil reserves of 115 billion barrels , though one analyst , Fadhil Chalabi of the London - based Centre for Global Energy Studies , puts the figure at more than 300 billion barrels — the largest reserves in the world .
The list of companies highlights the predatory motives behind the 2003 invasion and the subsequent international support for the occupation .
It includes US giants ExxonMobil , Chevron , Conoco Phillips , Occidental Petroleum , Hess , Marathon and Anadarko , Britain ’s BP , BG and Premier , and Australian firms BHP - Billiton and Woodside .
These are the three countries that deployed troops .
Royal Dutch Shell , France ’s Total , Germany ’s BASF , and a number of Japanese , Russian and Chinese firms have also gained the right to tender .
The operations against the Mahdi Army in Basra have been used to tackle a number of obstacles to large - scale corporate involvement in the oil industry .
The Sadrists , who oppose foreign exploitation of Iraq ’s oil industry from the standpoint of Iraqi nationalism , have effectively been driven underground in the city and hundreds of their loyalists killed .
In addition , the US , British and Iraqi government forces have targeted the Basra - based Fadhila party , which holds the provincial governorship and dominates trade unions in the oilfields and ports .
Over the past several years , government representatives in Baghdad have repeatedly accused Fadhila of using its control of the Basra administration and the state - owned southern oil company to operate a highly organised and profitable oil smuggling racket .
According to an unconfirmed April 10 report in the British - based Times , Fadhila governor Mohammed Al - Waili has been placed under house arrest by Iraqi troops .
There are no media reports , but it is highly likely that a purge of Fadhila appointees is taking place , especially within the oil industry .
In the wake of the Basra offensive , security in the oilfields and pipelines has been taken out of the hands of a Fadhila - controlled force and delegated to Iraqi army and police units loyal to the two Shiite parties that dominate the central government — the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq ( ISCI ) and Maliki ’s own Da’wa .
The weakened position of Fadhila is reflected in signals this week that the party wanted talks on rejoining the Maliki government and the dominant Shiite parliamentary faction — the United Iraqi Alliance ( UIA ) .
With the incorporation of Fadhila and the physical suppression of the Sadrists , the UIA expects to take control of the Basra government in the upcoming October provincial elections .
The deployment of government forces into the oilfields also seeks to intimidate members of the Basra Oil Union , who have taken strike action several times in opposition to the US occupation .
The union opposes privatisation of the oil industry .
Government troops have occupied the port of Umm Qasr , from which much of the country ’s oil is shipped .
The New York Times foreshadowed the move onto the docks in a March 13 article that denounced “ a militia - controlled union that will load and unload ships only eight hours a day — rather than the 24 hours a day typical of modern ports ” .
Transnational companies will initially enter the Iraqi oil and gas industry on the basis of two - year “ technical support agreements ” , for which they will be paid a flat fee and have no rights over reserves or any share in profits .
Sharp differences among the various sectarian and ethnic - based factions in the Iraqi parliament have prevented the passage of a proposed oil law that would legalise foreign control of oil resources .
Concerted efforts are underway to remove that obstacle , however .
US Vice President Dick Cheney held meetings with representatives of the main Shiite , Sunni and Kurdish blocs during his visit to the country last month .
He reportedly demanded a crackdown on the Sadrists and pressed for an agreement on the terms of the oil law .
On April 16 , the Maliki government and the Kurdish Regional Government ( KRG ) , which controls the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq , announced that a deal had been reached .
Legislation based on a February 2007 draft , already approved by Maliki ’s cabinet , will reportedly be presented to parliament soon .
The KRG will have the right to enter into contracts with foreign firms for oil and gas projects within its territory — a key Kurdish demand .
A central feature of the 2007 draft was that it legitimised “ production sharing agreements ” ( PSAs ) — a one - sided form of contract that allows companies developing oil fields to use initial revenues to recoup all their costs and gives them a proportion of subsequent profits .
The KRG has signed as many as 20 PSAs for oil and gas operations in northern Iraq .
The quid pro quo from the Kurdish elite is to shelve their ambitions to incorporate the city of Kirkuk and its surrounding oil fields into their autonomous territory .
A UN mission is currently preparing a report on whether it is feasible to hold a referendum in Kirkuk on joining the KRG .
The UN team is expected to recommend that four largely Kurdish areas be included in the autonomous Kurdish region , but not Kirkuk .
Under the Iraqi constitution , a referendum on the future status of Kirkuk was meant to have taken place by December 2007 .
It was postponed in the face of vehement opposition by ethnic Arabs and Turkomen in the city and threats of Turkish intervention .
The Turkish government opposes any expansion of the Kurdish region on the grounds that it could encourage separatist agitation among Turkey ’s own large Kurdish minority .
In February , Turkish troops carried out an eight - day incursion into the KRG to hunt down members of the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) .
The operation was a clear message to the Iraqi Kurds to back off on the issue of Kirkuk .
The largest Sunni parliamentary bloc , the Iraqi Accordance Front ( IAF ) , has indicated that it too wants to rejoin the government , suggesting that it is prepared to accept the oil law .
The plan to develop gas fields in Anbar province , which has an overwhelming Sunni population and is currently governed by parties belonging to the IAF , provides a definite incentive to do so .
The repression of opposition in Basra to meet US demands and accommodate big oil underscores the venal character of the Iraqi government and its various factions .
The Iraqi elite are concerned with securing their own privileged position within the framework of US occupation , regardless of the consequences for the mass of the population .
For decades , scientists have dreamed of computer chips that manipulate light rather than electricity .
Unlike electrons , photons can cross paths without interfering with each other , so optical chips could compute in three dimensions rather than two , crunching data in seconds that now takes weeks to process .
For now , though , optical computing remains a dream .
The chips require crystals that channel photons as nimbly as silicon channels electrons – and though engineers have been able to imagine the ideal photonic crystal , they 've been unable to build it .
Enter a beetle known as Lamprocyphus augustus .
In a study published this week in Physical Review E , researchers at the University of Utah describe how the inch- long Brazilian beetle 's iridescent green scales are composed of chitin arranged by evolution in precisely the molecular configuration that has confounded the would - be fabricators of optical computers .
By using the scales as a semiconductor mold , researchers hope to finally build the perfect photonic crystal .
" We have n't been able to manufacture materials at the nanometer resolution .
We knew the ideal structure , but we could n't make it , " said study co-author Michael Bartl , a University of Utah chemist .
Bartl 's team stumbled across L. augustus by sheer luck .
Study co-author Lauren Richey , now a Brigham Young University undergraduate , studied beetle iridescence for a high school science fair project .
She asked BYU biologist John Gardner , also a co-author of the study , to examine L. augustus with his lab 's electron microscope .
When the researchers scoped the scales , they noticed something strange :
No matter the angle of viewing , the scales always appeared in the same shade of green .
That 's unusual for iridescent surfaces , which derive their color from light refracted through semi-transparent layers .
Further study revealed that the quality came from the scales ' molecular arrangement , which had the same pattern as the atoms of carbon in a diamond .
Diamonds themselves are too dense to serve as photonic crystals , but researchers long ago identified their configuration as perfectly suited for manipulating light in a three - dimensional space .
" You can take the light , criss - cross it and it does n't interfere .
It allows you to build more complex and compact architectures , " said Paul Braun , a University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign photonic crystal specialist .
The crystals ' transmission purity would also eliminate waste heat generated by traditional electron - based circuits .
That heat is a limiting factor on traditional microchip capacities .
Laboratory attempts at mimicking diamonds have been largely unsuccessful .
Braun said that researchers at Sandia National Laboratories came close , but each crystal took a painstaking month to build .
" They 're almost impossible to fabricate , " said Zhong Lin Wang , a Georgia Institute of Technology material scientist .
Wang developed photonic crystals based on the scales of butterfly wings , but they did n't possess the elusive diamond form .
" If this beetle has an arrangement like diamonds , that 's truly unique . "
Bartl said that optical computer chips wo n't actually run on beetle scales .
Instead he plans to use the scales as a mold , replacing chitin with semiconductor material .
" This could motivate another round of serious science , " said Braun .
" If there 's an easy way to create the diamond structure , that 's going to expedite progress in the field . "
" Optical computers could do in a second what now takes days or weeks , " said Bartl .
" And we 're providing the materials . "
A new study by UC Davis researchers provides evidence that methods using human bone marrow - derived stem cells to deliver gene therapy to cure diseases of the blood , bone marrow and certain types of cancer do not cause the development of tumors or leukemia .
" The results of our decade - long study of adult human stem cell transplantation shows that there is little risk of adverse events caused by gene transfer , and that adult human stem cells do not pose a cancer risk when implanted into different organs , " said Jan Nolta , senior author of the study and director of the UC Davis Stem Cell Program .
Nolta and her colleagues tested the safety of gene transfer into bone marrow stem cells from human donors in more than 600 mice .
None of the transplanted mice developed leukemia or solid tumors caused by the gene therapy treatment , during the evaluation period of up to 18 months .
" These data are critical for advancing stem cell research leading toward therapies , " Nolta said .
" We 've shown that adult stem cells follow natural cues to reach target locations , they function normally when they get there and do not exhibit the unchecked cell growth that is the hallmark of cancer . "
Gene therapy trials using human bone marrow cells began in the early 1990s and have since included roughly 1,000 patients worldwide .
In 2000 , a leukemia - like condition emerged in three participants in a clinical trial in France , halting the trial and calling into question the safety of the method .
Researchers suspected that the gene transferred in this trial gave the transplanted cells an enhanced growth capacity that led to the cancers .
" After those studies in France , the gene therapy community felt that further biosafety testing was warranted , " explained Gerhard Bauer , lead author of the study and an assistant professor of hematology and oncology .
" Due to the significantly large number of study animals , our investigation further illuminates the safety of gene therapy using hematopoietic stem cells .
It allows us to rest easier with the knowledge that if we insert corrective genes into human bone marrow stem cells and administer those cells to human patients , we are providing a relatively safe therapy . "
Today , gene therapy using the adult blood - forming cells found in bone marrow ( known as hematopoietic stem cells ) is normally done in an autologous transplant setting .
The therapy involves taking hematopoietic stem cells from a person who needs treatment , genetically modifying the cells — perhaps by adding a missing gene — and then re-inserting the cells back into the same person .
This treatment eliminates the complications of graft - versus - host disease or host rejection that can occur in allogeneic transplants ( therapy where the cell donor is different from the recipient ) .

In the current study , 630 immunodeficient mice received mesenchymal stem cells from one human bone marrow donor and hematopoietic stem cells from another .
Mesenchymal stem cells are a type of cell found in bone marrow that support the function of hematopoietic stem cells , and can give rise to bone , cartilage , fat , and muscle .
Genes were inserted into the hematopoietic stem cells using one of two viral vectors — either a retrovirus or a lentivirus — before they were transplanted into the mice , along with genetically modified mesenchymal stem cells .
Of the mice used in the long - term study , four developed human leukemia .
None of those mice , however , were found to have vector DNA present in the malignant cells .
" This is evidence of a natural tendency for human bone marrow stem cells to develop leukemia in long - term studies , not that the leukemia was caused by the genetic modification , " Bauer explained .
" It 's a good statistical control for our method . "
Bauer noted that while the current study results are important for use with adult stem cells , they are not applicable to human embryonic stem cells , which have completely different properties .
" Our experiments did not involve human embryonic stem cells , so we have a lot of stringent work to do to ensure that those types of stem cells can be used safely for human clinical trials , " said Bauer .
" It certainly is possible , and we are working hard to establish safe and effective human embryonic stem cell - based cures for patients as well . "
Nolta and Bauer have worked on eighteen cell and gene therapy clinical therapy trials during their 12 years as colleagues , including stem cell gene therapy trials for adenosine deaminase deficiency , also known as the " Bubble Boy Disease , " and stem cell gene therapy for HIV , with colleagues from Children 's Hospital Los Angeles , who are also co-authors on the current report .

Bauer is the director of UC Davis ' Good Manufacturing Practice ( GMP ) laboratory in Sacramento .
Upon its completion , UC Davis will be one of the few universities with a large GMP facility where scientists will work in an ultra-clean environment to derive cellular products that , after certification and extensive testing , will be used to treat patients .
The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine ( CIRM ) has recommended funding for this new facility to help bring a wide range of stem cell therapy cures to patients throughout California .
According to Nolta , the results of the current study will allow UC Davis to move forward with increased certainty as it prepares for clinical trials .

EPA is missing in action on major environmental issues , observers charge
By Margaret Kriz
National Journal
The Environmental Protection Agency is failing to live up to its name these days , its legions of critics agree .
At a time when the nation ’s top environmental regulators face increasingly complex pollution problems , President Bush is pushing for dramatic cuts in EPA ’s budget , his administration ’s strained , pro-industry interpretations of environmental laws have repeatedly been laughed out of court , and the White House is widely perceived to be running roughshod over agency scientists and lawyers .
Environmental experts charge that the agency ’s vanishing act is undercutting environmental statutes and delaying much - needed new efforts to clean up the nation ’s air , water , and land as well as aggressively tackle global warming .
“ There has been a steady drumbeat of actions that this administration has taken to weaken clean - air protections in this country , ” says S. William Becker , executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies , which represents state and local pollution control officials .
“ Their actions have had very serious and substantial adverse impacts on our ability to provide health protection in this country . ”
Since the Democratic takeover of Capitol Hill in January 2007 , EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson has been continually hauled before Congress to answer for the Bush administration ’s environmental policies .
“ I view this administration as environmental outlaws , ” Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer told National Journal .
“ Every time the EPA deviates from what their scientists recommend , we know one thing for sure : People will get sick , and some will die . ”
The California Democrat objects , for example , to the administration ’s recent rejection of the tough new health standard for controlling smog ( also known as ozone ) that EPA ’s independent scientific panel had recommended .
Instead of taking the panel ’s advice , Johnson followed the president ’s orders and adopted an ozone standard that , many experts charge , includes weaker environmental protections .
According to Boxer , “ EPA ’s own analysis shows that Administrator Johnson ’s [ ozone ] decision … could result in between approximately 1,000 and 2,000 more premature deaths each year . ”
Legal experts say that even more than under Bush ’s two previous administrators , Christine Todd Whitman and Mike Leavitt , Johnson ’s EPA is regularly pushed around by politically powerful advisers at the White House and in other departments . ”
There ’s a sense that the agency has not stood up for itself and has been run over by other interests in the executive branch — and that it ’s happened under Steve Johnson ’s stewardship , ” said Richard Lazarus , an environmental law professor at Georgetown . ”
He has not been a strong administrator , a strong voice in the administration , ” Lazarus continued .
“ In case after case , to the extent that the EPA career and science people have sought something , the White House has repeatedly trumped his judgment more than has happened in the past . ”
Critics acknowledge that ever since President Nixon created the supposedly independent agency in 1970 , every EPA administrator has faced conflicts between what the agency ’s experts recommend and what the White House demands .
“ But it seems to me that that tension is now at an acute level , ” said Jonathan Cannon , director of the University of Virginia Law School ’s environmental and land - use program .
“ It ’s causing extreme friction within the agency and institutional damage .
It ’s demoralizing the legal staff , and it ’s further separating staff from the political leadership at the agency . ”
Cannon served at EPA during the Reagan , George H.W. Bush , and Clinton administrations .
EPA ’s current lawyers and scientists say that agency morale is almost as bad as it was in the early 1980s after President Reagan appointed pro-industry Anne Gorsuch Burford to head it .
EPA ’s reputation fell so low under Burford that Reagan felt obligated to sack her and bring back William Ruckelshaus , the agency ’s beloved first administrator .
Burford ’s controversial tenure led EPA ’s professional staff to organize a branch of the National Treasury Employees Union in hopes of “ being able to do our work with the minimum of political interference , ” said union Vice President J. William Hirzy , an EPA scientist .
He charges that the Bush administration ’s tactics constitute “ POLITICAL INTERFERENCE — in all capital letters . ”
As a consequence , Hirzy ’s group and three other employee unions have withdrawn from EPA ’s labor - management partnership council in protest .
White House meddling has pulled EPA “ off to the extreme end of the right - wing perspective on the environment , reflecting not even a consensus within the Republican Party but the views of some who are particularly hostile to the agency ’s historic mission , ” says Daniel Esty , an environmental law professor at Yale who served as the EPA administrator ’s deputy chief of staff during the George H.W. Bush administration and now advises Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama on environmental policy .
Into The Limelight
Although the White House seems to be calling the tune on the administration ’s environmental policies , most observers say that Johnson rarely objects .
Johnson , 57 , was elevated to administrator in May 2005 after decades of toiling in relative obscurity at the agency .
Bush brags about Johnson ’s credentials as a 27 - year EPA scientist .
For his part , Johnson enjoys telling his staff and visitors about his travels on Air Force One , his invitations to Camp David , and his wife ’s friendship with Laura Bush .
But the job of EPA administrator has become much less pleasant since the Democrats won control of Congress and began zeroing in on EPA ’s actions and on Johnson ’s relationship with the White House .
That scrutiny is almost certain to intensify as the Bush administration attempts to deepen its imprint on environmental policy before leaving office in January .
In the coming months , EPA is expected to issue some of the most controversial regulations of the Bush era — on global warming , pollution from “ factory ” farms , emissions from coal - fired power plants , and industrial emissions of lead .
Johnson denies that he is a White House puppet .
“ Each of these decisions is my decision , my decision alone , ” he told National Journal in a March 28 interview .
“ One of the things that I ’ve learned in my 27 years at EPA and being in a variety of decision - making capacities is that it ’s not a popularity contest … .
I completely reject the fact that I do n’t listen to my staff , ” he said .
“ I spend hours upon hours with them , going through various options and understanding the implications . ”
Johnson ’s approach to his job is defended by Jeff Holmstead , who headed EPA ’s air - pollution and radiation program during Bush ’s first term .
“ Different administrators have very different views of their role , ” said Holmstead , a partner at Bracewell & Giuliani .
“ There are some EPA administrators who really go out of their way to represent the environmental community .
And there are other EPA administrators who go out of their way to really be part of the administration . ”
From that perspective , Johnson is the consummate team player .
Never Popular
Industry lobbyists say they are tired of hearing that the Bush EPA always sides with the business community .
“ You ’re not talking to a person who says , ‘ Wow , we got a break from the agency , ’ ” said William Kovacs , vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ’s environment , technology , and regulatory affairs division .
In the case of ozone , for example , Kovacs noted that a broad coalition of industry groups waged an aggressive — but ultimately unsuccessful — campaign to persuade the Bush administration not to toughen air - pollution regulations .
The chamber , the American Petroleum Institute , the American Farm Bureau Federation , and other business organizations argued that any new restriction would hurt the economies of hundreds of communities already struggling to meet federal air - pollution demands .
Kovacs insists that Bush has the right to intervene in controversial environmental debates and overrule EPA ’s scientific panels and staff members .
“ The last time I checked , the executive branch was run by the president of the United States , ” Kovacs said .
“ And it is up to him to execute the laws , not some scientist who is sitting in a windowless office and has one opinion and who was n’t elected . ”
Business lobbyists and environmental advocates agree that the administration has adopted several groundbreaking programs to protect the environment .
Under Bush , regulators have reduced sulfur dioxide pollution from diesel - powered trucks ; curbed emissions from ships , trains , and construction equipment ; and imposed record fines on some of the nation ’s biggest polluters .
Holmstead notes that EPA is never particularly popular with business .
“ When I was in the EPA air office , it was hard to find a U.S. industry that we did n’t regulate , ” he said .
“ What EPA does is impose very expensive regulations on the business community .
Therefore , EPA is viewed with a little more skepticism perhaps than some of the other agencies . ”
Every White
House keeps a close eye on the agency for fear that its regulators will ignore the economic costs of environmental protection , Holmstead said , adding , “ EPA may not be well suited to understand the overall picture , so there needs to be a counterbalance within the administration . ”
Bush ’s supporters contend that congressional Democrats ’ attacks on EPA are inherently political .
Boxer shoots back , “ To say that Democrats ’ criticism of the Bush EPA is just politics is ludicrous on its face , because we all breathe the same air and drink the same water and rely on the EPA to protect us from the ravages of ozone , lead , perchlorate , and other toxins . ”
Likewise , Rep. John Dingell , D - Mich. , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , says that Bush ’s EPA “ has consistently failed to meet the needs of the American people . ”
Famous for his searing investigations of government agencies regardless of which party is in the White House , Dingell brags , “ I ’m an equal - opportunity son of a bitch . ”
The Turnabout
Washington insiders say that the Bush White House has significantly altered the way the federal government approaches environmental protection by quietly changing the way EPA does its job .
For one thing , critics charge , Bush is trying to starve the agency of cash .
The White House ’s proposed fiscal 2009 budget would provide just $ 7.1 billion — fewer actual dollars than EPA has received in any fiscal year since 1997 .
Bush ’s plan , when adjusted for inflation , includes record - low funding levels for community drinking water facilities and for the Superfund hazardous - waste cleanup program .
Lawmakers from both political parties say they ’ll scrap the budget proposal and start from scratch .
Meanwhile , EPA lawyers and scientists say that on some key issues Johnson has directed agency staffers to come up with legal and scientific justifications for regulatory decisions that the White House has already made .
That ’s quite a turnabout from the agency ’s traditional practice : EPA ’s professional staff would craft a proposed regulation in response to a new law or to public health problems , and the White House and the Office of Management and Budget would then vet the agency ’s draft rule .
And it ’s not just regulations that the White House is said to be taking the lead on .
In December , Johnson announced he would block California from developing its own program to regulate greenhouse - gas emissions from cars and trucks .
Agency documents gathered by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee show that EPA staffers overwhelmingly recommended that Johnson approve California ’s request .
Agency insiders say that the decision to deny the state a waiver originated in the White House and that Johnson subsequently ordered EPA lawyers and scientists to provide a rationale for the rejection .
Congressional investigators are checking internal EPA documents to confirm that sequence of events .
Johnson “ appears to have ignored the evidence before the agency and the requirements of the Clean Air Act , ” says Oversight Committee Chairman Henry Waxman , D - Calif .
Johnson maintains that EPA scientists and lawyers gave him a wide range of options for responding to California ’s request and that he made the final decision .
Current and former EPA officials also contend that the White House is telling agency staff members to focus on how much proposed regulations would cost industry , even when federal law specifically directs EPA to focus only on public health .
“ They ’ve tried to achieve a paradigm shift in how EPA makes decisions , ” said Carol Browner , who was EPA administrator during the Clinton administration and is now with the Albright Group .
“ They want to shift the agency away from the historical focus on public health and environmental protection and toward requiring cost - benefit analyses . ”
That change , she said , could be hard for the next president to reverse .
“ The question is : How much have they loaded that into the under - workings of the agency , and how do you tease it back out to guarantee that the agency does its job ? ” said Browner , who advises Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton .
House Democrats say that EPA is letting industry call the shots on appointments to its advisory panels .
In May 2007 , chemical - industry officials protested the appointment of Deborah Rice , a Maine government toxicologist , to an EPA panel charged with reviewing a potentially harmful chemical .
Industry officials said that Rice was biased because she had testified about the health hazards associated with the chemical .
After receiving a letter of protest from the American Chemistry Council , the lobbying group for the nation ’s largest chemical manufacturers , Johnson dismissed Rice from the panel .
Dingell later noted in a letter to EPA that Johnson took no action against nine scientific experts on the advisory panel who had financial ties to the American Chemistry Council or to chemical companies .
Under Johnson , EPA has been accused of limiting public access to reams of federal information on pollutants , industries , and agency research — documents that are supposed to be available under the Freedom of Information Act.
EPA has also eased requirements that companies provide data to the public about the volume of hazardous chemicals they release into the air and water in a given community .
The most devastating blow to public access came in 2006 when EPA summarily shuttered several of its libraries around the nation without first developing a plan for how vital data could be obtained by its staff and the public .
According to a Government Accountability Office report , some librarians at EPA ’s Washington headquarters and in regional offices tossed out documents and sold office equipment at fire - sale prices in their rush to meet prescribed deadlines for closing down .
EPA said that the shutdowns would save money and that much of the material would be posted online .
However , the GAO noted , because of copyright restrictions , only 10 percent of EPA ’s data can be digitized for Internet access .
In late March , EPA responded to the GAO report by promising to reopen the libraries in some fashion .
Jeff Ruch , executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility , an alliance of state and federal employees who work on environmental issues , summed up the EPA staff ’s frustration over the library closures : “ It took a real special talent to make library management controversial . ”
Creative Writing
The Bush administration also stands accused of taking an inappropriately creative and business - oriented approach to interpreting environmental laws .
But , increasingly , that creativity is being slapped down by federal judges , who are ordering EPA to adhere to the letter of the law .
One of the most dramatic examples involves mercury emissions by coal - fired power plants .
Under the Clean Air Act , EPA must order utilities to install cutting - edge technology to control such emissions .
However , before Johnson became administrator , other Bush appointees scrapped that part of the law and instead created a cap - and - trade program allowing companies to buy and sell mercury pollution credits .
In February , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ridiculed the EPA ’s interpretation of the law , saying it “ deploys the logic of the Queen of Hearts ” in Lewis Carroll ’s Alice ’s Adventures in Wonderland .
EPA and a utility - industry group are appealing .
While that legal battle drags on , the utility industry continues to emit 50 tons of mercury each year .
EPA ’s critics contend that its controversial reinterpretation of the Clean Air Act was an underhanded way to indefinitely postpone federal controls on mercury emissions .
“ If the industry believes that delay is victory , they got it , ” former EPA Administrator Browner said .
Mercury can cause severe neurological damage and is especially dangerous to young children and the fetuses of pregnant women who eat contaminated fish .
Opponents also accuse the White House of blocking federal regulation of greenhouse - gas emissions .
During the 2000 presidential campaign , candidate Bush pledged to control carbon dioxide and other pollutants that cause climate change .
But once in office , the president reversed his position , arguing that global warming was just a theory and that such restrictions would hurt the U.S. economy .
Since then , the White House has argued that EPA does not have the legal authority to regulate greenhouse - gas emissions .
However , in April 2007 , the Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Air Act requires EPA to regulate greenhouse gases emitted by cars and trucks if agency scientists determine that the pollutants are a danger to the public .
Responding to the decision , EPA took seven months trying to pull together a regulatory program .
It spent $ 5.3 million on contractor services and dedicated 53 EPA employees to the project , which concluded that the gases are dangerous .
The agency then drafted a 300 - page proposal to regulate those emissions .
In early December , the documents were sent to the White House and to other federal agencies for review .
But last month , Johnson announced that EPA was starting over .
He said that using the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases from cars and trucks would have forced regulators to curb global - warming emissions from power plants , factories , and other businesses .
Instead , he said , EPA would examine whether it could use a recently passed energy bill to address the vehicular emissions .
The reversal infuriated congressional Democrats , state officials , and environmentalists because the nation ’s highest court had specifically ruled on EPA ’s duties under the Clean Air Act .
Johnson ’s about - face virtually guarantees that the federal government will not regulate greenhouse gases during Bush ’s presidency .
“ The Bush administration is recklessly abandoning its responsibility to address the global - warming crisis , ” Waxman said .
Early this month , a coalition of states , cities , and environmental groups petitioned a federal court to force EPA to regulate climate - change pollutants under the Clean Air Act .
The agency ’s legal defeats on mercury and global warming are not isolated cases .
During the past four years , the Bush administration has lost 10 lawsuits on air - pollution issues alone in the D.C. Circuit Court , which handles most challenges involving federal regulations .
Holmstead , who authored the mercury rule while at EPA , insists the administration has been the victim of a liberal court .
“ It does seem that the court has been more willing to stretch the law if [ EPA ] does something that is viewed as pro-environmental versus when the environmentalists oppose it , ” he said .
But Lazarus , the Georgetown law professor , said that both Republican and Democratic appointees have ruled against the environmental policies of the Bush White House and EPA .
“ They ’ve lost a lot of their major reforms in court , and they ’ve lost them with balanced panels , ” he pointed out .
Former EPA lawyer Eric Schaeffer agreed .
“ These guys are losing these lawsuits on the plain language of the statute , ” said Schaeffer , who spent 12 years at EPA and headed the agency ’s regulatory enforcement office during the Clinton administration and early in the current administration .
“ The court is saying , ‘ You have n’t read the law . ’
That ’s how you get conservative judges to side with the environment .
You draw a circle around the statute and say , ‘ This was written by Congress . ’ ” Schaeffer now runs the Environmental Integrity Project , an advocacy group .
In the absence of federal regulations on mercury , global warming , and other pollution problems , the states are increasingly developing their own curbs , noted Becker of the air regulators group :
“ By not taking strong action in a lot of these areas , the agency is inviting the states to act .
And , by golly , they have . ”
Now , industry officials have begun complaining that the states are creating a patchwork of regulatory programs and that a uniform federal standard would be easier to meet .
Closing Time
As Bush ’s presidency winds down , EPA is drawing up a long list of new environmental policies .
“ As the president said , he ’s sprinting to the finish line .
And I , too , am sprinting to the finish line , ” Johnson said .
His critics are bracing for the worst .
“ The administration is going to be pushing out some very obnoxious stuff , ” predicts John Walke , director of the Natural Resources Defense Council ’s clean - air program .
“ They ’ve got their agenda all lined up .
And they want to accomplish as much as they can before they leave office . ”
Some of the administration ’s environmental proposals — the president ’s EPA budget , for example — can be ignored by Congress .
Others will no doubt be challenged in court .
But quite a few actions will be difficult to reverse — even under a new , more environmentally friendly administration .
“ Realistically , it would take half of an administration to overturn the damage they ’ve done through rule - making , ” Walke said .
“ And that ’s if you start immediately and succeed at overturning everything that was harmful from the past eight years .
That ’s probably not likely .
It ’s daunting at best . ”
As Becker sees it , “ Under any new administration , including a McCain administration , they need to come in from the get - go and turn the page .
They need to move on .
People at EPA will feel relieved . ”
Browner said she would counsel the next EPA administrator to take a firm stand on key environmental issues .
She recalled the advice she received from the agency ’s first head : “ Ruckelshaus told me , ‘ If you ’re not prepared on occasion to use your position and power to go directly to the president and ask him to support a decision you ’re making , you should n’t take the job . ’
“ In the meantime , disgruntled EPA professionals are longing for the day when the next administration takes over their agency .
“ It ’s not a Republican - versus - Democrat issue , ” said union representative Hirzy .
“ It ’s just that in the last eight years we ’ve had a reactionary operation here that has just been murderous .
01/20/09 — that ’s the magic number . ”

Archaeologists hired by the Aboriginal traditional owners have released the results of radiocarbon tests indicating that it is one of the oldest - dated sites in Australia and internationally significant as a prehistoric record of humanity .
" We have always known this is an important part of our history , that our ancestors lived here , " said a senior elder of the Martidja Banyjima people , Slim Parker .
" Our stories and songs tells us this .
It is a good feeling to know archaeologists have proved what we say is true .
It makes us feel strong .
Now we want this place preserved .
It is part of our heritage and our culture . "
The discovery shows Mr Parker 's ancestors lived in the area for more than 1000 generations .
The Banyjimas ' consultant archaeologist Neale Draper said : " We are thrilled at the test results .
This is a major scientific discovery .
It contains a large number of stone tools and it is one of the most data - rich ancient sites in Australia , with an exceptional amount of information about climate change through the last ice age , the earliest occupation of the Pilbara and North - West Australia . "
Discussions are now under way between the company and the traditional owners , who want the sensitive areas protected from mining .
Melbourne University 's Professor Jim Bowler , who discovered bones on the shores of Lake Mungo in the late 1960s — later estimated to be 40,000 years old , making them the oldest human remains found in Australia — said : " This appears to be a very , very important find .
It seems likely to write a new chapter in the history of Aboriginal Australia . "
Another eminent scholar , Dr Ian Crawford , former curator of archaeology and anthropology at the West Australian Museum , said : " Further work on this site is most important . "
Dr Crawford said the discovery of ancient tools was especially significant .
Analysis of seed remains on the artefacts might be able to settle a long debate among archaeologists about the date that grinding implements were first used by Australia 's indigenous people .
" It will be very interesting to see if this work can be related in any way to rock engravings in the area , " he said .
So far , no human remains have been found near the the dig site , but the archaeologists and Aboriginal elders have found other caves in the area that appear to have been deliberately walled in , and could be burial places .
" Some of these niches are empty .
They are being investigated with great care and respect , " Dr Draper said .
The sheer antiquity and quality of the material was amazing , he said .
" This is a forensic record of the history of indigenous Australia , especially in the Pilbara .
" The cave is a rock shelter measuring 10 by eight metres , with a roof 1.5 metres high .
The 1.5 - metre excavation pit goes down 2.2 metres to the bedrock below , and there is evidence of Aboriginal occupation down to two metres deep , " he said .
Twelve other sites in the area have also yielded archaeological evidence such as stone tools , fireplaces and dateable charcoal as well as plant remains such as seeds and bark .
Another 20 have still to be excavated .
Most of the stone tools are small cutting implements .
Some were found beside a fireplace containing charcoal dated as 25,000 years old .
Traces of organic material on the tools could provide evidence of prehistoric food supplies and climate change when further testing is complete .
" The most significant artefacts we found are a core ( piece of stone ) and two flakes ( from it ) at the site layer dated to 35,000 years ago , " Dr Draper said .
" The reason these are significant is because the flakes refit onto the core .
This demonstrates the way early Aboriginal peoples manufactured stone artefacts . "
Since these artefacts refitted together , it showed that the site had not been previously disturbed .
" We now hope Rio will redesign the mine to protect this site , so that we can begin a major salvage operation , " he said .
Dr Draper is managing director of Australian Cultural Heritage Management Ltd , a national consultancy .
He said carbon dating of artefacts was done at the University of Waikato in New Zealand , which has state - of - the - art carbon dating equipment .
The dig was supervised by a leading US archaeologist W. Boone Law , who said it was the most significant project he had ever worked on .
" The oldest - dated stone artefacts are a core and associated flakes that have a radiocarbon age estimate of 35,000 years , " he said .
" There are at least 12 stone artefacts buried up to 10 centimetres below the 35,000 year date , inferring the site is much older .
We do not know the age of the earliest artefacts , but based on the rock shelter stratigraphy , it is likely around 40,000 years .
" When we were excavating , we recovered most of the artefacts below the charcoal we dated to 25,000 years BP — before present . "
Mr Law said ancient campfires like the one in the cave shelter were identified by observing the outline of old hearths during digging .
" The outline of the campfires are defined by a dense concentration of ash , charcoal and burnt rock surrounded by unburnt soil , " he said .
" The soil surrounding the hearth will be a lighter colour .
Often there is burned rock at the base of a campfire , demonstrating that the fire burned in place or in situ . "
He said the site was of great international importance .
" I know that the scientific value of this rock shelter will be emphasised across the wider academic community , but for me personally , my memories of excavating this site will always be tied to working with the Banyjima people , " Mr Law said .
" A team of elders and young men worked alongside ACHM staff throughout this project , and their field observations added a new dimension to our research . "
" Their perspectives on the archaeological record and natural enthusiasm for looking after country are forever linked to the history of this place . "

For ten years , the modern skeptical movement has wielded a cudgel against claims of the paranormal : the James Randi Million Dollar Challenge .
In many debates over the possibility of psi abilities , the Challenge provides a final word for one side … ” has so - and - so applied for the Challenge ? ”
The financial reward offered by the James Randi Educational Foundation is seen by many skeptics as providing an irresistible motivation for anybody with paranormal ability – after all , if someone could genuinely exhibit such powers , surely they would step forward to take the million ?
However , after ten years , the James Randi Educational Foundation ( JREF ) says nobody has even got past their preliminary testing .
Furthermore , none of the ‘ big fish ’ – medium John Edward , spoon - bender Uri Geller , psychic Sylvia Browne – have applied ( although Sylvia Browne did accept James Randi ’s direct challenge on Larry King Live , without going any further ) .
And now , perhaps as a result of that fact , James Randi has announced that the Challenge will come to an end in two years , on March 6th , 2010 .
But does the challenge really make a statement about the existence of the paranormal and / or psi abilities ?
According to paranormal investigator Loyd Auerbach ( who , like Randi , is a member of the magic fraternity ) :
The suggestion that ending the Challenge after 10 years supports any statement that psi does not exist or someone would have won the challenge , is absurd on many levels .
The procedures for the Challenge included several hurdles in favor of , and multiple “ outs ” for Randi and the JREF that any discerning individual capable of any kind of extraordinary human performance would think twice about ( and here I ’m not just referring to psychics and the like ) .
What are these hurdles that Auerbach refers to ?
Chances , of Anything …
First , and perhaps the most important , is the effect size required to win the challenge .
While the JREF says that “ all tests are designed with the participation and approval of the applicant ” , this does not mean that the tests are fair scientific tests .
The JREF need to protect a very large amount of money from possible “ long - range shots ” , and as such they ask for extremely significant results before paying out – much higher than are generally accepted in scientific research ( and if you do n’t agree to terms , your application is rejected ) .
In the case of parapsychological research , however , where effect size is often small ( though apparently robust ) , this means most researchers would have to go to extraordinary lengths to win the million dollars .
As one psi researcher pointed out to me :
In the ganzfeld telepathy test the meta- analytic hit rate with unselected subjects is 32 % where chance expectation is 25 % .
If that 32 % hit rate is the “ real ” telepathy effect , then for us to have a 99 % chance of getting a significant effect at p < 0.005 , we would need to run 989 trials .
One ganzfeld session lasts about 1.5 hours , or about 1,483 total hours .
Previous experiments show that it is not advisable to run more than one session per day .
So we have to potentially recruit 989 x 2 people to participate , an experimenter who will spend 4 + years running these people day in and day out , and at the end we ’ll end up with p < 0.005 .
Randi will say those results are n’t good enough , because you could get such a result by chance 5 in 1,000 times .
Thus , he will require odds against chance of at least a million to 1 to pay out $ 1 million , and then the amount of time and money it would take to get a significant result would be far in excess of $ 1 million .
Furthermore , applicants must first pass a ‘ preliminary test ’ , before they are allowed to progress to the actual ‘ formal ’ test which pays the million dollars .
So an applicant must first show positive results in a preliminary test ( yielding results against chance of at least 1000 to 1 , apparently ) , then once through to the next stage they would then have to show positive results against much higher odds to claim the prize ( by all reports , at odds of around 1 million to 1 ) .
Failure in either test means no cash prize , and a fail beside their name .
It many respects it would be like telling a professional golfer to shoot 63 around Augusta National , then come back and shoot 59 , to prove that he can play golf .
In the words of Chris Carter , author of Parapsychology and the Skeptics :
If Randi were genuinely interested in testing unusual claims , then he would also not insist upon odds of at least one million to one against chance for the results .
Anyone familiar with scientific studies will be aware that experimental results against chance of say , 800,000 to one would be considered extraordinary ; but results this high would be , according to Randi , a “ failure . ”
Dr Michael Sudduth of San Francisco State University also pointed out to me a wonderful irony in one of the rules .
Challenge rule # 3 states : “ We have no interest in theories nor explanations of how the claimed powers might work . ”
As Sudduth puts it : “ Curiously , Randi ’s challenge itself is saddled with assumptions of this very kind .
The challenge makes little sense unless we assume that psi is the sort of thing that , if genuine , can be produced on demand , or at least is likely to manifest itself in some perspicuous manner under the conditions specified by the challenge . ”
Researchers Step Up to the Plate
As a consequence , you might well say “ no wonder no serious researcher has applied for the Challenge . ”
Interestingly , this is not the case .
Dr Dick Bierman , who has a PhD in physics , informed me that he did in fact approach James Randi about the Million Dollar Challenge in late 1998 .
Bierman reported a success in replicating the presentiment experiments of Dr Dean Radin ( where human reactions seem to occur marginally before an event occurs ) , and was subsequently asked by Stanley Klein of the University of California why , if his results for psi effects were positive and replicable , he did n’t respond to Randi ’s challenge .
Bierman replied that he would rather invest his time in good scientific research , rather than convincing skeptics in a one - off test .
However , after further discussion , he decided that he may be able to combine the two :
After some exchange of ideas I was brought into contact with Randi .
Randi sounded sincerely interested and I worked out a proposal for an interesting experiment that would last about a year .
Experimental effects in this type of research are small and require a lot of measurements to reach the required statistical significance ( I think Randi wanted a p- value of 0.000001 ) .
Note that he did n’t insist on showing the effect on stage .
Rather I proposed to do a kind of precognition ( actually presentiment ) experiment on - line over Internet where he or some other independent skeptic could generate the targets once the responses were communicated over the Internet ( all this would be done automatically on a computer under his control within a second ) .
This would prevent cheating from the experimenter ’s side but we still had to work out how to prevent cheating from the Randi-side .
At that point Randi mentioned that before proceeding he had to submit this preliminary proposal to his scientific board or committee .
And basically that was the end of it .
I have no idea where the process was obstructed but I must confess that I was glad that I could devote myself purely to science rather than having to deal with the skeptics and the associated media hypes .
Bierman said I should also contact Suitbert Ertel , Professor Emeritus of Georg - August - University of Göttingent , who has developed a new type of parapsychology experiment which seems to facilitate large - scale psi effects – which would be much more suited to the Randi challenge .
Ertel , I was told , had apparently also discussed the challenge with James Randi , after his results had been replicated by other skeptical researchers .
Ertel replied to my query by explaining his involvement with not just Randi ’s challenge , but also a separate ‘ Prize Challenge ’ offered by a German skeptical group :
My first approach [ to Randi ] was made because I thought the prize might be achieved by the Gauquelin planetary effect , a statistical “ paranormal ” or “ neo-astrological ” effect , with which I was very familiar as researcher .
The problem was that decisions regarding the sample which would amount to 1000 natal charts was dependent on much informed thought , and Randi did n’t know how to deal with the conditions .
So the correspondence came to an end .
The second approach was made because I had applied to win the prize of 10,000 EURO which the German GWUP promised to give to someone who would be able to demonstrate large psi effects .
Winning this prize would have been considered by Randi as passing his preliminary test , his first test which must be passed before someone is allowed to apply for Randi ’s main $ 1 000 000 test .
The psi effect demanded , even for the GWUP test =
Randi ’s preliminary test , was so large that I was not hopeful that I would be able to show so much of psi , with the help of my psi-gifted students which I selected by my “ pingpong ball test ” .
My only goal was to achieve a statistically significant effect so as to make the skeptics admit that they observed a significant psi effect .
This goal was achieved by my first test trial ( one psi-gifted participant ) in 2005 .
In 2006 another test was conducted with the presence of GWUP people : two of my students , psi-gifted in earlier tests , participated .
In this test the effect was not significant .
One of the apparent reasons for this failure was that the skeptics had changed the conditions of this test arbitrarily in many ways so that the participants felt uneasy under strong control – such feelings have psi-reducing effects .
Ertel ’s first test with the GWUP had a p value of .018 .
He mentioned however , that two additional students among a number of observers also participated , secretly , during the test .
Their results were also significant , giving a total significance p-value of .002 .
Ertel told me that the GWUP skeptics , to their credit , did note the results of the two students who had participated secretly .
Ertel thinks that the Million Dollar Prize is winnable , though obviously the odds required are not ‘ fair ’ scientifically .
However , as one of the rules is that applicants must pay all their own expenses , he estimates that he would need at least $ US10,000 to make a ‘ long shot ’ bid for the formal challenge .
He would also like to have a personal attorney present and another independent scientist as observer , and would need to select 3 - 4 psi-gifted participants near the JREF institution where the tests would be performed :
But winning the prize would not be my main concern .
My main concern is to achieve high levels of significance under control by the skeptics .
Psi effects would have to be acknowledged as existent by the science community if they were achieved , i.e. replicated ( because they would have been observed before the Randi test was made ) with , say , p = .0001 – it need not be .000001 .
Winning the Randi prize is no scientific standard for acknowledging the existence of causal effects .
P = .0001 or so obtained under control of people who are experts in deception ( so that this factor is ruled out ) and whose intention and bias is to prove that psi does NOT exist ( so bias is also ruled out ) would let psi appear existent beyond reasonable doubt .
Would You Trust This Man ?
Ertel ’s mention of the expenses required to engage in Randi ’s challenge , returns us to to the “ hurdles ” mentioned by Loyd Auerbach .
Perusing the rules of the Million Dollar Challenge would certainly give most people cause for concern .
Two of the most important , especially when combined , are rules # 4 and # 8 :
4. Applicant agrees that all data ( photographic , recorded , written , etc. ) gathered as a result of the setup , the protocol , and the actual testing , may be used freely by the JREF .
8 . When entering into this challenge , as far as this may be done by established legal statutes , the applicant surrenders any and all rights to legal action against Mr. Randi , and / or against any persons peripherally involved , and / or against the James Randi Educational Foundation .
This applies to injury , and / or accident , and / or any other damage of a physical and / or emotional nature , and / or financial and / or professional loss , and / or damage of any kind .
However , this rule in no way affects the awarding of the prize , once it is properly won in accord with the protocol .
In other words , applicants give the JREF / Randi virtually absolute license to use the data as best suits their publicity needs , without any legal recourse for the participant .
Not exactly enticing for an applicant , although if James Randi was held in higher esteem by the parapsychology research community then it might not matter so much .
However , a number of scientists iterated to me their distrust of Randi …and a number of them appear to have good reason for that judgement .
When I asked Rupert Sheldrake about the Million Dollar Challenge – a scientist who has investigated ‘ telephone telepathy ’ , the sense of being stared at , and possible psychic talents in animals , Sheldrake told me quite simply : “ I do n’t take the prize seriously , and above all I do n’t trust Randi since I ’ve found him to be dishonest …
He is not a scientist , has no scientific credentials , and is essentially a showman and an expert in deception ” .
Sheldrake pointed out a previous confrontation as evidence for his distrust of James Randi :
The January 2000 issue of Dog World magazine included an article on a possible sixth sense in dogs , which discussed some of my research .
In this article Randi was quoted as saying that in relation to canine ESP , “ We at the JREF [ James Randi Educational Foundation ] have tested these claims .
They fail . ”
No details were given of these tests .
I emailed James Randi to ask for details of this JREF research .
He did not reply .
He ignored a second request for information too .
I then asked members of the JREF Scientific Advisory Board to help me find out more about this claim .
They did indeed help by advising Randi to reply .
In an email sent on Februaury 6 , 2000 he told me that the tests he referred to were not done at the JREF , but took place “ years ago ” and were “ informal ” .
They involved two dogs belonging to a friend of his that he observed over a two - week period .
All records had been lost .
He wrote : “ I overstated my case for doubting the reality of dog ESP based on the small amount of data I obtained .
It was rash and improper of me to do so . ”
Randi also claimed to have debunked one of my experiments with the dog Jaytee , a part of which was shown on television .
Jaytee went to the window to wait for his owner when she set off to come home , but did not do so before she set off .
In Dog World , Randi stated : “ Viewing the entire tape , we see that the dog responded to every car that drove by , and to every person who walked by . ”
This is simply not true , and Randi now admits that he has never seen the tape .
Dr Gary Schwartz has often come under attack from James Randi for his research into mediumship .
Labelled “ Gullible Gary ” by Randi , and accused of believing in the tooth fairy , Dr Schwartz refused an invitation from Randi to allow an “ independently qualified panel ” to hold forth on the data he has collected .
According to Dr Schwartz : “ He calls it an ‘ independently qualified panel ’ , but it is composed mostly of people hand - picked to guarantee the decision would likely be a foregone conclusion , merely rubber - stamping his prejudices ” .
In this case , Randi suggested a panel comprising of Ray Hyman ( CSICOP Fellow ) , Marvin Minsky ( CSICOP Fellow ) , Michael Shermer ( CSICOP Fellow ) and Stanley Krippner ( a parapsychologist whom Randi is familiar with ) .
Not exactly “ independent ” , one would surmise .
Unfortunately , according to Dr Schwartz :
James Randi has a history of engaging in the twisting of the truth … Randi ’s recommendation of Dr. Krippner was certainly acceptable to me .
However , when I contacted Dr. Krippner directly to see if Mr. Randi ’s statement about him serving on the panel was correct , Dr. Krippner was concerned .
Dr. Krippner explained that he had previously emailed Mr. Randi stating that he would not agree to serve on such a committee .
The truth is , Dr. Krippner was not willing to serve on the panel , and he made this clear to Mr. Randi .
Lastly , despite James Randi ’s assurances that applying for the prize is a simple matter , this seems not to be the case .
A number of the more ‘ general ’ applicants have waited multiple years to have their claim tested ; one of the more recent , Carina Landin , went through a 3 year process just to reach the preliminary test , and after failing her test ( achieving above chance results , but not to a significant level ) found that her protocol had not been adhered to …and so is now waiting to be retested .
According to ‘ Kramer ’ , a former JREF employee who helped with applications :
We experience this a lot , and this most certainly leads many applicants to the conclusion that JREF is “ jerking them around ” , forgetting that no JREF representative is involved in testing , and that tests are determined with Randi ’s approval , but without his direct involvement , in order to insure absolute impartiality in the testing procedure .
JREF cannot guarantee the continued involvement of any third parties who volunteer their time ( without any form of compensation ) on behalf of The JREF Challenge . ”
All in all , it ’s rather easy to see why ‘ psychic personalities ’ would ignore the Million Dollar Challenge , irrespective of anyone ’s opinion as to whether their talents are real or fraudulent .
It asks them to risk their careers on a million to one shot ( assuming they are not fraudulent ) , putting all the power into the hands of a man they distrust – and who has been antagonistic towards them over a number of years – with no legal recourse available to them .
On the other hand , although parapsychologists face similar worries , it is now apparent that some are so determined to show the evidence for psi effects that they are willing to risk a failure in order to make an impression .
Both Dick Bierman and Suitbert Ertel feel that there is a robust enough effect for them to at least scientifically prove to the skeptics that something interesting is going on .
And perhaps others are aware of this fact …
You Say Paranormal , I Say Perinormal
At The Amaz!ng Meeting # 3 ( TAM3 ) , the JREF - sponsored conference held in January 2005 , Richard Dawkins made an intriguing comment during an on -stage chat with James Randi :
About the million dollar prize , I would be worried if I were you because of the fact that we have perinormal possibilities .
I mean , what if somebody – what if there really is a perinormal phenomenon which is then embraced within science and will become normal , but at present is classified conventionally as paranormal ?
Certainly , suspicious ( some might say ‘ skeptical ’ ) minds might wonder whether the influx of positive “ perinormal ” results – such as from the decades of Ganzfeld telepathy research , replicated presentiment experiments , and Ertel ’s new ball - drawing test – may have influenced the JREF ’s decision to withdraw the Challenge .
It ’s interesting to note that Rule # 14 of the challenge states :
This prize will continue to be offered until it is awarded .
Upon the death of James Randi , the administration of the prize will pass into other hands , and it is intended that it continue in force .
Similarly , in a previous discussion regarding the Challenge , Randi had stated : “ … the million dollars is not my million dollars , sir , it belongs to the foundation I represent , and it can not be used for any purpose other than as prize money in the challenge . ”
It would seem this is no longer the case …
Whatever the reasoning behind the withdrawal of the Million Dollar Challenge , it has little impact on scientific acceptance of psi effects .
Even if a challenger took on the risks and won the million dollars – despite Suitbert Ertel ’s best intentions – it is doubtful that skeptics would be convinced .
According to CSICOP Fellow Dr Ray Hyman :
Scientists do n’t settle issues with a single test , so even if someone does win a big cash prize in a demonstration , this is n’t going to convince anyone .
Proof in science happens through replication , not through single experiments .
Ultimately , Irrelevant
It would seem the modern skeptical movement has all bases covered .
If you do n’t apply , it shows you have no evidence of the paranormal .
If you do apply and fail , ditto .
If you put your career on the line and apply , beat initial odds of 1000 to 1 , and then 1,000,000 to 1 , to win the Challenge , then it still offers no proof of the paranormal .
Ironically , paranormal investigator Dr Stephen Braude agrees with Ray Hyman about the merits of the Challenge : “ The very idea that there could be a conclusive demonstration to the scientific community of psychic functioning is fundamentally flawed , and the suggestion that a scientifically ignorant showman should decide the matter is simply hilarious . “
Skepticism is certainly demanded in examinations of paranormal claims ( not to mention , in all facets of life ) .
However , the JREF Challenge seems to be primarily aimed at providing the modern skeptical movement with a purely rhetorical tool for attacking the topic of the paranormal .
In a recent newsletter , James Randi says as much : “ The purpose of the challenge has always been to provide an arguing basis for skeptics to point that the claimants just wo n’t accept the confrontation . ”
It appears though that some parapsychology researchers are actually more willing than Randi thought …
It seems quite obvious that the Million Dollar challenge does not offer – and has not offered in the past – a fair scientific evaluation of paranormal claims – rather , the statistics employed are primarily based on ensuring the million dollars remains safe .
Other rules further stack the deck against participants , by handing control of publicity to the JREF .
Suitbert Ertel commented to me :
Randi and those who offer a large monetary prize for psi effect demonstrations are entitled to demand unachievable psi effects .
It ’s their money and they must be careful not to lose it .
Everybody must admit that this is reasonable economically .
But careful reasoning about money and property is quite a different thing than careful scientific reasoning .
Dr Dean Radin was more blunt in his assessment :
This ‘ challenge ’ was like Evel Knievel ’s steam - powered motorcycle jump over the Snake River Canyon : A great stunt , accompanied by pomp and bluster , but ultimately irrelevant .
— — — ———-
Update : James Randi has responded to this post in his JREF newsletter dated
29/02/2008 : “ The Grubbies Attack “ .
While I do n’t consider this article an “ attack ” ( nor consider myself “ grubby ” ) , I do thank Randi for responding .
To be clear : I contacted the JREF three times while writing this article , and extended the deadline by a week , to allow for responses and clarifications from Randi ( or JREF officials ) .
I would have preferred that , rather than a rhetorical and selective newsletter ‘ debunking ’ , but Randi is entitled to do what he likes .
Although I would like to leave the article to stand alone , rather than debating points , Randi makes some unfortunate errors in his newsletter , which I feel bound to point out here .
Most importantly , in multiple passages , Randi refers to the words of “ Loyd Auerbach ” – these are not Auerbach ’s words , they are mine ( apart from one short quote from Auerbach ) .
This is unfortunate , as Randi directly addresses Loyd Auerbach in a rhetorical fashion on multiple occasions , when Auerbach did not say the words Randi attributes to him .
Other than that : I am not “ chortling ” over the end of the challenge , nor is this a “ 19,000 word tirade ” ( it does n’t even measure 4000 words , and it is simply an examination of the challenge ) .
Surely Randi is not so sensitive about people offering skeptical analyses ( this is his raison d’être , after all ) of his own work , as to label them “ tirades ” ( three times no less ) , when it most obviously is n’t ?
Randi defines “ applied ” for the challenge as it suits him .
Sylvia Browne “ applied ” , according to Randi , by responding on national TV after being “ forced into it ” ( labeling my statement “ wrong ” as a consequence ) .
Later , Professor Dick Bierman did not “ apply ” , despite approaching Randi without being forced into it , because “ his name appears in none of the application files ” .
For the record , when I queried Randi about his in a private email , he confessed that “ Browne never applied . ”
The passage about “ none of the “ big fish ” ” having applied is not a “ canard ” , as Randi labels it – it is in fact a point in favour of the Challenge .
For Randi ’s own edification , I am in agreement with him regarding Sylvia Browne .
In the only correct attribution to Loyd Auerbach , Randi says “ we have never said nor even suggested [ that the challenge disproves psi ] .
Loyd invented that , all by himself . ”
Loyd did not claim that Randi made that statement .
However , numerous self - described skeptics * have * suggested it .
Auerbach had no need to “ invent ” it ( a wonderfully descriptive phrase by Randi though , credit where due for his rhetorical skills ) .
Randi says “ the applicant invests nothing , has nothing to lose , and should be able to beat the odds in the same way that any person could . ”
This is patently untrue , as the article shows .
Randi : “ Again , nonsense .
We have NEVER had an applicant fail to come to agreement with us when terms were negotiated , and every one of those applicants simply failed and did not re-apply . ” I stand corrected .
Randi : “ What Auerbach purposely fails to understand – in order to have an argument – is that a pole - vaulter should be able to pole - vault , a cook should be able to cook , and a psychic should be able to do what he / she claims , to better than 1/100 odds . ”
Nonsense , Randi has no such knowledge that a psychic should do better than his arbitrary 1/100 odds – it is his personal opinion .
Would it be snarky of me to point out that in earlier paragraphs Randi claimed to have an “ abysmal ignorance of statistics ” ?
Randi says : “ And , I have to wonder why Dr. Bierman did not press me to pursue the matter , since he reports that it seems to have simply vanished .
We ’ve had many of such disappearances , in which apparently interested persons , scientists among them such as Dr. Wayne E. Carr – also a PhD , so we know he ’s a real scientist – who negotiated with us literally for years before backing out . ”
Randi turns this around rather deftly with some rhetorical sleight - of - hand .
According to Dr Bierman , the ball was in Randi ’s court when the application “ disappeared ” ; Bierman did not “ back out ” .
Randi need not have “ wondered ” why Bierman did not follow up – Bierman says himself in the article .
Further , Randi says his correspondence with Bierman terminated in 1983 … I ’m not sure of this date , as Bierman ’s email correspondence about presentiment was in 1998 .
[ The mention of Victor Zammit ’s own attack mid-response is nothing to do with my article . ]
However , I am glad to see that my article has prompted Randi to lower the odds ( to 1 in 100 for the preliminary , and 1 in 100,000 for the main challenge ) .
This may make the Challenge a more attractive proposition for parapsychology researchers .
It certainly remedies ( to a degree ) one of the main problems with the challenge – that the odds are so long .
One in one hundred thousand is still no easy task however .

There is still work to do on gold .
But once that is done , what is the next big step ?
In the long term we need an incremental linker , but I ’m also interested in an idea which I call concurrent linking .
A concurrent linker runs at the same time as the compiler .
As each object file is compiled , the linker is notified , and the linker adds the object file to the executable that it is building .
When the last compilation is completed , the linker writes out the fully linked executable .
The idea is to keep the linker from being a serializing step in a compilation .
It is normally easy to run many compilations in parallel , as each compilation is independent .
Traditionally , however , the linker can not start until all the compilations are complete , and it must read all the input files at that time .
A concurrent linker can instead run at the same time as the compilations .
There is no long wait after the compilations are complete .
Also , the newly generated object file should be in the disk cache , and so the linker will have to do less actual disk I/O .
I expect that this would only be a noticeable improvement for large programs , but then those are the cases where the linker really is a bottleneck .
The key to making this work will be careful control of the symbol table , and efficient tracking of relocations .
In general relocations for an object file may only be resolved when they refer to symbols defined in objects which appear on the link command line .
In other cases we must remember the relocation .
If the symbol is already known to be defined in an object which appears later on the link line , it would probably be appropriate to resolve the relocation to that symbol , but to record it in case the symbol definition is changed later .
In general an executable linked in this way may have additional text and data segments , and they wo n’t be as tightly packed .
Thus the resulting executable will most likely have slightly worse paging behaviour and will run slightly slower .
So this technique is only appropriate during the development cycle , not during a release build .

The blind man in John 9 did n’t have many vocational options .
He had been born blind .
And it was his own fault .
As a fetus this man sinned in the womb against the Almighty .
Either that or his parents had sinned and cursed him .
Whichever , he was suffering his just punishment .
Those who had been righteous fetuses walked by and sometimes dropped a coin in his hand .
You see , in the law and prophets God had not explained exactly why one person suffers more than another .
So theologians surmised that a person ’s suffering must result from a specific offense against God .
Oddly , this was what Job ’s three friends , Eliphaz , Bildad , and Zophar , had surmised about Job ’s suffering .
God ’s word to them was , “ you have not spoken of me what is right ” ( Job 42:8 ) .
Jesus was about to deliver a similar rebuke .
As Jesus and his disciples passed by this man , the disciples naturally wanted to know who was to blame , the man or his parents .
That ’s when Jesus threw another wrench into their theological system .
He said , “ It was not that this man sinned or his parents , but that the works of God might be displayed in him ” ( v. 3 ) .
Can you hear the disciples catch their breath ?
Have you caught yours ?
Jesus said that God was to blame .
The man was blind because God had a purpose in it that had n’t entered anyone ’s mind .
All those years the man and his parents labored under a perception of God ’s judgment for an unknown reason .
And they had born others ’ disdain .
Imagine what the man ’s childhood must have been like .
Imagine the insults , the indignities , the injuries , the poverty , the loneliness , and isolation from other children .
No hope for marriage .
No hope for education .
Why ?
Because God had something glorious to say through it .
It ’s just that up until this day no one saw it coming , least of all the blind man .
Jesus then spat on the ground , made mud with his saliva , put the mud on the man ’s eyes , and said , “ Go , wash in the pool of Siloam . ”
So he went and washed and came back seeing !
In that moment everything changed .
The man went from life - long blindness to seeing .
But even more revolutionary in its repercussions , he went from being perceived as the object of God ’s wrath to being the object of God ’s mercy !
This is mind - blowing .
God ’s purposes in his blindness turned out to be exactly opposite of everyone ’s perceptions .
All along people believed the man was “ born in utter sin ” ( v. 36 ) .
But in fact he was born blind in order that God might show mercy to him and pronounce judgment on the self - righteous religious people .
“ For judgment I came into this world , that those who do not see may see , and those who see may become blind ” ( v. 39 ) .
Caution : we must be very careful in assessing God ’s purposes in suffering — our own or someone else ’s .
Often we can not see any redeeming reason for it .
The same would have been true of the blind man until the day Jesus passed by .
Even here we might be tempted to say , “ Well , yes , but how often does that happen ? ” I know .
I have a sister who is severely developmentally disabled .
I know very little of God ’s purposes in it .
He often does not make his purposes public knowledge .
This story reminds us that our perceptions and God ’s purposes can be very different , even opposite .
If we are going to be skeptical , it ’s best to be skeptical of our perceptions .

No torrent site on earth is more popular than Mininova .
Surprisingly , however , all the legal pressure seems to have been focused on sites such as The Pirate Bay .
Mininova - against all the odds - appears to have stayed under the radar .
All that changed today as Mininova is now facing legal action by Dutch anti-piracy agency , BREIN .
BREIN , the Dutch anti-piracy outfit responsible for shuttering or forcing torrent sites such as Demonoid overseas , has announced that it will take BitTorrent - behemoth Mininova to court .
BREIN hopes the court will force Mininova to filter its search results , so that all . torrent files which may point to unauthorized content are removed .
Mininova is currently the largest BitTorrent site with over 30 million unique visitors per month .
Mininova displays user submitted torrents and carries legitimate premium content from publishers such as CBC .
Unlike The Pirate Bay , the site does not have their own BitTorrent tracker .
It transpires that BREIN and Mininova have been secretly trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement for more than a year now , but when one side believes they are acting within the law and the other side believes the opposite , a legal clash seems inevitable .
Erik Dubbelboer , one of the co-founders of Mininova , told TorrentFreak that Mininova will not cave in to pressure from BREIN .
He expects to have more details about the upcoming lawsuit later this week : “ We will proceed to court with full confidence .
We operate within the law , as we maintain our ‘ notice and take down ’ policy .
That is , we remove search results if a copyright holder asks us to . ”
Sites like YouTube operate in a similar manner – if the site receives a demand from a copyright holder that it should take content down , it does so under its DMCA obligations and there is no further action .
Mininova does n’t even host any unauthorized content , only . torrent files , which should make it even less of a target than YouTube .
Typically , BREIN does n’t see it that way .
Tim Kuik , managing director of BREIN , said that Mininova ’s business model is based on illegal activity .
“ A notice and take down procedure is absolutely insufficient for a site that makes use of unauthorized files , structurally and systematically , ” he added .
The announced legal action will focus on the question whether Mininova has to filter their search results or not .
BREIN wants Mininova to install such a filter , Mininova on the other hand does n’t want to censor the search results .
The outcome of the case is likely to have a huge impact on the future of other BitTorrent sites , and even sites such as Google and YouTube .
April 3rd , 2008 | Published in erlang , REST , yaws | 3 Comments | Bookmark on Pinboard .in
Regarding my “ RESTful Services with Erlang and Yaws ” article on InfoQ.com , Sam Ruby said :
This otherwise excellent article fails my ETag test .
When Sam speaks , I listen , so I ’ve given his feedback a lot of thought .
As I wrote in a comment on Sam ’s blog , the Erlang / Yaws RESTful services I work on do indeed support conditional GETs , so at least my day - to - day work passes his ETags test .
As for the article , there are two ways to think about it :
If you focus on the “ RESTful Design ” portion of the article , then yes , I could have added a “ think about where you need to support conditional GETs ” item to the “ key areas to pay attention to ” list .
If you focus on the Yaws / Erlang aspect of the article , then keep in mind that dealing with ETags requires dealing with HTTP headers such as If - none - match and the ETag header itself .
The article already shows you how to read request headers and write reply headers , though , and how you actually create specific ETag values for use in the headers depends on the particulars of your resources — Leonard Richardson ’s and Sam ’s excellent book already covers this pretty well .
I intended the focus of the article to be more about item 2 than item 1 , so I think not specifically addressing ETags is OK .
What would happen if our right to abortion hinged on the right to sexual pleasure rather than on a penumbra ?
Ecuador might just find out .
Maria Soledad Vela , a member of Ecuador ’s Constituent Assembly , a
committee tasked with the job of rewriting the nation ’s constitution , made international news
recently by proposing that a woman ’s right to sexual happiness be written into
the constitution .
To the surprise of
exactly no one , this suggestion caused some humorous overreactions from fellow
Ecuadorian politicians , mostly
male .
One suggested the law was a
mandate that women have orgasms , supposedly a physical impossibility ,
though I ’m sure Betty Dodson would
disagree .
Another , according
to Salon , likened the law to life in prison .
Protests like these caused folks the world
over to speculate about the psychology of a straight man who would advertise
his indifference , even hostility , to women ’s opinions of what happens in the
conjugal chambers .
Vela denied that she intended to trap unwilling men into a
hellish land of mandatory
pleasure provision .
Her
explanation –that this was about redefining women as sexual agents instead of
just sex objects and baby - makers –fit neatly into a long - standing feminist
paradigm , and really should n’t have caused the alarm that it did .
Lindsay
Beyerstein , in the comments at my place , likened it to the " pursuit of
happiness " clause in the Declaration of Independence .
One would assume that the right to sexual
autonomy simply went understood as a component of the right to pursue happiness ,
but in the atmosphere of sexual repression caused by the anti-choice rightwing in
this country , one ca n’t assume too much .
What would life be like if sexual autonomy were written into our
Constitution , a right much like the freedom of speech or freedom of religion ?
A lot of contentious issues would become a lot less
controversial right away .
The right to
birth control and abortion–critical to almost all heterosexual women ’s sexual
agency –could hardly be debated .
Right now , anti-choicers can exploit people ’s ignorance of legal matters
and hint that the right to privacy found in the Constitution by the Supreme
Court in the decision Griswold v .
Connecticut , which legalized contraception and led to Roe v. Wade , was somehow illegitimate
because the Constitution does n’t explicitly use the word " privacy " and because
the word " penumbra "
is multi-syllabic and confusing .
Penumbras are the cause of many rights that go unchallenged , but
anti-choicers wo n’t tell you this , pretending that sexual rights are unique in
this respect .
But if sexual autonomy were spelled out
as a right , then they could n’t really argue against it .
Most people are n’t going to buy the idea that contraception is
irrelevant to a woman ’s sexual autonomy , unless of course she ’s a lesbian , and
I do n’t see the fundies pushing widespread lesbianism as an alternative any
time soon .
It would be much easier to make the argument for
government - subsidized contraception , as well .
Right now , we can argue for it as a public health measure , but with a
right to pursue sexual happiness , we could also argue that those who can ’t
afford their own contraception should have their rights subsidized by the
government .
For those who wish to clutch
their pearls in shock , realize that the only downside to such a program
would be reduced public health expenditures for treating people after they
catch STDs or become pregnant unintentionally .
The Hyde Amendment , of course , would n’t stand
a chance against the right to sexual pleasure .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

Abstinence - only " education " would be a non-starter of an
issue , as well .
The idea that the
government should dictate to you a moralized agenda contrary to your own
autonomous desires–and to withhold crucial information you need to enact your
rights in the healthiest manner –would make as much sense as giving the
government the right to pick your religion for you .
The idea that there ’s a virtue in depriving
yourself of the pursuit of sexual happiness would start to look like
arguing that not voting or speaking up is somehow virtuous .
Trying to secularize for the classroom what
is patriarchal
religious dogma would be a much harder task , nearly impossible .
Why rape is wrong would become much clearer .
Right now , the law has to function
( for good reason ) by distinguishing between consensual and non-consensual sex .
So
far too many people think there ’s no moral difference between getting consent
that sounds like , " Oh god , do it now ! " and " Fine , if it ’s the only way I can
get you to leave me alone . "
But if we
had the right to sexual autonomy enshrined in the Constitution , then perhaps
people would see more value in women ’s sexual pleasure , just as we value free speech , freedom of
religion , and privacy .
And a lot fewer
men would push their luck by pretending that " no " was really " yes " by
exploiting the gray areas .
Same - sex marriage rights would be an easier sell , as well ,
if everyone had a right to sexual autonomy and the pursuit of happiness .
After all , is n’t the debate over marriage
basically about whether or not the institution exists to make people happy
( same - sex marriage advocates ’ argument ) or for people to submit to in order to
uphold the hegemony of heterosexism ( an argument made by right wingers , though of
course without the big words that come from the " elitism " of literacy ) ?
Such an amendment would wrap that debate up
altogether , making it clear that in America , institutions –even ones
with a sexual component like marriage–exist for the people , not the other way
around .
And if the people are better
served by same sex marriage — as they are — then there are no good arguments
against it .
Needless to say , there ’s no court in the land that could
justify a ban on selling
sex toys or even a need for the euphemism " marital aids " .
Saving the country the expense of prosecuting
dildo dealers alone would justify such an amendment .
When seven white swans made a home on the Chaobai river in north - east Beijing last year , it was hailed as an Olympic success story .
Until a few years ago , the waterway was so exploited that the bed was cracked dry .
Now the river has been refilled and the wildlife brought back , ready for rowing events in August .
For Beijing , it was a showcase of how the " green " games can improve the environment .
But four months on green activists are asking whether this and other cosmetic clean - ups are depriving arid regions of water during a particularly severe drought .
Thanks to a huge diversion , the Shunyi Olympic rowing park project has turned a dry river and its banks into a lush resort with a water surface of 63 hectares ( 155 acres ) and a green area of 53 hectares .
It is not the only hydro - engineering facelift .
Beijing is diverting millions of gallons of water to ensure this dry and dusty city looks its best during the Olympics .
Workers are rushing to complete a huge canal that will channel water from the Yangtze and other rivers in southern China to the parched but densely populated north .
Reservoirs around Beijing are being tapped to flush out the foul , polluted waterways in the centre of the city and to fill the fountains and keep the grass green in the Olympic park .
Meteorologists are even firing silver iodine crystals into the clouds to induce rain .
This work means other needy areas going dry .
Last year , farmers in neighbouring Hebei were told to grow corn or wheat instead of water - intensive rice .
Tens of thousands of people have been relocated for a 192 - mile section of the water diversion project , which will open in April , redirecting 300 m cubic metres of water from Hebei to the capital .
In any year this would be a sacrifice .
Hebei has one of China 's lowest levels of per-capita water resources .
But this year 's drought is severe .
This week the Hebei Daily said levels of winter rain and snow were 60 % below the long - term average , leaving many reservoirs at very low levels .
" The severe drought has created tense conditions for water supplies in our province , and the conflict between water supply and demand has been dramatically exacerbated , " it noted .
Like many other Olympic projects , the water diversion was being planned anyway .
Beijing needs more water because it has more flush toilets , more ornamental lakes , more building sites and more people .
The population - soon expected to hit 18 million - has more than quadrupled since the 1960s .
But the Olympics is an excuse to accelerate development .
The games are such a national priority that few dare risk being accused of lacking patriotism .
Tensions are apparent .
Earlier this week , a senior official in Shaanxi province - which is also being tapped for Beijing - warned of social , economic and environmental disaster because of strains on water resources .
" In order to preserve the quality of Beijing 's water we have to close all our factories .
But we still need to live .
So I say the government needs to compensate Shaanxi , " An Qiyuan , chairman of the Chinese people 's political consultative committee for Shaanxi , told the Financial Times .
Activists accuse Beijing of sacrificing its neighbours .
" Using drinking water from Hebei and other poor provinces to provide for luxuries in Beijing is wrong , " said Dai Qing , a leading environmental activist .
" Beijing will ensure the city has enough clean water in August , but it will only be temporary .
In the longer term , the water crisis will worsen . "
She said the rowing park at Chaobai was the worst example of waste because it required filling a dry river , greening parched earth and building one of the world 's biggest fountains .
" This was a dry river .
Why do they have to use this area for competition ? " said Dai .
The water 's origins are mysterious .
The government insists the river is being filled from the Wenyu , a smaller Beijing waterway used for effluent , but Dai says the volume is insufficient and the quality too low .
She suspects the Chaobai is being filled from already depleted groundwater supplies and reservoirs .
It is difficult to assess .
Despite reports that the Olympics will push up water consumption by 30 % , the Beijing city water bureau insists supplies diverted from Hebei and Shaanxi are for normal use , urban development and the increase in population .
" We never said we need extra water for the Olympics , " said the bureau 's propaganda director , Yu Yaping .
" We do n't know if the total volume of water will increase this year .
In fact we are trying to promote measures to save water . "
Such is the sensitivity that even the scale of the drought is hard to confirm .
" We can't give you any statistics .
Our reservoir is too important to Beijing and to the Olympics .
We can't tell you the trend , " said an official of Miyun reservoir , who declined to give his name .
But the director of the rowing park , Zhang Xiangdong , insisted his project was a success .
" This was dry seven years ago .
From last year , 40 m cubic metres of water is flowing into the Chaobai every year .
We now have more than 100 kinds of trees that produce 50,000 tonnes of oxygen , which is good for the air .
Last autumn , we had our first swans .
Can you imagine how excited we felt ?
And by August , the Chaobai will be full . "
The anonymous internet phenomenon Wikileaks.org today won two influential allies in its fight against a US court order shutting down the website .
Wikileaks disclosed secret documents on Guantanamo Bay , Northern Rock and other controversial issues before a Swiss bank won a legal injunction that blocked its US server last week .
But two groups that frequently challenge the Bush administration on its wiretapping programme and its treatment of terrorist suspects came to its defence today .
The American civil liberties union ( ACLU ) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a legal motion on behalf of Wikileaks users , defending their right to access the website without censorship .
" Journalists , academics , and the general public have a legitimate interest in accessing the materials found on Wikileaks in order to inform their work and participate in public debate , " ACLU staff attorney Ann Brick said in a statement .
" Blocking access to the entire site in response to a few documents posted there completely disregards the public 's right to know .
It 's unconstitutional and un-American . "
In a separate court filing today , an alliance of American reporters filed a motion supporting on behalf of Wikileaks , arguing that the website 's closure violates the freedom of speech guaranteed in the Constitution .
The alliance — which includes the Associated Press , Gannett news service , the Los Angeles Times newspaper and other media outlets — cited the famous " Pentagon Papers " case of 1971 , when the administration of Richard Nixon sought a restraining order against newspapers that published leaked documents on the Vietnam war .
" Under [ the ] Pentagon Papers [ case ] , the first amendment prohibits prior restraints [ on freedom of speech ] in nearly every circumstance , even where national security may be at risk and the … source is alleged to have obtained the documents unlawfully , " the media alliance wrote in its filing .
It was not a risk to US national security that prompted the court order shutting Wikileaks .
Instead a Swiss bank convinced a judge appointed by George Bush to close the website after a former bank employee leaked documents that purport to show the company engaged in money laundering and tax evasion .
The next step in the case will come on Friday , when a court hearing is scheduled to determine whether the preliminary shutdown order can stand .
In the meantime , fans and supporters of Wikileaks have rallied to its defence by setting up " mirror " copies of the website that include most of the incriminating documents at issue in the case .
Normally , big discoveries in a given field come at the rate of a few a year , if that .
However , the past six weeks have seen not one , but a series of announcements that may change the face of superconductivity research .
Starting with a publication in the February 23rd edition of the Journal of the American Chemical Society and ending with three separate announcements from various Chinese research groups , these last few weeks have given us the description of a previously unknown class of high temperature superconductors .
When electrons flow through a conductor , they scatter due to thermal vibrations and material impurities — the amount of scattering is measured as the electrical resistance .
For most materials , as the temperature drops towards absolute zero , the electrical resistance asymptotically reaches the material 's inherent conductivity .
However , once some materials drop below a critical temperature , the resistance drops to zero : these materials are known as superconductors .
If one constructs a loop of superconducting material and sends an electric current moving through it , that current will persist for all time , since there is no resistance to stop it .
The current explanation for superconductivity is that conducting electrons form coordinated pairs that are inefficiently scattered ; since conductance is inversely proportional to scattering , this leads to infinite conductance .
The temperature at which a material begins superconducting — the critical temperature — is very low .
Titanium will superconduct below 0.40 K ; the figure for lead is all the way up at 7.19 K .
Some alloys are known to exhibit superconductivity at higher temperatures than pure compounds —
Nb 3 Al has a critical temperature of 18.9 K. According to the canonical explanation for superconductivity , the BCS theory , nothing should be able to exhibit superconductivity at a temperature above 30 K .
In 1986 this prediction was shown to be false with the discovery of the cuprate high temperature superconductors .
The first , La 1.15 Ba 0.85 CuO , discovered in 1986 by Muller and Bednorz , was shown to have a critical temperature of 35 K .
The discovery was so ground breaking , it netted the pair the Nobel Prize in Physics the following year .
In the intervening 20 years , new materials in the cuprate high temperature superconductor family have been discovered .
Probably the most well known is the yttrium - barium - copper oxide ( YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 ) which was the first superconducting material shown to superconduct at a temperature of 92 K , well above the boiling point of nitrogen .
The current record holder for high temperature superconductor is mercury thallium barium calcium copper oxide ( Hg 12 Tl 3 Ba 30 Ca 30 Cu 45 O 125 ) which transitions into superconductive state at a whopping 138 K — with some reports this can be raised to 164 K at high pressures .
However , these are still all well short of room temperature , 298 K .

Up until late February , all known high - temperature superconducting materials were some variation of a copper oxide .
In the month 's final edition of JACS , a research team from the Tokyo Institute of Technology reported on the groundbreaking discovery of a lanthanum oxygen fluorine iron arsenide ( LaO 1 - x F x FeAs ) * that exhibits superconductivity at 26 K .
About a month later , researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei announced that they had synthesized a samarium oxygen fluorine iron arsenide ( SmO 1 - x F x FeAs ) ** ceramic that exhibited superconductivity at 43 K . Continuing the groundbreaking results , a second Chinese team , this one at the Institute of Physics ( IoP ) at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing , reported three days later that they had succeeded in creating praseodymium oxygen fluorine iron arsenide ( PrO 1- x F x FeAs ) *** which had a critical temperature of 52 K .
They made a second announcement a few weeks later , in which they reported that the superconducting temperature of their praseodymium compound could be raised to 55 K by growing it under pressure .
These four materials represent an entire new class of superconducting compounds , and their discovery could provide a big boost to our theoretical knowledge of superconductivity .
The field has n't come to an agreement on to how to account for the behavior of cuprate high - temperature superconductors .
It is believed that the layered structure of the cuprates , the ability of electrons to hop from copper ion to copper ion , and the shielding provided by copper - free layers all contribute to the superconductivity .
Since these new materials also have a similar - ish layered structure , are bad conductors before they transition , and exhibit antiferromagnetism , it is hoped that they can offer new insights into a general mechanism (s ) of high - temperature superconductivity .
According to Steven Kivelson , a theoretical physicist at Stanford , " [ there exist ] enough similarities that it's a good working hypothesis that they 're parts of the same thing . "
However , not everyone hopes the mechanism is the same .
Philip Anderson , a Nobel Laureate and theoretical physicist at Princeton , says that an entirely new mechanism of superconductivity would be far more important than if they mimicked the current understanding of superconductivity .
" If it 's really a new mechanism , God knows where it will go , " says Anderson .

I ’m sure the Lego company had good reason not to release a Ultrarealistic ‘ Glock 17 ’ lego kit for kids 12 - 17 .
“ Fool your friends and police folk alike ”
Brickgun.com comes up with a brilliant product that will can only lead to no good .
From their website homepage :
‘ We specialize in creating the coolest , most realistic kits that can be built using genuine Lego parts .
Each model is life - sized , with accurate dimensions and details .
They feature functioning mechanics such as triggers , hammers , slides , safeties and magazines so they not only look like the real thing , they work like the real thing as well . ’
Imagine the brainstorming session for this idea / product : ‘ What can we do , or create that will be very popular with impressionable kids , that can be made very easily with a highly penetrated toy product in homes , and can get them killed when mistaken for a real weapon ? ’
Brickgun !
Added bonus , bring a bag of black lego pieces through the TSA , cause an airport wide panic and national security breach on plane by a 12 yr old who has pieced them together from instructions bought off of brickgun , or inspired by the website .
( or even this blog entry .. hmm )
Dont wait !
Get your “ The Coolest Lego Weapons in the World . ”
Note :
If I didnt lay it down the sarcasm thick enough , albiet very cool models , this product , because of the basis of its ‘ kid friendly ’ materials , can be very dangerous and will lead to no good in the hands of certain kids , desperate crack heads and most drunken adults .
Have them play with something safe , like the Indiana Jones Bull whip , with ultrarealistic whip crackin sound .
Setting a " LEO " Straight
By L. Neil Smith
Dear Sir :
I am in receipt of your May 17 letter to Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership , in response to my column about the National Rifle Association and its collusion with the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Explosives .
( See " With Friends Like The NRA ... "
http://jpfo.org/smith/smith-friends-like-nra.htm ) .
I thank you for taking the time and going to the effort of expressing your concerns , but I 'm afraid you have some misconceptions about the nature of individual rights in general and the individual right to own and carry weapons in particular .
You begin by complaining that the article in question is " too radical even for me " .
" Radical " comes from the Greek , from their word for " root " ( " radish " is a related word ) .
In English , it means getting to the root of whatever you 're talking about , to the fundamentals , the basics , which is , indeed , what I try to do with all my writing .
I 'm sure you meant that what I said is too extreme , a word that depends on context : extreme compared to what ?
In this case it seems that it 's extreme compared , not to what the Second Amendment actually provides , but what you 'd rather believe it does .
A firm believer in the strict interpretation of the Second Amendment would not go on to say the other things you do about the rights it was written to preserve .
But perhaps I can help .
" I do n't feel the need , " you inform us , " for law - abiding and honest citizens to own and carry fully automatic weapons , especially those capable of concealment , along with sawed - off shotguns . "
Pardon me if I point out that it could n't possibly be less important what you do or do n't " feel the need " for .
I do n't care what you " feel " , nor would James Madison who wrote the Bill of Rights , nor would Thomas Jefferson whom it was written to satisfy .
Clearly , you fail to understand why the Second Amendment was written .
While it 's become popular to say it has nothing to do with duck hunting -- and that 's true as far as it goes -- very few people understand that it has nothing to do with defending yourself from muggers , burglars , or rapists , either , although that 's a surely welcome side - benefit .
The Second Amendment was written specifically to ensure that the people would always possess the physical means to intimidate the government , to keep it in line , or , failing that , to overthrow it at need and , as Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence , " provide new guards for their future security " .
In its time , the Pennsylvania ( or Kentucky ) rifle represented the leading edge of technology , and those who possessed it could shoot three times as far , with much greater accuracy , than those stuck with , say , the British Army 's " Brown Bess " smoothbore musket .
Jefferson , an inventor and a technophile himself , would recognize the need today for the average citizen to be equipped with weapons that are the equal of , or superior to , whatever the government supplies its troops with .
Now if that does n't include " automatic weapons , especially those capable of concealment , along with sawed - off shotguns , " I do n't know what it does include .
You can't make the government behave itself with bolt action rifles , pump shotguns , and revolvers .
You also say , " We do n't need to have explosives and other weapons of war readily available to anyone that wants them or the U.S. would be like the countries in the middle east we are attempting to defend . "
Yet " weapons of war " ( a term often used as propaganda by the likes of Sarah Brady and Dianne Feinstein ) are precisely why the Second Amendment was written , and , once again , what you feel " we " do or do n't need is completely unimportant .
You have no legitimate say in the matter .
The police are the standing army that the Founding Fathers worried about , and , as such , they 're the very people the Second Amendment was ratified to protect us from .
If 200 years of American history have anything to teach us , it 's that so - called " public servants " are neither .
Their loyalty is not to the public , but to the politically powerful .
All too soon they come to see themselves as the public 's masters , not servants .
Maybe that 's part of their strange transformation over the years from keepers of the peace into " law enforcement officers " .
We 've gotten to a point where they 'll enforce any damn law -- no matter how evil or idiotic it is -- without regard to whether it serves the public and the peace or damages them .
To quote you further , " I guess what I am trying to say is the United States is a country of laws to safeguard the population from the criminal element of our society . "
Wrong again : how can this be a country of laws if the Bill of Rights -- especially the Second Amendment -- can be ignored or reinterpreted into meaninglessness by the government ?
That 's how the Canadian " Charter of Rights and Freedoms " works .
Nothing in it is absolute , it fails to protect the right to property in any way , and it can be suspended whenever the government feels like it .
Are we Canadians ?
The " criminal element of our society " we should worry about are elected and appointed officials who've decided that either the Founding Fathers did n't really mean what they said , that it somehow does n't apply today ( interestingly , even the Left has n't made that claim much over the past seven years of the Bush Administration ) , or that we 're all too stupid to read some kind of secret code they wrote into the law , empowering tyrants to take our rights away whenever they " feel the need " .
" I can only imagine if all the current gun laws were abolished how the crime rate would [ soar ] . "
Given the incontrovertible fact that the better armed people are , the less crime there is , a soaring crime rate would indeed be totally imaginary .
Liberals whimper about just such an imaginary soaring crime rate whenever it gets easier for individuals to own and carry weapons .
I suggest that you read More Guns , Less Crime by Professor John Lott if you have any doubts on the subject .
I have to add that your phrase " legally purchased firearm " is offensive to anyone who believes that begging the government for permission to own a gun , or informing it that you have one , defeats the purpose of the Second Amendment .
Any individual should be free to walk into any store , gun show , or yard sale and buy a gun for cash , without signing a paper or even giving anyone their name .
That 's what the Founders intended ; that 's how it was most places until 1968 ; that 's what we must strive for .
To paraphrase the great Alphonso Bedoya , in Treasure of the Sierra Madre , " We don ' need no stinkin ' legalized ! "
Not too much later on , you assert that , " ... if you get rid of the [ BATFE ] their duties and personnel would be absorbed by other Federal agencies .
Getting rid of a name does not help anyone .
Federal law enforcement agencies have their place ... "
On the contrary , we seek not only to abolish the BATFE , but all of its functions , as well , since not one is legal under the Constitution .
Alcohol and tobacco ( however much some people may disapprove of their use ) are subject to religiously - based punitive " sin taxes " that are completely out of place in a nation with a First Amendment in its Constitution .
They violate the letter and spirit of the Fourteenth Amendment , as well , since it guarantees equal protection under the law -- protection that smokers , drinkers , and gun people never actually receive .
Furthermore , there 's no Constitutional justification for the existence of any of the agencies you think might pick up BATFE 's workload .
( See Article 1 , Section 8 , a short , extremely explicit list of powers permissable to the government -- a list that does not include creating anything even remotely like the EPA , OSHA , FBI , NSA , DHS , or CIA . )
If you wish to live in a " country of laws " it must be a country of all the laws , especially highest law of the land , the Bill of Rights .
You begin again ,
" I believe that all law - abiding citizens should be allowed to carry a firearm and -- "
Please get this through your head once and for all : regarding the individual right to own and carry weapons , there is no " allowed " .
Government has nothing to say about it .
This basic human right predates the Second Amendment ( which only offers to protect it ) .
It predates the Constitution .
It predates the United States .
It predates the British and the Roman empires .
It predates civilization itself .
Undaunted by the laws you profess to respect , you trudge onward : " Concealed weapons permits should be good throughout the United States , however , I do believe there should be some type of proficiency qualification requirement ... every 3 to 5 years if not annually . "
Apparently I missed the part of the Second Amendment that says , " the right of the people who have permits and pass some type of proficiency qualification to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . "
" I understand JPFO 's positions on firearms given the history of the Jewish people and what has happened to them ...
This will never happen in this country unless the government is willing to kill those of us that will fight to the death before giving up our guns and for this reason , I do not feel they will try . "
Maybe this is a little harsh , but exactly whose fantasy world are you living in ?
This is the age of Waco , of Ruby Ridge , of the Texas FLDS child kidnappings .
It 's an age in which a United States Senator , Thomas Dodd , can get the Library of Congress to translate Nazi gun laws -- written to satisfy Hitler the way the Bill of Rights was written to satisfy Jeffersom -- so he could turn them into the Gun Control Act of 1968 .
It 's the age of secret detention centers -- concentration camps -- the seizure of private weapons as part of " helping " disaster victims , and the imposition of a North American Union that would circumvent and destroy the Bill of Rights , erase the borders between this country and Mexico and Canada , and force Americans to use " Ameros " for money instead of dollars .

The government now snatches people off the street and out of their homes , ships them without due process to Guantanamo Bay and other places for unlimited periods of time , and tortures them .
Your bland assurances that " it ca n't happen here " ring a bit hollow , since it is happening here , right now .
Only this time , everybody gets to be a Jew .

You say : " We must continue the watchdog approach on all new legislation and be very vocal on bills that attempt to further constrict our ' Right to Keep and Bear Arms ' along with any legislation that constricts other Constitutional rights , " you tell us .
" Our best hope is return conservatives to the House , Senate , and Presidency . "
You go on at considerable length about " conservative principles " and a need to elect and appoint conservatives anywhere and everywhere .
You seem to have missed the fact that it 's your precious conservatives and their so - called " principles " that have brought us to the end of the American dream of peace , freedom , prosperity , and progress .
It 's interesting to me that novelist / philosopher Ayn Rand predicted developments like these over forty years ago .
See : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand.
It 's your precious conservatives who wage unconstitutional wars , lock up individuals who are supposed to be presumed innocent until they 're proven guilty , deprive them of legal representation , and treat them in ways it 's illegal to treat animals .
It 's your precious conservatives who rammed the fascistic Patriot Act through Congress , who conduct illegal , warrantless wiretaps , who continue the medieval practice of Eminent Domain , and champion the mass invasion of privacy at airports .
It 's your precious conservatives ' irrational insistence on gun control -- victim disarmament -- at any cost that prevents passengers from shooting hijackers before they can crash planes into buildings .
Your precious conservatives would rather shoot down a hijacked plane loaded with innocent people , than let those people exercise their basic human right to self - defense .
In short , it 's your precious conservatives -- right wing socialists who have turned out to be no better than the left wing socialists who call themselves liberals -- who are leading the government 's campaign to destroy the Bill of Rights .
When German " law enforcement officers " did this to their own people they protested that they were " only following orders " -- but we hanged them anyway , at Nuremberg .
In my experience most cops ' highest loyalty is to their pensions , rather than the people they claim to serve , an attitude that makes all kinds of oppression -- including genocide -- possible .
See JPFO 's gun control / genocide chart at / filegen -a-m/ deathgc.htm#chart
I urge you to read Melissa Marsh 's review of Ordinary Men : Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland by Christopher R. Browning , then obtain and read the book itself : .
" If the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101 could become killers under such circumstances , what group of men cannot ? " says Browning , trying to understand and explain why people can be led to do anything , no matter how depraved .
" Human responsibility is ultimately an individual matter . "
I am speaking to you , now , of your individual responsibility .
I truly wonder what Second Amendment -- and what Constitution -- you believe in .
It certainly is n't the one that I know and love , that the colonists and veterans after them fought and bled and died for .
It 's time to look straight into the ugly face of history and acquaint yourself unflinchingly with the truth .
A cop should not cop out .
Sincerely ,
L. Neil Smith

Devastation of a regional nuclear war would be far from confined to the countries that started it .
Plants and animals , including humans , would be endangered by a global ozone hole that would result and persist for years after all the bombs were exhausted , a new study suggests .
The layer of ozone high up in the Earth 's atmosphere absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the sun before it hits the Earth 's surface .
Without it , almost all lifeforms would be bombarded by this energetic radiation , and though more research needs to be done into the specific effects of a significant ozone depletion , increased UV radiation can damage DNA and has been linked to the most common forms of skin cancer , as well as melanoma ( the most lethal skin cancer ) and cataracts .
" It would have a big increase in human ailments such as cataracts and cancer , " said study leader Michael Mills of the University of Colorado at Boulder .
Since 1990 , the chances of developing melanoma have more than doubled , according to a 2003 Environmental Protection Agency document .
This increase is believed to be a result of increased exposure to UV radiation from ozone depletion caused by man-made chemicals that destroy ozone , such as chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) .
What exactly the UV bombardment will mean in terms of species extinction is uncertain , Mill said .
But he added , " it would affect the food chain . "
Researchers used a computer model to see how a regional nuclear war ( in this case between Pakistan and India ) involving 50 nuclear devices the size of the bombs dropped on Hiroshima would affect global ozone levels .
The effect was far more massive than previous studies done in the 1980s had suggested , even though these studies had imagined a full - scale nuclear war , the authors said .
The findings are detailed in the April 7 issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
About 40 countries in the world possess enough plutonium , uranium or a combination of both to construct substantial nuclear arsenals .
A nuclear exchange like the one examined in this study would be only a fraction of a percent of the total explosive power of the world 's nuclear arsenal , Mills said .
Of the eight nations that have known nuclear arsenals , even those with the smallest , such as Pakistan and India , are believed to have 50 or more Hiroshima - sized weapons .
" The world has become a far more dangerous place when the actions of two countries on the other side of the world could have such a drastic impact on the planet , " study co-author Brian Toon , also of the University of Colorado at Boulder .
Smoky soot plumes Previous studies , including a 1985 National Research Council Report , had examined the effects of nuclear war on ozone loss by considering the chemicals the bombs would spew into the atmosphere .
But they failed to consider the massive smoke plumes that would rise into the air as the bombed - out cities burned .
The new study considers both , painting a picture of citywide firestorms and ozone destruction .
" It has as much to do with the bombs as it does with the fuels in modern megacities , " Mills said .
" Pretty much everything will burn in a city . "
A previous study conducted by Toon showed that as buildings , cars and other infrastructure burned , the air above would fill with soot .
Some of this soot would fall out of the atmosphere in so - called black rains , but the rest would make its way up into the atmosphere within a matter of days , Mills said .
The heat from these firestorms ( like those that destroyed Dresden , Germany , in World War II ) would push the soot - filled air into the upper troposphere , the bottom - most layer of the Earth 's atmosphere .
The blackened air would then be warmed by incoming sunlight and would rise further , into the stratosphere , which sits atop the troposphere and is the layer of the atmosphere where the ozone that protects us from the sun 's harmful ultraviolet rays is found .
The soot could eventually rise 50 miles ( 80 kilometers ) up in the atmosphere , the study found .
The new study found that up in the stratosphere , the soot would continue to absorb incoming sunlight and heat the surrounding air .
This heat would jump - start the chemical reactions that destroy ozone .
" So the temperatures go way up and this changes the rates of a number of catalytic cycles that destroy ozone , " Mills told LiveScience .
As these cycles speed up , they wipe out the ozone molecules much faster than they would at normal temperatures .
The heating of the stratosphere would also alter its circulation , prolonging the time that it normally takes for the air in that layer to turn over , prolonging the soot 's effect on ozone destruction .
Global ozone hole Above the mid-latitudes , where the United States and most of Europe lie , ozone levels would drop by 25 to 40 percent .
At higher northern latitudes , ozone losses would reach 50 to 70 percent , the model results show .
" The models show this magnitude of ozone loss would persist for five years , and we would see substantial losses continuing for at least another five years , " Mills said .
The 1985 NRC report found only a 17 percent depletion of stratospheric ozone over the Northern Hemisphere , which would recover by half in just three years .
" The big surprise is that this study demonstrates that a small - scale , regional nuclear conflict is capable of triggering ozone losses even larger than losses that were predicted following a full - scale nuclear war , " Toon said .
These losses would drop ozone levels below the amount that typically marks the seasonal ozone hole over Antarctica — only this ozone hole would extend from about 20 degrees north and south of the equator , creating a near - global ozone hole .
The loss of this protective " sunscreen " layer could have a terrible impact on the plants and animals living below that would then be susceptible to UV radiation .
Damage to plants and animals at mid-latitudes would likely rise sharply , according to the study , which was funded by the University of Colorado at Boulder .
UV rays could also damage the bacteria at the roots of some crops , which the plants depend on for some food .
Previous studies have shown residents of aquatic ecosystems , especially amphibians , are particularly susceptible to UV rays because they can do little to avoid it .
Many plankton in the ocean could also be wiped out , endangering the many marine organisms that depend on them for food .
" They can't slap on sunscreen , " Mills said .

Blocking a hunger - inducing hormone to help obesity might have unwanted effects .
Looks good : a hormone that boosts hunger also seems to boost memory .
Punchstock
It ’s a classic mistake : you arrive at the grocery store hungry , and everything seems irresistible .
Researchers have now worked out how a hunger - induced hormone called ghrelin can make all that food seem so desirable .
The hormone stimulates the same ‘ reward centres ’ of the brain that have been linked to drug - seeking behaviour , they say .
But it also activates regions of the brain involved with making memories : people injected with ghrelin remember pictures of food more clearly a day later .
The appetite - stimulating effects of ghrelin are already being tested to see if the hormone can encourage eating in cancer patients .
And inhibiting ghrelin has been discussed as one way to treat obesity .
But the new results , published this week in Cell Metabolism1 , suggest that drugs that block ghrelin may have unwanted effects on memory , says study author Alain Dagher of McGill University in Montreal , Canada .
Hungry eyes
Ghrelin was already known to trigger hunger : people given a ghrelin injection will pile their plates higher when turned loose on an all - you - can - eat buffet .
Patients with the rare genetic disorder Prader - Willi syndrome have abnormally high levels of ghrelin and sometimes eat without ever feeling sated ; some evenrupture their stomachs .
But precisely how ghrelin controls hunger was not clear because the body has several systems in place to regulate appetite , and several different hormones , including the appetite - suppressing leptin , affect hunger .
“ Ghrelin makes you hungry , but what does that mean ? ” says Michael Schwartz of the University of Washington in Seattle , who was not involved in the study .
“ What exactly is hunger in terms of how the brain works ? ”
Dagher and his colleagues enlisted the help of 20 lean , healthy volunteers .
The volunteers were given a meal and then shown pictures of food three hours later , when they were neither full nor hungry .
Twelve of the volunteers received injections of ghrelin .
In the brain
A brain - imaging technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging tracked blood flow in the brain while volunteers viewed the pictures .
The researchers found that those who had received the ghrelin injections had more blood flow , and so more activity , in several regions of the brain .
One of these was the striatum : a reward center in the brain that contains receptors for a neurotransmitter called dopamine .
Dopamine is associated with feelings of pleasure , and the striatum is also important in drug addiction .
Those who received the hormone also showed heightened activity in regions of the brain that process visual images , and in two regions — the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex — that coordinate responses to stimuli and strengthen memories of an event .
“ If you eat something that makes you sick , you will never eat it again — that ’s thanks to the amygdala , ” says Dagher .
The volunteers ' behaviour backed up the notion that their memory was affected : when they returned the next day , those who had received ghrelin were better able to remember the pictures of food .
You must remember this
Whether ghrelin affects memory in general or only memories pertaining to food remains unknown .
Studies in laboratory rats have shown that the animals ' memory can be impaired when ghrelin is absent .
“ It ’s not clear if that effect is specific for food , or if ghrelin is a general memory enhancer , ” says Dagher .
“ If you ’re a rodent , most of your memory has to do with food . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The same may have been true for humans long ago , notes Hans - Rudolf Berthoud , a neurobiologist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge , who was not involved in the study .
So a link between hunger and memory for our primitive ancestors makes sense .
But today things are different .
“ To go across the street to McDonald ’s does n’t require all of that .
Now we have GPS systems . ”
And in modern times , the link between ghrelin and memory could impede the development of drugs that target the hormone to beat back hunger , say Dagher and his team .

Christopher Lumsden denied murder
A lawyer who stabbed his wife to death after she told him she was leaving him has been released after serving less than half of his sentence .
Christopher Lumsden , 55 , pleaded guilty to manslaughter at Manchester Crown Court in February 2006 and was sentenced to five years .
Lumsden killed his wife Alison , 53 , at their luxury home in Bowdon , near Altrincham , on 16 March 2005 .
The probation service confirmed he had been released on licence .
Lumsden had served his time at Sudbury Open Prison in Derbyshire .
A spokesman for the National Probation Service in Derbyshire said : " Christopher Lumsden is currently out of prison and is under licence and being supervised by the Derbyshire probation service . "
Stabbed repeatedly
The spokesman did not say when Lumsden was released .
Lumsden , who was a partner at international law firm Pinsent Masons in Manchester , attacked his wife five days after she had told him she was leaving him for a family friend .
During his trial , Lumsden told the court how he had tried to put on a brave face despite knowing of his wife 's affair but " broke " on the night of the attack .
He plunged a 12 cm kitchen knife into his wife 's back and continued to stab her repeatedly in the face and neck .
He denied murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility .
Nevertheless , the outrage is both understandable and useful .
Public money has been put at risk to calm a storm on Wall Street while ordinary people are losing their homes .
The public is crying , “ What about us ? ” and politicians are listening , as they should .

Like the failure of a financial behemoth , spreading foreclosures engulf the innocent as well as the imprudent and unwise .
To be sure , many homeowners were shortsighted and greedy .
Like their Wall Street counterparts they borrowed too much and got caught when the music stopped .
Like the Bear Stearns shareholders , they should take losses .
But putting them out of their homes does not merely harm them and their children , it endangers whole neighborhoods and drags down the assets of their more prudent neighbors .
Congress and the Bush administration should move quickly  as they proved they could with the rapid passage of the stimulus package  to enact laws to ease the renegotiation of mortgages and keep homeowners who are able to pay the new charges in their homes .
Public money will have to be put at risk , but it is worth it .
The deals should be structured so that the taxpayer shares in the gains if markets recover and the properties or mortgages are later sold at a profit .
When the immediate crisis is past , however , we must turn to the difficult task of reducing the chances of a replay .
It will not be easy to design regulations that do more good than harm , but at the very least all financial institutions that stand to benefit from Federal Reserve help in a crisis must be subject to regulatory scrutiny to make sure they are managing their risk prudently .
There must be higher capital requirements and limits on excessive leverage .
If the rules are reasonable , we should not weep if a few high fliers choose to move their operations to other countries with laxer rules .
Our markets will be better off without them .
After that , we must take on the even harder job of sorting through the explosion of financial instruments that have proliferated in the boom and deciding which belong in our kit of tools and which should be relegated to the waste heap .
If they genuinely spread risk and help move capital into more productive uses , they should stay .
But some exotic derivatives seem mainly to reflect the efforts of traders to outsmart each other .
Their opaqueness may entail more systemic risk than social value .

The recently imposed restriction on H - 1B visas that prohibit employers from filing more than one petition for an employee in the fiscal year , did not go down too well with many people , as was expected .
In fact , there have been demands from various US employers to raise the cap on H - 1B visas .
A new study reveals that American businesses are finding it difficult to fill the skilled positions , even with the large number of foreign professionals coming to US on H - 1B visas .
These quotas on H - 1B visas have been a sore spot for a long time with companies like Microsoft and other high technology companies .
Even heads of education are miffed with these visa rules that have become even more strict post 9/11 .
The Institute of International Education estimated that the number of foreign students coming into the US to study has dropped since 2003 , for the first time in more than 30 years .
It blamed the decline to stricter visa rules and increased competition from other foreign universities .
US businesses actually benefit from the issue of H - 1B visas to employ foreign workers in various fields where practical and theoretical expertise in certain specialized occupations needs a Bachelors or a higher degree , including engineers , computer programmers and scientists .
The current cap on these visas is 65000 per fiscal year .
US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) reveal that the first 20,000 H - 1B petitions files by foreigners with US - earned masters degree or higher are exempt from this cap .
According to USCIS , there are a few more exceptions that are exempt from this cap .
If the foreigners wish to come to US on H - 1B visas to work for affiliated non profit entities , non profit research organizations , government research organizations or specific higher education institutions , they will be granted visas regardless of the visa availability .
The USCIS will start receiving H - 1B visa petitions from April 1 , 2008 for fiscal year 2009 .
Once the above mentioned caps are reached , they will randomly approve the visas from among the petitions received on the last date of receipt .
The reason for this restriction is being given by the USCIS as an intention to promote fair and systematic process for H - 1B petitioners .
They say that this rule will ensure that all companies applying for H - 1B petitions will be given an equal chance to receive H - 1B visa for their workers .
Microsoft chairman , Bill Gates contends that a cap on these visas is what forces Americans to outsource jobs .
He has repeatedly requested the US Congress to let more foreign engineers work in the high tech firms , as these firms are having to outsource jobs to overseas companies .
Gates even went on to add that the increased caliber of research institutions in India and China means the cap on visas will pose a big threat to America ’s competitiveness .
In fact , when he was asked what he would do if he could write US law , Bill Gates is said to have promptly replied that he would certainly get rid of the H - 1B visa caps .
In spite of all these contentions , the USCIS went ahead and imposed the restriction on H - 1B visas .
A survey shows that many people are of the opinion that this sort of thinking threatens to harm the economic future of America , with the US companies being given limited access to the skilled professionals , who are needed for the growth of US companies .
When this happens , more and more companies will be looking to place more of their human resources outside the United States , which is certainly not what the US government wants .

Ever since the Quai Branly Museum placed its crystal skull in a glass display case a week ago , visitors have been swarming around the spooky artifact .
The museum 's directors brought it out of storage to coincide with the release of the movie " Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull , " opening this weekend .
The film 's plot is loosely based on the legend that 13 crystal skulls , dating from the Aztec period more than 500 years ago , must be reunited by 2012 to prevent the end of the world .

When you pay Novell for semi - baked OOXML support , you actually pay Microsoft
E ndlessly we kept insisting and showing that there are serious patent issues associated with OOXML ( e.g. in [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] ) .
Unsurprisingly , Microsoft resorted to bald - faced lies .
It needed the false perceptions in order to lure in innocent supporters .
And now comes the real Microsoft .
[ mind highlight , which is ours ]
Microsoft today launched an update of its OpenXML and ODF translator for its Excel and Powerpoint applications and pledged to keep churning out more documentation to enable interoperability — and more patents to protect that IP . [...]
Microsoft would not disclose pricing for its protocol licensing but pledged today that going forward it will be offered at a “ reasonable and non discriminatory ” ( RAND ) manner .
Late last month — just days after Microsoft launched its multi-faceted interoperability initiative – the European Union fined Microsoft $ 1.4 billion for allegedly failing to comply with a three - year - old order to supply server interoperability data for competitors .
Some rivals , including Samba and other open source players , argued in the past that that the costs were too prohibitive for ISVs .
Here comes Joe Wilcox comparing such an ‘ interoperability ’ to a public relations stunt .
Microsoft ’s idea of a Document Interoperability Initiative is to put together a bunch of businesses that profit from file format incompatibilities .
And that is supposed to demonstrate — quoting from the press release — ” Microsoft ’s commitment to implement a set of strategic changes in its technology and business practices to expand interoperability through the implementation of its interoperability principles . ”
With such tricks being played , it ’s hardly surprising that Sun is already adopting the ( L ) GPLv3 for OpenOffice.org .
We wrote about this yesterday and here comes a later observation about the timing of the announcement .
OpenOffice.org has announced that the project will be moving from its current LGPLv2 licensing to the LGPLv3 with a coming version 3.0 of the open source office software suite . [...]
Interestingly , OpenOffice.org ’s announcement comes on the same day Microsot has made another interoperability announcement , this time centered on document formats .
The main man of the Open Source Initiative is at the same time praising Sun ’s Simon Phipps , who was the first to announce this adoption of ( upgrade to ) the LGPLv3 .
I believed that no matter what the process , a standard should be judged by the product .
Watching the fallout settle from the BRM in Geneva , I ’m beginning to think that you were right and I was wrong .
What you got right is that when a process is allowed to go out of its way to exclude legitimate participation , we must withdraw from the presumption that the standard can be legitimate , even if the end product does not overly exclude the possibility of an open source implementation .
This is what I have leared by reading the Groklaw report on the BRM .
To conclude , Microsoft ’s OOXML is a case of charging competitors money .
OOXML is not free .
The next few posts will also show that OOXML support simply cannot be provided by anything other than Microsoft Office , one of the company ’s last remaining cash cows .
Microsoft wants to control a second ‘ standard ’ not in order to facilitate choice , but in order to make more money . █

Arlen Specter , the Republican leader of the Senate Judiciary Committee , on Wednesday demanded an independent investigation into " Spygate . "
The announcement came three years after it was first disclosed President Bush had authorized a secret electronic eavesdropping program on Americans without warrants in the wake of the September 11 terror attacks .
But Specter was n't referring to that .
Instead , the Pennsylvania senator is demanding an inquiry into the New England Patriots ' secret videotaping of opposing NFL coaches ' signals on the sidelines – an affair sports writers have dubbed " Spygate . "
We are not making this up .
Specter said such behavior , a violation of NFL rules , is damaging to the sport .
Call it Specter 's own Patriot Act .
" It 's really an insult to the people who follow it , " Specter said .
He added that the Patriots " owe the public a lot more candor and a lot more accountability . "
The league has fined the Patriots and coach Bill Belichick $ 750,000 each .
The team 's video assistant has turned over to the NFL eight tapes of opposing coaches giving signals during games .
Apparently real - world warrantless spying is n't as egregious as snooping on opposing NFL coaches .
Specter and other lawmakers initially talked tough when The New York Times disclosed Bush 's spying program in 2005 .
" There is no doubt that this is inappropriate , " Specter said at the time .
But Congress , including Specter , eventually passed the Protect America Act , which allowed government officials to eavesdrop in the United States on telephone conversations and e-mails without warrants , if the target of the surveillance is " reasonably believed " to be overseas .
The law expired in February after lawmakers deadlocked on whether to grant immunity to telecommunications companies being sued for assisting Bush in carrying out the administration 's secret spying program before it was legal .
The Protect America
Act 's expiration means surveillance must be authorized by a secret intelligence court if the wiretap is physically planted on U.S. soil .
Still , President Bush maintains that , as commander in chief , his administration has warrantless spying powers regardless of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution .
Again , we 're not making up this story .

The Pennsylvania campaign , which produced yet another inconclusive result on Tuesday , was even meaner , more vacuous , more desperate , and more filled with pandering than the mean , vacuous , desperate , pander - filled contests that preceded it .
Voters are getting tired of it ; it is demeaning the political process ; and it does not work .
It is past time for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to acknowledge that the negativity , for which she is mostly responsible , does nothing but harm to her , her opponent , her party and the 2008 election .
If nothing else , self interest should push her in that direction .
Mrs. Clinton did not get the big win in Pennsylvania that she needed to challenge the calculus of the Democratic race .
It is true that Senator Barack Obama outspent her 2 - to - 1 . But Mrs. Clinton and her advisers should mainly blame themselves , because , as the political operatives say , they went heavily negative and ended up squandering a good part of what was once a 20 - point lead .
On the eve of this crucial primary , Mrs. Clinton became the first Democratic candidate to wave the bloody shirt of 9/11 .
A Clinton television ad  torn right from Karl Rove ’s playbook  evoked the 1929 stock market crash , Pearl Harbor , the Cuban missile crisis , the cold war and the 9/11 attacks , complete with video of Osama bin Laden .
“ If you ca n’t stand the heat , get out of the kitchen , ” the narrator intoned .
The daily phone calls .
The midnight e-mail .
And , when college lets out , those dinner table declamations ?
Oh , please .
Senator Barack Obama ’s devotees just wo n’t give their parents a break .
As the race for the Democratic presidential nomination continues , youthful volunteers for each candidate have been campaigning with bright - eyed brio , not only door - to - door but also at home .
But the young supporters of Mr. Obama , who has captured a majority of under - 30 primary voters , seem to be leading in the pestering sweepstakes .
They send their parents the latest Obama YouTube videos , blog exhortations and “ Tell Your Mama / Vote for Obama ! ” bumper stickers .
Megan Simpson , a Penn State senior , had not been able to budge her father , a Republican .
But the day before the deadline for registering for the coming Democratic primary in Pennsylvania , she handed him the forms and threw in a deal - sweetener as well .
“ I said , ‘ Dad , if you change your party affiliation in time to vote for Obama , ’ ” recalled Ms. Simpson , 22 , an Obama campus volunteer , “ ‘ I will get you the paperwork the day after the primary if you want to switch back to being a Republican . ’ ”
Thus did Ralph E. Simpson Jr. , 50 , construction company owner , become a newly minted Democrat .
“ I probably will switch my affiliation back , ” Mr. Simpson said , “ but I have n’t decided who I will vote for in the general election .
If Meg keeps working on me , who knows ? ”
This timelapse video shows the construction of the first Orion crew module , the spacecraft that will take humanity to the moon and Mars .
As you can see , this version is not the full ship , as it lacks all computer , engine and support systems , not to talk about the proton torpedoes and turbolasers .
However , the Apollo - style module is the first real tangible part of the Constellation Program , and will play a crucial part in its early development .

This capsule wo n't leave Earth 's atmosphere : it will be used in a 90 - second flight to demonstrate the features of the new ship , built using the same concept as the Apollo capsule but on a much larger scale .
The Orion is 16.5 feet in diameter , with a mass of 22.7 metric tons , which gives it " two and a half times the volume " inside the Apollo capsule .
Knowing how small Apollo was , it 's not going to be the Enterprise flight deck , but it will be able to fit four crew members comfortably starting in 2014 , the year in which it will travel to the International Space Station .
Six years later , it will go to the moon .

Mr. Bush said in his speech on Thursday that the Defense Department budget today represented slightly more than 4 percent of gross domestic product , compared with more than 6 percent in some years of the Reagan administration and as much as 13 percent in 1952 - 3 , when the United States was engaged in the war in Korea .

But the war in Iraq is largely being paid for off the books , with emergency and supplemental spending rather than from the Pentagon ’s operating budget , so Mr. Bush ’s figures are a low estimate of the relative cost of the war , analysts have observed .
And growing entitlement costs today make such comparisons with previous eras questionable .
“ Even if you assume the war costs will phase down , either quickly or slowly , we are still on an unsustainable track under current budget policy , ” said James R. Horney , director of federal fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington , a liberal research group .
“ Before the war started and without any of the new ideas of the candidates , we ’re in a situation where we have to reduce spending and reduce the rate of growth of Medicare and Medicaid and , to a lesser extent , Social Security .
So the costs of the war have to be seen in that context . ”
Douglas Holtz - Eakin , Mr. McCain ’s chief economic adviser and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office , said the benefits of success in Iraq dwarfed the $ 150 billion annual cost .
He also said that if the war and the personal and corporate tax cuts that Mr. McCain advocated added to the federal deficit and debt , so be it .
“ I would like the next president not to talk about deficit reduction , ” Mr. Holtz - Eakin said at a symposium sponsored by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget .
“ The next president should talk about what ’s good for American families  education , health care at reasonable costs , pensions that are secure , opening our borders to trade .
If we can take care of that , we can take care of the budget . ”
Mr. McCain has said he plans to pay for tax cuts and modernizing the military by eliminating earmarks and wasteful spending from the federal budget .
Both Senators Clinton and Obama would allow the Bush administration ’s personal income tax cuts to expire in 2011 and are proposing new levies on wealthy individuals , oil companies and other businesses to help pay for expansive and expensive new government programs .
While both promise to remove troops from Iraq , Mrs. Clinton does not expect any big savings that could be used to finance her domestic initiatives .
Mr. Obama does expect the winding down of the Iraq war to ultimately produce a “ peace dividend ” that can be used for other things .
Jim Webb , ( who is one of my picks for VP ) makes an excellent case for his GI Bill on MTP this morning and calls out the GOP on their negligent behavior and the threatened Bush veto .
John McCain and George Bush say they support the troops , but when it comes to stepping up and doing something tangible , they are striking out .
How dare they say these benefits are too costly when we 're spending millions of dollars a day to occupy Iraq ?
And as Webb says , this will be used on the campaign trail .
And a watered down substitute by McCain and his pal Graham is not the solution .

Webb :
No president in history has , has vetoed a , a benefits bill for those who 've served .
So on the one hand , we have this rhetoric , which goes to what I was writing saying , " This is the next greatest generation , these guys are so great . "
And then we see this president , he 's fine with sending these people over and over again where they 're spending more time in Iraq than they are at home .
He 's fine with the notion of stop loss , where we can , we can make people stay in even after enlistments are done .
And then we say , " Give them the same benefit that the people in World War II have , " and they say it 's too expensive .
Think Progress has more :
The Pentagon has suggested that Webb ’s bill is too generous in conferring benefits to soldiers after “ only ” two years of service .
However , as Webb pointed out , soldiers would still have to finish their enlistment term .
What ’s more , as a recent CBO report showed , any loss in reenlistment rates is entirely made up for by increased military recruits .
Full transcript via MTP below the fold :
SEN .
WEBB : I introduced this G.I. bill my first day in office .
The idea was to give to people who'd been serving since 9/11 the same educational benefits , the same right to a first - class future as those who served in World War II .
We , we started working hard on this bipartisan , nonpartisan , hopefully ; we have now got 58 sponsors in the Senate , 300 sponsors in the House of Representatives , and a , and a good number of the , you know , the thinking Republicans have moved to us .
And now the president says he 's going to veto this bill .
No president in history has , has vetoed a , a benefits bill for those who 've served .
So on the one hand , we have this rhetoric , which goes to what I was writing saying , " This is the next greatest generation , these guys are so great . "
And then we see this president , he 's fine with sending these people over and over again where they 're spending more time in Iraq than they are at home .
He 's fine with the notion of stop loss , where we can , we can make people stay in even after enlistments are done .
And then we say , " Give them the same benefit that the people in World War II have , " and they say it 's too expensive .
So I think the Republican Party is , you know , is , is on the block here to , to clearly demonstrate that they value military service or suffer the consequences of losing the support of people who've , who 've served .
MR. RUSSERT : The Pentagon , the administration and other editorials across the country have said the problem with the bill is that if , after three years people can leave with full benefits , it 'll be very difficult to retain good soldiers , to have them re-enlist .
SEN .
WEBB : Well , I , I would say to them that three years of accumulated service qualify you for the benefits , but you still have to serve your enlistment .
I spent five years in the Pentagon -- one as a Marine , four as a defense executive .
I did manpower issues the whole time ; I know how these formulas work .
We have , as co-sponsors on this bill , John Warner , former chairman of the Armed Services Committee ; Carl Levin , current chairman of the Armed Services committee ; Chairman Akaka of the Veterans committee ; Senator Specter , former chairman of the , the Veterans committee ; Chuck Hagel , the only senator to have served as a senior official in the Veterans Administration .
We know what we 're doing and , and we are not going to harm the military .
What you have is 70 to 75 percent of the ground troops in the , in the Army , in the Marine Corps , have left the service by the end of their first enlistment .
And those are the people that are not being taken care of .
The Department of Defense does a very good job of taking care of the , the career force , but this large number of people , the overwhelming majority of people who are out of the military , that come in because they love their country , they do a hitch and then they want to get on with their lives , they are not getting the opportunity for a first - class future that they deserve .
MR. RUSSERT : Will this bill , you think , if the president vetoes it , be an issue in the campaign ?
The presidential campaign ?
SEN .
WEBB : I , I would say the president really has a choice here and -- to , to show how much he values military service .
And if he were to veto this bill , I can't see how it would not become an issue in the campaign .
What we want to do is get a bill -- and I 've been , I 've been trying to keep the politics out of it .
I 've working -- been working really hard to keep the politics out of it .
We want to get a bill where Democrats and Republicans can come together .
And I 've , I 've listened to all the veterans ' organizations , I 've , I 've listened to other members of Congress and , and made modifications in this bill , and I think it 's a very fair bill .

Hillary Clinton denied leaking the photo of Barack Obama wearing a turban , but her campaign manager says that even if she had , it would be no big deal .
" Hillary Clinton has worn the traditional clothing of countries she has visited and had those photos published widely . "
Sure she did .
And George Bush put on a poncho in Santiago , while Paul Wolfowitz burned up YouTube with his anti-malarial African dance routines while World Bank president .
The obvious difference is this : when white politicians go ethnic , they look funny ; when a black presidential contender does it , he looks foreign - and when the ethnic apparel in question is vaguely reminiscent of the clothing worn by Iraqi and Afghan fighters ( at least to many Fox viewers , who think any headdress other than a baseball cap is a declaration of war on America ) , the image is downright frightening .
The turban " scandal " is all part of what is being referred to as " the Muslim smear " .
It includes everything from exaggerated enunciations of Obama 's middle name ( Hussein ) to the online whisper campaign that Obama attended a fundamentalist madrasa in Indonesia ( a lie ) , was sworn in on a Qur'an ( another lie ) , and if elected would attach speakers to the White House to broadcast the Muslim call to prayer ( I made that one up ) .
So far Obama 's campaign has responded with aggressive corrections that tout his Christian faith , attack the attackers and channel a cooperative witness before the House Un- American Activities Committee .
" Barack has never been a Muslim or practised any other faith besides Christianity , " states one fact sheet .
" I 'm not and never have been of the Muslim faith , " Obama told a Christian News reporter .
Of course Obama must correct the record , but he does n't have to stop there .
What is disturbing about the campaign 's response is that it leaves unchallenged the disgraceful and racist premise behind the entire " Muslim smear " : that being Muslim is de facto a source of shame .
Obama 's supporters often say they are being " Swift - boated " ( a pejorative term derived from the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign against the 2004 presidential candidate John Kerry ) , casually accepting the idea that being accused of Muslimhood is tantamount to being accused of treason .
Substitute another faith or ethnicity , and you 'd expect a very different response .
Consider a report from the archives of the Nation .
Thirteen years ago Daniel Singer , the magazine 's late Europe correspondent , went to Poland to cover a presidential election .
He reported that the race had descended into an ugly debate over whether one of the candidates , Aleksander Kwasniewski , was a closet Jew .
The press claimed his mother was buried in a Jewish cemetery ( she was still alive ) , and a popular TV show aired a skit featuring the Christian candidate dressed as a Hassidic Jew .
" What perturbed me , " Singer said , " was that Kwasniewski 's lawyers threatened to sue for slander rather than press for an indictment under the law condemning racist propaganda " .
We should expect no less of the Obama campaign .
When asked during the Ohio debate about Louis Farrakhan 's support for his candidacy , Obama did not hesitate to call Farrakhan 's antisemitic comments " unacceptable and reprehensible " .
When the turban photo flap came up in the same debate , he used the occasion to say nothing at all .
Farrakhan 's infamous comments about Jews took place 24 years ago .
The orgy of hate that is the " Muslim smear " is unfolding in real time , and it promises to greatly intensify in a general election .
These attacks do not simply " smear Barack 's Christian faith " , as John Kerry claimed in a campaign mailing .
They are an attack on all Muslims , some of whom actually do exercise their rights to cover their heads and send their kids to religious school .
Thousands even have the very common name Hussein .
All are watching their culture used as a crude bludgeon against Obama , while the candidate who is the symbol of racial harmony fails to defend them - this at a time when US Muslims are bearing the brunt of the Bush administration 's assaults on civil liberties , including dragnet wiretapping , and are facing a documented spike in hate crimes .
Occasionally , though not nearly enough , Obama says that Muslims are " deserving of respect and dignity " .
What he has never done is what Singer called for in Poland : denounce the attacks themselves as racist propaganda , in this case against Muslims .
The core of Obama 's candidacy is that he alone - having lived in Indonesia as a boy and with an African grandmother - can " repair the world " after the Bush wrecking ball .
That repair job begins with the 1.4 billion Muslims around the world , many convinced that the US has been waging a war against their faith .
This perception is based on facts , among them the fact that Muslim civilians are not counted among the dead in Iraq and Afghanistan ; that Islam has been desecrated in US - run prisons ; and that voting for an Islamist party resulted in collective punishment in Gaza .
It is also fuelled by the rise of a virulent strain of Islamophobia in Europe and North America .
As the most visible target of this rising racism , Obama has the power to be more than its victim .
He can use the attacks to begin the very process of global repair that is the most seductive promise of his campaign .
The next time he 's asked about his alleged Muslimness , Obama can respond not just by clarifying the facts but by turning the tables .
He can state that while a liaison with a pharmaceutical lobbyist may be worthy of scandalised exposure , being a Muslim is not .
Changing the terms of the debate this way is not only morally just but tactically smart - it 's the one response that could defuse these hateful attacks .
The best part is this : unlike ending the Iraq war and closing Guantánamo , standing up to Islamophobia does n't need to wait until after the election .
Obama can use his campaign to start now .
Let the repairing begin .

RELEASE : 08-103
NASA Statement on Student Asteroid Calculations
WASHINGTON -- The Near - Earth Object Program Office at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , has not changed its current estimates for the very low probability ( 1 in 45,000 ) of an Earth impact by the asteroid Apophis in 2036 .
Contrary to recent press reports , NASA offices involved in near - Earth object research were not contacted and have had no correspondence with a young German student , who claims the Apophis impact probability is far higher than the current estimate .
This student 's conclusion reportedly is based on the possibility of a collision with an artificial satellite during the asteroid 's close approach in April 2029 .
However , the asteroid will not pass near the main belt of geosynchronous satellites in 2029 , and the chance of a collision with a satellite is exceedingly remote .
Therefore , consideration of this satellite collision scenario does not affect the current impact probability estimate for Apophis , which remains at 1 in 45,000 .

Over time , East Berlin and West Berlin developed their separate airports .
Besides Tempelhof , Tegel grew in the former French sector .
With reunification , it was decided to mothball both Tegel and Tempelhof and consolidate the city ’s air traffic at a single site , Schönefeld .
Tempelhof ’s landmark building would be preserved for some use yet to be determined  a museum , offices ( nothing was definite , in typical Berlin fashion ) .
The goal was to attract more intercontinental flights and make Berlin more attractive to businesses .
Both main political parties , the conservative Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats , signed off on it .
Then delay followed delay in the way things do here .
What a glorious city Berlin is , and what a mess .
It is bankrupt and underpopulated .
Big companies like Sony , Samsung and Mercedes , enticed after reunification by subsidies intended to boost business , took advantage of the offers then skipped town .
Image Berlin plans to move all flights to Schönefeld , south of town .

The New York Times
There ’s no city plan worthy of a great capital , partly because of old , festering rivalries .
Years ago it was decided to demolish the Palace of the Republic , a 1970s bronzed glass - and - steel behemoth at the center of the old East Berlin .
West Berliners saw it as an eyesore that housed the loathed East German parliament .
East Berliners recalled it affectionately , because its clutch of theaters and bowling alleys and restaurants were where they could escape the drudgery of Communist life .
It ’s now to be replaced with a fake Baroque palace , a copy of the Hohenzollern schloss formerly on that site , which was bombed , then razed by the Communists  a forthcoming Potemkin village and a sad excuse for a showpiece in a city that prides itself on its cultural sophistication .
Fortunately , Berlin is now too broke to finish demolition , which has already taken longer and cost more than the building did to put up .
As for Tempelhof , the city ’s popular mayor , Klaus Wowereit , led the push to shut it immediately and not wait for Schönefeld ’s expansion .
This partly explains why Conservative opponents in town changed course and vigorously campaigned to save it .
They rallied nostalgic West Berliners .
The conservative Springer newspapers joined in .
So did Chancellor Angela Merkel .
America , with its shaky standing , became a subtle undercurrent in the debate .
Sonny Bono was Murdered by Hit Men in Assassination Plot
Shocking new allegations by a former FBI investigator claim thatwas not killed running into a tree in a skiing accident in Nevada in 1998 , but was actually clubbed to death by hired hit men .
Bono , who had a successful music career with ex-wife Cher , entered politics and served as mayor of Palm Springs , CA from 1988 - 1992 .
He was then elected to the House of Representatives in 1994 , representing California 's 44th District .
Investigator Bob Fletcher claims that he sent Bono evidence of a 10 - year study linking top U.S. government officials to arms and weapons dealers less than a month before his death .
According to Fletcher , " He was going to make it his number one priority ...
There 's no doubt in my mind Sonny was murdered by someone who needed him silenced . "
Former FBI agent Ted Gunderson agrees .
Gunderson , who has studied the evidence for the past decade believes Bono was assassinated by top officials linked to an international drug ring , who feared the singer - turned - politician was about to expose their crimes .
According to Gunderson , " It 's nonsense for anyone to now try to suggest that Bono died after crashing into a tree .
There 's zero evidence in this autopsy report ... to show such an accident happened .
Instead , there 's powerful proof he was assassinated .
" This was an evil plot that was carried out to almost perfection by ruthless assassins . "
Gunderson believes
Bono was ambushed by hired hit men who beat him to death , then staged the tree collision .
His claims have reportedly been backed up by top forensic experts who fear Nevada authorities were too quick to call the death a skiing accident .
Gunderson is calling for authorities to dig up Bono 's remains and open a homicide investigation .

Sceptics might suspect that the hand of Man has been at work .
But according to its owner , this remarkably - shaped root is entirely the product of Mother Nature .
The root , attached to a Chinese fleeceflower plant , shows a naked man and woman in all their glory with even the most intimate details in all the right places .
Scroll down for more ...
It appears just as it was when the plant was pulled from the ground , according to the man who spotted it on a vegetable stall in a town in China 's eastern Shandong province .
The man , named Fan , was so taken with his find he is said to have paid 600 yuan , more than £ 40 , to buy it .
Curious visitors now travel from miles around to see the foot - long veggie couple on display at his home .
The fleeceflower is a favourite dietary supplement in Asia where its boiled extract is believed to reduce cholesterol and fight heart disease .
The root is also sold as a diet food to help reduce obesity .
I ’ve ranted about this at length before , I ’m sure – even in print , in O’Reily ’s Open Sources 2 .
But now Debian have proved me right ( again ) beyond my wildest expectations .
Two years ago , they “ fixed ” a “ problem ” in OpenSSL reported by valgrind [ 1 ] by removing any possibility of adding any entropy to OpenSSL ’s pool of randomness [ 2 ] .
The result of this is that for the last two years ( from Debian ’s “ Etch ” release until now ) , anyone doing pretty much any crypto on Debian ( and hence Ubuntu ) has been using easily guessable keys .
This includes SSH keys , SSL keys and OpenVPN keys .
What can we learn from this ?
Firstly , vendors should not be fixing problems ( or , really , anything ) in open source packages by patching them locally – they should contribute their patches upstream to the package maintainers .
Had Debian done this in this case , we ( the OpenSSL Team ) would have fallen about laughing , and once we had got our breath back , told them what a terrible idea this was .
But no , it seems that every vendor wants to “ add value ” by getting in between the user of the software and its author .
Secondly , if you are going to fix bugs , then you should install this maxim of mine firmly in your head : never fix a bug you do n’t understand .
I ’m not sure I ’ve ever put that in writing before , but anyone who ’s worked with me will have heard me say it multiple times .
Incidentally , while I am talking about vendors who are bad for security , it saddens me to have to report that FreeBSD , my favourite open source operating system , are also guilty .
Not only do they have local patches in their ports system that should clearly be sent upstream , but they also install packages without running the self - tests .
This has bitten me twice by installing broken crypto , most recently in the py - openssl package .
[ 1 ] Valgrind is a wonderful tool , I recommend it highly .
[ 2 ] Valgrind tracks the use of uninitialised memory .
Usually it is bad to have any kind of dependency on uninitialised memory , but OpenSSL happens to include a rare case when its OK , or even a good idea : its randomness pool .
Adding uninitialised memory to it can do no harm and might do some good , which is why we do it .
It does cause irritating errors from some kinds of debugging tools , though , including valgrind and Purify .
For that reason , we do have a flag ( PURIFY ) that removes the offending code .
However , the Debian maintainers , instead of tracking down the source of the uninitialised memory instead chose to remove any possibility of adding memory to the pool at all .
Clearly they had not understood the bug before fixing it .
P.S. I ’d link to the offending patch in Debian ’s source repository .
If I could find a source repository .
But I can’t .
( Update )
Thanks to Cat Okita , I have now found the repo .
Here ’s the offending patch .
But I have to admit to being astonished again by the fix , which was committed five days before the advisory !
Do these guys have no clue whatsoever ?
Because being reasonable people has pushed us to the fringes of an unreasonable society .
Even today modern wonders of engineering like the Eiffel Tower and the Golden Gate Bridge inspire awe ( and songs and works of art ) .
A quick look at their origins , however , can turn awe to amazement and astonishment .
Each of the five projects listed here took their toll financially and were paid for in part with human lives .
Some cost more than the GDP of a small country to construct and others were completed with tens of thousands of people lost in the process .
A few were predicted centuries before their time and others were attempted multiple times and faced numerous setbacks before they could be completed .
The Panama Canal is undoubtedly one of the most complex , costly , and difficult engineering projects ever undertaken .
As early as the 1550s there was talk of creating such a canal to create a vital waterway for speedier trade between the Americas .
However , it was n’t until over three centuries later that a serious attempt was made to build it .
An initial effort by the French in the 1880s was given up after over 20,000 workers lost their lives to disaster and disease .
Under subsequent American leadership systems were devised to transport soil away by rail and properly house workers for safety and health purposes though thousands of Americans also lost their lives before the canal was completed in the early 1900s .
The Eiffel Tower is one of the most known and beloved monumental structures of the world , yet it was never intended to be .
Designed for a world ’s fair in the late 1800s the tower was intended to be a demonstration of modern engineering , not an object of lasting beauty , and was supposed to be deconstructed following the event .
Amazingly , just 300 were needed to assemble 18,000 parts on site with 2.5 million rivets – and only one person perished in the construction process .
Parisians at the time were shocked , dismayed and outraged at this bare metal structure towering the sky – a structure that has since become the primary symbol of Paris .
The Golden Gate Bridge had , at the time of its creation , the longest span of any suspension bridge in the world .
With estimates at over 100 million dollars a bridge was deemed unfeasible in this location for many years before one daring engineer promised it could be done for 17 million .
One of the engineers of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge ( a bridge infamous for its collapse ) worked on the project – fortunately he did a better job with the Golden Gate .
In the end , the construction came in just barely under budget and only 11 workers died during the creation of this massive and innovative bridge .
As with the Eiffel Tower and Paris , the Golden Gate Bridge was widely considered ugly at the time but is now a universal symbol of San Francisco .
The Zuiderzee Works are an amazing feat of modern engineering constructed to protect The Netherlands from flooding as well as to create over a half million acres of usable farmland .
Plans for the construction of this project date back to the 1700s but it was n’t until a severe flood in the early 1900s that these plans were set in motion .
Once the area was dammed off work began on pumping water out of certain areas to create usable land .
One of these areas was even created during World War II and was used by the resistance as a hiding place .
All in all an estimated 200 million square feet of sand was used and over 4,000 workers were employed daily in the construction of this immense water - retention system that at parts measures up to 300 feet thick at the level of the surrounding water and resists tremendous water pressures .
The Channel Tunnel ( aka The Chunnel ) is a relatively recent work of engineering genius .
Completed in 1994 , the Chunnel was ( amazingly ) first envisioned nearly 200 years prior as a means for horse - drawn carriages to cross between France and England .
Even though it was built with modern safety standards the tunnel still cost the lives of 10 workers – only one fewer than the Golden Gate Bridge generations prior .
The tunnel was bored with a dozen drilling machines and sits on average nearly 150 feet below the water above .
A ‘ pilot ’ service hole was drilled to test soil conditions before secondary drills could completely carved out spaces .

A ram -raider who smashed his way into a supermarket wearing only a sheet and a pair of his girlfriend 's boots has been jailed for four years .
David Ball , 32 , was arrested shortly after his buttocks were caught on CCTV by surveillance cameras in the store .
The drunken thief stole his girlfriend 's Renault Clio from her driveway to smash through the shop 's security shutters .
Scroll down for more ...
Caught on camera : David Ball rammed his way into the shop using his girlfiend 's car before climbing through the gap wearing just her Ugg boots and a sheet
He was then filmed dashing through the mangled metal grille wearing " nothing more than a bed sheet and a pair of girlfriend 's Ugg boots " , prosecutors told Birmingham Crown Court .
Once inside the Co-op branch in Balsall Common , near Solihull , Ball broke into a cigarette machine and stole around £ 1,500 of cigarettes .
This was on top of the £ 10,000 worth of damage he caused by smashing into the metal shutters .
Scroll down for more ...
Cheeky :
The surveillance cameras catch a glimpse of Ball 's bare behind as he makes off with £ 1,500 worth of cigarettes
In video shown to the court , he could be seen squeezing back through the gap and exposing his bottom to the CCTV cameras before returning to the car with his spoils .
He then led police on a high - speed car chase , reaching 80 mph in a built - up 40 mph zone and dodging a police " stinger " before crashing into two parked cars and spinning to a halt .
When arrested , Ball , of St Nicholas Avenue , Kenilworth , Warwickshire , said he " had been asleep in the back seat and knew nothing about the theft " .
He was found to be about two and a half times the legal alcohol limit .

Pursuit : Ball led police on a high - speed chase through Solihull before he crashed .
He then told officers he had been asleep in the back of the vehicle during the raid
Later , in a police interview , he said he had no recollection of his actions in the early hours of April 16 this year , but on seeing the CCTV footage " accepted that it was him " .
Thomas Kenning , defending , said : " It was an unusual offence , to say the least . "
The court heard that Ball , who has fought a drug addiction for years , had committed a string of previous offences including " between 50 and 60 " thefts .
Judge John Cavell said that Ball , who wore a T - shirt and jeans , had a " serious criminal record of offences of robbery , theft , wounding and aggravated vehicle taking " .
He told Ball : " You took another motor vehicle and , from the video that the court has seen , used that car in what is colloquially called a ram - raid . "
Ball , he said , showed considerable persistence and determination to break into the premises .
The judge went on : " You drove in such a way it 's fortunate that nobody was injured or killed . "
Ball was sentenced to four years , having previously pleaded guilty to burglary , aggravated vehicle taking , drink - driving and driving with no insurance or licence .
He was also sentenced to serve a further 51 weeks , to run consecutively , for breaching two suspended sentences , and was disqualified from driving for three years .
The court heard that the defendant decided - in advance of his first child 's birth next January - to tell police of various other offences for which they had no evidence that he was the culprit .
The offences were taken into consideration in passing sentence .
Using a scientific framework to identify the world ’s most Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered ( EDGE ) species , the EDGE of Existence programme highlights and protects some of the weirdest and most wonderful species on the planet .
This is a list of the top 10 .
10 . Pygmy hippopotamus
The pygmy hippo is a solitary animal that lives among dense vegetation along streams and swamps and in the rainforests of West Africa .
It sometimes lives in cultivated areas , but the pygmy hippo is shy : it avoids people , as well as other hippos .
Each hippo has its own territory .
The male ’s territory is larger than the female ’s ; both mark their territorial boundaries with their droppings .
The pygmy hippo feeds mainly when it is dark .
It spends most of the day resting within its territory .
It changes resting places once or twice a week .
9 . Attenborough ’s long - beaked echidna
This animal is one of three species from the genus Zaglossus to occur in New Guinea .
It is named in honour of Sir David Attenborough .
It was considered extinct until recent expeditions have discovered tracks and locals have reported seeing the creature .
8. Bactrian camel
An imposing animal , the Bactrian camel can reach seven feet in height and weigh up to 1,500 pounds .
The species ’ thick , brown coat changes with the seasons .
During winter , it thickens to provide added insulation against the cold while large chunks of fur are shed in the summer to keep the animal cool .
Both male and female Bactrian camels have two large humps on their backs .
The Bactarian camel is endangered due to loss of habitat .
7. Yangtze River dolphin
This dolphin , also called a Baiji , is a freshwater dolphin found only in the Yangtze River in China .
Unfortunately it has already reached the conservation status of Critically endangered – possibly extinct .
Fossil records suggest that the dolphin first appeared 25 million years ago and migrated from the Pacific Ocean to the Yangtze River 20 million years ago .
6. Slender loris
The slender loris is a small , nocturnal primate found only in the tropical rainforests of Southern India and Sri Lanka .
They are able to live in wet and dry forests , as well as lowland and highland forests .
They prefer thick , thorny vegetation wherein they can easily escape predators and find the large assortment of insects that is the mainstay of their diet .
The Indian government has laws protecting the slender loris , but its effect is difficult to gage .
5. Hirola antelope
This antelope has recently become very rare , with current censuses reporting fewer than 400 individuals .
Only one hirola exists in captivity : an aging female at the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville , Texas .
It is a relic species , and only exists today ( barely ) due to its unique habitat requirements .
Another name for this antelope is the “ four - eyed antelope ” , due to its pronounced , dark - colored preorbital glands , which are enlarged when excited .
4. Bumblebee bat
The Bumblebee bat competes with the Etruscan pygmy shrew for the title of world ’s smallest mammal .
These bats are so - named since they ’re about the size of a bumblebee , weigh about as much as a dime , and have the ability to hover like hummingbirds .
Their roosting habitat consists of the hot upper chambers of caves in limestone hills .
Bumblebee bats are are now considered one of the twelve most endangered species on the planet .
3. Golden - rumped elephant shrew
The Golden - rumped elephant shrew is the largest of all the unique African family , the elephant shrews .
It is the size of a small rabbit , and is only found in the coastal Arabuko Sokoke National Park north of Mombassa in Kenya .
It is classified as endangered because of its highly restricted and fragmented environment ; it is also hunted for food and by feral dogs .
2. Hispaniolan solenodon
Hispaniolan solenodon , also known as the Haitian Solenodon or Agouta , is a solenodon only found on the island of Hispaniola , shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic , and was unknown to science until 1833 .
Currently , the solenodon may only be surviving in only two places in the Dominican Republic : Jaragua and Del Este National Parks and La Visite National Park in neighboring Haiti .
Its presence in Los Haitises National Park in the Dominican Republic is inferred but unconfirmed .
1. Long -eared jerboa
The Long - eared Jerboa , is a nocturnal mouse - like rodent with a long tail , long hind legs for jumping , and exceptionally large ears .
It is distinct enough that authorities consider it to be the only member of both its genus , Euchoreutes , and subfamily , Euchoreutinae .
In 2007 Zoological Society of London sent a researcher to study human impact on its environment .
The study returned with video footage that been noted as the “ first time ” the creature has been “ recorded on camera ” .
This has helped to start a campaign to protect them .
With all this talk of those kids who found the parachute that might be D.B. Cooper 's , it 's made me think about people who have randomly disappeared .
I think it 's such a fascinating topic – and other people must too , or we would n't still be talking about people such as Amelia Earhart and Mr. Cooper today .
In that spirit , I 've found ( not literally , of course ) a few people whose disappearances have kept us guessing over the years .
I know there are ( sadly ) plenty out there , but I tried to pick some of the vanishings I found most intriguing .
Virginia Dare , 1587
Virginia
Dare is just one of the many people ( 87 men , 17 women and 11 children , to be exact ) from the island of Roanoke who disappeared without a trace .
What 's notable about Virginia , though , is that she was the first child of English parents to be born in the Americas .
In fact , it is Virginia 's grandfather , John White , who discovered that the colony was missing .
In 1587 , John sailed back to England for supplies and assistance for the colony .
When he returned in 1590 , everything was gone except for the infamous " CROATOAN " carved on a tree .
Virginia is gone but not forgotten , though .
Dare County , N.C. is named after her , as is the Virginia Dare Memorial Bridge that spans the Croatan Sound .
Roanoke Island celebrates Virginia 's birthday every year with an Elizabethan Renaissance Fair .
Her legend has also been the subject of many imaginative writers – a couple of novels have her meeting Pocahontas and John Smith .
The Daughter of Virginia Dare even portrays her as Pocahontas ' mother .
A 1965 novel titled Dare , Virginia and the other Lost Colonists have all of the Roanoke residents being abducted by aliens and settling on a planet called Dare .
In the Buffyverse , Virginia Dare is a vampire slayer known as the White Doe .
The T.B. show Freakylinks shows us a demon Virginia who destroyed the other colonists .
The picture above , by the way , is a map of the Roanoke area by John White .
Can you believe no pictures of Virginia Dare from 1587 exist ?
( that 's a joke )
Theodosia Burr Alston , 1812
Theodosia was the daughter of Vice President Aaron Burr .
She led a pretty charmed life until 1812 – prior to that , she was widely known as the most educated American woman of the day , she married a wealthy land owner and politician and had a son named after her father .
In 1812 , though , Theodosia was exhausted from appealing to people on her father 's behalf .
He was acquitted of treason but decided it would be best to spend some time in Europe .
Theo was arranging for his 1812 return when her son died .
She was still recovering from the shock of that when she boarded the Patriot in the Georgetown , S.C. harbor to meet her father in New York .
That was n't to happen , though – after boarding the ship , neither it nor Theodosia were ever seen again .
Of course , most theories say that the boat went down in a storm .
But some legends say the Patriot was captured by pirates , who made Theo and her shipmates walk the plank .
Another version of this is that Theo was forced to become a pirate 's mistress .
The least believable of the theories , though , is the one that involves a Karankawa Indian chief .
He supposedly found a ship wrecked on the shore and found Theo , chained to a bulkhead and naked except for a gold locket engraved with her name .
He rescued her and she told him that she was the daughter of a very important man and that if the chief ever came across white men , he should give him the locket and explain what happened .
She gave him her necklace and promptly died .
Benjamin Briggs and the passengers and crew of the Mary Celeste , 1872
Not that a missing ship is anything to be blasé about , but it was n't uncommon before modern technology was able to track ships .
The Mary Celeste is interesting , though , because the ship was found – minus its passengers .
The Mary Celeste might have been cursed from the very beginning - the first captain died on her maiden voyage .
She was launched on her last voyage on November 5 , 1872 , from Staten Island to Genoa , Italy .
A month later the captain of the Dei Gratia , who knew Captain Benjamin Briggs , spotted the Mary Celeste drifting along toward the Strait of Gibraltar .
Although the ship was just drifting , no distress signals were flying .
Some of the Dei Gratia 's crew went to the Mary Celeste in a small boat and boarded it .
It was wet , but in good condition .
The lifeboat was missing and looked like it was intentionally launched .
A six - month supply of food and water had been left behind , along with all of the ship 's paperwork except for the captain 's log .
The most plausible theory stems from the cargo the Mary Celeste had on board – more than 1,000 barrels of alcohol .
When the abandoned ship was unloaded , nine of these barrels were found empty .
The theory is that when the cargo hold was opened , the nine leaking barrels resulted in a rush of fumes that lead the captain to believe the ship was going to explode .
He basically freaked out , ordered everyone into a lifeboat and forgot to secure the lifeboat to the ship ( or the line broke ) .
Another theory is that the crew drank the alcohol , murdered the Captain and stole the lifeboat to escape .
Flannan Isles Lighthouse Keepers , 1900
In December of 1900 , the lighthouse keepers on the Flannan Isles off the coast of Scotland vanished .
It was first noted when a steamer passed the lighthouse on December 15 and noticed the light was n't working .
This was reported , but apparently nothing was done until the relief keeper and a crew with provisions went to the lighthouse on December 26 .
When no one came out to greet them , they entered the lighthouse and found the entrance gate and main door both closed , the beds unmade , the clock stopped and an overturned chair in the kitchen .
The island was thoroughly searched for the men and any clues as to their whereabouts , but the only thing that was found was some damage done by a storm .
Although this might seem like a clue , the log left by the keepers showed that it happened before they disappeared .
The Northern Lighthouse Board concluded that the men had drowned and been swept out to sea .
Rumors , though , had one keeper murdering the other two , then drowning himself out of guilt .
A sea serpent was also a possibility , along with the prospect that they had been abducted by spies or attacked by a boat full of ghosts ( the lifeboat full of the Mary Celeste crew , maybe ? ) .

Dorothy Arnold , 1910
Imagine the media frenzy if Paris Hilton went for a walk in L.A. and disappeared forever ( we can dream , right ? ) .
That 's just what happened when Manhattan socialite Dorothy Arnold went for a stroll in Central Park ( supposedly ) on December 12 , 1910 .
Dorothy was the daughter of a wealthy perfume importer and the niece of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court .
Earlier that year , she had spent a week with a man that could have caused some embarrassment to the Arnold family , so instead of reporting her missing , her dad conducted his own investigation through the Pinkertons .
Six weeks later , he gave in and called the police .
The man she had been seeing , George Griscom , Jr. , thought she might have committed suicide after her writing was rejected from a magazine .
Friends thought she killed herself because Griscom would n't marry her .
And her dad thought she had been abducted in Central Park .
Another rumor circulated that she had gotten pregnant and died during a botched abortion .
So far , no one knows the truth for sure – no evidence of any sort has ever turned up .

Amelia Earhart , 1937
Set on circumnavigating the globe , Amelia Earhart took off in her Electra from Miami with navigator Fred Noonan on June 1 , 1937 .
After numerous stops , they ended up in Lae , New Guinea on June 29 .
They had completed a good chunk of their trip – about 22,000 miles .
Only 7,000 miles remained of the fateful journey .
On July 2 , the pair headed for Howland Island , which is where the trip took a turn for the worse : they fell out of contact and disappeared .
Search efforts began only an hour after Amelia 's last communication .
Obviously , they were never found , despite a huge search effort involving $ 4 million , the Navy and the Coast Guard .
Their efforts included a search of Gardner Island ( now Nikumaroro ) which had been uninhabited for more than four decades .
Since then , artifacts have been uncovered on Nikumaroro including a piece of clear Plexiglass with the exact thickness and curvature as an Electra window and a size nine shoe that looked like the shoes Amelia wore .
We have to look at some of the theories surrounding her disappearance – they 're pretty interesting .
Many thought she was perhaps a spy for FDR and the Japanese had something to do with her disappearance .
For instance , in 1966 , a CBS correspondent published a book that said Amelia and Fred were captured and executed when they crashed on Saipan Island .
Another book was published including a daughter from a Japanese officer who claimed her father had executed Amelia himself .
A former Marine said that he and his fellow soldiers had opened a safe in Saipan , only to find Amelia 's briefcase .
Another Marine said he actually guarded the plane in 1944 and then watched it being destroyed .
One author even claimed that Amelia actually completed the flight , returned to the U.S. and began living under an assumed name – Irene Bolam .
The real Irene Bolam sued for $ 1.5 million and swore that she was not Amelia Earhart .
Studies since then have shown that she was telling the truth .
D.B. Cooper , 1971
Just in case you have n't heard the D.B.
Cooper story , here 's a little recap .
In November 1971 , D.B. Cooper ( AKA Dan Cooper , neither of which are his real name ) hijacked a plane , demanded a ransom of $ 200,000 , and jumped out of the aircraft after he received it .
He has never been found , but a few clues have popped up over the years .
In 1980 , a little boy found nearly $ 6,000 in rotting $ 20 bills on the banks of the Columbia River , which is in the area of where Cooper jumped .
In 2007 , the FBI announced that they were able to get some DNA from a tie Cooper left on the plane .
And , most recently , some kids found an old parachute buried near Amboy , Washington .
The FBI does n't think Cooper survived the flight – when he jumped out , the plane was going through a bad storm with lots of cloud coverage .
More than 400 troops from Fort Lewis helped survey the area on foot for any trace of Cooper , but no one found even a shred of evidence .
Although the $ 20 bills given to Cooper were unmarked , the FBI was careful to assign a certain range of serial numbers .
A newspaper in Portland offered $ 1,000 to the first person who could bring in one of these bills , hoping that Cooper was spending them , but not one ever turned up .
If GOP Wants To Govern Like Dems , Why Have a Separate Party ?
Republicans are and should be panicked over the fact that conservative Democrat Travis Childers just defeated Republican Greg Davis by a margin of 54 % - 46 % in the race for a vacant Mississippi congressional seat .
That seat is in a conservative district that had given President Bush a 25 - point margin of victory over John Kerry in 2004 - it never should have flipped Democrat .
This is the third double - digit loss in a row for Republican candidates in conservative districts across the United States .
Childers ' victory came one week after Rep. Don Cazayoux won a House seat in the Baton Rouge , La. , area that had been in Republican hands for three decades .
Over the winter , Rep. Bill Foster won an election in Illinois to succeed former House Speaker Dennis Hastert , who had been in Congress more than 20 years .
What we 're watching is the culmination of the decade - plus deterioration of the conservative Republican brand .
Put simply , no one , including base conservatives , trusts the Republicans to govern effectively while following anything even faintly resembling a conservative platform .
That 's unfortunate , since the only time that the Republicans really took the country by storm was in 1994 , when they all ran on a set of firm , well established conservative values and issues .
When the GOP strayed from that , falling back on the Democratic Party tradition of retaining power through excessive pork barrel spending and questionable ethical practices , they first lost seats - then lost their majorities .
To regain what they have thrown away they must return to those conservative principles .
If successful , they then must reject the compromising allure of power and promise to govern in the future as conservatives , not as the Democratic Party Lite .
Pollsters such as Gallup and the Pew Foundation have measured the voters ' party identification for decades .
Concurrent with the GOP 's move away from conservative governing principals has been the increase in voters ' self - identification as either being a Democrat or someone who leans Democrat , with a comparable decrease in self - identification with the Republicans .
Is that merely because of changing demographics , as many political scientists suggest ?
Or is it because there have been no national leaders that continually challenge the Democrats on an ideological basis and promote widespread conservatism in the Republican ranks ?
The last nationally recognized GOP leader that did that was Newt Gingrich - ten years ago .
Without such leadership , without such an enunciated conservative agenda for people to believe in , without a Republican Party that does what it promises , is it not natural for voters to wander - looking for something else to believe ?
The aforementioned disparity between self - identified Democrats and Republicans does n't fully explain the losses suffered by the GOP in 2006 .
The Dems had to run conservatives to win their majority that year .
They had to run conservatives to win the three most recent House special elections .
Is n't the natural home of many of those voters who elected conservative Democrats really the Republican Party , rather than the party of Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid , and Barack Obama ?
The GOP 's problems have gotten so bad that even a prominent national conservative , Sean Hannity , is now publicly speaking of his plan to leave the GOP and re-register in New York 's Conservative Party .
That conservatism is no longer an effective belief system and governing method for the Republicans is becoming a self - fulfilling prophecy .
Without anyone in the GOP publicly promoting conservative ideology and a true conservative agenda as a solution to our problems , how do we know that it wo n't work ?
When it 's been tried in the past , it 's attracted enthusiastic supporters and voters - and been quite successful .
Waiting for another Ronald Reagan is foolish - he was one of a kind .
But there are new conservative leaders on the horizon , such as Governor Bobby Jindal of Louisiana .
The problem is that up and coming national leaders like Jindal are in the future , not present .
The current GOP leadership is merely treading water .
The House Leadership just announced their " new " message in the wake of the GOP 's special election losses : " Change You Deserve " .
Unfortunately , their message sounds suspiciously similar to the message that the Democrats used to win in 2006 and are working on today .
And lost upon the Republican leadership is the irony that the faces behind their latest " change " are the same faces that " changed " the GOP from the majority party to the minority two years ago .
Voters will recognize that .
The national GOP has fallen for the media lie that voters across America want a ' moderate ' , as opposed to a conservative , Republican Party .
Unfortunately , that 's also the philosophy behind the Presidential campaign of John McCain .
McCain might very well become the next President , but it will be more because of the inadequacies of his opponent than any wellspring of support for his governing philosophy or ideology .
This moderation trend is nothing new , nor is the Republicans ' refusal to deal with it .
By their actions , or inactions , the Republican leadership has permitted the Democrats and the media to define down the GOP , recreating the word " conservative " as a pejorative .
Think family values and the image is of Mark Foley and Vito Fossella .
Think wasteful pork barrel and earmark spending - and the image is of Ted Stevens .
Think corruption and the public thinks Randy Cunningham .
Think " against tax cuts " and the image is of ... John McCain .
All of these issues define the Republicans as a party that promises to both reform government and to address the major problems that the country faces today , but delivers no more and acts no better than Democrats .
As such , are we supposed to be surprised that the voters would rather have the real Democrats , rather than the fake ?
Republicans , and conservatives in particular , wo n't be able to benefit much from their Presidential candidate 's coattails this year either .
For an example , just look at Senator McCain 's newly launched climate change tour .
In a national poll conducted by Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg released earlier this month , only 4 % of respondents replied that the environment as a whole was one of the most important issues in this election .
More surprisingly , only 6 % of Democrats thought so !
So why is McCain so focused on climate change ?
Because it is one of the mainstream media 's pet issues , and McCain is trying to get in the media 's good graces again .
By doing so , and prominently embracing issues that the Democrats own nationwide , McCain feels that he 'll attract some swing votes .
That 's not going to work .
The media will never be in John McCain 's corner during a Presidential general election , no matter how hard he tries .
They will be firmly in Obama 's back pocket , and will be the primary enablers for Howard Dean 's upcoming vicious attack machine against McCain .
And the voters who view global warming as a major election issue ?
They 're so far Left that they 'll be repulsed from voting for McCain by his other stances on issues such as the War in Iraq .
So what other good might come of John McCain 's tack to the left ?
Will his road to ' moderation ' help Republicans overall this fall ?
To answer that , I 'll just relay something that Fox News ' Carl Cameron said in his report from 5/13/08 on Brit Hume 's show about McCain 's global warming tour .
Cameron quoted a McCain aide on the candidate 's plan to distance himself from the GOP and President Bush by Election Day :
... By the time the November elections come around , it 'll be hard to tell that they were even in the same party .
Seeing as this statement was made in the context of the Senator 's climate change tour , it 's safe to assume that McCain is n't talking about moving the image of the party to the right .
How that will serve to help other Republicans this fall escapes me , unless McCain 's real plan is to remake the party in the image of himself and former politicians like former Rhode Island Senator Lincoln Chafee and former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman .
While that does take care of most ethical issues , it throws the rest of Republican conservatism under the bus .
If he does that , the GOP will be in the minority for generations to come .
McCain will be all over the map this fall - conservative on some important issues like the war and judges , but liberal on other issues such as the global warming , immigration , and perhaps even taxes .
The past few years has shown that such vacillation - such an inability to enunciate a clear set of conservative governing principles across the policy spectrum - might work for an individual GOP candidate here and there , but represents disaster for the overall political party .
John McCain might win this crucially important Presidential election , since the alternative would be disastrous for the United States and the world .
The war issue alone , and the ramifications worldwide and domestically if we should lose , should be enough to bring the conservative base out to vote for the Senator in an election that many of them might otherwise be tempted to skip .
But the message so far from McCain to down - ballot Republicans this fall is clear : " Do n't expect any help from me , unless you are prepared to repudiate much of your conservative beliefs " .
That 's not the way for the GOP to rebuild the party .
And that 's certainly not the way for the GOP to win .
Many supporters say that such gestures are not the final gasp of a failed political campaign , but a spark for a “ revolution . ”
And Mr. Paul encourages such talk .
When he speaks or writes of revolution , the congressman means it in the 1776 sense , except that the oppressors now live in Washington , not London .
The candidate wants to turn back what he sees as 200 years of creeping expansion of federal power , dissolve the Federal Reserve and the Internal Revenue Service , return to the gold standard , bring the troops home , not just from Iraq , but from everywhere  and yes , legalize pot , at least for medical purposes .

This message has hit home  not only with some traditional libertarians , but also among a small but passionate group of young voters who came of age after Sept. 11 , during the debates about the Iraq war , the Patriot Act and Abu Ghraib .
For them , the Ron Paul message has the feel not of 1776 , but of 1968 , when an unpopular war raged abroad , and a subculture of disenfranchised young people embraced an unorthodox philosophy built around a utopian ideal of freedom .
Of course , Ron Paul is a lot closer to Barry Goldwater than to Eugene McCarthy .
But his young supporters , many of whom call themselves former liberals , said the peacenik left shares much with the libertarian right .
“ It ’s about taking the country back , ” Mr. Lim said , waving off the policy differences between his old “ political saint , ” Mr. Nader , and his new one , who is anti-Roe ( Mr. Paul opposes abortion personally , but thinks states should decide the issue ) and supports gun rights .
“ Whether you believe in abortion or not , in guns or not , that ’s not the point , ” Mr. Lim said .
“ It ’s about the way the country is going : to hell in a handbasket . ”
Mr. Paul ’s voters tend to be younger and angrier than most Republicans .
Exit polls in New Hampshire , South Carolina and Michigan by Edison / Mitofsky showed that Mr. Paul ’s voters tended to strongly disapprove of the Iraq war , and hold a far more negative opinion of the Bush administration than other Republican voters do .
In Michigan , where Mr. Paul received 6 percent of the vote , 34 percent of Paul voters were under 30 , compared with 13 percent of voters there over all .
( Mr. Paul is also , largely , a guy thing .
In the New Hampshire primary , where the candidate received 8 percent of the vote , his support was 77 percent male , according to exit polls . )
With young voters comes youthful enthusiasm .
“ This is the message of the Beatles , the Dylans of the world , ” said Marc Scibilia , a 21 - year - old songwriter from Buffalo , referring to Mr. Paul ’s platform .
Mr. Scibilia posted a video of his Paul - themed song , “ Hope Anthem , ” on YouTube , and this summer he will lead a 28 - city “ Freedom Tour ” featuring other musicians .
Mr. Paul ’s message of freedom and peace is “ an ancient message  it inspired people in the 60s and 70s , ” Mr. Scibilia said .
“ I want to bring back that era of magic . ”

The debate over changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act — the legal framework governing how agencies like the NSA conduct wiretaps — is typically framed as a contest between the competing values of security and privacy .
But in an article published in the latest issue of IEEE Security & Privacy , a team of top network security experts argue that large - scale digital surveillance creates new security risks and vulnerabilities as well .
" The US , " the authors warn , " could build for its opponents something that would be too expensive for them to build for themselves : a system that lets them see the US ’s intelligence interests , a system that could tell them how to thwart those interests , and a system that might be turned to intercept the communications of American citizens and institutions . "
The legal changes being fought out in Congress are meant to facilitate a series of architectural changes in the way foreign intel surveillance is conducted .
As strictly foreign communications increasingly pass over American fiber on their way to their destinations , intel professionals hope that intercepts once carried out abroad can now be performed from the convenience of a domestic switching office .
And while the word " wiretap " may evoke images out of the film The Lives of Others — headphone - clad Ulrich Mühe sitting in an attic fastening alligator clips to copper wire — modern surveillance will increasingly entail not targeting particular lines of communication , but rather sifting through vast amounts of telecom data by computer in order to flag calls and e-mails of potential interest .
This may mean , among other things , using databases of information - rich Call Data Records to identify target calling patterns , so that subjects can be pinpointed even if they change phones .
The problem , the authors argue , is that everything that makes an electronic surveillance system convenient for intel agencies also makes it a more attractive target for hostile outsiders or corrupt insiders .
Surveillance systems located , not at the border or at international cable heads , but at U.S. telecom hubs — systems like the one retired AT&T engineer Mark Klein describes seeing at the company 's San Francisco office — can also more easily pick up the purely domestic communications apt to be valuable to intruders .
And where once intel agencies working with domestic telecom firms would have been presenting specific requests to acquire particular communications , they are now themselves likely to be doing not only the analysis of recorded conversations , but the filtering as well , which will involve aggregating still more juicy , info - rich databases .
And more centralized storage of sensitive data creates both powerful incentives to attempt a breach and the risk of serious harm if one occurs .
A realistic threat
The threat of enemy hackers gaining control of lawful wiretap architecture may sound like fodder for a Hollywood thriller , but in fact , it has already happened .
In Greece in 2004 , parties still unknown gained access to legitimately - installed surveillance software on the country 's Vodafone cell network .
For ten months , the intruders were able to listen in on " cell phones belonging to the prime minister and ministers of defense , foreign affairs , justice , and public order — as well as opposition members in the Greek parliament . "
It would be nice to believe U.S. security is tighter , but the authors point to some cause for concern even in the little publicly available information about intel surveillance :
They describe the auditing system for the FBI 's DCS - 3000 wiretap system as " primitive , " noting that it relies on passwords for authentication , uses shared rather than user - specific logins , and employs the outdated MD5 hashing algorithm .
The authors offer a series of recommendations to reduce the security risks posed by surveillance .
Intercepts should be carried out at locations less likely to gather purely - domestic traffic , even when this is less convenient than picking up communications at backbone routers , and irrelevant information should be screened out before any more centralized processing is done .
Telecom providers should , when possible , act as intermediaries between intel analysts and data .
And independent oversight should be imposed to reduce the likelihood of both abuse and error .

Are Animals Easier to Potty Train Than Kids ?
Ever since the prissy kitty Mr. Jinx used the toilet in the movie  Meet the Parents ,  and Jim Carry had his dog potty trained in  Bruce All Mighty ,  toilet training animals has become more popular .
Just about any animal that can be trained , in any way , is a candidate for potty training .
This Would Make Jinxy Cat Proud
Thanks to their small size and agility , cats are probably one of the easiest animals to potty train .
Full training will usually take about one month ( not too bad compared to the three to six months it takes to potty train a child ) .
One month of patience and a little bit of effort can leave you litter and smell free .
Home Training , Step - by - Step
There are several different ways to toilet train a cat .
Many online stores offer toilet training kits , which are usually over priced .
This video shows one home training method step by step : Modified Toilet Lets this Poodle Potty Dogs are not as easy to work with as cats , but still have the ability to be toilet trained as shown by this cute mini poodle : Wild ?
Yes .
Gross ?
Pretty Much Potty training doesnt stop at traditional domestic animals .
According to her owner , this bobcat named Ginger taught herself how to use the toilet .
Now , if only Ginger can resist the urge to step into the toilet ... and most importantly , stop drinking from the toilet .
Ratapouille
Most rats dont leave their droppings in your toilet , as this polite pouched rat named Matisse does .
Potty - Bellied Pig
Although it may be slightly more awkward , even oversized animals can be taught to use a toilet .
This pig had no trouble at all :
If you Build it , they will GO !
If the animal is really just too big or clumsy , or produces massive amounts of poo , you can always build them a special toilet of their own .
The first elephant toilet was recently built in Thailand for a five - year old elephant named Diew .
He uses the contraption several times a day and never forgets to flush !
We deal with helping a lot of parents facing the tough task of potty training stubborn children , but even so , the thought of a stubborn bobcat or elephant seems slightly more daunting !

Did Canadian President of Scientology Implicitly Threaten Protester ?!
Posted by RB on May 11 , 2008 · 20 Comments
Here is a video of “ Reverend ” Yvette Shank , President of the “ Church ” of Scientology Canada , speaking to a protester on an April 20 mini-raid protest in Toronto .
Shank asks the protester why she is not wearing a mask .
The protester says she is not wearing a mask on account of the warm weather and because she is not afraid of CoS and does not think that the CoS could find her anyway .
Shank says that CoS would not even bother trying to find her , but that they could if they wanted to .
Is it just me , or does Shank seem pretty confident in her cult ’s ability to track down detractors ?
I do n’t blame her given the cult ’s years of experience in this sort of thing .
Question :
Why would the President and supposed Reverend of a supposedly ethical “ Church ” go out of her way to tell someone protesting against the “ Church ’s ” unethicality that the “ Church ” could indeed track the protester down if they wanted to ?
By the way , did I mention that this organization claims to be a Church ?

Will humans need to live as space nomads to survive ?
Possibly , says Neil deGrasse Tyson of the American Museum of Natural History .
" It may be , " says Tyson , " that our only insurance policy against extinction is to become a multi- planet , space faring species . "
Worries of climate change and unexpected catastrophe on Earth , compounded with humankind 's natural curiosity about what lies beyond , compel private industry and NASA alike not only to wonder " what if , " but to prepare for the " when . "
The video below was broadcast on ABC News ' Good Morning America on February 8 , 2008 .

WASHINGTON  Big Wall Street investment companies are pulling back on their borrowing from the Federal Reserve 's emergency lending program , a sign that credit conditions may be improving a bit .
A Federal Reserve report Thursday said those firms averaged $ 22.6 billion in daily borrowing over the past week .
That compares with $ 24.8 billion in the previous week .
It marked the third straight week where investment firms borrowed less from the central bank .
The program , which began March 17 , is one of several extraordinary actions the Fed has taken recently to limit the damage from the housing and financial crises .
After the sudden crash of Bear Stearns , the nation 's fifth - largest investment bank , fears grew that others might be in jeopardy , given major stresses in credit and financial markets .
Scrambling to avert a market meltdown , Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues — in the broadest use of the central bank 's lending authority since the 1930s — agreed last month to temporarily let investment firms obtain emergency financing from the Fed , a privilege previously granted only to commercial banks .
The program , similar to the one the Fed has long had for commercial banks , will continue for at least six months .
It gives investment firms a place to go for overnight loans .
Commercial banks and investment companies pay 2.5 % in interest for the loans .
Banks , meanwhile , averaged $ 10.7 billion in daily borrowing for the week ending April 23 .
That compares with $ 7.8 billion for the previous week .
The identities of commercial banks and investment houses are not released .
As part of the effort to relieve credit strains , the Fed auctioned $ 59.46 billion in super - safe Treasury securities to investment firms on Thursday .
The auction — the fifth of its kind — fetched bids totaling less than the $ 75 billion worth of securities the Fed was making available .
That could suggest that demand for Treasuries may be moderating a bit .
And that might be viewed as a sign of some improvement in credit conditions , analysts said .
" Although the $ 59.5 billion sold is still a sizable amount , it does suggest that liquidity strains could be easing , " said Lynn Reaser , chief economist at Bank of America 's Investment Strategies Group .
In exchange for the 28 - day loan of Treasury securities , bidding firms can put up more risky investments as collateral , including certain shunned mortgage - backed securities .
In the five auctions held so far , the Fed has provided nearly $ 218.41 billion worth of the Treasury securities to investment firms .
The program began March 27 .
In Thursday 's auction , investment firms paid an interest rate of 0.2500 % for a slice of securities .
The auction program is intended to help financial institutions and the troubled mortgage market .
The goal is to make investment houses more inclined to lend to each other .
It also is aimed at providing relief to the distressed market for mortgage - linked securities .
Questions about their value and dumping of these securities had driven up mortgage rates , aggravating the housing slump .

According to many who live there , the village of Denshaw is a little piece of paradise tucked away in the Pennines .
But Wikipedia readers have been receiving a rather different message .
According to the world 's most - used online encyclopaedia , its population was devastated by a tapeworm outbreak ten years ago .
Those who remain relax by throwing sheep or shooting cows .
It gets no more than four hours of sunlight a day because of the surrounding hills .
And the total population is four , none of whom is a " fit girl " .
Scroll down for more ...
The sleepy town of Denshaw has received a number of spoof entries on its Wikipedia page
The outbreak of misinformation , caused by at least one prankster , has been greeted with hilarity by most locals .
But it is another reminder of why the website - which can be edited by anyone with an internet connection - should be taken with a pinch of cyber salt .
Until earlier this year , Denshaw 's Wikipedia entry mainly comprised a discussion of the bus services connecting it to nearby Oldham and Ashton - under - Lyne .
By yesterday , owever , the hijackers had given free rein to their imagination .
They claimed the village , real population about 500 , " attracts people from many different locations mainly due to the competitive sports held in the village including rock rolling , cow shooting and sheep hurling " .
The Denshaw entry went on : " Due to the complex hill formations surrounding the village , sunlight is only visible for four hours a day , some say a contributing factor in the local population 's health problems such as obesity and severe malnurishment ( sic ) . "

Rick Raney , landlord at the Golden Fleece in Denshaw , with his partner Jackie
Displaying a colourful turn of phrase , it said that until recently , the village " consisted mainly of small holding farms and a few timid brothels such as the Golden Fleece pub " .
Another fabrication which might help identify the culprit claimed that Holly Wright had been named village idiot for five years running .
A further snippet was the claim that the village football pitch slopes at an angle of 35 degrees .
And detailing the extraordinary disease outbreak of a decade ago it revealed : " There has not been much tourism in Denshaw since the Ascariasis epedemic ( sic ) in 1998 which left most of the village seriously ill . "
Ascariasis is a parasitic tapeworm infection more common in tropical climes .
" The effects are still being felt today , especially by the residents of Dumfries Drive where the epidemic was felt worst . "
Julie Thomas , a 37 - year - old nurse who lives in Dumfries Drive , said : " I lived here in 1998 and there was no outbreak - unless I 've still got it and do n't know about it ! "

Malcolm McLintock , 68 , added : " I 've lived here since 1948 .
It 's a lovely place .

Rick Rainey , landlord of the 400 - year - old Golden Fleece , said : " It was once frequented by highwaymen so I 'm sure it has hosted ladies of the night in its past .
But I can reassure customers that 's not the case now . "
By last night , all the spoof elements had been removed - although parish councillor Ken Hulme revealed that one of them was inspired by reality .
" The football pitch really is on a hillside , " he said .
" I do n't know whether it slopes as much as 35 degrees , and games are played across the hill , rather than up and down it .
" But put it this way , you do n't get many passes if you 're playing on the uphill wing ! "
( Fortune Magazine ) --
For years , Wal - Mart tried to enter the U.S. banking business , but it gave up in 2007 , pulling its application after endless outcries from domestic retail banks .
Now it 's found a more receptive audience south of the border .
In November , Wal - Mart de M�xico opened its first consumer bank , Banco Wal - Mart , in Toluca ; the company plans to launch 80 more by the end of the year .
Toluca , a sprawling industrial town near Mexico City , seems like an unlikely place for Wal - Mart 's maiden push into banking .
But there , in a strip mall , beside a bakery and a beauty parlor , Norma Pacheco is mulling a Wal - Mart account .
" I 'd use it to pay for my Wal - Mart purchases , " says Pacheco , a 42 - year - old engineer .
" The brand gives me confidence . "
Pacheco is n't the client Wal - Mart de M�xico is ultimately after .
Mexico 's biggest retailer , with 668 stores , wants to crack the low - income market in a country where just 24 percent of households have savings accounts , compared with 55 percent in Chile .
Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) plans to boost sales via debit cards , later ease users into more profitable services like insurance , and make money on interest - rate spreads .
Early signs are promising .
H�ctor Aguila , the bank 's manager , says that about 40 percent of the new clients who have signed up at dedicated desks in the store since the bank 's November launch have never had an account of any kind .
Wal - Mart 's mission is to lure newcomers with easy instructions and entry points , like minimum balances of less than $ 5 and no commissions , compared with $ 100 minimums at competing banks .
( But interest rates are only 1 percent , half what most banks pay , and Wal - Mart 's annual rate for consumer loans is 75 percent . )
The retailer , which opened three branches in Toluca , plans to have as many as 80 by the end of the year , before an even bigger push in 2009 .
Wal - Mart is also eyeing the $ 23 billion remittances market - the amount sent home every year by Mexican immigrants in the U.S.
Because it forged a cut-rate deal with MoneyGram ( MGI ) , Wal - Mart is outpacing the overall growth in the money - transfer market , says Robert Dodd , an analyst at Morgan Keegan , but its share remains tiny .
The retailer says it has no plans to revisit the U.S. bank market soon , though Jan Smith , managing director of InfoAmericas in M iami , says Mexico is " a good dress rehearsal . "
Wal - Mart is n't the first bank to court Mexico 's low - income earners .
In 2002 appliances retailer Grupo Elektra started Banco Azteca .
Today it has nearly 1,500 branches and more than seven million savings accounts .
A spinoff from microfinance firm Compartamos followed in April with similar services and an IPO that was 13 times oversubscribed .
But Wal - Mart 's broad appeal , high traffic , and low fees give it an edge , analysts say .
The retailer 's entry into Mexican banking follows reforms by the Calder�n administration , which wanted to make it easier for low - income earners to open accounts .
Now other big banks may try to get in on the action .
Says HSBC ( HBC ) corporate accounts manager Julius Cardoza : " We 're curious about Wal - Mart 's strategy . "
Our addiction to oil has been bad for us for a long time .
We ’ve paid a high price for it in terms of high greenhouse gas emissions and cities choked by cars .
But now we ca n’t afford our regular fix any more .
So here ’s what we need to do to conquer our addiction .
It wo n’t be easy , but it will be worthwhile — and besides , we do n’t really have a choice .
With the price of petrol hitting NZ $ 2 per litre , the Sustainable Energy Forum has proposed twelve steps for New Zealand to end its increasingly self - destructive addiction to oil .
This is a guest post from Tim Jones of the Sustainable Energy Forum in New Zealand .
The Twelve Steps :
1. Stop deluding ourselves .
The era of cheap , readily - available oil has ended .
Prices may fluctuate , but the underlying trend is up , up , up .
We have to get used to using less .
2. Demand that politicians take the issue seriously .
Make it an election issue .
Do n’t take ‘ we ’ve got everything under control ’ as an answer .
3 . Stop building new roads .
They ’re a monumental waste of money , time and effort .
They encourage , rather than ease , congestion , and besides , the growth in car travel that ’s used to justify them is n’t going to happen anyway .
4 . Divert that money and effort into measures that address the challenges of oil depletion and climate change .
5 . Make a major investment in public transport .
It needs to be better , faster , more comfortable , more regular , and more predictable .
It needs to cater for everyone , not just peak - hour commuters — though they need a better service as well .
6 . Make a major investment in broadband internet to allow more people to work from home , and change tax and business practices that discourage working from home .
The more car trips we can avoid , the better .
7. Electrify transport where possible .
New Zealand is well placed to use renewable electricity for transport .
We should be electrifying commuter rail where it is not already electric , using light rail ( trams ) in cities , and looking at electrification of the main trunk line .
On the other end of the scale , electric bikes and scooters can make a big difference in our cities .
And electric cars show promise , though there ’s a lot of questions to be answered yet .
8 . Do n’t use cars unless there ’s no alternative .
Take the bus .
Take the train .
Switch to a scooter .
Walk or cycle – both your wallet and your doctor will thank you .
9 . Deal with other aspects of our oil dependence .
Agriculture , for example , is highly dependent on oil .
We ’re going to need to change the way we grow and distribute food .
Let ’s get to work on that now , not wait until supermarket shelves start to empty .
10 . Stockpile or manufacture vital products currently imported from overseas .
When oil runs short , will that still be possible ?
Let ’s take stock now and work out what we may need to start stockpiling or making in New Zealand .
11 . Think local .
Ending our oil addiction is n’t just up to central government , though it can play its part .
Communities can work together to make themselves more resilient .
Join or start a Transition Towns group in your local area .
12 . Accept reality .
The age of cheap oil is over .
It ’s not coming back .
As individuals and as a nation , we have to adapt .
For many , religious activity changes between childhood and adulthood , and a new study finds this could affect one 's mental health .
According to Temple University 's Joanna Maselko , Sc.D. , women who had stopped being religiously active were more than three times more likely to have suffered generalized anxiety and alcohol abuse / dependence than women who reported always having been active .
" One 's lifetime pattern of religious service attendance can be related to psychiatric illness , " said Maselko , an assistant professor of public health and co-author of the study , which appears in the January issue of Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology .
Conversely , men who stopped being religiously active were less likely to suffer major depression when compared to men who had always been religiously active .
Maselko offers one possible explanation for the gender differences in the relationship between religious activity and mental health .
" Women are simply more integrated into the social networks of their religious communities .
When they stop attending religious services , they lose access to that network and all its potential benefits .
Men may not be as integrated into the religious community in the first place and so may not suffer the negative consequences of leaving , " Maselko said .
The study expands on previous research in the field by analyzing the relationship between mental health -- anxiety , depression and alcohol dependence or abuse -- and spirituality using current and past levels , said Maselko , who conducted the research when she was at Harvard University .
In the study sample , comprising 718 adults , a majority of men and women changed their level of religious activity between childhood and adulthood , which was critical information for the researchers .
" A person 's current level of spirituality is only part of the story .
We can only get a better understanding of the relationship between health and spirituality by knowing a person 's lifetime religious history , " Maselko said .
Out of the 278 women in the group , 39 percent ( N=109 ) had always been religiously active and 51 percent ( N=141 ) had not been active since childhood .
About 7 percent of the women who have always been religiously active met the criteria for generalized anxiety disorder compared to 21 percent of women who had stopped being religiously active .
" Everyone has some spirituality , whether it is an active part of their life or not ; whether they are agnostic or atheist or just ' non-practicing . '
These choices potentially have health implications , similar to the way that one 's social networks do , " Maselko said .

After creating a well - structured and usable grid , consider allowing it to breath .
A page without a grid is a usability nightmare .
On the other hand , a grid that has creatively overlapping , escaping , or energizing columns leads to a more enjoyable user experience .
Discovering or planning areas of the design that will have some freedom will lead to more interesting and appealing design solutions .

What is Grid-Based Design ?
Grids are structure imposed on chaos .
They are a harmonious and reliable system for presenting information .
Grids offer an effective design approach for site layouts and assist in communicating site ’s main messages clearly to the end user .
They created ordered hierarchies , proportional relationships , and clear visual paths for the eye to travel .
Its important to know your tools before trying to get creative with them .
This means you should study the grid and understand how to successfully use it to create your site layouts .
Learn to achieve balance , symmetry , and place emphasis on important content all through the use of the grid .
Grids are useful for communicating information clearly and effectively .
Khoi Vinh ’s redesign of a complex news - site proves it .
Six Creative Column Techniques
Like skyscrapers in city centers , overwhelmingly , columns dominate Web design grids .
Once you ’ve mastered the grid as a tool then it ’s time to get creative with it .
Work on establishing a visual rhythm in your design .
Then you can step in and break the visual flow for effect .
The techniques discussed in the next section present effective ways of getting creative with your columns in grid - based Web design .
1. Embracing Disharmony
Disharmony is , of course , the opposite of harmony .
A grid is a harmonious instrument .
Its goal is to achieve balance , symmetry , and order .
So why would you want to bring imbalance to this order ?
Why break up this carefully constructed data structure ?
The answer is to add interest .
Chaos is more interesting than order .
A good murder mystery is infinitely more enjoyable than a story about taking a walk in the park .
Jackson Pollock ’s splattered paint canvas is more stimulating than a wall without it .
A partly broken grid is more interesting than a perfectly ordered grid .
Besides who does n’t want to break the rules ?
Embrace some randomness , chaos , or discord and create a space for them to thrive within your designs .
2. Joining for Variety
Layouts that have strong horizontal areas are being seen more often , especially on home pages .
Horizontal
Web design areas feel more creative because vertical designs are so common on the Web .
Try using more rows in your designs .
Or join areas of a column together to create a display space in your design .
Rows can be used to break up the visual flow of a page .
Each row you create gives a new opportunity for establishing new column areas with different sizes , numbers , and variety .
Its possible to create pages on your site , or areas of your pages , that are heavily horizontal .
Or join columns to form rows that add interesting areas to your layouts .
Consider varying the number of columns in the rows you create .
The gray horizontal row below is heavily emphasized .
The use of repeating horizontal backgrounds helps to make predominately vertical layouts feel wide .
Adding these spaces to your layouts will allow them to stand out .
Horizontal areas in sites will slow the user ’s progression through the page and create emphasis .
3. Utilizing Angles
It ’s possible to set an entire grid on an angle .
In the article Rule Four : Spacing Is Your Friend an angled grid design is reviewed .
The example used in this article is for print design though .
The use of an angled grid is unusual on the Web .
That ’s because the layout of text on the Web is horizontal , not slanted .
You would likely use images to accomplish an angled piece of text .
Flash would be another option .
In both cases you ’re loosing the semantic goodness and ease of use of Cascading Style Sheets .
The use of angles to occasionally break your grid will add visual interest .
If you restrict the use of angles to images you wo n’t lose any semantic or SEO benefits of the default horizontal text used in the Web .
4. Escaping Boundaries
One of the techniques in line with embracing some disorder is to break out of the boundaries you ’ve established in your grid .
Once you ’ve established your order find ways for elements to move outside of it .
Cross over the lines you ’ve set up and break out of the visual flow of the page .
In the article Thinking Outside the Grid Molly E. Holzschlag discusses concepts of creating compelling visual design that breaks the mold of the grid .
Some of her examples show boundaries being escaped .
This is an inspiring conceptual article that also discusses the complexities involved in coding designs that are less rigid .
Pull - quotes are an example of a design element that presents an opportunity to break out of your established visual flow .
The older version of Andy Rutledge ’s Design View used interesting pull - quotes that broke the visual flow of the column .
Doing this places greater emphasis on the pull - quotes than if they were kept within the content of the column .
Compare the old version to the newer site design below .
The new design places pull - quotes within the boundaries of the content column .
This is a less creative and more conservative solution .
Though in either case the pull - quote creates a noticeable change in the visual flow of the column .
An abrupt change in the flow of the page will cause users to pause and notice the change in rhythm .
This is true whether the pull - quote is kept within the column or moved outside the boundaries of its borders .
Consider this the next time you use pull - quotes or if you ’re embedding an image within your column .
As an image presents the same design opportunity .
5. Illustrating Areas
Illustrations and the use of design elements allow for overlapping and breaking out of the structure you ’ve created in your grid .
They can be used to add some areas of creative disorder to counterbalance the rigidity of the grid .
In the example below the illustration at the top of the page breaks the grid by overlapping the gridlines and flowing into different content areas .
The movement of the design elements within the illustration creates a different visual rhythm that acts in opposition to the order of the grid .
There is balance in the design of these opposing forces .
The illustrations in this design add stimulating areas of interest to an otherwise boxy layout .
6. Energizing Spaces
There are some basic design principles to consider when looking to energize space within your grid .
Concepts such as asymmetrical balance , proximity , and repetition are discussed in the article The Principles of Beautiful Web Design by Jason Beaird .
These principles are at work in the portfolio design of Issara Willenskomer , shown below .
Jason Beaird has this to say about asymmetrical balance , “ Rather than having mirror images on either side of the layout , asymmetrical balance involves objects of differing size , shape , tone , or placement .
These objects are arranged so that , despite their differences , they equalize the weight of the page . ”
In the image shown below no two paragraphs or images are the same size .
Columns are broken and overlap horizontally .
Mathematical precision is abandoned and a grid based on an artist ’s intuition and eye for design is used to fill this creative space .
The balance achieved here is not based on rigid structure alone , but rather is achieved through the equalizing weight of asymmetrical balance .
Each portfolio piece repeats a structure of similar size and weight of presentation on the page .
The elements within each space through their proximity function as single design units .
Though each portfolio piece is presented with a unique rhythm within the confines of this space , thereby adding interest to the design .
There is great variety in each one of these portfolio spaces .
This allows for a creative presentation that the designer will enjoy making and a viewer will find stimulating .
Case Studies
Three sites that creatively use columns and break out of the rigid confined of well structured grids .
Study # 1 : Satsu Design
The design of Satsu.co.uk uses sketch style illustrations to overlap the grid lines established for the site .
These illustrations effectively communicate the concept of rough draft brainstorming creativity .
Conceptually the illustrations do n’t belong inside the confines of an ordered grid .
They serve to bring interest , asymmetrical balance , and conceptual creativity to the design .
The use of illustrations , the spacing between elements , and the variety in weight of elements within each grid make this a visual stimulating design .
Study # 2 : Lake Crackenback
Lake Crackenback utilizes illustrative design elements to great effect .
The interior page , second image below , has a strong three column grid .
Though the presentation through the design gives the illusion that it is one column with side elements that overlap that column .
The side columns successfully overlap and break the rigid layout of the grid .
Order is maintained while visual interest is added .
Also , notice the difference in presentation between the home page and the interior page .
Varying your grid on different pages can be a useful technique for adding interest as well .
Study # 3 : Edgepoint Church
Edgepoint Church has a strong grid and a two column layout .
The home page stands out as unique .
It has multiple rows that turn the two columns into three , or unite a column to form one space .
The home page especially has a grid filled with variety .
The grid is escaped with the use of angles and placement of the illustrations and photography that surround the layout .
The header has a free flow design that opens up the top as a creative space .
Conclusion
There are multiple techniques to add interest to your grid .
Certainly you should first understand how to use the grid effectively .
Then work on escaping some of this rigid structure and create some free flowing spaces within your design .
Or break the established flow and focus attention on a particular element .
Utilize concepts such as disharmony , asymmetrical balance , and ordered chaos to bring areas of your site ’s grid designs to life .
